2019-02-06,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The Brazilian state of Minas Gerais canceled Vale SA’s license to operate a dam at one of its largest mines, the company said on Wednesday, following the collapse of another dam in the state that killed an estimated 300 people. Vale has come under intense public pressure since the Jan. 25 dam burst, with some politicians and prosecutors calling for criminal prosecution and a management shakeup, especially since it happened less than four years after another fatal dam burst in Minas Gerais. Vale shares on Sao Paulo’s Bovespa exchange fell 4.9 percent to a seven-day low of 42.46 on Wednesday, while its U.S. traded ADRS slumped 6.2 percent. The state canceled Vale’s license for Laranjeiras dam. It had been used in the operation of the Brucutu mine, which had already been suspended by a court order, freezing nearly 9 percent of the company’s output. Vale, which was already trying to appeal the court order, said it would also appeal the license cancellation. Minas Gerais also canceled Vale’s license to operate its Jangada mine, which has been paralyzed since the dam close to the Córrego do Feijão mine burst in the state, killing at least 150 people. Another 182 people are still missing from what is possibly Brazil’s most deadly mining disaster. The cut in output from Brucutu forced Vale to declare force majeure in iron ore and pellets contracts on Tuesday. In the latest report to raise questions about whether warning signals were missed ahead of the mud avalanche which felled buildings and trees in the town of Brumadinho, Globo TV reported that Vale had been made aware of problems with sensors designed to monitor the structure. The report cited a deposition by an engineer for German inspection firm TÜV SÜD, whose job it was to monitor the dam’s safety. Both Vale and TÜV SÜD declined to comment on the report. Separately, the German firm said in a statement that it had hired two external law firms to conduct an independent probe into its role in the dam collapse. Two of its employees were arrested following the accident but were released on Tuesday. Vale, which co-owned another dam whose 2015 collapse killed 19 people and polluted a major river, said on Tuesday it would invest some 1.5 billion reais ($400 million) starting in 2020 to reduce its reliance on giant dams to store the muddy detritus from mining, known as tailings.   It aims to boost the portion of the waste material that is dried rather than stored wet to 70 percent by 2023.  The company also said it would spend about $70 million on safety and maintenance at existing tailings dams in 2019, representing a 180-percent jump from 2015.  In December, Vale agreed to pay $500 million for New Steel, a company that owns patents in 56 countries for a dry processing method known as Fines Dry Magnetic Separation. In 2009, one Vale executive identified concerns about the tailings dams and discussed the possibility of making building material from tailings, including bricks, in a bid to trim the vast amounts of wet tailings, Reuters reported last week. It was not clear whether the company followed any of his recommendations at the time.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday proposed exempting some light bulbs from federal efficiency standards that take effect next year, a move environmentalists said would boost pollution and power bills for consumers. The department said in a notice that revisions in two rules published by the Obama administration in January 2017, days before President Donald Trump was inaugurated, misconstrued existing law and that it was proposing to scrap the changes. The proposal was part of a push by the administration to ease regulations. An executive order Trump signed the month he became president called for agencies to ditch two old regulations for each one they propose. The administration has also rolled back Obama-era regulations on pollution and emissions as it seeks to boost oil, gas and coal output.  The proposal would remove three-way bulbs, candle-shaped bulbs used in chandeliers, reflector bulbs used in recessed lighting, and others from having to comply with the new efficiency standards.  Advanced technologies, including light-emitting diode or LED light bulbs, use far less electricity than incandescent light bulbs, which produce far more wasted heat.   The changes would result in $12 billion in extra power bill costs for consumers, said the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “This is another senseless and illegal Trump administration rollback that will needlessly hike our energy bills and spew tons more pollution into the air, harming the health of our children and the environment,” said Noah Horowitz, director of NRDC’s center for energy efficiency standards. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on criticism of its proposal. The department will hold a public meeting on the proposal in Washington on Feb. 28.      The Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit alliance of  business, government, environmental and consumer interests, said the proposal would give a lifeline to makers of inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs. The Obama-era rules stemmed from bipartisan energy legislation passed in 2007 and signed by Trump’s fellow Republican, George W. Bush, that called for phasing in lighting efficiency standards, the alliance said.

2019-02-06,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar captured the closed El Sharara oilfield on Wednesday, officials said in a challenge to the Tripoli government. El Sharara was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. But some tribesmen demanding development funds remained at the 315,000 barrel-per-day oilfield, one of their protest leaders told Reuters.  Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) group, which is based in the east, called oil firm NOC to lift force majeure, a contractual waiver, it had declared when it shut down production. NOC declined to comment.  The LNA said it had met no resistance. “Our forces arrived safely at the field,” a spokesman for the forces, Ahmed Mismari, told a news conference in Benghazi, where the LNA is headquartered. A tribal protest leader told Reuters: “With the army (LNA) we can find an understanding as they are military people.” He did not elaborate and it was impossible to get more details.  Libya’s oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centres in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure. Haftar is a dominant figure in the east where his LNA seized the second-largest city of Benghazi in 2017 by expelling Islamist and other fighters. Last month, his forces started an offensive in the south to fight militants and secure its oilfields, and on Wednesday made good on the promise by moving on the El Sharara field. A video posted online showed jubilant soldiers at the oilfield which is located deep in Libya’s south and had previously belonged to the Tripoli-based internationally recognised government. A resident confirmed LNA solders were inside the oilfield, a vast complex stretching for kilometres. A Tripoli official, asking not to be named, acknowledged that the LNA was holding El Sharara. He declined further comment and there was no statement from the Tripoli government. Tripoli had earlier on Wednesday appointed a military commander for the main southern city of Sabha and there were unconfirmed reports that Tripoli would dispatch a force to secure El Sharara. Haftar’s forces are allied to a parallel administration based in eastern Libya. His LNA faction last month started a military offensive in eastern Libya to fight militants and secure the region’s oilfields. An executive at NOC unit AGOCO, citing OMV, said on Twitter the El Sharara oilfield could reopen in March. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor. A NOC board member, Jadalla al-Awkaly, praised the LNA advance, writing on his personal Facebook page: “A national army with a pure desire to liberate the homeland.” NOC is based in the capital Tripoli, in the country’s west.

2019-02-06,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition on Wednesday said it would use a U.S.-based fund to receive some of the country’s oil income in a key step to bankroll its efforts to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.  The fund would receive income accrued by state-run oil firm PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] since last month, when U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters. Guadio, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, last month declared himself to be the South American country’s interim ruler. White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the United States would consider lifting sanctions on senior Venezuelan military officers if they recognise Guaido as interim leader. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely,” Bolton wrote on Twitter. Aside from one senior general, who recognised Guaido in a video and urged others in the military to do the same, most of Venezuela’s top military officers have not defected from Maduro. Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela’s top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug of war as the United States has made aggressive moves to remove it from Maduro’s control and imposed sanctions on OPEC-member Venezuela’s oil industry. “This is already quite advanced, I hope that next week it can be announced by our representative in the United States,” Paparoni said, though he did not give details about the nature of the U.S.-based fund or the financial institution involved. Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation. Maduro was re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham. Yon Goicoechea, a member of Guaido’s policy team, told Reuters that Guaido was in contact with PDVSA’s international partners and they were willing to keep operating in Venezuela. He did not identify the partners. Guaido’s team is planning for a post-Maduro government with an emergency arrangement to supply fuel domestically, given widespread shortages across Venezuela, Goicoechea said. Most Latin American and European countries also recognise Guaido, although Italy so far has not. Guaido has reached out to Italy’s ruling coalition seeking its support. Maduro, who retains control over the state, denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him. He is supported by China and Russia, while Slovakia on Wednesday joined Italy in defying the coordinated action of European Union nations and the United States. The opposition has also sought to prevent the government from selling gold, believing that it is using the proceeds to try to stay solvent as the sanctions cut off other revenue streams.  But Maduro’s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led National Assembly, Paparoni told a news conference. Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital bought the largest amount, 27.3 tonnes of gold, and a Turkish firm bought 23.9 tonnes, Paparoni said. “We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold,” Paparoni said. Venezuela had gold reserves of 132 tonnes between the central bank’s vaults and the Bank of England at the end of November, according to central bank data. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Noor Capital said it “does not engage in any illegal or prohibited transactions.” In recent days, at least five tankers carrying gasoline, gasoil for power generation and naphtha have been ordered to unload at Venezuela’s ports as fuel inventories dwindle. PDVSA issued court orders for most of the tankers to discharge, according to shipping and PDVSA sources.       Guaido asked Italy’s ruling coalition leaders in a letter to meet with his representatives as he seeks their explicit backing. Italy’s hard-right League has expressed strong support for Guaido, but coalition partner the 5-Star Movement has not, making Italy the only major European Union nation not to recognise him as Venezuela’s interim head of state. League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s office on Wednesday said he would meet Guaido’s envoys on Feb. 11. As the world’s countries line up to support either Maduro or Guaido, the United Nations warned against using aid as a pawn. The United States has sent food and medicine to Venezuela’s border, even though it is unclear how it will get past the objections of Maduro. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. The International Committee of the Red Cross has doubled its budget in Venezuela in recent weeks and is also helping Venezuelan migrants in neighbouring Colombia and Brazil, ICRC President Peter Maurer said in Geneva.

2019-02-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Australian dollar tumbled on Wednesday after the country’s central bank signaled a possible interest-rate cut in the latest indication that a global economic slowdown is tilting policymakers toward looser monetary policy, while a gauge of world equity markets edged off two-month highs. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 slipped amid concerns over growth, disappointing earnings reports and another possible U.S. government shutdown in the wake of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. European shares gained slightly. Australia’s central bank was the latest to signal policy easing in the face of economic headwinds. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would be patient on further rate hikes as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had “weakened,” and the European Central Bank sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy later this year. The about-face pushed the Australian dollar down 1.62 percent against the U.S. dollar, putting it on track for its biggest daily drop since November 2016. In turn, the U.S. dollar moved higher against a basket of major currencies.  “We are starting to see central banks follow Powell’s lead,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis. “That’s what’s actually contributed to this dollar rally that we have seen recently.” The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.32 percent. The euro was down 0.42 percent to $1.1364. The index was on pace for a fifth day of gains.      On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to 25,390.3, the S&P 500 lost 6.09 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,731.61, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.80 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,375.28. Shares of videogame makers Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software tumbled more than 10 percent after both companies gave disappointing forecasts. Still, the S&P 500 has surged more than 16 percent since Dec. 24. “After the big run-up that we have had, we are basically in more of a pause, digestion period, where we are seeing some churning but not a big overall move for the market,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. European stocks were buoyed by gains in Italian banks and tech stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15 percent while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.28 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.6946 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Tuesday. Signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply boosted oil prices, but gains were capped by the rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. U.S. crude settled up 0.7 percent at $54.01 a barrel, while Brent settled at $62.69 a barrel, up 1.2 percent.

2019-02-06,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A key ally of Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the country’s election to be held in little over a week would go back in body bags.  Nasir El-Rufai, governor of the northern state of Kaduna, made the comments during a discussion programme on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community’s role in elections was raised. It followed an international outcry over the suspension of Nigeria’s top judge.  The Feb. 16 vote in Africa’s top oil producer pits Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015, against main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president in a race widely seen as tight that has become increasingly rancorous in the last few weeks.  The discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the programme in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules. “We are waiting for the person who will come and intervene. They will go back in body bags because nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country,” said El-Rufai.  “We have got that independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible,” he said. Last year Buhari and Atiku both signed an agreement stating a commitment to hold a peaceful election.  Following El-Rufai’s comments, the main opposition People’s Democratic Party said it would be “left with no option than to consider a review of its signatory in the national peace accord” if the ruling party did not stop “comments, threats and incendiary actions”.  The chief justice - who was suspended and replaced with an acting replacement last month - could preside over a dispute over the election result. Nigeria’s judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. Last week the Nigerian government said it would not accept any foreign “meddling” after statements by the EU, the United States and Britain expressed fears about the impact of the judge’s suspension if the election result was disputed. “While the security of EU observers is of paramount importance, and will remain under constant review, EU observers will continue their work across the country in the run-up to - and beyond - the 16 February elections,” said the EU election observation mission in a tweet in which it stated that it was aware of the governor’s comments.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the World Bank Group should be led by U.S. Treasury official David Malpass, a Trump loyalist and critic of multilateral institutions who has vowed to pursue “pro-growth” reforms at the development lender. Trump’s nomination of Malpass, the Treasury Department’s top diplomat, is subject to a vote by the World Bank’s executive board and could draw challengers from some of its 188 other shareholding countries. The United States is the largest shareholder with 16 percent of its voting power and has traditionally chosen the bank’s president, but Jim Yong Kim, who stepped down from the job on Feb. 1, faced challengers from Colombia and Nigeria in 2012. The nomination of Malpass signals that the Trump administration wants a firmer grip on the World Bank. He was an economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 election campaign. Malpass, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, a job in which he oversees the U.S. role in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, has criticized them for growing ever larger, more “intrusive” and “entrenched.” He also has pushed the bank to cut back lending to China, which he argues is too wealthy for such aid when it is saddling poorer countries with debt in its Belt and Road infrastructure drive. Last year, as part of a $13 billion World Bank capital increase, Malpass helped negotiate reforms aimed at refocusing resources towards the poorest countries and winding down lending to China. “He has fought to ensure financing is focused on the places and projects that truly need assistance, including people living in extreme poverty,” Trump said in announcing his choice at the White House with Malpass by his side. Malpass said at the White House he would work to implement these reforms and also focus on women’s economic empowerment. “I’m very optimistic that we can achieve breakthroughs to create growth abroad that will help us combat extreme poverty and create economic opportunities in the developing world,” Malpass said. Malpass will continue to participate in U.S.-China trade negotiations as he campaigns for the World Bank presidency. He will join a delegation heading to Beijing for more talks next week, a senior Trump administration official said. But as Trump’s “America First” trade agenda and tariff war with China puts strains on many developing economies, some development experts say that Malpass’ candidacy will be a difficult sell. “David Malpass will have a lot of work to do to convince other shareholders that he is prepared to move beyond his past statements and track record when it comes to the World Bank’s agenda,” said Scott Morris, a former U.S. Treasury development finance official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. Morris said that includes the global lender’s role in climate finance and “the need for constructive engagement with China.” By naming Malpass a day before the World Bank board begins a month-long nomination process, Trump could deter the emergence of other candidates.  Malpass would honor the bank’s standards and obligations, including its initiatives to combat climate change, the senior Trump administration official said.   If approved, Malpass would replace Kim, a physician and former university president who resigned more than three years before his term ended to join private equity fund Global Infrastructure Partners. Kim had differed with the Trump administration over climate change, effectively ending the bank’s financing of coal-fired power projects. [nL1N1ZF1ZN] Malpass served in Treasury and State Department roles during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

2019-02-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, boosted by signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply, but gains were capped by a rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Brent crude futures gained 71 cents, or 1.15 percent, to settle at $62.69. The benchmark earlier fell to a session low of $61.05. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 35 cents, or 0.65 percent, to settle at $54.01 a barrel, up from a session low of $52.86. U.S. government data on Wednesday showed that domestic crude inventories rose less than expected last week even as refineries hiked output. Stocks increased 1.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 1, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks increased by 513,000 barrels, less than anticipated, while distillate stockpiles fell a greater-than-expected 2.3 million barrels. “Distillate demand increased sharply last week due to the extreme cold weather, which contributed to the declining distillate stocks,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. “All in all this report is bullish for crude oil and refined product prices.” Market participants have focused on signs of tightening global crude supply after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies began an agreement in January to cut output. The producers known as OPEC+ started cutting production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from last month to avert a new supply glut, and OPEC has delivered almost three-quarters of its pledged cuts already, a Reuters survey showed last week.  U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company could also lift prices, though they have yet to trigger any sharp increase. The sanctions aim to block U.S. refiners from paying into PDVSA accounts controlled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.  Venezuela’s opposition is opening a U.S. fund to receive the proceeds of oil sales, a key measure to secure revenue for its effort to dislodge Maduro, an opposition lawmaker said on Wednesday. A stronger U.S. dollar limited gains on Wednesday. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. “Despite several forays in WTI above our prior resistance of $55, the market continues to draft back down largely under the pressure of this week’s stronger dollar,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Also dampening market sentiment were worries about weaker global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Oil prices fell on Tuesday after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. U.S. President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that a trade deal was possible with China. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks next week.

Separately, the German firm said in a statement that it had hired two external law firms to conduct an independent probe into its role in the dam collapse. Two of its employees were arrested following the accident but were released on Tuesday. Vale, which co-owned another dam whose 2015 collapse killed 19 people and polluted a major river, said on Tuesday it would invest some 1.5 billion reais ($400 million) starting in 2020 to reduce its reliance on giant dams to store the muddy detritus from mining, known as tailings.   It aims to boost the portion of the waste material that is dried rather than stored wet to 70 percent by 2023.  The company also said it would spend about $70 million on safety and maintenance at existing tailings dams in 2019, representing a 180-percent jump from 2015.  In December, Vale agreed to pay $500 million for New Steel, a company that owns patents in 56 countries for a dry processing method known as Fines Dry Magnetic Separation. In 2009, one Vale executive identified concerns about the tailings dams and discussed the possibility of making building material from tailings, including bricks, in a bid to trim the vast amounts of wet tailings, Reuters reported last week. It was not clear whether the company followed any of his recommendations at the time.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday proposed exempting some light bulbs from federal efficiency standards that take effect next year, a move environmentalists said would boost pollution and power bills for consumers. The department said in a notice that revisions in two rules published by the Obama administration in January 2017, days before President Donald Trump was inaugurated, misconstrued existing law and that it was proposing to scrap the changes. The proposal was part of a push by the administration to ease regulations. An executive order Trump signed the month he became president called for agencies to ditch two old regulations for each one they propose. The administration has also rolled back Obama-era regulations on pollution and emissions as it seeks to boost oil, gas and coal output.  The proposal would remove three-way bulbs, candle-shaped bulbs used in chandeliers, reflector bulbs used in recessed lighting, and others from having to comply with the new efficiency standards.  Advanced technologies, including light-emitting diode or LED light bulbs, use far less electricity than incandescent light bulbs, which produce far more wasted heat.   The changes would result in $12 billion in extra power bill costs for consumers, said the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. “This is another senseless and illegal Trump administration rollback that will needlessly hike our energy bills and spew tons more pollution into the air, harming the health of our children and the environment,” said Noah Horowitz, director of NRDC’s center for energy efficiency standards. The Department of Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on criticism of its proposal. The department will hold a public meeting on the proposal in Washington on Feb. 28.      The Alliance to Save Energy, a nonprofit alliance of  business, government, environmental and consumer interests, said the proposal would give a lifeline to makers of inefficient incandescent and halogen bulbs. The Obama-era rules stemmed from bipartisan energy legislation passed in 2007 and signed by Trump’s fellow Republican, George W. Bush, that called for phasing in lighting efficiency standards, the alliance said.

2019-02-06,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan forces loyal to Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar captured the closed El Sharara oilfield on Wednesday, officials said in a challenge to the Tripoli government. El Sharara was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. But some tribesmen demanding development funds remained at the 315,000 barrel-per-day oilfield, one of their protest leaders told Reuters.  Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) group, which is based in the east, called oil firm NOC to lift force majeure, a contractual waiver, it had declared when it shut down production. NOC declined to comment.  The LNA said it had met no resistance. “Our forces arrived safely at the field,” a spokesman for the forces, Ahmed Mismari, told a news conference in Benghazi, where the LNA is headquartered. A tribal protest leader told Reuters: “With the army (LNA) we can find an understanding as they are military people.” He did not elaborate and it was impossible to get more details.  Libya’s oil industry has faced disruption since unrest began, with rival power centres in the west and east. Protesters and armed groups have often targeted oilfields and energy infrastructure. Haftar is a dominant figure in the east where his LNA seized the second-largest city of Benghazi in 2017 by expelling Islamist and other fighters. Last month, his forces started an offensive in the south to fight militants and secure its oilfields, and on Wednesday made good on the promise by moving on the El Sharara field. A video posted online showed jubilant soldiers at the oilfield which is located deep in Libya’s south and had previously belonged to the Tripoli-based internationally recognised government. A resident confirmed LNA solders were inside the oilfield, a vast complex stretching for kilometres. A Tripoli official, asking not to be named, acknowledged that the LNA was holding El Sharara. He declined further comment and there was no statement from the Tripoli government. Tripoli had earlier on Wednesday appointed a military commander for the main southern city of Sabha and there were unconfirmed reports that Tripoli would dispatch a force to secure El Sharara. Haftar’s forces are allied to a parallel administration based in eastern Libya. His LNA faction last month started a military offensive in eastern Libya to fight militants and secure the region’s oilfields. An executive at NOC unit AGOCO, citing OMV, said on Twitter the El Sharara oilfield could reopen in March. NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor. A NOC board member, Jadalla al-Awkaly, praised the LNA advance, writing on his personal Facebook page: “A national army with a pure desire to liberate the homeland.” NOC is based in the capital Tripoli, in the country’s west.

2019-02-06,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s opposition on Wednesday said it would use a U.S.-based fund to receive some of the country’s oil income in a key step to bankroll its efforts to dislodge President Nicolas Maduro.  The fund would receive income accrued by state-run oil firm PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL] since last month, when U.S. President Donald Trump recognised Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state, opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters. Guadio, head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, last month declared himself to be the South American country’s interim ruler. White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the United States would consider lifting sanctions on senior Venezuelan military officers if they recognise Guaido as interim leader. “If not, the international financial circle will be closed off completely,” Bolton wrote on Twitter. Aside from one senior general, who recognised Guaido in a video and urged others in the military to do the same, most of Venezuela’s top military officers have not defected from Maduro. Citgo, the eighth-largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela’s top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug of war as the United States has made aggressive moves to remove it from Maduro’s control and imposed sanctions on OPEC-member Venezuela’s oil industry. “This is already quite advanced, I hope that next week it can be announced by our representative in the United States,” Paparoni said, though he did not give details about the nature of the U.S.-based fund or the financial institution involved. Pressure is building on Maduro, a socialist, to resign amid an economic crisis marked by widespread shortages and hyperinflation. Maduro was re-elected last year in a vote critics have called a sham. Yon Goicoechea, a member of Guaido’s policy team, told Reuters that Guaido was in contact with PDVSA’s international partners and they were willing to keep operating in Venezuela. He did not identify the partners. Guaido’s team is planning for a post-Maduro government with an emergency arrangement to supply fuel domestically, given widespread shortages across Venezuela, Goicoechea said. Most Latin American and European countries also recognise Guaido, although Italy so far has not. Guaido has reached out to Italy’s ruling coalition seeking its support. Maduro, who retains control over the state, denounces Guaido as a U.S. puppet who is seeking to foment a coup against him. He is supported by China and Russia, while Slovakia on Wednesday joined Italy in defying the coordinated action of European Union nations and the United States. The opposition has also sought to prevent the government from selling gold, believing that it is using the proceeds to try to stay solvent as the sanctions cut off other revenue streams.  But Maduro’s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led National Assembly, Paparoni told a news conference. Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital bought the largest amount, 27.3 tonnes of gold, and a Turkish firm bought 23.9 tonnes, Paparoni said. “We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold,” Paparoni said. Venezuela had gold reserves of 132 tonnes between the central bank’s vaults and the Bank of England at the end of November, according to central bank data. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Noor Capital said it “does not engage in any illegal or prohibited transactions.” In recent days, at least five tankers carrying gasoline, gasoil for power generation and naphtha have been ordered to unload at Venezuela’s ports as fuel inventories dwindle. PDVSA issued court orders for most of the tankers to discharge, according to shipping and PDVSA sources.       Guaido asked Italy’s ruling coalition leaders in a letter to meet with his representatives as he seeks their explicit backing. Italy’s hard-right League has expressed strong support for Guaido, but coalition partner the 5-Star Movement has not, making Italy the only major European Union nation not to recognise him as Venezuela’s interim head of state. League leader and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini’s office on Wednesday said he would meet Guaido’s envoys on Feb. 11. As the world’s countries line up to support either Maduro or Guaido, the United Nations warned against using aid as a pawn. The United States has sent food and medicine to Venezuela’s border, even though it is unclear how it will get past the objections of Maduro. “Humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. The International Committee of the Red Cross has doubled its budget in Venezuela in recent weeks and is also helping Venezuelan migrants in neighbouring Colombia and Brazil, ICRC President Peter Maurer said in Geneva.

2019-02-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Australian dollar tumbled on Wednesday after the country’s central bank signaled a possible interest-rate cut in the latest indication that a global economic slowdown is tilting policymakers toward looser monetary policy, while a gauge of world equity markets edged off two-month highs. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 slipped amid concerns over growth, disappointing earnings reports and another possible U.S. government shutdown in the wake of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. European shares gained slightly. Australia’s central bank was the latest to signal policy easing in the face of economic headwinds. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would be patient on further rate hikes as Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had “weakened,” and the European Central Bank sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy later this year. The about-face pushed the Australian dollar down 1.62 percent against the U.S. dollar, putting it on track for its biggest daily drop since November 2016. In turn, the U.S. dollar moved higher against a basket of major currencies.  “We are starting to see central banks follow Powell’s lead,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis. “That’s what’s actually contributed to this dollar rally that we have seen recently.” The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against six major currencies, rose 0.32 percent. The euro was down 0.42 percent to $1.1364. The index was on pace for a fifth day of gains.      On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to 25,390.3, the S&P 500 lost 6.09 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,731.61, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 26.80 points, or 0.36 percent, to 7,375.28. Shares of videogame makers Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software tumbled more than 10 percent after both companies gave disappointing forecasts. Still, the S&P 500 has surged more than 16 percent since Dec. 24. “After the big run-up that we have had, we are basically in more of a pause, digestion period, where we are seeing some churning but not a big overall move for the market,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist with SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. European stocks were buoyed by gains in Italian banks and tech stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15 percent while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.28 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.6946 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Tuesday. Signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply boosted oil prices, but gains were capped by the rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. U.S. crude settled up 0.7 percent at $54.01 a barrel, while Brent settled at $62.69 a barrel, up 1.2 percent.

2019-02-06,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A key ally of Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday said people from overseas who sought to intervene in the country’s election to be held in little over a week would go back in body bags.  Nasir El-Rufai, governor of the northern state of Kaduna, made the comments during a discussion programme on the Nigerian Television Authority when the topic of the international community’s role in elections was raised. It followed an international outcry over the suspension of Nigeria’s top judge.  The Feb. 16 vote in Africa’s top oil producer pits Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015, against main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president in a race widely seen as tight that has become increasingly rancorous in the last few weeks.  The discussion about the role of foreign countries in elections was raised on the programme in which reference was made to concerns expressed by the European Union, the United States and Britain over the suspension of Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen over allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules. “We are waiting for the person who will come and intervene. They will go back in body bags because nobody will come to Nigeria and tell us how to run our country,” said El-Rufai.  “We have got that independence and we are trying to run our country as decently as possible,” he said. Last year Buhari and Atiku both signed an agreement stating a commitment to hold a peaceful election.  Following El-Rufai’s comments, the main opposition People’s Democratic Party said it would be “left with no option than to consider a review of its signatory in the national peace accord” if the ruling party did not stop “comments, threats and incendiary actions”.  The chief justice - who was suspended and replaced with an acting replacement last month - could preside over a dispute over the election result. Nigeria’s judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes in past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. Last week the Nigerian government said it would not accept any foreign “meddling” after statements by the EU, the United States and Britain expressed fears about the impact of the judge’s suspension if the election result was disputed. “While the security of EU observers is of paramount importance, and will remain under constant review, EU observers will continue their work across the country in the run-up to - and beyond - the 16 February elections,” said the EU election observation mission in a tweet in which it stated that it was aware of the governor’s comments.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that the World Bank Group should be led by U.S. Treasury official David Malpass, a Trump loyalist and critic of multilateral institutions who has vowed to pursue “pro-growth” reforms at the development lender. Trump’s nomination of Malpass, the Treasury Department’s top diplomat, is subject to a vote by the World Bank’s executive board and could draw challengers from some of its 188 other shareholding countries. The United States is the largest shareholder with 16 percent of its voting power and has traditionally chosen the bank’s president, but Jim Yong Kim, who stepped down from the job on Feb. 1, faced challengers from Colombia and Nigeria in 2012. The nomination of Malpass signals that the Trump administration wants a firmer grip on the World Bank. He was an economic adviser to Trump’s 2016 election campaign. Malpass, Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, a job in which he oversees the U.S. role in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, has criticized them for growing ever larger, more “intrusive” and “entrenched.” He also has pushed the bank to cut back lending to China, which he argues is too wealthy for such aid when it is saddling poorer countries with debt in its Belt and Road infrastructure drive. Last year, as part of a $13 billion World Bank capital increase, Malpass helped negotiate reforms aimed at refocusing resources towards the poorest countries and winding down lending to China. “He has fought to ensure financing is focused on the places and projects that truly need assistance, including people living in extreme poverty,” Trump said in announcing his choice at the White House with Malpass by his side. Malpass said at the White House he would work to implement these reforms and also focus on women’s economic empowerment. “I’m very optimistic that we can achieve breakthroughs to create growth abroad that will help us combat extreme poverty and create economic opportunities in the developing world,” Malpass said. Malpass will continue to participate in U.S.-China trade negotiations as he campaigns for the World Bank presidency. He will join a delegation heading to Beijing for more talks next week, a senior Trump administration official said. But as Trump’s “America First” trade agenda and tariff war with China puts strains on many developing economies, some development experts say that Malpass’ candidacy will be a difficult sell. “David Malpass will have a lot of work to do to convince other shareholders that he is prepared to move beyond his past statements and track record when it comes to the World Bank’s agenda,” said Scott Morris, a former U.S. Treasury development finance official who is now a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington. Morris said that includes the global lender’s role in climate finance and “the need for constructive engagement with China.” By naming Malpass a day before the World Bank board begins a month-long nomination process, Trump could deter the emergence of other candidates.  Malpass would honor the bank’s standards and obligations, including its initiatives to combat climate change, the senior Trump administration official said.   If approved, Malpass would replace Kim, a physician and former university president who resigned more than three years before his term ended to join private equity fund Global Infrastructure Partners. Kim had differed with the Trump administration over climate change, effectively ending the bank’s financing of coal-fired power projects. [nL1N1ZF1ZN] Malpass served in Treasury and State Department roles during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

2019-02-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, boosted by signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply, but gains were capped by a rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. Brent crude futures gained 71 cents, or 1.15 percent, to settle at $62.69. The benchmark earlier fell to a session low of $61.05. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures gained 35 cents, or 0.65 percent, to settle at $54.01 a barrel, up from a session low of $52.86. U.S. government data on Wednesday showed that domestic crude inventories rose less than expected last week even as refineries hiked output. Stocks increased 1.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 1, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks increased by 513,000 barrels, less than anticipated, while distillate stockpiles fell a greater-than-expected 2.3 million barrels. “Distillate demand increased sharply last week due to the extreme cold weather, which contributed to the declining distillate stocks,” Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch said. “All in all this report is bullish for crude oil and refined product prices.” Market participants have focused on signs of tightening global crude supply after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies began an agreement in January to cut output. The producers known as OPEC+ started cutting production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from last month to avert a new supply glut, and OPEC has delivered almost three-quarters of its pledged cuts already, a Reuters survey showed last week.  U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company could also lift prices, though they have yet to trigger any sharp increase. The sanctions aim to block U.S. refiners from paying into PDVSA accounts controlled by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.  Venezuela’s opposition is opening a U.S. fund to receive the proceeds of oil sales, a key measure to secure revenue for its effort to dislodge Maduro, an opposition lawmaker said on Wednesday. A stronger U.S. dollar limited gains on Wednesday. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. “Despite several forays in WTI above our prior resistance of $55, the market continues to draft back down largely under the pressure of this week’s stronger dollar,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Also dampening market sentiment were worries about weaker global economic growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute. Oil prices fell on Tuesday after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. U.S. President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union address that a trade deal was possible with China. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks next week.

2019-02-06,"* Aussie dollar poised for biggest one-day drop since Nov. 2016 * No big surprises from State of the Union address * U.S. dollar index firms for 5th straight session * European equities slightly higher on bank lift (Updates with afternoon U.S. trading) By Chuck Mikolajczak and Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar tumbled on Wednesday after its central bank signaled a possible interest-rate cut in the latest indication a global economic slowdown is tilting policymakers towards looser monetary policy, while a gauge of world equity markets edged back from two-month highs. Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 slipped on concerns over growth, disappointing earnings reports and another possible U.S. government shutdown in the wake of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday. European shares gained slightly. Australia’s central bank was the latest to signal policy easing in the face of economic headwinds. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would be patient with regard to further rate hikes, while the European Central Bank also sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy later this year. The about-face pushed the Australian dollar down 1.65 percent against the U.S. dollar, putting it on track for its biggest daily drop since November 2016. In turn, the U.S. dollar moved higher against a basket of major currencies. “We are starting to see central banks follow (Fed Chair Jerome) Powell’s lead,” said Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis. “That’s what’s actually contributed to this dollar rally that we have seen recently.” The dollar index, tracking the unit against six major currencies, rose 0.31 percent, with the euro down 0.4 percent to $1.1366. The index was on pace for a fifth day of gains. In his address, Trump vowed to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, a divide with Democrats that had led to the previous 35-day partial government shutdown. “While he wasn’t confrontational, he still didn’t reach out an olive branch across the aisle in any manner. Both sides still seem dug in, so there’s a real fear that we are going to head toward another government shutdown,” said Gaffney. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 11.84 points, or 0.05 percent, to 25,423.36, the S&P 500 lost 3.06 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,734.64 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.83 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,386.25. Shares of videogame makers Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software tumbled after their respective forecasts sparked concerns. European stocks were buoyed by gains in Italian banks and tech stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.19 percent. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.7018 percent, from 2.704 percent late on Tuesday. Signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply boosted oil prices but gains were capped by a rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. U.S. crude rose 0.56 percent to $53.96 per barrel and Brent was last at $62.55, up 0.92 percent on the day.

2019-02-06,"(Adds Alberta government comment, updates stock price) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc , one of Canada’s biggest oil producers, expects the province of Alberta to end mandatory production curtailments ahead of schedule as they have caused a price boost that makes rail shipments uneconomic, Chief Executive Officer Steve Williams said on Wednesday. Such unintended consequences are happening faster than the Alberta government likely expected, and it should now plan for a “soft exit” from curtailments that is fair to producers, Williams said on a quarterly conference call. “The rail economics are seriously damaged, and a lot of the rail movements are stopping or have stopped,” he said. “That’s going to have the opposite impact than what the government wants.” Alberta curtailed 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January to drain a glut of crude in storage that was caused by congested pipelines. The output cuts boosted Canadian oil prices from record lows last year, but Suncor and other producers that have ample pipeline space and refineries say the sharp correction harmed their integrated businesses. The curtailments were applied fairly and saved jobs in the sector, said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for Alberta’s energy minister. He said the government will monitor storage levels and adjust production levels as needed. Williams said that the case for forced curtailments is likely to abate with seasonal maintenance shutdowns by oil producers during the second quarter, and with Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 expansion likely to start filling for start-up later this year. “You’re going to see the pressure start to come off,” he said. Suncor’s shares turned positive after Williams’ remarks, and were up 0.6 percent at C$43.77 on Wednesday afternoon in Toronto. Alberta eased the curtailments modestly for February and March. Its plan is to reduce the curtailments further to an average of 95,000 bpd through the end of 2019 once storage levels are sufficiently reduced. Suncor’s comments echo those of rival Imperial Oil Ltd , which said last week that it is ending nearly all crude by rail shipments because of the price impact of the curtailments. Late on Tuesday, Suncor reported a quarterly loss due largely to a one-time charge related to how it accounts for inventory.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Colombian President Ivan Duque will discuss Venezuela and other issues at the White House on Feb. 13, the White House said on Wednesday. It will be the first visit to Washington as president by Duque, a right-wing lawyer and former senator who took office last August after a decisive election victory against a leftist opponent. “The leaders expect to discuss their commitment to pro-growth policies, combating terrorism and illicit narcotic networks, strategic partnerships in regional security, and efforts to restore democracy in Venezuela,” the White House said in a statement. The United States has stepped up pressure to drive Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power after recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as acting president last month. Colombia has backed the effort. “I hope that in the coming days the diplomatic siege will continue,” Duque said on Friday, calling for free elections in Venezuela as part of a transition process. Colombia has become the main destination for the more than 3 million Venezuelans who have left their country, fleeing a political, economic and social crisis. More than 1 million Venezuelans currently live in Colombia. Trump met with Duque in New York at the U.N. General Assembly in September. He had planned to travel to Colombia in December but the visit was canceled.

2019-02-06,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility Uniper said on Wednesday there were no taboos in the fresh talks it will hold with its largest owner Fortum, breaking a long-standing deadlock between the two and potentially paving the way for a full take over. Fortum - majority owned by Finland - has a 49.99 percent stake in Uniper. Activist investors Elliott and Knight Vinke have disclosed stakes of 17.84 percent and 5.02 percent, respectively. Talks between Uniper and Fortum - which will not include Uniper’s CEO and CFO who will step down in August - could result in a cooperation agreement or follow up bid for the remainder of Uniper, investors, analysts and sources say. Below are some of the developments that could take place in the course of the year: Since becoming Uniper’s largest shareholder last year following a deal with E.ON, Fortum has tried to strike a cooperation agreement with Uniper, whose management had opposed the transaction from the get-go. While Fortum’s Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark as recently as last week described the results of these efforts as “disappointing”, the resignations of Uniper’s CEO and CFO, which were announced late on Tuesday, could move things along. The discussions, which will take place in a top-level working group where Uniper will be represented by its remaining two management board members, aim at exploring partnership opportunities on a strategic and operational level. Talks could lead to closer cooperation between the two energy firms in some markets, including Russia, with Jefferies estimating potential cost saving synergies for Uniper of 682 million euros ($776 million), or 1.90 euros per share. Expectations are that Fortum will, one way or another, eventually gain full control of Uniper, given the Finnish group approached its German peer regarding a takeover in the summer of 2017, albeit without success. Instead, Fortum spent 3.8 billion euros on buying the 47 percent stake in Uniper that E.ON held onto after spinning the company off three years ago, picking up only a few additional shares in the full bid it had to make as part of the deal. At Uniper’s current market value, the remaining stake would cost Fortum 4.8 billion euros plus any premium the group would certainly have to pay. Analysts at JP Morgan are less enthusiastic about the prospect of a bid, pointing to uncertainties raised by a recent government proposal to close coal-fired power stations in Germany and its impact on local utilities. “If anything this unlocks an unproductive situation, and we believe that Fortum is likely to wait for more clarity on the German coal and lignite phase-out compensation,” JP Morgan analysts wrote. Uniper Supervisory Board Chairman Bernhard Reutersberg, despite saying nothing was off-limits in discussions, said that no substantial results were expected before the group’s shareholder meeting in May. The relationship between both companies has been shaped by mistrust and allegations in the past, with Uniper calling Fortum a “wolf in sheep’s clothing” and Fortum saying Uniper actively tried to prevent a takeover from happening. One hurdle to fully integrating the two companies is a water license owned by Uniper’s Russian unit Unipro. If Unipro keeps the license, a Russian ban on foreign state-owned entities owning a majority in local strategic assets would prevent Fortum from owning more than half of Uniper. Elliott, which has also recently taken stakes in Thyssenkrupp and Bayer, will certainly have an external influence on the talks. The activist investor has significantly raised its stake in Uniper in recent months and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters that a further increase was possible. Elliott has so far remained tight-lipped in its role as a shareholder, at least publicly, apart from backing a motion last year to investigate whether Uniper tried to block the sale of E.ON’s stake to Fortum. Given the size of Elliott’s stake, it will be difficult for Fortum to gain full control over Uniper via a domination agreement unless it is supported by the fund, given Fortum needs a three-quarter majority at Uniper’s annual general meeting to make that happen. Elliott declined to comment and Knight Vinke was not immediately available for comment.

2019-02-06,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s government last year sold 73 tonnes of gold to Turkey and the United Arab Emirates without the required approval of the opposition-led National Assembly, an opposition legislator said on Wednesday. Of that total, Abu Dhabi investment firm Noor Capital bought the largest amount, 27.3 tonnes of gold, opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told a news conference, without providing evidence. Paparoni also said a Turkish firm bought 23.9 tonnes of gold last year. Venezuela’s opposition, led by National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, has sought to prevent the gold sales, believing Maduro’s government is using the proceeds to try to stay solvent as U.S.-imposed sanctions cut off other revenue streams. The United States and numerous other countries have recognised Guaido as Venezuela’s interim leader in the aftermath of Maduro’s re-election last year in a vote critics have called a sham. Venezuela had gold reserves of 132 tonnes between the central bank’s vaults and the Bank of England at the end of November, according to central bank data. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests to comment. Noor Capital last Friday said it had bought 3 tonnes of gold on Jan. 21 from the Venezuelan central bank and would not buy more until Venezuela’s situation stabilized. Its purchase was in accordance with “international standards and laws in place” as of that date, it said. “We will keep working so that not one more gram of gold can be sold,” Paparoni said. In response to a request to comment, Noor Capital issued the same statement as last week saying it “does not engage in any illegal or prohibited transactions.” Paparoni also said Maduro’s administration had transferred 127 million euros to bank accounts in Russia, without providing a date. Since Monday, the Venezuelan government has not been able to move money between its accounts in banks in the European Union, Paparoni said. Turkey and Russia have been key supporters of Maduro. Maduro’s government began selling gold about a year ago after falling oil production, economic collapse and mounting U.S. sanctions hit public income in the OPEC-member nation and made it hard for it access credit.

2019-02-06,"(Adds details on shipments) Feb 6 (Reuters) - The United States imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry last week, looking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of revenue. The sanctions limit transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. Here are details on how the sanctions work: The United States is aiming to freeze sales proceeds from Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. There is also a prohibition on U.S firms exporting diluents, unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude, to Venezuela. Venezuela exports oil primarily to the United States, India, and China as well as other nations. Only the United States and India are notable sources of cash, as Russian and Chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated oil-for-loan agreements due to Venezuela’s heavy liabilities with those countries. Russia, in particular, resells the oil it receives to others. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refineries. However, they stipulate that refiners cannot make payments directly to PDVSA, but into escrow accounts that PDVSA will not get access to until the company is controlled by a new government. Maduro and Manuel Quevedo, who is both oil minister and head of PDVSA, have said they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the United States to leave the country’s ports without being prepaid. Numerous tankers are trapped in the Gulf of Mexico. Venezuela’s PDVSA sells oil to brokers – trading houses and third-party merchants – with the following terms: the shipments are paid by the merchants who often have another buyer lined up, and delivery is made at the Venezuelan ports. Once a tanker leaves Venezuelan waters, it belongs to the merchant (the buyer). The company is then free to sell the oil to whomever it wants. It is unclear whether payments have been made to either PDVSA or the escrow accounts that the United States said it would set up to help fund opposition leader Juan Guaido’s efforts. For now, companies can do business but with restrictions. Refineries that import from Venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to get their supplies elsewhere. However, since payments cannot be made to PDVSA, this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States. The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russian state-owned oil giant Rosneft . Chevron, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Weatherford International all have operations in Venezuela, and are allowed to continue transactions and activities with PDVSA and its joint ventures through July 27. Venezuela’s production could fall further later this year if the service companies, which have already reduced operations, leave the country. Chevron, which has four joint-venture operations in the country, said it would not comment on the current situation in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil both left Venezuela years ago after late President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil industry. NON-U.S. PDVSA PARTNERS IN VENEZUELA Norway’s Equinor has a 9.7 percent stake in a heavy oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt area, which is majority owned by PDVSA. The company also has a 51 percent stake in a Plataforma Deltana block off eastern Venezuela, and it has 25 employees in Venezuela. “We are just following the situation and making sure that we safeguard our employees,” Equinor’s spokesman said about the political developments and impact on the company’s operations. Rosneft and China’s CNPC each hold substantial interests in several oilfields in Venezuela, which dwarf those of any other country. Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, Italy’s Eni, Japan’s Inpex and India’s ONGC Videsh also own minority oilfield stakes. Russia’s Lukoil was part of a Russian consortium to develop production in Venezuela but quit several years ago and has since then sharply reduced its presence in the country. Citgo Petroleum is a wholly owned subsidiary of PDVSA and operates refining capacity to process about 750,000 bpd. It also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation’s retail fuel market. The United States has exempted Citgo from its sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. As of September, the company had about $500 million in cash and a credit line of approximately $900 million, according to a creditor familiar with the company’s financial statements. Citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from PDVSA for three more months, according to the sanctions. The sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents (heavy naphtha) to PDVSA, which are used for making the country’s extra heavy crude oil ready for export. The OPEC member’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018 from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela and PDVSA are estimated to owe more than $100 billion to bondholders, suppliers, allied governments, lenders and creditors holding judgments. Some creditors have gone to U.S. courts to try to seize Citgo to satisfy their legal claims. Reporting By David Gaffen, Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga,

2019-02-06,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is committed to launching fast and effective reforms that could be “difficult and painful” to avoid a worsening of economic, financial and social conditions, according to a draft government policy statement seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The statement sets the main policy objectives of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri’s national unity government that was finally formed last week after nine months of wrangling over cabinet portfolios. With one of the world’s highest public debt burdens, Lebanon says it will carry out reforms that have been put off for years but are now seen as more pressing than ever to put the public finances on a sustainable path. The draft policy statement commits to bringing down the debt-to-GDP ratio by boosting the size of the economy and reducing the budget deficit. Echoing a pledge made by Hariri at last year’s Paris donor conference, it says the government is committed to a “financial correction” equal to at least one percent of GDP a year over five years, starting with the 2019 budget. This would be achieved by boosting revenues and cutting spending, starting with transfers to the state-run power company, which the World Bank has said represent a “staggering burden” on the public finances. The draft statement also said the government would freeze state hiring in 2019 in all its forms. State hiring in the four years to follow would be half the number of retirees and only on condition the deficit reduction targets had been met. Information Minister Jamal al-Jarrah, speaking to journalists, said tax increases were not being considered. He said there were no big points of contention over the statement and it was expected to be approved on Thursday by the government, which includes the Iran-backed group Hezbollah. International donor institutions and foreign governments want to see reforms before releasing some $11 billion in financial assistance pledged at a Paris conference last year. Hariri aims to use the funds, mostly soft loans, for a capital investment programme that would boost low growth. Lebanon’s economy has been hit by factors including years of regional turmoil, including the war in Syria. The draft policy statement said the government would continue the policy of exchange rate stability, calling it a priority for “social and economic stability”. The pound has been pegged to the dollar at the same level for over two decades. The government would award licences for offshore energy blocks in a second round of tenders by the end of 2019, the draft statement said. Exploration in the first block by a consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek began last year.    Lebanon has some of the world’s worst debt and balance-of-payments ratios, and its ability to dodge financial disaster has for years confounded critics, whose warnings of debt defaults, balance of payments crises and a collapse of the pound currency, have all failed to materialise. Its financial system has depended for funding on financial transfers from the diaspora, though questions over the sustainability of the model have grown due to a slowdown in remittance and deposit inflows. President Michel Aoun said the financial situation was improving. Aoun also said that interest rates were expected to start falling soon. A presidential source said he was referring to high rates offered on bank deposits. Kevin Daly, Senior Investment Manager in Emerging Market Debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said it clearly looked “like an unsustainable story over the medium term”. “Having a government in place, that’s extremely important, but they need to address some of the key vulnerabilities and the big one is in the electricity sector which is a big drain on the fiscal finance of the country – that plus no growth.” Additional reporting by Ellen Francis in Beirut and Karin Strohecker in London; Writing by Tom Perry/Ellen Francis; Editing by Hugh Lawson, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/lebanon-government/exclusive-heavily-indebted-lebanon-promises-quick-reforms-draft-policy-statement-idUKL5N2015O7,06 Feb 2019,"* State hiring to be frozen in 2019 - draft

2019-02-06,"PARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The French Senate on Wednesday voted in favour of allowing the state to lower its minority stake in gas and power group Engie, despite rejecting a proposal to privatise airport operator ADP earlier in the week. The French state owns 23.64 percent of Engie’s capital and 34 percent of the shares’ voting rights, and is required by law to keep at least 33 percent of the voting rights. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told the Senate that if Engie wanted to issue new capital to finance its expansion, the state would have no choice but to subscribe to respect the law. “That is why we ask for the possibility to lower the state’s stake in Engie below the legal limit,” Le Maire told senators. The government has given no indication of how much of its shares it may want to sell. The Senate, controlled by the conservative opposition, voted 250 against 92 in favour of the government proposal. A no-vote could only have delayed the operation, rather than definitively block it, since the Assemblee Nationale lower house of parliament - where President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist LREM party has a comfortable majority - has the final vote. “The logic is the same for all government asset sales, we want to give (these companies) the chance to grow and develop,” Le Maire said, adding that Engie would boost its investment in renewable energy, notably biogas and offshore wind power. The planned sale of more Engie shares is part of a government plan to raise around 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion) for innovation as part of its “Loi Pacte” legislation.

2019-02-06,"OSLO (Reuters) - Last year was the fourth warmest on record and the outlook is for more sizzling heat approaching levels that most governments view as dangerous for the Earth, a U.N. report showed on Wednesday. Weather extremes in 2018 included wildfires in California and Greece, drought in South Africa and floods in Kerala, India.  Record levels of man-made greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels, trap ever more heat. Average global surface temperatures were 1.0 degree Celsius (1.8 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times in 2018, the U.N.’s World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said, based on data from U.S., British, Japanese and European weather agencies. “The long-term temperature trend is far more important than the ranking of individual years, and that trend is an upward one,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. “The 20 warmest years on record have been in the past 22 years.” To combat warming, almost 200 governments adopted the Paris climate agreement in 2015 to phase out the use of fossil fuels and limit the rise in temperatures to 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for 1.5C (2.7F). “The impacts of long-term global warming are already being felt - in coastal flooding, heat waves, intense precipitation and ecosystem change,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. Last year, the United States alone suffered 14 weather and climate disasters with losses exceeding $1 billion each, led by hurricanes and wildfires, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said.  NOAA and NASA contribute data to the WMO. This year has also started with scorching temperatures, including Australia’s warmest January on record. Against the global trend, parts of the United States suffered bone-chilling cold from a blast of Arctic air last week.In WMO records dating back to the 19th century, 2016 was the hottest year, boosted by an El Nino weather event in the Pacific Ocean, ahead of 2015 and 2017 with 2018 in fourth. The British Met Office, which also contributes data to the WMO, said temperatures could rise to 1.5C above pre-industrial times, for instance if a natural El Nino weather event adds a burst of heat. “Over the next five years there is a one in 10 chance of one of those years breaking the (1.5C) threshold,” Professor Adam Scaife of the Met Office told Reuters of the agency’s medium-term forecasts. “That is not saying the Paris Agreement is done for ... but it’s a worrying sign,” he said. The United Nations defines the 1.5C Paris temperature target as a 30-year average, not a freak blip in a single year. The United Nations says the world is now on track for a temperature rise of 3C or more by 2100. The Paris pact responded to a 1992 U.N. treaty under which all governments agreed to avert “dangerous” man-made climate change. A U.N. report last year said the world is likely to breach 1.5C sometime between 2030 and 2052 on current trends, triggering ever more heat waves, powerful storms, droughts, mudslides, extinctions and rising sea levels. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has cast doubt on mainstream climate science and promotes the coal industry, plans to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement. He did not mention climate change in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday. Patrick Verkooijen, head of the Global Center on Adaptation in the Netherlands, told Reuters that the WMO report showed “climate change is not a distant phenomenon but is here right now.” He called for more, greener investments, ranging from defenses against rising seas to drought-resistant crops.

(PPC) is seeking a higher price from two bidders for three coal-fired plants it is selling to boost competition in the energy market, a company source said on Wednesday. The sale was a condition of Greece’s last international bailout and the deadline for bids expired on Wednesday. It had been repeatedly pushed back since the tender was launched last year for various reasons. The state-controlled utility asked bidders on Wednesday to raise their offers and its board will meet on Friday to evaluate them, a source from the company said on condition of anonymity. PPC is selling two plants in the town of Megalopoli on the southern Peloponnese along with another plant and a licence to build a new one in Meliti, northern Greece, after a European Union court ruled that the utility had abused its dominant position in the coal market. Greek group GEK Terna, jointly with Czech company Seven Energy, submitted one of the bids, a government official told Reuters on condition of anonymity. A source close to the sale said that GEK Terna had bid for all the assets on sale. The other bidder was Greek industrial group Mytilineos , the government official said. Mytilineos was not available for comment but an official with knowledge of the matter said the group bid only for the plant in Meliti. PPC, which is 51 percent state-owned, and the energy ministry are handling the divestment and the European Commission is overseeing the process. PPC had shortlisted six investors in the sale. PPC said last week that some of the plants had swung to profit after about 400 people opted to move to other subsidiaries of the group or had retired under a voluntary exit scheme.

Crowds welcomed Tsipras as he arrived on Heybeliada, an island south of Istanbul, to visit the Halki theological school which was closed by the Turkish state in 1971 and has remained a source of contention between the long-time rivals. “I want to believe that the day is approaching when these rooms will be filled again with the laughter of happy students,” he said in a speech, saying the seminary’s reopening would send a “message of friendship, understanding and brotherhood”. “There are issues between our governments and our countries which only dialogue can resolve,” he said, flanked by Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of Orthodox Christians worldwide and who is based in Istanbul. Tsipras is the first serving Greek prime minister to visit the Halki seminary. Turkey, which is overwhelmingly Muslim, has given no public indication that it is planning to reopen the Christian seminary and has resisted years of pressure from the European Union, which it aspires to join, to do so. On Tuesday, Tsipras met Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara, where the Turkish president said he expected more cooperation from Athens in the repatriation of eight soldiers who fled to Greece following an attempted coup in 2016. Tsipras told their joint news conference that Greece does not welcome putschists, but that the case of the eight soldiers was a matter for the judiciary. He said both countries had agreed to de-escalate tensions in the Aegean Sea and proceed with confidence-building measures. Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin joined Tsipras on Wednesday in Istanbul on a tour of Hagia Sophia, which was the foremost cathedral in Christendom for 900 years and then - after the city fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453 - one of Islam’s greatest mosques for another 500 years. It has been a museum since 1935. In late 2017, Erdogan made the first visit to Greece by a Turkish president in 65 years, but the trip was marred by verbal sparring over various historical grievances. Erdogan complained about discrimination against Muslims in northern Greece, while Turkey’s military presence in ethnically split Cyprus and diverging interpretations of an international treaty defining their borders also fueled tensions. Cyprus has been divided since a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. U.N.-led peace talks between the Greek and Turkish sides collapsed in 2017. NATO members Greece and Turkey were nearly drawn into a military clash in 1996 over an uninhabited Aegean islet. On Tuesday, Turkey updated a list of former military officers wanted for their alleged role in the 2016 putsch to include the eight officers granted asylum in Greece, and offered a bounty of 4 million Turkish lira ($770,000) for each of them.

2019-02-06,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - Biofuel producer and oil refiner Neste reported a bigger than expected fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday after seeing robust demand for its renewables fuels, which it expects will continue to grow. The Finnish company, which produces diesel and other fuels from renewable materials at plants in Singapore and Rotterdam, said sales at its renewables business in the first quarter would likely surpass those of the fourth quarter of 2018, adding that utilization rates would be high. Chief Executive Peter Vanacker said the company’s main growth drivers going forward would be rising jet fuel sales, and marine fuel sales as shipping companies prepare for new sulfur emissions rules coming into force in 2020.  “In 2018, we have already produced the first 5,000 tonnes of renewable jet fuel and we see a big market coming up in the aviation industry,” Vanacker told Reuters in a phone interview. Neste’s cooperation with furniture giant Ikea on bio-based plastics, announced last June, would be another growth area, he said. The company’s shares rose as much as 6 percent after its results and were up 4 percent at 85.46 euros by 1343 GMT. Neste, which also has two conventional oil refineries in Finland, said margins for its oil products business would be low in the first quarter due to a weak gasoline market, but would strengthen towards the end of that period. Renewables account for 70 percent of group profits and  Neste said its total fourth-quarter core operating profit rose 12 percent to 349 million euros ($398 million), beating analysts’ average expectation of 321 million in a Reuters poll. Operating profit at its renewables operations rose to 281 million euros, beating analysts’ forecasts in the poll, which ranged from 198 million to 258 million. Neste announced in December plans to build a new 1.4 billion euro refinery in Singapore, expecting to expand its total renewables production capacity to 4.5 million tonnes annually by 2022 from 2.7 million tonnes currently. “As you can see from the Singapore investment, quite a lot of our efforts are going into expansion in the renewables space where we still see quite a lot of opportunities for the future,” Vanacker said. Neste said its cooperation with Ikea aimed “to utilize renewable residue and waste raw materials as well as sustainably produced vegetable oils in the production of plastic products”. The company sees room for growth in its marine fuel business ahead of the new sulfur emissions limits, which will fall to 0.5 percent in bunker fuel from 3.5 percent currently. “We are very well positioned because here in the Baltic Sea the regulation is already even lower than 0.5 percent, it’s 0.1 percent,” Vanacker said, referring to the new emissions limit for ships. “This will have a positive influence on our additional margin,” he said, adding some industry consultants has estimated the effect at between $1.8 and $2 per barrel.   Neste proposed a dividend of 2.28 euros per share, slightly above the average forecast.

2019-02-06,"BEIRUT, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Israel has breached Lebanon’s waters by licensing a company to “exploit an area” for oil and gas near disputed borders, Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said on Wednesday. The two countries have an unresolved maritime border dispute over a sea zone of about 860 sq km (330 square miles) which extends along the edge of three of Lebanon’s energy blocks. U.S. diplomats mediated between them last year after a spike in tensions that also involved a row over a border wall Israel built and over Iran-backed Hezbollah’s growing arsenal. “(It is) a dangerous matter. Israel has licensed and exploited an area adjacent to the Lebanese southern maritime borders,” MPs from Berri’s Amal party quoted him as saying on Wednesday after a meeting. “This is an infringement on Lebanese sovereignty and targets our oil wealth and waters.” The Israeli Energy Ministry did not immediately comment. Berri vowed “not to remain silent” and will bring it up with the Italian prime minister visiting Beirut this week, as well as other foreign states, the lawmakers said. Ali Bazzi, an Amal lawmaker, said Israel pressed on with the “violation” even though the companies on the Lebanese side have stayed away from the contentious border. Lebanon sits on the Levant Basin in the eastern Mediterranean - along with Cyprus, Egypt, Israel and Syria - where a number big gas fields have been discovered since 2009. Lebanon has signed its first offshore oil and gas exploration and production agreements for two energy blocks, including one disputed by Israel. A consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek signed the contracts. Lebanon has said the dispute would not stop it benefiting from potential undersea reserves in Block 9, while consortium operator Total said it would not drill the block’s first well near the disputed sliver of water. Instead, the well would be drilled more than 25 km (15 miles) from the maritime border claimed by Israel, Total has said.

2019-02-06,"By Ana Mano and Christian Plumb SAO PAULO, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Vale SA, the world’s largest iron ore miner, plans to invest some 1.5 billion reais ($400 million) starting in 2020 to reduce its reliance on tailings dams, it said late on Tuesday, after one collapsed last month, likely killing hundreds. The dam at the Feijao do Corrego mine burst on Jan. 25 in the Brazilian town of Brumadinho in what is likely the country’s most deadly mining disaster ever. Rescuers have found 142 bodies and almost 200 people are still missing. Vale said its plan to reduce its reliance on giant dams to store the muddy detritus from mining, known as tailings, would boost to 70 percent by 2023 the portion of the leftover material that is dried out rather than stored wet. The company also said it would spend about $70 million on safety and maintenance measures for existing tailings dams in 2019, representing a 180 percent increase from 2015. That year a Vale joint venture was responsible for another deadly dam spill that killed 19 people and polluted a major river. A Vale spokeswoman said that both the 2019 investment in dam management and the plan to produce more dry tailings had already been budgeted before the Brumadinho disaster but not made public. In December, Vale agreed to pay $500 million for New Steel, a company that owns patents in 56 countries for a dry processing method known as Fines Dry Magnetic Separation. In 2009, one Vale executive identified concerns about the tailings dams and discussed the possibility of making building material from tailings, including bricks, as one measure to reduce the hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wet tailings, Reuters reported last week. Whether the company followed any of his recommendations at the time is unclear. Vale has come under intense public pressure since the Jan. 25 dam burst, with some politicians and prosecutors calling for criminal prosecution and a management shakeup. A court-ordered halt to production at several of its dams on Monday froze production at its largest mine in Brazil’s mining heartland of Minas Gerais, responsible for nearly 9 percent of the company’s output. That led Vale to declare a force majeure on some of its iron ore contracts on Tuesday. $1 = 3.6917 reais

2019-02-06,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom is looking to gain an even larger gas market share in Europe following record-high 2018 exports, expecting a decline in Europe’s gas output combined with rising demand, a senior manager at the company said.   Last year it sold more than 200 billion cubic metres of gas to Europe, including Turkey, while its gas market share in the region rose to more than a third.  Elena Burmistrova, in charge of the Russian company’s exports, said Gazprom would be able to offset a production decline in the European Union, mainly at the Netherlands’ Groningen, once Europe’s largest natural gas field. “North Sea production is also gradually declining ... So, the space for Russian gas is being freed up,” she said on the sidelines of the European Gas conference in Vienna. EU gas production will halve by 2040, the Paris-based International Energy Agency has said. Moscow has piped gas to Europe from its fields in Siberia and northern Russia for more than 50 years. It can ill afford losing the lucrative market for Kremlin-run Gazprom, whose sales account for over 5 percent of Russia’s $1.6 trillion economy. Burmistrova said Gazprom was striving to raise its market share in Europe, where the company generates two thirds of its gas sales. “According to preliminary estimates, our share (in Europe)  stood at 34 percent in 2017, while in 2018 it could have reached around 35 percent,” Burmistrova said in remarks cleared for publication on Wednesday. Russian energy sales have become increasingly politicised since 2014 following the annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, accusations of meddling in the U.S. presidential election in 2016 and a nerve gas attack in Britain. Gazprom last year escaped the spectre of big fines in a case that had dragged on for seven years after it clinched a deal with EU antitrust regulators to reform its pricing structure and allow rivals a foothold in eastern Europe.  Burmistrova said Gazprom did not want to look too “aggressive” in the eyes of Europe with its plans to boost sales. “We don’t set a target of gaining 40 or 45 percent of the (EU) market,” she said. Some European countries, mainly in Eastern Europe, have voiced concern about Russia’s growing energy clout. The Gazprom manager said the company had proven to be a reliable gas supplier and that its exports in Europe would not suffer because of politics. However, Gazprom’s exports have been jeopardised by a shale gas production boom in the United States and President Donald Trump’s plans to sell “vast amounts” of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Europe.     U.S. LNG shipments to Europe totalled 3.23 million tonnes, or 48 cargoes, in October to January, compared to 0.7 million tonnes, or nine cargoes, a year earlier.  The United States is now second only to Qatar, the world’s largest LNG producer, as an LNG supplier to Europe, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  Burmistrova played down the danger to Russian gas dominance in Europe from the United States. “We will always be competitive against American LNG,” she said.

2019-02-06,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell CAPE TOWN, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The response to the horrendous dam collapse at a mine owned by Brazil’s Vale has focused on iron ore prices and how a disaster that will likely claim more than 300 lives occurred, and what must be done to make sure this doesn’t happen again. These are valid concerns, but the risk of focusing on the immediate issues is that the much larger problems of the mining industry are once again glossed over. Namely that miners aren’t trusted and suffer from a serious image problem. It may seem somewhat trivial to talk about image in the face of such a human tragedy, but mining’s poor image across a range of stakeholders is the major issue for the industry. If mining has a poor safety and community image, it becomes “uninvestable”, to use the words of a senior global banker, talking at the 121 Mining Investment event in Cape Town this week, held under Chatham House rules. If investors don’t want to commit funds to the industry because of fear over damage to their own image from poor mining practices, then the industry will be starved of capital. Lack of capital means it becomes harder and harder to get new mines built or exploration drilling undertaken. There is also the risk of a cascade of negative outcomes for mining. If major banks and pension funds make it clear they are withdrawing from investing in mining companies, it’s likely share prices will suffer, leading other investors to withdraw funds, even if they don’t have quite the same moral qualms. It goes further than just losing sources of capital, with mining companies already struggling to attract younger workers. A common theme at the Investing in African Mining Indaba, a second event in Cape Town this week and one of the biggest such conferences worldwide, was a lament from company executives that members of the millennial generation - roughly in their early 20s to mid-30s - show little interest in mining, preferring more trendy industries, such as technology and digital solutions. The fact that mining is increasingly turning to digital applications and that mines of the future will bear little resemblance to current operations is not resonating with younger workers, largely because of the industry’s image, rather than its substance. Mining companies also have a global image problem, with many increasingly nationalistic governments wanting to extract more value from their mineral resources. Mining companies push back against higher royalties, or other forms of contribution such as underwriting new infrastructure, largely because they boost costs and cut profits. But by becoming unpopular in countries where they operate, longer term costs may be ultimately higher for mining companies. Mining runs the risk of suffering what happened to the oil industry, where international majors went from a dominant position to one where state companies produce the bulk of crude. The mining industry appears to be increasingly aware of its image problem, with speakers at both the 121 Mining and Mining Indaba events referring repeatedly to the concept of their “licence to operate”, a term that includes working with local communities, governments and consumers of their products. Miners are keen to brand themselves as part of the green energy revolution, since mining provides the metals and energy needed to make the renewable technologies that aim to replace the burning of fossil fuels. But the problem for miners is convincing an increasingly sceptical public of how necessary their industry is. Part of this is that the greener part of mining is still struggling to disassociate itself from the dirty part. In other words, lithium, cobalt and copper miners still get lumped alongside coal miners. Iron ore miners now are at risk of moving into the space occupied by coal, as public distrust and distaste will be ramped up after the tailings dam collapse at Vale’s Corrego do Feijao mine. The industry needs to do more than just recognise its image problems, it needs chief executives to make presenting and promoting a better picture their top priority, not just something they pay lip service to before handing off to junior, under-resourced public relations teams.

The deadline will probably have more impact than the next OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (March 18), OPEC’s extraordinary meeting (April 17-18) or even the White House review of Iran sanctions waivers (May 4). The outcome of trade talks will have a decisive influence on the oil consumption outlook for the rest of the year since the threat of tariffs and associated uncertainty are proving the largest drag on global economic growth. Because the trade deadline comes first, the outturn will shape the subsequent strategic choices made by OPEC and its allies over oil production and the White House on how far to toughen Iran sanctions. Uncertainty about the outlook for global trade has already pushed the world economy close to the brink of recession, judging by a range of business surveys and statistics on trade volumes (tmsnrt.rs/2TyUPrn). China’s manufacturers reported a fall in business activity in December and January, and the official purchasing managers’ index has fallen to its lowest level for three years. Global manufacturers have reported declining export orders for five months now, according to the new export orders component of the JPMorgan Global PMI, with new business falling at the fastest rate since 2016. Freight flows through Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub, are also falling at the fastest rate since 2016, according to government statistics. The only significant exception to the global slowdown has been the United States itself, where manufacturers report a continued widespread upturn, albeit more slowly than the frenzied rates in late 2017 and early 2018. In the rest of the world, the slowdown has taken a toll on current and prospective oil consumption growth, pushing the global market towards surplus and causing prices to fall sharply in the fourth quarter. The biggest impact of the slowdown is being felt in the consumption of middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel used in trucking, shipping, railroads and airlines as well as by manufacturers, miners and farmers. Given distillate’s predominant use in freight transport and industry, distillate consumption and prices have been closely correlated with the business cycle at U.S. and global levels in the last 50 years. If the economy slides into an extended slowdown, or worse an outright recession, distillate prices will come under renewed pressure and take crude prices down with them. The global economy has been battered by a series of negative shocks in the last six to 12 months, including the stalled Brexit negotiations, rising U.S. interest rates, an appreciating U.S. dollar, and sharp falls in world equity markets. But the largest source of uncertainty stems from the deteriorating trading relationship between the United States and China, which is spilling over to both countries’ trading networks. The resolution of U.S.-China tensions will therefore have more impact on the global economic outlook and oil consumption than any other single factor in 2019. Of all possible outcomes, four are the most likely: (1) Comprehensive agreement settling all or nearly all outstanding issues between the two countries; (2) Limited agreement settling some issues but leaving more difficult items to be dealt with later (risking recurrent tensions); (3) No deal but with an agreement to postpone the tariff deadline while the two sides continue negotiating (risking recurrent tensions); (4) No deal, with an immediate imposition of U.S. tariffs on China’s exports. A comprehensive agreement on all issues would be the most positive result and could lead to a major boost in business confidence, but because some issues are so difficult, it is also probably the least likely of those four possible outcomes. At the other end of the spectrum, no deal and immediate imposition of tariffs would be the most negative outcome and the resulting shock to confidence and markets would make a recession very likely. The risks of no deal give policymakers in China and the United States a powerful incentive to compromise – provided they can save face and present any accord in a favourable light to domestic audiences. The intermediate outcomes of a limited accord or continued negotiations would avoid the worst recession risks but do little to rekindle business confidence, so have little impact on the trajectory of the economy. Comprehensive agreement is obviously more positive for oil consumption, while no deal would pose the greatest risk for oil demand. Comprehensive agreement would allow the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to contemplate relaxing their output curbs but might make the White House hesitate about toughening sanctions on Iran. By contrast, no deal would probably force OPEC and its allies to consider even deeper production cuts but also give the White House more scope to reduce or eliminate sanctions waivers for Iran’s crude customers. OPEC and its allies will need a clear idea of the White House’s approach to Iran before they make any decision about adjusting output to avoid repeating the miscommunication that dogged the last U.S. sanctions deadline in October-November 2018. The White House will therefore come under pressure to make its position on Iran sanctions clear before the OPEC+ meeting in mid-April to avoid further oil price volatility. The imposition of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA to deny financial support to the Maduro government and force a transfer of power to the opposition has further complicated the outlook. The scope of the sanctions remains unclear (intentionally) but they appear to include primary sanctions on U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil and secondary sanctions on third-country firms doing business with PDVSA. If the sanctions are sustained for any length of time, they will probably remove several hundred thousand barrels per day of crude from the global market, which would tighten the production-consumption balance significantly. But the lack of much price response so far suggests most traders expect the showdown between the United States and the Maduro government to be resolved relatively quickly. The abrupt and aggressive escalation of the crisis has engaged the full political and diplomatic credibility of the White House and the United States in forcing a swift transition of power. The United States has pushed the crisis so far it would be very difficult to back down now and allow the Maduro government to remain in place. Most traders seem to be betting the standoff will end quickly with the replacement of the Maduro administration and a resumption of Venezuela’s exports (or alternatively exports will be allowed to resume to third countries). If the standoff lasts longer and third-country exports remain sanctioned, crude prices will eventually have to rise unless OPEC makes up the difference. While Venezuela remains an immediate concern, the outlook for oil prices in the rest of the year will be dominated by what happens in trade talks between the United States and China in the next three weeks.

2019-02-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tests of the first shale well at Cuadrilla’s site in northwest England show a rich reservoir of high quality and recoverable gas, the British firm said on Wednesday, adding that rules that have constrained its testing work should be eased. Cuadrilla is using a technique called hydraulic fracturing that involves injecting water and chemicals at high pressure to break up rock and extract gas. The practice, known as fracking, can cause tremors and environmentalists oppose the development. The company repeatedly stopped operations last year at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire because of minor seismic events. British regulations demand work be suspended if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or more is detected. Cuadrilla said it could only partially test the horizontal shale well because of the operating limits. It said it fully fractured 2 out of 41 stages along the horizontal well and less than 14 percent of sand was injected. “Nonetheless the natural gas still flowed back from the shale at a peak rate of over 200,000 standard cubic feet (scf) per day and a stable rate of some 100,000 scf/day,” Chief Executive Officer Francis Egan. Scaling up the results suggested a flow range of between 3 million to 8 million scf/day for a 2.5 km (1.6 miles) section once all stages were hydraulically fractured, Cuadrilla said. “We have also confirmed that the Bowland shale formation fractures in a way that, from U.S. experience, is typical of an excellent shale gas reservoir,” Egan said. Fracking techniques were pioneered in the United States, which has turned from an importer of gas to a net exporter. Cuadrilla said more production data was needed to refine the preliminary results and this could only be done if seismicity limits are lifted to allow more effective fracturing. The firm has asked the regulator to review rules on seismic activity to allow more thorough testing of exploration wells. Depending on the outcome, Cuadrilla plans to complete fracking its first well at Preston New Road, start a second and carry out flow testing of both later this year. Rival Ineos, which has the largest shale gas license acreage in Britain, has called on the government to change seismicity regulations. Experts have also said the limit for tremors could be safely raised at fracking sites. Environmentalists have campaigned against fracking, saying extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They have also raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination. Greenpeace UK said the government should not waste time on fracking and support clean energy infrastructure instead.  Britain’s government has said it wants to cut reliance on imports of gas, which heats about 80 percent of British homes. It has proposed measures to speed up planning applications to support the development of the UK shale gas industry. The British Geological Survey estimates shale gas resources in north England could reach 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf), 10 percent of which could meet Britain’s demand for about 40 years. Cuadrilla is 47.4 percent owned by Australia’s AJ Lucas and 45.2 percent owned by a fund managed by Riverstone.

2019-02-06,"* Aussie dollar set for biggest one-day drop in a year * State of Union address throws up no market surprises * European equities lower on poor earnings, Daimler, BNPP in focus * Italy 30-year bond takes orders of 33 billion euros * (Updates pricing, adds quotes) By Virginia Furness LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar nosedived on Wednesday after its central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut, in yet another indication the global economic slowdown is persuading policymakers to go easy on rate hikes. World stocks too stalled just off two-month highs , undermined by the growth worries as well as U.S. President Donald Trump’s combative State of the Union address in which he unveiled no new policy initiatives. European shares traded marginally in the black and equity futures signalled a flat to weaker open on Wall Street. Australia’s central bank is only the latest to signal policy easing in the face of economic headwinds — the U.S. Federal Reserve has all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, while the European Central Bank also sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy later this year. The U-turn pushed the Australian dollar 1.5 percent lower, putting it on track for its biggest daily drop in a year. Australian short-dated bond yields were set for their biggest one-day drop in more than two years, down 10 basis points on the day. “When I look at the global economy, Germany on is on the cusp of recession, Italy is in recession, Japan in on the cusp, the Chinese economy is seeing the lowest growth in 3 decades. The Fed had a look at the picture and said the world is slowing, it is maybe appropriate to pause,” said Rhys Petheram, a fund manager in the multi-asset team at Jupiter Asset Management. “I want to be more defensive in my allocation to risk,” he added. Wall Street finished strong on Tuesday and is now some 16 percent off December lows but sentiment was knocked by the U.S. president’s failure in his annual speech to unveil new infrastructure plans. He also raised the possibility of another government shutdown should financing not be forthcoming for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Futures indicated a weaker open on U.S. stocks with the S&P and Nasdaq both down 0.1 percent. European stocks meanwhile were undermined by the latest batch of earnings, that further underscored the weak local economy and the drag on companies from slower global trade. Shares in BNP Paribas and carmaker Daimler slumped one percent and three percent respectively, ending the market’s six-day rally. French-listed BNP Paribas lowered its profit and revenue growth targets for 2020 while Daimler’s profits were hit by trade war and ballooning costs for developing electric and self-driving cars Germany’s DAX index lost 0.5 percent. Europe’s economic weakness prompted demand for bonds, with German 10-year government bond yields trading around 0.17 percent, well off the 0.21 percent highs hit on Tuesday . Investors have pushed back expectations that the European Central Bank will hike rates this year, a view reinforced after data showed German industrial orders fell on weak foreign demand in December. Investors will also be looking to the European Commission’s winter macroeconomic forecasts, due to be published Wednesday or Thursday. Large downward revisions to growth and inflation are likely, many analysts predict. “The moderation of growth is so widespread it makes the ECB’s job easier, as it was more difficult for them to justify their stance when Germany was leading the economic cycle while other countries were lagging growth,” said Monica Defend, chief strategist and deputy head of research at Amundi. The appetite for bonds also was evident in the 33 billion euros worth of orders investors had placed for Italy’s new 30-year bond by 1115 GMT. Concerns for world growth fanned fears for global energy demand, hitting crude prices. Brent futures were trading around $61.59 a barrel. On the Brexit front, sterling looked fragile at around $1.2951 after losing nearly 0.7 percent on Tuesday when weak service sector data underscored damage to the economy from Brexit uncertainty. Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to tell EU leaders they must accept legally binding changes to the Irish border arrangements of Britain’s divorce deal or face a disorderly no-deal Brexit.

2019-02-06,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian mining company Vale SA plans to invest about 1.5 billion reais ($409 million) in so-called dry stacking tailing systems to reduce its reliance on tailings dams, it said late Tuesday, after a dam burst last month killing an estimated 300 people. The Brumadinho dam burst on Jan. 25, killing 142 people and leaving almost 200 still missing, according to the latest report from rescue workers. Vale said its plan to shift to dry tailings, which would start next year, was aimed at boosting the dry processing portion of its production to 70 percent by 2023, thus reducing the need for dams in its operations.   Investments to service Vale’s existing dams in 2019 will total about $70 million, the company said, representing a 180 percent increase from 2015.

2019-02-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s energy secretary said on Wednesday it is still possible to deploy the Wylfa nuclear power project in the 2030s if a financing model can be agreed. Last month, Japan’s Hitachi Ltd put its plans for a nuclear plant at Wylfa in Anglesey, Wales, on hold after it failed to find private investors. “It is still possible to deploy Wylfa in the 2030s if a financing model can be agreed,” Greg Clark told a parliamentary committee. The government is looking at the potential for a different funding model such as a regulated asset-based one which it will update on during the summer. “One of the reasons (nuclear plants) have proved difficult to finance is because there is an abundance of alternatives which are cheaper. Nuclear has a much longer lead time than any of those alternatives. There is no shortage of ability to replace that power,” Clark added.

2019-02-06,"OSLO/LONDON (Reuters) - Equinor on Wednesday reported a smaller-than-expected rise in fourth-quarter earnings and said output would be stagnant in 2019, sending the oil and gas company’s shares down despite a dividend increase and a brighter long-term outlook. A fall in oil prices, higher exploration spending, plus lower fourth-quarter refinery and products trading margins affected Equinor’s earnings negatively, the company said. Equinor expects production in 2019 to remain broadly unchanged from last year’s record output, despite plans to start its Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea in November as planned, it added. Latest results from rivals Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, BP and Chevron have all beat forecasts, buoyed by higher production in U.S. shale basins, even though crude oil prices fell sharply at the end of the year. Equinor’s Oslo-listed shares were 1.6 percent lower by 1130 GMT, the worst performing stock in the European oil and gas index, which was up 0.1 percent. “Shares are down on weaker fourth-quarter figures and disappointing production guidance for 2019, which we expected to be higher,” Teodor Sveen-Nilsen at Sparebank 1 Markets said. “On the positive side, dividends were higher than expected and there was also a stronger long-term (production) guidance,” he said. Equinor’s adjusted earnings before interest and tax rose to $4.39 billion for the October-December quarter from $3.96 billion during the same period of 2017, lagging a forecast of $4.8 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.  Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, said it planned to pay a dividend of $0.26 per share for the fourth quarter, an increase from the $0.23 paid in recent quarters. Analysts had expected an unchanged dividend. The company said it expected to generate a total of $14 billion free cash flow over 2019-2021 at an oil price of $70 a barrel, indicating a potential to raise dividends going forward. CEO Eldar Saetre told Reuters Equinor would use its cash to boost its dividends further, reinvest in capital expenditure and strengthen its balance sheet. “We want to grow the dividend policy,” Saetre said in an interview, adding that there were no plans for share buybacks for now, though it remained a tool of the company’s dividend policy.  “The priority is cash dividend,” he said. Equinor said it expected production to rise at an average 3 percent per year from 2019 to 2025, with new fields coming on stream off Norway and Brazil, an increasingly important  production area for Equinor. Its Carcara discovery in Brazil, which is estimated to hold similar resources as Johan Sverdrup, could start production in 2023-2024, the company’s presentation showed. Equinor’s production in the last quarter of 2018 rose to a record high of 2.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day from 2.1 million boe a year ago, helped by its onshore U.S. shale oil fields, the company said. Equinor said it planned to raise its capital expenditure to $11 billion this year from $9.9 billion in 2018. It also planned to increase its exploration budget to $1.7 billion in 2019 from $1.4 billion last year. So far there were no signs of cost inflation that could affect the firm’s capital expenditure guidance, Saetre said.  Rising costs in an oil company’s supply chain is a common feature of previous upturns in the oil industry activity cycle, eating into profits. “We don’t see this coming in into our numbers,” Saetre told Reuters.

2019-02-06,"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Wednesday it was lowering the price of its Model 3 sedan for the second time this year, moves that come in the wake of Tesla losing a tax credit that made its cars more affordable for U.S. buyers. The company is ramping up production of the Model 3 and trying to make it more accessible for mainstream car buyers. Tesla has also been cutting costs as it looks to turn in profits this year. A U.S. federal tax credit began phasing out for Tesla in January, effectively raising the price of cars by $3,750. Tesla said on Tuesday it had cut the Model 3 price by $1,100, following a cut of as much as $2,000 in January. That leaves the starting price of a Model 3 at $42,900, still substantially above the $35,000 price Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk originally promised. Musk told a Twitter user that the company is “doing everything we can” to drop the Model 3 base price to $35,000, without credits. “It’s a super hard grind,” he wrote. The billionaire in the past few months has been pushing for cost-cutting initiatives, like cutting jobs and ending a customer referral program. Tesla said in a statement that ending the costly referral program allowed it to cut the Model 3 price. The referral program that ended at the beginning of February gave new buyers six months of free charging and prizes for existing owners such as launching personal photos into deep space or invites to a Tesla event. Tesla delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter. The Palo Alto, California-based company’s share were down 0.45 percent at $319.89 in premarket trading on Wednesday.

2019-02-06,"FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - Uniper said on Wednesday nothing was off limits in fresh talks with Finland’s Fortum, its top shareholder, renewing investor hopes for a full takeover of the 9.7 billion euro ($11.1 billion) German energy group. The comments seem to break a deadlock between the two groups ever since Fortum bought a 47 percent stake in Uniper from E.ON last year in a deal that included a full takeover bid and was seen as hostile by Uniper’s management. Fortum last week said it had raised its stake to 49.99 percent, the maximum it is allowed to own after Russian authorities capped its ownership of Uniper at 50 percent due to a water license its Russian unit Unipro holds. Uniper said late on Tuesday that its chief executive and finance chief, who both openly opposed Fortum’s takeover plan, would step down in August, adding the group’s remaining board members would soon start talks with Fortum in a working group. “The outcome is completely open,” Uniper Chairman Bernhard Reutersberg told analysts on a conference call, adding talks were not expected to produce substantial results before Uniper’s annual general meeting scheduled for May 22. Reutersberg said the aim of the talks, in which Uniper will be represented by Chief Commercial Officer Keith Martin and Chief Operating Officer Eckhardt Ruemmler, was to determine how a partnership between the groups could add value. “This revives takeover speculation. A Fortum-friendly management could pave the way for a complete takeover and should try to find a solution for the current Russian blockade,” said a Frankfurt-based trader. JP Morgan analysts were more cautious. “We would caution investors who may think that this is a sign of Fortum getting close to reaching domination agreement any sooner,” they said in a note. Shares in Uniper, which are up 16 percent year-to-date, rose as much as 3.2 percent and were 0.3 percent higher at 1107 GMT. Uniper CEO Klaus Schaefer, who has been undergoing cancer treatment since last summer, said he could not devote the required energy to working out a cooperation deal with Fortum due to his illness. Sources told Reuters in December that Fortum held talks with activist fund Elliott, Uniper’s second-largest shareholder with a 17.84 percent stake, over how to gain control of the German firm. Elliott may raise its stake further, a person familiar with the matter said, a move that would make it harder for Fortum to gain full control without paying up. “It is in the interest of everybody that we rapidly advance now to create value for the stakeholders of both companies,” Fortum CEO Pekka Lundmark said.

2019-02-06,"* API reports increase in U.S. crude inventories * Concern about impact of Venezuelan sanctions eases * U.S., Chinese officials to hold trade talks next week (Adds analyst quotes in 3rd, 13th paragraph) By Alex Lawler LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Oil fell below $62 a barrel on Wednesday after a report showed a rise in U.S. crude inventories, while concerns about the impact on global supplies of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela faded. U.S. crude inventories rose by 2.5 million barrels last week, according to industry group the American Petroleum Institute, and gasoline stocks also increased. The government’s official supply report due later on Wednesday. “The fact that U.S. crude oil and gasoline stocks rose more sharply than expected, as reported by the API after close of trading yesterday, is weighing on prices,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank. Brent crude, the global benchmark, slipped 49 cents to $61.49 a barrel as of 1053 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was down 55 cents at $53.11. The U.S. announced sanctions on Venezuela’s state oil company last week, a move which could further curb supplies, although the development has yet to result in steep price gains. . “It would seem that the market is really not too worried yet about the potential loss of Venezuelan barrels,” said analysts at JBC Energy in a report. “This is either because the market assumes that the size of the impact will not be large, or at least it will be of short enough duration.” Worries about weaker global economic growth and the trade dispute between the United States and China have also weighed on the market. Oil fell on Tuesday after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. In his State of the Union address, U.S. President Donald Trump said a trade deal was possible with China. Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks next week. Supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, have been supporting prices. Venezuela, an OPEC member, is like Iran and Libya exempt from making voluntary curbs under the deal. The producers known as OPEC+ began cutting production from last month to avert a new supply glut and OPEC has delivered almost three-quarters of its pledged cutback already, according to a Reuters survey. Fritsch of Commerzbank said the Venezuelan issue could still drive oil higher. “The price has yet to react in any noticeable way,” he said. “That said, if the other OPEC countries fail to offset this outage, the oil market could quickly become undersupplied, driving the price up.” (Additional reporting by Colin Packham Editing by Edmund Blair and Jane Merriman)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-3-oil-falls-below-62-on-u-s-inventories-fading-venezuela-concerns-idUKL3N2010BW,06 Feb 2019,"* U.S., Chinese officials to hold trade talks next week

2019-02-06,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Virginia Furness LONDON, Feb 6 (Reuters) - The Australian dollar nosedived after its central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut in a remarkable shift from its long-standing tightening bias, a further indication of global economic slowdown. The policy shift caught some investors off-guard as only just the previous day the RBA had steered clear of an easing signal when holding its official cash rate at a record low 1.50 percent for the 30th straight month. The Australian dollar plunged 1.5 percent overnight and was set for its biggest daily drop in a year. Elias Haddad, rates and FX strategist, at Commonwealth Bank of Australia said that while there was a risk the Aussie dollar could test $0.70, a more pronounced downward move was unlikely. “As a bank we have pushed out our call for a 25 basis point rate hike by one year to November 2020 from November 2019,” he said. Australia’s central bank is the latest to signal policy easing in the face of global economic headwinds. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, citing slowing global growth as a risk to the world’s top economy. The European Central Bank has also sounded less certain that it will start tightening later this year. Donald Trump’s combative State of the Union address added to the gloom on markets as the U.S. president unveiled no new infrastructure initiatives and instead raised the prospect of another shutdown should financing not be forthcoming for the wall on the U.S.-Mexico border he wants to build. As such the dollar settled near a two-week high. In the annual speech outlining his priorities for the coming year, Trump said illegal immigration was a national crisis and reiterated his vow to build the border wall. Futures trading indicated a weaker open to the U.S. stock markets with the S&P down 0.16 percent, and Nasqad down 0.07 percent. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was last down 0.07 percent at around 0900 GMT. European stocks markets opened slightly in negative territory as a fresh new batch of earnings failed to lift spirits after Trump’s address touched on trade and budget issues but provided investors with few insights. Banks were the biggest drag on the STOXX 600, with shares BNP Paribas down 1.6 percent after France’s largest-listed lender lowered its profit and revenue growth targets for 2020 after a tough fourth quarter. Germany’s DAX opened 0.2 percent lower, France’s CAC 40 was down 0.4 percent and Spain’s IBEX fell 0.1 percent. The euro zone blue chip index fell 0.3 percent. Further weak data from Europe prompted demand for core euro zone bond yields as investors pushed back expectations that the European Central Bank will hold back from rate hikes. German industrial orders fell unexpectedly on weak foreign demand in December, data showed on Wednesday, a further sign that companies in Europe’s largest economy are struggling with a slowing world economy and trade disputes. Investors will also be looking to the European Commission’s winter macroeconomic forecasts, due to be published on Wednesday or Thursday. Large downward revisions to growth and inflation are likely, according to analysts at Societe Generale. “The EC forecast will give a pretty good guideline of how much the ECB will revise their own economic forecasts,” said CBA’s Haddad. German 10-year government bond yields, the benchmark for the region opened one basis point lower on Wednesday at 0.16 percent, well off the 0.21 percent highs hit on Tuesday . Italian debt was in focus with the Treasury planning to sell a 30-year bond via a syndicate of banks. Italian 30-year government bond yields jumped to three-week highs at 3.678 percent as investors sold bonds to make way for the new issue . Sterling meanwhile was a shade lower at $1.2930 after losing nearly 0.7 percent on Tuesday on weak Purchasing Managers Index data for Britain and uncertainty about Brexit talks. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May will travel to Brussels on Thursday to tell EU leaders they must accept legally binding changes to the Irish border arrangements of Britain’s divorce deal or face a disorderly no-deal Brexit.

2019-02-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - The deadline for the United States and China to reach a trade deal before U.S. tariffs increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports (scheduled for March 2) is the most important date in the calendar for oil traders. The deadline will probably have more impact than the next OPEC+ joint ministerial monitoring committee (March 18), OPEC’s extraordinary meeting (April 17-18) or even the White House review of Iran sanctions waivers (May 4). The outcome of trade talks will have a decisive influence on the oil consumption outlook for the rest of the year since the threat of tariffs and associated uncertainty are proving the largest drag on global economic growth. Because the trade deadline comes first, the outturn will shape the subsequent strategic choices made by OPEC and its allies over oil production and the White House on how far to toughen Iran sanctions. Uncertainty about the outlook for global trade has already pushed the world economy close to the brink of recession, judging by a range of business surveys and statistics on trade volumes. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TyUPrn) China’s manufacturers reported a fall in business activity in December and January, and the official purchasing managers’ index has fallen to its lowest level for three years. Global manufacturers have reported declining export orders for five months now, according to the new export orders component of the JPMorgan Global PMI, with new business falling at the fastest rate since 2016. Freight flows through Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub, are also falling at the fastest rate since 2016, according to government statistics. The only significant exception to the global slowdown has been the United States itself, where manufacturers report a continued widespread upturn, albeit more slowly than the frenzied rates in late 2017 and early 2018. In the rest of the world, the slowdown has taken a toll on current and prospective oil consumption growth, pushing the global market towards surplus and causing prices to fall sharply in the fourth quarter. The biggest impact of the slowdown is being felt in the consumption of middle distillates such as diesel and jet fuel used in trucking, shipping, railroads and airlines as well as by manufacturers, miners and farmers. Given distillate’s predominant use in freight transport and industry, distillate consumption and prices have been closely correlated with the business cycle at U.S. and global levels in the last 50 years. If the economy slides into an extended slowdown, or worse an outright recession, distillate prices will come under renewed pressure and take crude prices down with them. The global economy has been battered by a series of negative shocks in the last six to 12 months, including the stalled Brexit negotiations, rising U.S. interest rates, an appreciating U.S. dollar, and sharp falls in world equity markets. But the largest source of uncertainty stems from the deteriorating trading relationship between the United States and China, which is spilling over to both countries’ trading networks. The resolution of U.S.-China tensions will therefore have more impact on the global economic outlook and oil consumption than any other single factor in 2019. Of all possible outcomes, four are the most likely: (1) Comprehensive agreement settling all or nearly all outstanding issues between the two countries; (2) Limited agreement settling some issues but leaving more difficult items to be dealt with later (risking recurrent tensions); (3) No deal but with an agreement to postpone the tariff deadline while the two sides continue negotiating (risking recurrent tensions); (4) No deal, with an immediate imposition of U.S. tariffs on China’s exports. A comprehensive agreement on all issues would be the most positive result and could lead to a major boost in business confidence, but because some issues are so difficult, it is also probably the least likely of those four possible outcomes. At the other end of the spectrum, no deal and immediate imposition of tariffs would be the most negative outcome and the resulting shock to confidence and markets would make a recession very likely. The risks of no deal give policymakers in China and the United States a powerful incentive to compromise – provided they can save face and present any accord in a favourable light to domestic audiences. The intermediate outcomes of a limited accord or continued negotiations would avoid the worst recession risks but do little to rekindle business confidence, so have little impact on the trajectory of the economy. Comprehensive agreement is obviously more positive for oil consumption, while no deal would pose the greatest risk for oil demand. Comprehensive agreement would allow the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to contemplate relaxing their output curbs but might make the White House hesitate about toughening sanctions on Iran. By contrast, no deal would probably force OPEC and its allies to consider even deeper production cuts but also give the White House more scope to reduce or eliminate sanctions waivers for Iran’s crude customers. OPEC and its allies will need a clear idea of the White House’s approach to Iran before they make any decision about adjusting output to avoid repeating the miscommunication that dogged the last U.S. sanctions deadline in October-November 2018. The White House will therefore come under pressure to make its position on Iran sanctions clear before the OPEC+ meeting in mid-April to avoid further oil price volatility. The imposition of U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA to deny financial support to the Maduro government and force a transfer of power to the opposition has further complicated the outlook. The scope of the sanctions remains unclear (intentionally) but they appear to include primary sanctions on U.S. buyers of Venezuelan oil and secondary sanctions on third-country firms doing business with PDVSA. If the sanctions are sustained for any length of time, they will probably remove several hundred thousand barrels per day of crude from the global market, which would tighten the production-consumption balance significantly. But the lack of much price response so far suggests most traders expect the showdown between the United States and the Maduro government to be resolved relatively quickly. The abrupt and aggressive escalation of the crisis has engaged the full political and diplomatic credibility of the White House and the United States in forcing a swift transition of power. The United States has pushed the crisis so far it would be very difficult to back down now and allow the Maduro government to remain in place. Most traders seem to be betting the standoff will end quickly with the replacement of the Maduro administration and a resumption of Venezuela’s exports (or alternatively exports will be allowed to resume to third countries). If the standoff lasts longer and third-country exports remain sanctioned, crude prices will eventually have to rise unless OPEC makes up the difference. While Venezuela remains an immediate concern, the outlook for oil prices in the rest of the year will be dominated by what happens in trade talks between the United States and China in the next three weeks.

OMV, which has been on a shopping spree in recent months to expand in Asia and the Middle East, will propose a dividend of 1.75 euros per share, up from last year’s 1.50 euros, it said on Wednesday after joining rivals BP, Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron in reporting stronger than forecast earnings.. The group is shifting its focus more towards gas exploration and refining as a less polluting alternative to oil. Its purchases included upstream assets in New Zealand, Malaysia and the UAE. Having bought refining and petrochemical assets from Abu Dhabi National Oil Company for $2.5 billion nearly two weeks ago, OMV said it does not plan any further big acquisitions but will now focus on integrating its new assets. OMV said its upstream production is forecast to rise to about 500,000 barrel of oil equivalent (boe) per day in 2019, against 427,000 boe per day last year. The company expects 2019 Brent oil prices to average around $65 a barrel, down from $71 last year, and predicts a drop in average gas spot prices. Clean current cost of supplies (CCS) earnings before interest and tax, which exclude special items and inventory gains or losses, came in at 1.053 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in the fourth quarter, beating analyst expectations of 974 million euros. Adjusted operating contribution from OMV’s exploration and production business, meanwhile, surged 68 percent to 578 million euros despite a sharp drop in crude prices towards year-end. OMV’s refining margin, the company’s earnings from turning crude oil into fuel and diesel, dropped to $5.24 a barrel from $5.69 in the third quarter. “Increased crude prices resulted in higher feedstock costs, negatively impacting the indicator refining margin,” the group said in a statement, adding that it expects the refining indicator to be about $5 a barrel this year.

2019-02-06,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian oil company Aker BP posted a smaller-than-expected increase in fourth-quarter earnings due to higher production costs and lower oil prices, but raised its dividend.  The company said on Wednesday earnings before interest and taxes rose to $403 million  (£311.2 million) from $305 million (£235.5 million) in the same quarter a year earlier, lagging the $491 million expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. The Oslo-listed firm’s shares opened down 2 percent, lagging a 0.5 percent fall in the European oil and gas index.   “Revenues were impacted by low oil prices at the end of the quarter,” Aker BP said in a statement. The company said production costs rose to $13 a barrel in the last quarter, partly due to its increased stakes in the Valhall and Hod fields and higher maintenance during the year. Full-year production costs were $12.1 a barrel, in line with  previous guidance. Aker BP forecast these expenses would rise slightly in 2019 due to maintenance and modifications, especially at the Valhall and Ula fields. The company, 30 percent owned by BP Plc, also said it would pay a quarterly dividend of $0.5207 per share amid strong cash generation from output growth. This was more than the $0.38 anticipated by analysts. The increase came after the company said in January it would boost dividend payments between now and 2023, amounting to a total of $750 million in 2019 and up from $450 million a year earlier. In total, the company’s so-called contingent oil and gas resources in discoveries grew by 23 percent in 2018 due to new acquisitions. Aker BP, created in 2016 from the merger of Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke’s oil firm Det norske and the Norwegian arm of BP, has grown rapidly to become the second-largest licence holder on the Norwegian continental shelf. The company previously reported fourth-quarter production of 155,700 barrels of oil equivalents (boe) per day, up from 135,600 boe per day in the same period in 2017.

2019-02-06,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras paid a symbolic visit to Istanbul’s former cathedral Hagia Sophia on Wednesday on a trip aimed at improving ties with Turkey, long strained by disputes over territory, energy exploration and Cyprus. Tsipras met Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara on Tuesday, where the Turkish president said he expected more cooperation from Athens in the repatriation of eight soldiers who fled to Greece following an attempted coup in 2016. Tsipras told their joint news conference that Greece does not welcome putschists, but that the case of the eight soldiers was a matter for the judiciary. He said both countries had agreed to de-escalate tensions in the Aegean Sea and proceed with confidence building measures. Differences with Turkey “can and must be solved with dialogue,” he added. Erdogan spokesman Ibrahim Kalin accompanied Tsipras on his tour of Hagia Sophia, which was the foremost cathedral in Christendom for 900 years and one of Islam’s greatest mosques for another 500 years. It has been a museum since 1935. Tsipras will later visit an island near Istanbul to attend mass at the Orthodox Halki theological school, a centre of scholarship until it was closed by the Turkish state in 1971. Turkey’s refusal to reopen it is another bone of contention. He will also meet Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of Orthodox Christians worldwide, and representatives of the Greek community in Istanbul. Another source of tensions between the Aegean neighbours is the divided island of Cyprus, split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. U.N.-led peace talks between the Greek and Turkish sides collapsed in 2017. NATO members Greece and Turkey were nearly drawn into a military clash as recently as 1996 over an uninhabited Aegean islet. On Tuesday, Turkey updated a list of former military officers wanted for their alleged role in the 2016 failed putsch to include the eight officers granted asylum in Greece, and offered a bounty of 4 million Turkish lira ($770,446) for each of them.

2019-02-06,"WOLFSBURG, Germany (Reuters) - If Volkswagen realizes its ambition of becoming the global leader in electric cars, it will be thanks to a radical and risky bet born out of the biggest calamity in its history. The German giant has staked its future, to the tune of 80 billion euros ($91 billion), on being able to profitably mass-produce electric vehicles - a feat no carmaker has come close to achieving. So far mainstream automakers’ electric plans have had one main goal: to protect profits gleaned from high-margin conventional cars by adding enough zero-emission vehicles to their fleet to meet clean-air rules. Customers have meanwhile largely shunned electric vehicles because they are too expensive, can be inconvenient to charge and lack range.  The biggest strategy shift in Volkswagen’s 80 years has its roots in a weekend crisis meeting at the Rothehof guesthouse in Wolfsburg on October 10, 2015, senior executives told Reuters.  At the meeting hosted by then VW brand chief Herbert Diess, nine top managers gathered on a cloudy Saturday afternoon to discuss the way forward after regulators blew the whistle on the company’s emissions cheating, a scandal that cost it more than 27 billion euros in fines and tainted its name.    “It was an intense discussion, so was the realization that this could be an opportunity, if we jump far enough,” said Juergen Stackmann, VW brand’s board member for sales. “It was an initial planning session to do more than just play with the idea of electric cars,” he told Reuters. “We asked ourselves: what is our vision for the future of the brand? Everything that you see today is connected to this.” Just three days after the Rothehof meeting of the VW brand’s management board, Volkswagen announced plans to develop an electric vehicle platform, codenamed MEB, paving the way for mass production of an affordable electric car.  For months after the Volkswagen scandal blew up in 2015, rival carmakers treated diesel-cheating as a “VW issue”, according to industry experts. But regulators have since uncovered excessive emissions across the sector and unleashed a clampdown that undermines the business case for combustion engines, forcing a sector-wide rethink.   Now the “villain” of dieselgate is likely to become the largest producer of electric cars in the world in coming years, analysts say, putting it in pole position to flood the market - should the demand materialize.    “Decisions to convert the Emden factory (in Lower Saxony) to build electric cars, would never have happened without this Saturday meeting,” said Stackmann, one of five senior VW executives who spoke to Reuters. However the full scale of VW’s ambitions were only revealed two months ago when it took the industry by surprise by pledging to spend 80 billion euros to develop electric vehicles and buy batteries, dwarfing the investment of rivals.  It plans to raise annual production of electric cars to 3 million by 2025, from 40,000 in 2018.  It’s a risky bet.  With regulators and lawmakers, rather than customers, dictating what kind of vehicles can hit the road, analysts at Deloitte say the industry could produce 14 million electric cars for which there is no consumer demand.  It’s also an all-or-nothing bet in the long run. VW, whose ID electric car will hit showrooms in 2020, has set a deadline for ending mass production of combustion engines. The final generation of gasoline and diesel engines will be developed by 2026. Arndt Ellinghorst, analyst at Evercore ISI, said betting on electric vehicles (EVs) could be risky because customers did not want to own cars dependent on street-charging facilities.  “What if people are still not ready to own EVs? Will adoption be the same in the U.S., Europe and China?” he said. But he added that EU and Chinese emissions regulations made electric vehicle adoption inevitable and that being an early industry mover in that direction offered a “positive risk-reward”.  Another by-product of dieselgate that quickened VW’s electric drive, according to the senior executives, was a purge of the company’s old guard, who became the focus of public and political anger. This empowered Diess, a newcomer who had joined as VW brand boss shortly before U.S. regulators exposed the carmaker’s emission test cheating.  Diess, who joined from BMW where he helped pioneer a ground-breaking electric vehicle, has since been appointed CEO of Volkswagen Group, a multi-brand empire that includes Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Seat, Skoda, Lamborghini and Ducati.  Carmakers have failed to mass-produce electric cars profitably largely because of the prohibitive cost of battery packs which make up between 30 percent and 50 percent of the cost of an electric vehicle.   A 500 km-range battery costs around $20,000, compared with a gasoline engine that costs around $5,000. Add to that another $2,000 for the electric motor and inverter, and the gap is even wider. Even electric start-up Tesla’s cheapest car, the Model 3, is on sale in Germany at 55,400 euros, priced just below a base model Porsche Macan, a compact SUV. In the United States, Model 3 prices start at $35,950. VW believes its scale will give it an edge to build an electric vehicle costing no more than its current Golf model, about 20,000 euros, using its procurement clout as the world’s largest car and truck maker to drive down the cost. “We are Volkswagen, a brand for the people. For electric cars we need economies of scale. And VW, more than any other carmaker, can take advantage of this,” a senior Volkswagen executive told Reuters, declining to be named.  The carmaker’s electric-vehicle budget outstrips that of its closest competitor, Germany’s Daimler, which has committed $42 billion. General Motors, the No.1 U.S. automaker, has said it plans to spend a combined $8 billion on electric and self-driving vehicles. Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi said in late 2017 they would spend 10 billion euros by 2022 on developing electric and autonomous cars. “On a 2025 view, we expect Volkswagen to be the number one electric vehicles producer globally,” UBS analyst Patrick Hummel said. “Tesla is likely to remain a niche player.” VW’s test cheating using engine management software - “defeat devices” - resulted in the introduction of tougher pollution tests which revealed in 2016 and 2017 that emissions readings across the industry were up to 20 percent higher under real-world driving conditions compared with lab conditions. This has raised the bar on the auto sector’s efforts to cut emissions of carbon dioxide, blamed for causing global warming.  EU lawmakers in December agreed a cut in carbon dioxide emissions from cars of 37.5 percent by 2030 compared with 2021 levels. This was after the European Union forced a 40 percent cut in emissions between 2007 and 2021. “This goal is no longer reachable using combustion engines alone,” Volkmar Denner, chief executive of Bosch, the world’s biggest auto supplier, said about the 2030 proposals.  Every gram of excessive carbon dioxide pollution will be penalized with a 95 euros fine from this year onwards. Strategy firm PA Consulting forecasts VW will face a 1.4-billion-euro penalty for overstepping average limits in Europe by 2021, while Ford and Fiat-Chrysler face fines of 430 million euros and 700 million euros respectively. Daimler, BMW, PSA, Mazda and Hyundai will miss their 2021 average emissions targets, PA Consulting forecasts. Toyota, Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi, Volvo, Honda and Jaguar Land Rover are on track to meet their goals.  PA Consulting’s forecasts were extrapolated using 2017 registration data for each powertrain type and consumer buying trends, but do not include more recent sales trends.    Ford, VW and BMW said they would meet their targets because of a push to sell more hybrid and electric cars in 2018. Daimler said it aimed to meet the targets, PSA said it would respect the targets while Fiat-Chrysler declined to comment. Mazda had no immediate comment, while Hyundai did not respond to a request for comment. Carmakers have struggled to lower their average fleet emissions because of a shift in customer taste toward heavier, bigger SUVs (sports utility vehicles), which make it harder to maintain the same levels of acceleration and comfort without increasing fuel consumption and pollution.  SUVs are now the most popular vehicle category in Europe, commanding a market share of 34.6 percent, according to JATO Dynamics. Even Porsche, which makes lightweight sportscars, relies on sports utility vehicles for 61 percent of sales.  As the industry-wide scale of excessive emissions prompted Brussels to push through tougher laws late last year, VW executives concluded that purely electric cars were the most efficient way to meet carbon dioxide goals across its fleet.   This was the point of no return, according to executives, when the company made the final electric investment decisions and committed to staying the course it had plotted after dieselgate. “After evaluating alternatives, we opted for electromobility,” chief operating officer Ralf Brandstaetter told Reuters about VW’s deliberations in November.

2019-02-06,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - The response to the horrendous dam collapse at a mine owned by Brazil’s Vale has focused on iron ore prices and how a disaster that will likely claim more than 300 lives occurred, and what must be done to make sure this doesn’t happen again. These are valid concerns, but the risk of focusing on the immediate issues is that the much larger problems of the mining industry are once again glossed over. Namely that miners aren’t trusted and suffer from a serious image problem. It may seem somewhat trivial to talk about image in the face of such a human tragedy, but mining’s poor image across a range of stakeholders is the major issue for the industry. If mining has a poor safety and community image, it becomes “uninvestable”, to use the words of a senior global banker, talking at the 121 Mining Investment event in Cape Town this week, held under Chatham House rules. If investors don’t want to commit funds to the industry because of fear over damage to their own image from poor mining practices, then the industry will be starved of capital. Lack of capital means it becomes harder and harder to get new mines built or exploration drilling undertaken. There is also the risk of a cascade of negative outcomes for mining. If major banks and pension funds make it clear they are withdrawing from investing in mining companies, it’s likely share prices will suffer, leading other investors to withdraw funds, even if they don’t have quite the same moral qualms. It goes further than just losing sources of capital, with mining companies already struggling to attract younger workers. A common theme at the Investing in African Mining Indaba, a second event in Cape Town this week and one of the biggest such conferences worldwide, was a lament from company executives that members of the millennial generation - roughly in their early 20s to mid-30s - show little interest in mining, preferring more trendy industries, such as technology and digital solutions. The fact that mining is increasingly turning to digital applications and that mines of the future will bear little resemblance to current operations is not resonating with younger workers, largely because of the industry’s image, rather than its substance. Mining companies also have a global image problem, with many increasingly nationalistic governments wanting to extract more value from their mineral resources. Mining companies push back against higher royalties, or other forms of contribution such as underwriting new infrastructure, largely because they boost costs and cut profits. But by becoming unpopular in countries where they operate, longer term costs may be ultimately higher for mining companies. Mining runs the risk of suffering what happened to the oil industry, where international majors went from a dominant position to one where state companies produce the bulk of crude. The mining industry appears to be increasingly aware of its image problem, with speakers at both the 121 Mining and Mining Indaba events referring repeatedly to the concept of their “licence to operate”, a term that includes working with local communities, governments and consumers of their products. Miners are keen to brand themselves as part of the green energy revolution, since mining provides the metals and energy needed to make the renewable technologies that aim to replace the burning of fossil fuels. But the problem for miners is convincing an increasingly sceptical public of how necessary their industry is. Part of this is that the greener part of mining is still struggling to disassociate itself from the dirty part. In other words, lithium, cobalt and copper miners still get lumped alongside coal miners. Iron ore miners now are at risk of moving into the space occupied by coal, as public distrust and distaste will be ramped up after the tailings dam collapse at Vale’s Corrego do Feijao mine. The industry needs to do more than just recognise its image problems, it needs chief executives to make presenting and promoting a better picture their top priority, not just something they pay lip service to before handing off to junior, under-resourced public relations teams. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-mining-image/column-vale-disaster-makes-miners-image-problem-worse-russell-idUKL3N1ZZ3BT,06 Feb 2019,"The response to the horrendous

2019-02-06,"* Aussie sinks over 1 pct as RBA opens door to rate cut * Markets subdued after Trump’s State of the Union * Europe markets expected to open slightly lower * Sydney gains 0.3 pct, Nikkei rises 0.1 pct * Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Daniel Leussink and Wayne Cole TOKYO/SYDNEY, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares were subdued on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address failed to give markets fresh trading catalysts, while the Australian dollar nosedived after the central bank opened the door to a possible rate cut. Spread-betters expect London’s FTSE and Frankfurt’s DAX to respectively drop 0.2 percent and 0.1 percent when they open, while seeing a slightly larger fall for Paris’s CAC . MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed with China and several other markets in the region still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The range in which the index traded was limited to just 0.80 points, the narrowest since Dec. 25 last year. Australian shares gained 0.3 percent, rising for the third session, while Japan’s Nikkei closed up 0.1 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 last were a tad higher. The Australian dollar shed nearly 1.3 percent to hit a one week low of $0.71435, putting it on course for its biggest intraday drop in more than five months. The sharp selloff in the Aussie came after Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) Governor Philip Lowe said the bank remained optimistic about the local economic outlook but acknowledged rates might fall if unemployment were to rise and inflation stay too low. “Over the past year, the next-move-is-up scenarios were more likely than the next-move-is-down scenarios. Today, the probabilities appear to be more evenly balanced,” he said in a speech in Sydney. Chris Weston, Melbourne-based head of research at foreign exchange brokerage Pepperstone, said the comments show the RBA will react when it needs to though the bar to cutting rates continued to be quite high. “I think he (Lowe) has opened the door to a degree. A lot of people in the market do see the fragility that’s coming through in quite a lot of parts of the Australian economy,” he said. Trump vowed in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday to build a border wall that is a source of a deep partisan divide and said Democratic attempts at “ridiculous partisan investigations” could damage U.S. prosperity. Trump used part of his address to offer a spirit of compromise, particularly in areas such as lowering the price of prescription drugs and funding a $1 trillion upgrade in U.S. roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Some investors were hoping Trump would offer evidence of real, concrete progress in the U.S.-China trade negotiations, said Nick Twidale, chief operating officer at Rakuten Securities in Sydney. “The market had much more hopes that he would come up with something more concrete. We didn’t really get it,” Twidale said. “We got a lot of positive rhetoric — a lot of backslapping, or self-backslapping if you like. Because of that, we just had a really subdued reaction.” Senior U.S. and Chinese officials are poised to start another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal on American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, two people familiar with the plans said on Tuesday. Dow Jones reported earlier that the talks next week would be led by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, citing an unidentified senior administration official. Wall Street had already racked up gains courtesy of strong corporate results from Europe and the U.S., including a blockbuster from Estée Lauder Cos Inc. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.68 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.74 percent. Treasury bonds also bounced, helped by data showing a surprisingly soft U.S. service sector index of 56.7, with new orders falling to a one-year low. The Federal Reserve should leave interest rates where they are until the U.S. economic outlook is clearer, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Tuesday, a process that could take several more months. The dollar held up well thanks in part to a retreat in sterling, which hit a two-week low at $1.2923 in early trade after poor survey data and uncertainty about Brexit talks pushed it below a key market level. Sterling has come off about 2 percent from its 2019 high of $1.3218. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was firm at 96.110 and well above last week’s low of 95.162. It fell 0.2 percent on the yen to 109.76. The euro slipped to $1.1394 after a survey showed on Tuesday that euro zone businesses expanded at their slowest pace since mid-2013 at the start of the year. In commodity markets, the Wall Street Journal reported Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were proposing a formal partnership with a 10-nation group led by Russia to try to manage the global oil market, an alliance that could transform the cartel. U.S. crude futures edged up 7 cents to $53.73. Brent was also up 7 cents at $62.05. Spot gold was a shade lower at $1,314.30 per ounce, about 0.9 percent short of its recent peak at $1,326.30.

2019-02-06,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States supports “dictators, butchers and extremists” in the Middle East, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in a Twitter post Wednesday in a response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech. Tensions have ramped up between Iran and the United States since Trump pulled out of a multilateral nuclear deal last May and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic. “US hostility has led it to support dictators, butchers & extremists, who’ve only brought ruin to our region,” Zarif wrote in the Twitter post. Trump called Iran “the world’s leading state sponsor of terror” during his speech and said his administration had acted decisively to confront it, according to a video of the speech posted on the official White House website. “It is a radical regime. They do bad, bad things,” Trump said. “We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants ‘death to America’ and threatens genocide against the Jewish people.” Zarif responded by saying that Iran, including its Jewish community, was commemorating progress as it prepares to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution on Monday.  “Iranians—including our Jewish compatriots—are commemorating 40 yrs of progress despite US pressure, just as @realDonaldTrump again makes accusations against us @ #SOTU2019” Zarif wrote on Twitter, referring to the State of the Union address. Top Iranian officials, including President Hassan Rouhani, have said that the Islamic Republic is facing its toughest economic situation in 40 years, at least partially due to the U.S. sanctions.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday to build a border wall, which is a source of a deep partisan divide, and said Democratic attempts at “ridiculous partisan investigations” could damage U.S. prosperity. Trump spoke to a joint session of the U.S. Congress facing political discord over his demands that Democrats end their opposition to funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall he says is needed to stem illegal immigration and smuggled drugs. During his 82-minute speech, he outlined his political priorities without providing specific policy details. Trump called illegal immigration “an urgent national crisis,” but stopped short of declaring a border emergency that would allow him to bypass Congress for wall funding. Instead, he urged Democrats and Republicans to find a compromise by a Feb. 15 deadline. “In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall, but the proper wall never got built. I will get it built,” Trump said in the House of Representatives chamber, with his main Democratic adversary, new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, watching over his shoulder. Democrats call the wall a waste of money and ineffective. During the speech, Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal tweeted her opposition to the wall, saying: “The border is more secure than ever. Enough.” Trump warned, without offering evidence, that Democratic efforts to investigate his administration, along with the possibility of U.S. involvement in wars abroad, would endanger the U.S. economy. “An economic miracle is taking place in the United States  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations,” he said. His remarks came as Democrats who now control the House planned a series of probes into the Trump administration and his personal finances, while Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller investigates Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Russia denies meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Democratic Representative Val Demings called Trump’s remarks shameful and said the investigations would proceed. “We’re not going to stop,” she said. Apart from lauding economic accomplishments - unemployment near a five-decade low and manufacturing job growth among them - Trump’s speech was light on new initiatives to further stoke growth in an economy seen as losing momentum as it began 2019. Financial markets were largely subdued as Trump delivered his speech. “It was pablum, without specifics,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York.  Trump’s speech unfolded largely in a civil fashion with Cabinet members, military commanders and several Supreme Court justices in attendance at the annual presidential address to Congress. Many Democratic women lawmakers wore white to celebrate 100 years of women having gained the right to vote. Republicans cheered on the president, while Democrats grimaced or shook their heads but held their fire and applauded at non-partisan moments, such as when two Holocaust survivors were recognised. Despite a lack of concrete progress in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme, Trump said his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un would take place on Feb. 27 and 28 in Vietnam. It is expected to be either in Hanoi or Da Nang. From China to Venezuela to Afghanistan, Trump devoted a large section of his speech to foreign policy, saying a trade deal was possible with China if Beijing agrees to “real structural change.” The world’s two largest economies are in talks to try to hammer out an agreement to end a trade war. Trump hailed peace efforts unfolding between his administration and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan and said if a deal could be reached, it would allow him to bring some U.S. troops home after 17 years of war spawned by the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counterterrorism,” he said. He also hailed allied gains against Islamic State militants in Syria and reiterated his plan to withdraw U.S. troops from that war zone, despite comments earlier in the day from a top U.S. general, Joseph Votel, that a U.S. pullout could prompt a resurgence in the militancy. “Great nations do not fight endless wars,” said Trump, whose withdrawal plans are opposed by many congressional Republicans. Trump also denounced Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who the United States and a number of Latin American and European countries accuse of being an illegitimate leader after last year’s disputed election. Trump used part of his speech to offer a spirit of compromise, particularly in areas such as lowering the price of prescription drugs and funding a $1 trillion upgrade in U.S. roads, bridges and other infrastructure. But whether Trump and his opponents would follow through was far from clear, with both sides entrenched in long-held positions and girding for 2020 elections, reluctant to give the other side a political victory. Driving the two parties apart is Trump’s insistence on funding for the border wall. Pelosi, who frequently sat stony-faced through Trump’s address, has shown no sign of budging from her opposition to Trump’s wall-funding demand. The Republican president appeared in the House chamber just weeks after his demand for $5.7 billion in funding for the U.S.-Mexico wall triggered a historic 35-day partial government shutdown that more than half of Americans blamed him for, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. “Simply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let’s work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe,” Trump said. In the Democratic response to Trump’s speech, Stacey Abrams, who lost a race for governor of Georgia last November, said that while Democrats stood ready to secure the country’s ports and borders, “America is made stronger by the presence of immigrants – not walls.” For all of Trump’s talk about political unity, he could not resist denouncing liberal Democrats who have gained power in the House, best personified by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has proposed a 70 percent tax on the richest Americans. “We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country,” Trump said. As Trump spoke, Ocasio-Cortez could be seen smiling broadly.

The second price cut to the Model 3 this year now brings the cost of its least expensive variant to $42,900, according to the company's website here. Tesla’s customer referral incentive plan ended on Feb. 1 after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had tweeted that the referral program was “adding too much cost to the cars, especially Model 3”. Tesla delivered fewer-than-expected Model 3 sedans in the fourth quarter and cut prices for all its vehicles in the United States to offset a reduction in a green tax credit.

2019-02-06,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Independence Group, an Australian miner looking to move into making chemicals used in electric vehicle batteries, on Wednesday said it was in talks with a range of potential buyers of those products.         The mid-tier miner trialled production of battery chemical nickel sulphate in December and January, said Chief Executive Peter Bradford, and is now set to send samples to potential customers and partners.   That comes as the firm, capitalised at A$2.7 billion (£1.5 billion), considers building a chemicals plant in the state of Western Australia, with Bradford saying it would update the market on those plans in April. Australia is a major supplier of materials for the battery industry, tapping a boom in demand for electric vehicles. “(Now) we can go out ... and then shortlist who may be preferred partners,” Bradford told Reuters in an interview. Those partners could include companies that offer expertise in chemicals processing, as well as firms that commit to buy supply in return for upfront capital through offtake agreements. “We’ve had since we started this work, some unsolicited interest coming in the front door,” Bradford said.  “As that’s come in, we have engaged with those people. In a number of those instances, we have engaged in ... confidentiality agreements.” That comes as global miner BHP Group this year expects to bring online a 22,000-tonne a year nickel sulphate plant in Western Australia.  But such projects will face increasing competition from Indonesia, where plans for three large-scale nickel chemicals projects were announced in the last quarter of 2018. Analysts speculate that Indonesia may win more market share given its closer proximity to Asia’s battery hubs and as technological developments and sheer volume bring down costs. However, Bradford said he had not seen any dip in interest over the past few months.  Independence Group produced 14,428 tonne of nickel in the first-half of the financial year that began in July, around a third of BHP’s production in the same period.

2019-02-06,"WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will give his annual State of the Union speech on Tuesday, in which he will outline his administration’s priorities for the coming year in front of both congressional chambers and their guests. Below are excerpts from his speech, as prepared for delivery: “The agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda.  It is the agenda of the American people.” “In the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see.  Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this Great American Adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century.” “Together, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America’s future.  The decision is ours to make.” “Over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.” “We have unleashed a revolution in American Energy – the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world.” “After 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day.” “Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path ... Alice’s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing – and the need to remedy this injustice.” “We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens.” “No issue better illustrates the divide between America’s working class and America’s political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.” “All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before.” “To build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount: reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.” “Both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America’s crumbling infrastructure.” “It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place.  This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.” “We stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom.” “As a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.” “We will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants Death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish People.” (Reporting by Makini Brice Editing by Sonya Hepinstall)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-excerpts/trump-to-repeat-previous-calls-to-action-in-state-of-the-union-speech-excerpts-idUKL1N20101Q,06 Feb 2019,"U.S. President Donald Trump

It was then that she and Kohler brothers, Ryan and Matthew, had a “light-bulb moment”. “Instead of trying to solve the problem by cleaning the beaches every day, let’s go to what the source of the problem is, and take the plastic bottle away,” said Kerrigan, now 31. In 2016, the trio founded startup company Generation Water, based on the Thai resort island of Phuket. They partnered with Marriott, the world’s largest hotel brand, in January 2017 to come up with a sustainable alternative to plastic bottles that would be commercially competitive and meet the needs of resorts and authorities. Two years on, the South African-born entrepreneurs explained the workings of a pilot water plant at the JW Marriott Phuket Resort & Spa on Mai Khao beach, next to slogans saying “Save Water Drink Air” and “Made 100% from the air”. Here, in the sweltering heat, two water generators suck in vapour from the air, which then condenses into water when it hits cold coils. The water drips into tanks, making 4,000 litres a day. It is filtered, minerals are added, and it is put into reusable glass bottles. These are placed into 445 guestrooms at the JW Marriott Phuket and neighbouring Renaissance Phuket Resort & Spa. The bottled water is also being trialled at two Marriott vacation clubs nearby. The move is part of a wider effort on the holiday island to cut down on plastic bottles, rife in the hospitality industry, and a major problem in Asia and its travel hotspots. In many parts of Asia, tap water is unsafe to drink, so hotel guests get complimentary water, mostly in plastic bottles. As much as 60 percent of the plastic found in the ocean comes from five Asian nations, including Thailand, according to U.S.-based non-profit group Ocean Conservancy. In 2017, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific organised a forum to encourage sustainable water management on resort islands. On Phuket, which is half the size of Hong Kong, more hotels are being built, and water is already in short supply. Trucks navigate crowded roads as resorts without their own catchment area bring in water from reservoirs. Phuket was the world’s 11th top city destination in 2017, with 11.6 million international arrivals, according to global research company Euromonitor International. To cope with the environmental impacts of this influx, nearly 70 hotels from the Phuket Hotels Association have pledged to cut plastic bottles and straws by the end of 2019. Since Marriott started producing its own water four months ago, it has stopped more than 100,000 plastic bottles from entering landfill or oceans, the chain says. It plans to expand the scheme to all Marriott resorts in southern Thailand, handing out 4 million glass bottles. Carsten Siebert, Marriott International’s director of operations for Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and Myanmar, said the company understood it had “a greater obligation to operate responsibly given our expanding global footprint”. The chain has a goal to reduce water consumption per occupied room by 20 percent between 2007 and 2020. ‘CLIMATE-POSITIVE’ The “water from air” technology uses 78 percent less energy than producing standard bottled water, has a lower carbon footprint, and is about a third cheaper, Generation Water says. “The good thing is that it starts to become financially affordable,” said Matthias Y. Sutter, general manager at JW Marriott Phuket. Nor does the system rely on pulling water from the ground, rivers or lakes. “We don’t have to invest in land to secure our own water,” said Kanokwan Homcha-aim, corporate social responsibility manager for the same Marriott hotel. Guests here have reacted positively since the bottled water was introduced in September, happy that “finally a big brand made a move”, she said. They also like the taste. Michael Lawson, a lawyer from Sydney sitting at the Sala Sawasdee lobby bar, said his children were “quite picky” about water. “But it’s very refreshing and they are fighting over it in the room,” he said. Downstairs in the Siam Deli, teenage student Jeremy Frydman from Melbourne said it was better than tap water at home. One challenge for Generation Water is explaining the science behind the technology. Many guests ask about air pollution, for example. But the water collected is clean to start with, and the technology still works if the air is polluted as only water condenses, not the air or its contaminants, said Ryan Kohler. And with human activities emitting more greenhouse gases, the atmosphere is warming up, causing more water to evaporate, which further heats the air in “a vicious circle”, he added. The water-from-air system helps reduce this vapour, said Kerrigan, adding that it has no impact on rainfall levels. Thailand’s food and drug administration approved Generation Water last August, and the company is now expanding. It is building a plant in Phuket, which will use solar energy to make “climate-positive” water, producing more than 20,000 litres of water per day by the end of the year. Nine Marriott resorts on Phuket are in the process of signing up, along with 30 other hotels. Generation Water is now eyeing the rest of Thailand, and is talking to hotels in Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Maldives, Kohler said. It also sells smaller water production units that can be used in homes, offices, classrooms and yachts. The company’s goal is to stop 1 billion 500 ml plastic bottles from entering landfill and the oceans every year by the end of 2021 - equal to supplying 3,000 hotels of 250 rooms. As for Marriott staff on Phuket, they have “no excuse now”, said Homcha-aim. Their birthday gift from the company will be a reusable tumbler, which they can fill up with ""water from the air"".

2019-02-06,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei nudges up 0.3 pct, most markets flat * President Trump gives state of the Union at 0200 GMT * Dollar firm as sterling takes a dive amid Brexit unease * OPEC seeks oil pact with Russia-led group - WSJ By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Asian shares started cautiously on Wednesday as investors waited to see if U.S. President Donald Trump drops any hints of progress on tariffs in his State of the Union speech. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat with China and several other markets in the region still closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.3 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 barely budged. Dow Jones reported on Tuesday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer plan to hold talks in Beijing early next week, citing an unidentified senior administration official. Trump was expected to challenge Democrats to approve funding for his long-sought border wall but stopped short of declaring a national emergency over it, at least for now. The speech starts at 2100 ET (0200 GMT). Investors are also interested in any detail on a long-touted plan for infrastructure spending, which has yet to get a single road or bridge built. “Trump is likely to tout progress on the trade front, though many key structural issues are likely still outstanding,” said Richard Franulovich, Westpac’s head of FX strategy. “An infrastructure plan is likely to be resuscitated again. A Democrat led-Congress will likely be more sympathetic, which would be a positive for risk appetite.” Wall Street had already racked up gains courtesy of strong corporate results from Europe and the U.S., including a blockbuster from Estée Lauder Cos Inc. The Dow ended Tuesday up 0.68 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 0.47 percent and the Nasdaq 0.74 percent. Treasury bonds also bounced, helped by data showing a surprisingly soft U.S. service sector index of 56.7, with new orders falling to a one-year low. The Federal Reserve should leave interest rates where they are until the U.S. economic outlook is clearer, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said on Tuesday, a process that could take several more months. The dollar held up well thanks in part to a retreat in sterling, which hit two-week lows at $1.2922 after poor survey data and uncertainty about Brexit talks pushed it below a key market level. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was firm at 96.064 and well above last week’s low of 95.162. It was steady on the yen at 109.94. The euro slipped to $1.1407 after a survey showed on Tuesday that euro zone businesses expanded at their slowest pace since mid-2013 at the start of the year. The Australian dollar was a rare gainer after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) sounded less dovish than speculators had wagered on at its first policy meeting of the year on Tuesday. Markets are now all ears for a speech by RBA Governor Philip Lowe at 0130 GMT. “The Bank could keep to its mantra of “the next move in cash rates is more likely to be up”, though not any time soon and presumably even further away,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at National Australia Bank. “However, increased downside risks both globally and domestically will likely mean the Governor will be less confident of this statement than was the case a few months ago.” In commodity markets, the Wall Street Journal reported Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies were proposing a formal partnership with a 10-nation group led by Russia to try to manage the global oil market, an alliance that could transform the cartel. U.S. crude futures rose 15 cents to $53.81 in early trade. Brent had ended Tuesday down 40 cents at $62.11. Spot gold held at $1,314.71 per ounce, short of its recent peak at $1,326.30.

2019-02-06,"SYDNEY, Feb 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher for the first time in three sessions on Wednesday, although concerns over the outlook for the global economy capped gains. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.76 per barrel at 2338 GMT, up 10 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. They closed down 1.7 percent on Tuesday. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 0.8 percent in the previous session. Global economic worries have weighed on market sentiment in recent days, offsetting support from signs that global supplies are tightening. With a nervous market, traders are focused on the U.S. State of the Union address by President Donald Trump at 0200 GMT. “Anything out of the State of the Union that hints at the U.S.-China deal not working out, or more anti-trade rhetoric would be a negative for energy prices as demand would be lower if global growth keeps being downgraded,” said Alfonso Esparza senior market analyst, OANDA. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have been viewed as supportive for prices by helping tighten global supplies. A flotilla loaded with Venezuelan oil has formed in the Gulf of Mexico, some holding cargoes bought ahead of the latest U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and others whose buyers are weighing who to pay. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed to production cuts effective from last month to beat back supply growth.
