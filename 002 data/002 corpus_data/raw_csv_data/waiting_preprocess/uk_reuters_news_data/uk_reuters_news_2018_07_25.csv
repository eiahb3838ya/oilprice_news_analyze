2018-07-25,"KILIFI, Kenya, July 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From a mile away, the roof of Mihingoni Primary School glitters in Kenya’s midday sun. The effect, though, comes not from the roof but from what is on it: a sparkling array of solar panels. Mihingoni is one of eight mostly off-grid primary schools in the southeastern coastal county of Kilifi that have been fitted with a solar array. The key task of the 800-watt panels is to power tablet computers that pupils use under the government’s strategy to integrate e-learning into primary education. Last year more than 1 million of the devices were distributed to primary school students across the country - among them Mihingoni’s pupils. But tablets require electricity, which many rural schools lack. Mihingoni primary is connected to the national grid, but power is expensive, and only its computer room has electricity, limiting charging of the devices. But “since the solar panels were fitted (in January), pupils can have access to their tablets any time, and the cost of power has considerably gone down,” said Kuchanja Karisa, headmaster of the school, about 35 kilometres (22 miles) north of the coastal city of Mombasa. In his impoverished area, he said, access to electricity boosts access to education, not least because the cost of power is factored into school fees. “Poverty levels in this area are high, and any slight increase or decrease in school fees affects school attendance,” he said. The panels are part of a project run by two British-based organisations to provide solar power to primary schools and clinics in remote, off-grid communities. The OVO Foundation - the charitable arm of a green-leaning energy firm - provides funding, while Energy 4 Impact, a charity that works on accelerating access to energy, does the installation. The need is great: thousands of Kenyan schools lack access to the national power grid. Figures from the education ministry show the country had 29,460 primary schools as of 2014, of which nearly 22,000 were state schools. As of last December, about 24,000 primary schools were connected to the grid, according to Simon Gicharu who chairs the government’s rural electrification program. A lack of power at unconnected schools, however, makes it difficult for students to take full advantage of tablets provided under the e-learning programme, Karisa said. At Mihingoni, for example, pupils unable to access the computer lab to charge their tablets - which have an eight-hour battery life - ended up using them less, the headmaster said. At the school, students previously paid 1,500 Kenyan shillings ($15) a year for electricity. But today, with the solar panels, there is a much lower fee - 500 shillings ($5), which goes to pay for more grid power in the rainy season when the solar panels work less effectively. Cutting costs “has seen a sharp increase in the number of students who have since joined the school”, Karisa said. In 2017, the school had about 50 pupils in each class, he said. Now it has 140, with the lower cost encouraging more parents to send their children to school. Annual fees at the school are about 700 shillings ($7) per primary school student, apart from the energy supplement. “Every coin counts for area locals,” Karisa said. Fifty kilometres north is Migodomani Primary School, which also had solar panels installed in January. Headmaster Ngala Kahindi Luwali told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that until the panels were available, his pupils had been unable to use tablets at all. “With the solar panels we have been able to catch up with other schools in urban areas that have already incorporated e-learning,” he said. “Pupils are enthusiastic with e-learning since it’s a new method of teaching.” The panels power not only the tablets, but projectors and a television - none of which the school previously had been able to use. The array also provides lighting to the school’s boarding facilities, where students once relied on costly and polluting paraffin lanterns. Gaby Sethi, who heads the OVO Foundation, said she believes providing access to clean electricity in parts of the world without power can help people get ahead. “We think we can have a significant impact on people and children’s lives if we’re electrifying schools and health clinics,” she said. Under the project, the panels and installation are free, with the schools paying for ongoing maintenance costs, Karisa said. Gabriel Katana, the county’s head of education and information and communications technology, said the local government wants to see solar panels installed to power hospitals and other social amenities too. “In the future we will ... purchase solar pumps to use in irrigating food to be grown in the schools to feed the pupils,” he said. The ambition is to use solar power for all of the county’s primary school needs - not just powering information technology, he said. Relying on solar panels has some drawbacks, however - including that they can be less effective in rainy and cold seasons, said Mihingoni Primary School’s Karisa. At those times, the school has to revert back to using kerosene for lighting and grid power for electricity, he said. Daniel Kuria, who manages Energy 4 Impact’s solar programme in Kenya, agreed there is a need for a solar array that generates sufficient power in the rainy season. Mihingoni primary will get an improved battery system to store solar power and help bridge the gap, he said. For now, the solar panels - and lower school fees as a result - are helping keep students in school, Karisa said. Parents ""can use the flimsiest of excuses to keep their children home, so it's important to have cheap, reliable energy, like solar, that will not expense the parents,"" he said.

2018-07-25,"* European stocks halt three-day worldwide equities rally * Markets focussed on Trump-Juncker trade meeting * Commodities bolstered by prospect of increased China demand * China yuan, Turkish lira steady in FX markets * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - A three-day stocks rally was threatening to stall on Wednesday, as markets waited for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission chief Jean Claude-Juncker to see where the global trade war was heading next. A flurry of disappointing U.S. earnings including from Boeing and General Motors was set to tug Wall Street off a five-month high too as profit taking on tech stocks and miners sapped Europe.. Focus had also returned to what may happen with tariffs after EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a Swedish newspaper on Wednesday that the bloc was preparing $20 billion of levies on U.S. goods if Washington imposes them on imported cars. A monthly survey of German business confidence also showed some impact from the row, although there was no major plunge and with China’s yuan having held up overnight too, traders in most markets seemed content to keep their positions steady. “We have seen a lot of complacency over this entire trade war so the question is, unless we see a very negative outcome (from the EU-U.S. meeting), are we going to see a marked reaction?” Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said. “It is an odd one where two key trade partners, but also two key allies, are now fighting each other.” With another blizzard of multinational corporate earnings, a European Central Bank meeting and U.S. GDP figures still to come this week, there was plenty of scope for volatility. Car giant General Motors fell 5.5 percent in pre-market trading after the automaker cut its 2018 earnings forecast, citing rising steel and aluminum costs due to U.S. tariffs. Air conditioner maker Ingersoll-Rand said tariffs would hurt its margins, while Indian motorcycle-maker Polaris Industries said it would have to absorb additional tariff and related commodity cost increases too. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was just off a two-week low at 94.506 and fractionally lower at $1.1692 against the euro and 111.07 yen. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which tends to act as the benchmark for global borrowing costs, eased to 2.937 percent as well, after climbing to a six-week peak of 2.973 percent overnight. Bond yields have been pushed up this week on speculation the Bank of Japan is edging closer to unwinding its aggressive stimulus programme. But with Thursday’s ECB meeting looming, most bond yields in the euro area also edged down on Wednesday. Britain’s pound nudged up to $1.3160 after UK Prime Minister Theresa May had said on Tuesday that she would now lead negotiations on the country’s departure from the European Union. Turkey’s lira also clawed higher having sunk more than 3 percent on Tuesday, after its central bank shied away from raising rates in what was seen as another hit to its shredded credibility. State Street Global Advisors currency portfolio manager Aaron Hurd said the worry is that President Tayyip Erdogan’s government will put pressure on the central bank to keep rates down, fuelling what is already double-digit inflation. “The new (finance) minister and the new cabinet in total is an unknown quantity and we have to wait and see and learn how to interpret their behaviours,” Hurd said. “That means an even higher risk premium priced into the currency.” The decline in China’s yuan paused for the time being also. The currency was a shade firmer at 6.797 per dollar having hit a 13-month low of 6.829 this week on signs that Beijing is grabbing for the stimulus levers again. The Shanghai Composite Index closed fractionally lower after brushing a one-month high and enjoying a roughly 3-percent surge this week. Tokyo’s Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.9 percent and, though South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.4 percent, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained 0.4 percent. Those moves came after Wall Street’s S&P 500 closed at its highest level since the start of February as Google’s blowout results bolstered what has already been a bumper U.S. earnings season. In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 0.4 percent at $73.86 a barrel, adding to the previous day’s gains as market focus shifted away from oversupply concerns to the possibility of increasing Chinese demand. Copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) traded down at $6,260 per tonne after soaring 2.7 percent overnight to a two-week peak of $6,328.00 on Chinese stimulus hopes. Iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange touched a two-month peak of 479.5 yuan a tonne, while precious metal gold was 0.6 percent higher at 1,231 an ounce. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-07-25,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical company Sibur is preparing for an initial public offering (IPO) potentially worth between $2 billion and $3 billion and which may happen by the end of the year, financial market sources told Reuters. Sibur, the largest petrochemical producer in Eastern Europe, has long mulled a share placement on the open market but faced delays for various reasons. One of three financial market sources familiar with Sibur’s plans said the company was looking at the possibility of an IPO in Moscow and London and may raise $2 billion to $3 billion. Another of the sources said the company was looking to raise “a couple of billion dollars” from the deal. Asked about a potential IPO, Sibur said in a written reply to Reuters that it was considering “strategic options” on how to finance its growth.   Businessman Leonid Mikhelson, the head of and a major shareholder in Russia’s largest gas producer Novatek, owns 48.5 percent of Sibur. His business partner Gennady Timchenko owns 17 percent, while China’s Sinopec and Silk Fund control 10 percent each. A source said Mikhelson may sell part of his stake, while Timchenko and another shareholder, Kirill Shamalov, both under U.S. sanctions, were likely to retain their shares. Shamalov owns 3.9 percent in Sibur. The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) does not block an entity if the ownership in the asset by the sanctioned persons is below 50 percent, it says on its website. The United States slapped sanctions on Timchenko in 2014 in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, describing him as a member of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. Shamalov, described by the U.S. Treasury as “Putin’s family associate”, was put on the sanctions list in April in connection with Ukraine, Syria and suspected cyber activities. A spokesman for Timchenko declined comment as did Sibur, which is not under Western sanctions as a company. Two of the three sources said JP Morgan and Russia’s Gazprombank are among possible arrangers of the Sibur IPO deal. JP Morgan declined to comment, and Gazprombank did not reply immediately to a request for comment. There was no final decision whether only existing shares would be involved or Sibur would issue new shares for the IPO as well, the sources said.  Sibur is constructing a petrochemical complex in western Siberia known as ZapSibNefteKhim, which will be one of the world’s five biggest petrochemical plants, part of a play by Russia to capture more of the value from the oil it produces. Another of its projects, a gas chemical complex in Russia’s far east, will require preliminary investments of up to $8 billion. Sibur is looking for Asian partners to share the risks for the latter.

2018-07-25,"SEKONG, Laos (Reuters) - Rescue teams from China and Thailand headed on Wednesday into a remote part of landlocked Laos, where more than 3,000 people were stranded after a dam collapse sent a deluge of water across a swathe of villages, domestic media said. The Vientiane Times, citing district Governor Bounhom Phommasane, said about 19 people had been “found dead”. While nearly 3,000 had been plucked to safety, more than that number were awaiting rescue, many on the rooftops of submerged homes. A senior Lao government official told Reuters by telephone from the capital, Vientiane, that dozens were feared dead after the failure of the dam - a subsidiary structure under construction as part of a hydroelectric project - on Monday. (Map locating the collapsed dam in Laos: tmsnrt.rs/2JLQY4F) “We will continue with rescue efforts today, but it’s very difficult, the conditions are very difficult. Dozens of people are dead. It could be higher,” said the official, who declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak to the media.  A United Nations report on the disaster put the death toll at five, with 34 missing, 1,494 evacuated and 11,777 people in 357 villages affected. It said 20 houses were destroyed and more than 223 houses and 14 bridges damaged by the flooding. However, a government official said hundreds were reported missing after at least seven villages were submerged in the Attapeu province, the southernmost part of the country. State media showed pictures of villagers, some with young children, stranded on roofs of submerged houses, and others  trying to board wooden boats. Experts said the remoteness of the affected area could hamper relief operations. “The roads are very poor,” Ian Baird, a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a Laos expert, told Reuters by telephone.  “People don’t usually go in that area during the rainy season. There are mountains nearby that villagers might be able to get up on ... I don’t think anybody really knows for sure.” State media said a joint team of Lao and Chinese rescuers would reach Attapeu on Wednesday afternoon, and it showed a long line of cars with boats on trailers heading into the country from northeast Thailand. South Korea and Singapore have also offered to help in the rescue effort.  Laos, one of the world’s few remaining communist states and one of Asia’s poorest countries, has ambitions to become the “battery of Asia” through the construction of multiple dams. Its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build the dams under commercial concessions that involve the export of electricity to more developed neighbors, including power-hungry Thailand. Rights groups have repeatedly warned against the human and environmental cost of the dam drive, including damage to the already fragile ecosystem of the region’s rivers. Attapeu is a largely agricultural province that borders Vietnam to the east and Cambodia to the south. The dam that collapsed was part of the $1.2 billion Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. Known as “Saddle Dam D”, it was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. The project’s main partner, South Korea’s SK Engineering & Construction, said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers. The firm blamed the collapse on heavy rain.  Laos and its neighbors are in the middle of the monsoon season that brings tropical storms and heavy rain. Lao state media also posted images of flash flooding, with buildings and roads under water, further north in Khammouane province. An official at SK Engineering & Construction said fractures were discovered on the dam on Sunday and the company ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon the danger became clear. Shares in major stakeholders of SK E&C fell on Wednesday. SK E&C’s biggest shareholder, SK Holdings Co Ltd (034730.KS), was down 6.2 percent in its biggest daily percentage loss since Feb. 11, 2016. The second-biggest shareholder, SK Discovery Co Ltd (006120.KS), slid as much as 10 percent.  Laos expert Baird said the collapse of the subsidiary dam was unlikely to affect others in the project. “The water’s all out of the reservoir now and the water levels are already going down but I don’t think they’ll be able to fix it until the dry season,” he said.  Hydropower dams on the Mekong River’s lower mainstream pose a serious threat to the region, International Rivers, which works to stop destructive hydropower projects in Laos, said in April.  Predicted impacts include a decrease of 30 to 40 percent in fisheries by 2040 as well as a drastic cut in food security and farm productivity, as well as greater poverty in much of the Lower Mekong Basin.  Laos has finished building 11 dams, says Thai non-government group TERRA, with 11 more under construction and dozens planned.

2018-07-25,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - United States threats to throttle Iran’s international oil trade can be easily answered, the head of the elite Revolutionary Guards said on Wednesday, according to the Tasnim news agency. U.S officials are stepping up diplomatic efforts to pressure countries to stop importing Iranian oil. “If the current capabilities of the Revolutionary Guards ... reaches the ears of the adventure-seeking president of America, he will never make this kind of mistake and will reach the understanding that an oil threat can be easily answered,” Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to the Tasnim agency. Jahari did mot specify how Iran might react to U.S. threats to its oil exports. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday backed President Hassan Rouhani’s suggestion that Iran might block Gulf oil exports if its own exports are stopped. U.S-Iranian relations have been particularly strained since U.S. President Donald Trump broke with European allies in May and announced that the United States was pulling out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.  Trump’s administration has also called on its allies to stop buying Iranian oil.

2018-07-25,"BRIDGETOWN, Barbados, July 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - With her foot down to show off the acceleration of the zippy electric car, Joanna Edghill spins around the car park before plugging the vehicle into a charging point beneath rows of solar panels converting Caribbean rays into power for the grid. In the five years since she and her husband started their company Megapower, it has sold 300 electric vehicles and set up 50 charging stations plus a handful of solar car-ports on the 21 mile-long (34 km) island of Barbados. They are now expanding elsewhere in the Caribbean. “The main factor with islands is we don’t have range anxiety. I can develop and roll out a charging network in Barbados where customers are never more than a few kilometres from a charging point,” said Edghill, who previously worked in international development. “We have at least 220 days of pure sunlight every year, so why not take advantage of the resources that we do have here?” Burdened by a costly dependence on imported fuel for energy, Barbados and many other Caribbean islands are considering boosting the number of electric vehicles on their roads. But they face barriers, including high initial costs, stiff import duties on electric vehicles and a lack of regulatory support, say people working in the sector. Globally, the number of electric vehicles topped 3 million in 2017, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), which predicts there will be 125 million in use by 2030. That figure could go as high as 220 million if action to meet global climate targets and other sustainability goals becomes more ambitious, says the IEA. More research, policies and incentives are needed to drive further uptake, it notes. In Barbados, the island’s electricity utility, government departments and private firms are among the customers buying the lefthand-drive electric cars and delivery vans Megapower imports from Britain, said Edghill. It has also built solar car-ports, which power charging points, for the Barbados arm of courier giant DHL and the government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Megapower’s other solar panels feed into the grid, offsetting the equivalent of the non-renewable power used by 400 electric cars. “The Caribbean is ripe for the electrification of transportation,” said Curtis Boodoo, assistant professor at the University of Trinidad and Tobago who also works on electric vehicles with the CARICOM regional group of 15 countries. “If you invest in electric vehicles, you are able to use your existing electrical infrastructure, and save the costs of the transportation fuel that you have to import.” Pumping fuel into electricity generation is two to three times more efficient than putting it directly into car engines, he said, meaning more electric vehicles on the roads could help shave the region’s hefty bills. For many Caribbean countries, over half the amount of fuel they import is used for transport. Barbados spent $300 million last year on fuel imports, government data shows. Crippled with public debt and dogged by rising oil prices, the island’s new government wants to make its bus network electric, and eventually switch all government transport too. Boodoo said increased state investment in electric buses would help upgrade transport systems, while cutting climate-changing emissions and paving the way for consumers to follow. Plug-in vehicles could also “piggy-back” on a push to inject more power into the grid from renewables like solar, wind and hydro, said Devon Gardner, CARICOM’s energy programme manager. Costs are high, however, and on some islands, import duties for electric vehicles are higher than on combustion-engine cars. Trinidad and Tobago has scrapped taxes and import duties for most electric cars, but taxes elsewhere can add up to 100 percent depending on the model. High purchase prices mean vehicles remain unaffordable for most Caribbean drivers. A Nissan Leaf electric car, for example, costs about $50,000 in Barbados, compared with $30,000 in Britain. Heavily indebted Caribbean countries are torn between collecting much-needed revenue from car imports and supporting the roll-out of private electric vehicles, said Gardner. “The Caribbean doesn’t have the luxury of using some of the levers of incentives that were used by the richer, more developed countries,” he said. Nonetheless, power utilities in the Bahamas, Turks and Caicos, and St. Lucia are starting to install charging networks, which could help the sector expand, said Megapower’s Edghill. “Privately owned utilities want people buying electricity, so every person that is plugging in is a person not buying gas or diesel, but buying their product,” she said. BATTERY BACK-UP John Felder, who founded Cayman Automotive, plans to open an office soon in Havana and anticipates a healthy market in Cuba for electric bikes and scooters which start at $800. Low import duties on electric vehicles in Cuba make them cheaper to buy, said Felder. He has sold about 60 electric cars in the Cayman Islands - which has cut import duties - and installed 15 charging stations he wants to convert to solar. “The eco-system is very fragile - there are no freeways where you can go 70, 80 miles per hour for hundreds of miles,” he said. “Electric vehicles are perfect for the Caribbean.” While fast-improving battery technology is making electric cars more attractive globally, on hurricane-prone Caribbean islands, emerging vehicle-to-grid technology could use power stored in batteries to keep the lights on if disaster strikes. Power stored in one electric bus could provide energy for up to 50 homes for a day, or power shelters and community centres if overhead electricity cables are knocked out, said Boodoo. Driving down prices might be key to kick-starting an electric car revolution. But some bet islands will gradually wake up to the benefits plug-in vehicles can bring by improving public transport and taming expensive diesel habits. ""I'd like to say that within five years, 10 percent of the (Barbados) population will be driving electric vehicles - I think that's realistic,"" said Edghill. (Reporting by Sophie Hares.

2018-07-25,"BENGHAZI, Libya, July 25 (Reuters) - A control station at Libya’s giant Sharara oilfield has resumed operation but foreign engineers who help operate the field have not returned yet due to security reasons, a field engineer said on Wednesday. Station 186 was shut down after two oilfield staff were abducted in an attack by an unknown group more than a week ago, forcing Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) to cut output. There was no current production figure available but the engineer said with the station coming back output would rise again. State-run NOC had previously said it expected output to drop by 160,000 barrels per day (bpd), although one engineer had said then output at the field, which had been producing 200,000-300,000 bpd recently, had already dropped to below 100,000 bpd. The attack happened at the control station on the outskirts of Sharara, about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away from the main part of the field. Tripoli-based NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor , formerly known as Statoil. The field, in Libya’s remote southwest, has suffered security problems in the past, including raids in which vehicles and mobile phones were stolen. In addition to being one of Libya’s main export grades, Sharara feeds the 120,000 bpd Zawiya oil refinery on the country’s northwest coast.

2018-07-25,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar is building a sugar refinery in a bid to avoid supply disruptions after neighboring Gulf Arab states severed economic and political ties with Doha more than a year ago, sources say. In normal trading conditions, building a refinery in Qatar would make little commercial sense because of depressed sugar prices, surplus world stocks and the presence of regional refineries that could provide supplies, the sources said. But they said Qatar, with its huge financial resources generated from gas exports and as host of the 2022 World Cup, wanted to avoid any shortfall for the desert nation that depends heavily on imports to feed its 2.7 million population. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt severed ties with Qatar in June 2017, accusing it of fomenting regional unrest, supporting terrorism and getting too close to Iran. Doha denies all the accusations. “This will strengthen our independence and by God’s will help break restrictions imposed on our economy. Now, more than ever, we must be able to support ourselves,” a senior Economy Ministry official told Reuters. He said the refinery would be near Hamad port, 40 km (25 miles) south of Doha, and would start up by the end of 2019 or early 2020. The official declined to provide further details. Two sources with knowledge of the initiative said the new refinery would have capacity to produce 110,000 tonnes of sugar a year, exceeding annual consumption estimated at 80,000 tonnes. The sources did not give a value for the project. A presentation by the Transport and Communications Ministry showed the planned plant would refine 300 tonnes of sugar a day, saying operations were expected to start by 2020.  Qatar previously relied on imports of white sugar from the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Once the boycott started, Qatar turned to supplies from India and other producers. Food prices rose after the boycott, with Saudi Arabia cutting off imports by closing Qatar’s only land border. A Middle East based trade source said the project did not make economic sense based on the investment needed to adapt Hamad port and the cost of packaging, which would need to be imported. Another regional trade source said the refinery was likely to bring in raw sugar from Brazil to be refined into white sugar. “This has to be viewed as a strategic project for Qatar,” the source said.

2018-07-25,"LONDON, July 25 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Solar panels and smart batteries could help cut electricity bills by almost half for people on the Isles of Scilly, a British energy storage provider said as it launched a renewable energy programme on the group of Cornish islands. The Smart Energy Islands project aims to slash climate-changing emissions, improve the power supply and lower costs for “fuel-poor” residents of five inhabited islands, 45 km (28 miles) off England’s southwest coast, energy firm Moixa said. The Isles of Scilly aim to generate 40 percent of their energy from renewable sources, and make 40 percent of vehicles driven there electric or low-carbon by 2025. A 55-km undersea cable is now the only connection between the Isles of Scilly and the UK’s national grid. Last year, islanders had to rely on diesel generators for almost two weeks after the cable was damaged by a fishing boat. The isles’ dependence on imported fuel has left many families with unreliable heating systems and expensive bills. Electricity costs per household are about 30 percent higher than in Cornwall, according to Moixa. Of the islands’ 2,200 residents, about 15.5 percent cannot afford to heat their homes, compared to roughly 11 percent across England, a government report said this year. The project, costing 10.8 million pounds ($14.2 million) and partly financed by the European Regional Development Fund, will install solar panels on more than 70 council houses, as well as smart water heaters and smart batteries in homes and businesses. The islands will cut planet-warming carbon emissions by nearly 900 tonnes per year once the solar panels are operating, according to Moixa. The combined technologies, due to be installed by this autumn, will provide islanders with a reliable electricity supply year-round, and could reduce their bills by as much as 40 percent, said Chris Wright, Moixa’s chief technology officer. The smart batteries put in by the company will store surplus power and release it when demand peaks, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “The system delivers flexibility and manages the load on the grid,” he said. The project, led by Hitachi Europe Ltd, offers a blueprint for other small islands and cities across Europe, Wright noted. “The Isles of Scilly are a small community but can be seen as a prototype city,” he said. The project is “a precursor for what energy systems might look like in a few years' time”, he added. ($1 = 0.7598 pounds) (Reporting by Isabelle Gerretsen. Editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-07-25,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Clariant’s (CLN.S) update on its ties with Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE is likely to be delayed, as antitrust approvals for the Saudi company’s 25 percent stake in the Swiss speciality chemical maker take longer than expected. SABIC’s move to become Clariant’s largest shareholder has prompted speculation that the Saudi company could increase its holding, but Clariant CEO Hariolf Kottmann said SABIC had no current plans to make a full bid. “If they change their position, they will let us know,” Kottmann said, adding any talk of such a deal was premature, especially before the two have had detailed talks.     Kottmann told Reuters on Wednesday after Clariant published first-half results that the timing of the strategy update with investors, planned for early September, was now uncertain. The Saudi chemicals company bought a quarter of Clariant in January, helping to resolve the Swiss company’s fight with activist investors who had blocked its planned merger with rival Huntsman (HUN.N). But the Swiss company cannot start in-depth talks with SABIC over their future, Kottmann said, until regulators in countries including Brazil and Mexico give their blessing to SABIC’s purchase of the stake.   “If we receive the antitrust clearance at the beginning of September...we need at least four, five, six weeks to continue the discussions we’ve had currently, to bring a bit more meat to the bone,” Kottmann said. He said lawyers from both sides have said there was no reason not to get the clearance, but the formal process is taking more time. Clariant shares were down 1.8 percent at 1055 GMT. SABIC’s purchase has triggered speculation about a full takeover of Clariant. “Clariant remains the top takeover candidate in the sector,” Baader Helvea analyst Markus Mayer said. But Kottmann said that SABIC had not changed its tone since January, when it said it had no current plans to launch a full takeover.  “From today’s point of view, it (a takeover) makes no sense, because I think now we are in a much earlier stage and phase of discussions where we have the obligation to find value-creating potentials for our shareholders,” Kottmann said.  Clariant’s first-half net income rose to 211 million Swiss francs ($212 million), up from 153 million francs a year ago. Sales rose 8 percent to 3.4 billion francs, from 3.1 billion francs in the same period in 2017 and ahead of analyst forecasts in a Reuters poll. Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts said a drop in profitability at Clariant’s natural resources business that supplies the oil and mining industries showed it was taking longer to recover than expected. The EBITDA margin at this business fell to 12.6 percent in the first half, down from 14.6 percent  Clariant Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said natural resources was one of the areas where the company’s business is slated to improve in the second half.

2018-07-25,"(Repeats without change) By Carolina Mandl and Alexandra Alper RIO DE JANEIRO, July 24 (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA has chosen to enter exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oilfields to a group backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, two people familiar with the matter said. Brazilian energy firm Ouro Preto Óleo e Gás, backed by EIG, made the top bid for the so-called Pampo and Enchova clusters, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, beating out Trident Energy, a Warburg Pincus-backed firm, the sources said. The deal could mark EIG’s debut in the oil production business in Latin America’s top producer. It also makes strategic sense for the private equity firm, which earlier this year bought out Brazilian logistics company Prumo Logistica, operator of the nearby port of Acu. Goldman Sachs will provide debt financing for the bid, whose structure and value were not immediately clear. But sources familiar with the tender, first reported by Reuters in June, said it could fetch around $1 billion. Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment. World class geology and dwindling reserves mean the world’s top oil majors have invested billions of dollars to take stakes in Brazil’s prolific deep water oilfields in recent months. But smaller oil companies are often better than large ones at cutting costs and some have honed expertise in squeezing more oil out of mature fields. EIG will follow in the footsteps of First Reserve Corporation and Riverstone Holdings, private equity firms invested in Brazil’s Barra Energia. Ouro Preto, created in 2010, is led by former OGX president Rodolfo Landim and has stakes in several basins throughout Brazil, but none in Campos. A sale of the mature field clusters would also make financial sense for Petrobras, the world’s most indebted oil company, as it seeks to offload $21 billion in assets from 2017 to 2018. According to Petrobras, the Enchova cluster, which includes the Marimba, Enchova, Bonito, Enchova Oeste Bicudo and Pirauna fields, has 32 wells producing 25,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With 27 wells, the Badejo, Pampo, Linguado and Trilha fields of the Pampo cluster produce 13,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Petrobras is selling the rights to the fields until 2025. Both Enchova and Pampo began producing in the 1980s.

John Mitchell will leave the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company “to pursue another opportunity,” Chief Executive Luke Kissam told employees in the memo. A company spokeswoman declined to comment. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Albemarle is the world’s largest lithium producer and its annual lithium sales have spiked more than fourfold since 2015 to $1.3 billion. The company’s shares, however, have plunged 29 percent this year on competition concerns as rivals have forged ahead with fresh mine developments. With lithium mines across the Americas and Australia, Albemarle is a major supplier to Panasonic, which in turn supplies battery parts to global auto giants, including Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla. Mitchell will be replaced as Albemarle’s president of lithium by former FMC Corp executive Eric Norris, who joined the company in January as chief strategy officer. Norris’ “leadership style and wealth of business experience makes him a natural fit for the role,” Kissam said in the memo. Norris previously led FMC’s health and nutrition division, and had prior stints in the company’s lithium unit. FMC is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Albemarle is also shuffling other executives, according to the memo. Dave Ryan will become head of Albemarle’s investor relations department. He joined the company in 2016 from corrugated packaging manufacture WestRock Co. Amy Dunbar will become Albemarle’s treasurer.

2018-07-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - Problems with weldings have forced French utility EDF (EDF.PA) to delay the start-up date for its troubled Flamanville 3 nuclear reactor to the second quarter of 2020 and pushed its cost estimate up to three times the original budget. When construction started in 2007, the target launch date was 2012, but the project has suffered a string of serious technical problems - including the discovery of weak spots in its reactor vessel cover - and has been delayed several times. The cost estimate is now up by another 400 million euros to 10.9 billion euros ($12.75 billion), EDF said in a statement.  It said that loading of the nuclear fuel, last set for the fourth quarter of 2018, was now scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2019.  On a call with reporters, Flamanville project director Laurent Thieffry said that repairs to the weldings would start at the end of this month and continue till summer 2019. He added that the reactor would be connected to the grid in the first quarter of 2020 and its commercial start at full power was now scheduled for the second quarter of 2020.  “The new planning for the EPR reactor in Flamanville is totally realistic,” EDF head of new nuclear projects Xavier Ursat said. But he added that the startup schedule would depend on the go-ahead of nuclear regulator ASN. EDF said the 400 million euro extra cost consisted of 60 to 70 million euros in cost directly related to the welding repairs, with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project.  EDF shares were down 0.9 percent in early trading on a virtually flat French bourse. The utility said a total of 53 weldings on the reactor’s secondary circuit would have to be redone, while for another 10 it is confident that it can convince regulator ASN that they are fit for service. Another 85 weldings were in line with specifications and needed no repairs, it said.  The secondary circuit consists of 360 meters of 50-95 cm diameter piping that conducts steam from the reactor’s four steam generators to the plant’s turbine, and pumps condensed water back to the steam generators. Four to five centimeters thick, the pipes require high-tech welding that needs to go around each pipe 100 times and takes eight weeks per welding. EDF said the 400 million euro extra cost consisted of 60 to 70 million euros directly related to the welding repairs, with the rest due to the impact of the delay on the entire project.   EDF said it would closely supervise and control the welding work on the reactor itself. A parliament report about nuclear security released this month said that excessive reliance on outsourcing was causing safety issues in EDF’s reactors.  France relies on nuclear energy for 75 percent of its electricity. The EPR reactor is the first new reactor to be built on its soil in decades.  The French government wants to reduce the country’s reliance on nuclear to 50 percent and will decide later this year by when this target should be reached.

2018-07-25,"AMSTERDAM, July 25 (Reuters) - Electricity grid operator TenneT IPO-TTH.AS said on Wednesday its investments in its Dutch and German high voltage grids rose 20 percent to 904 million euros ($1.06 billion) in the first half of 2018, as it tries to keep pace with the rapid expansion of solar and wind energy. The Dutch government-owned operator of electrical grids in the Netherlands and Germany earlier this year said it expected to invest a total of 28 billion euros in new infrastructure in the coming 10 years. This infrastructure is needed to connect the large new wind and solar farms Germany and the Netherlands plan to build, on land and in the sea. Both countries have said they will get the large majority of their energy from renewable sources by 2050. “The energy transition is gaining momentum, also in the Netherlands”, Chief Executive Mel Kroon said in a statement. “While the Netherlands has been trailing behind Germany until now, it is expected to catch up soon.” In the Netherlands, TenneT is working on an offshore electricity grid to connect a total of 11.5 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind energy capacity to its onshore high-voltage transmission grid by 2030. In Germany, the company is also expanding the connection of offshore wind farms to the onshore grid, while preparing bids for the construction of “electricity highways” to transmit wind energy over hundreds of kilometres from the north to the south. TenneT said its revenues remained stable at around 2 billion euros in the first half of 2018.

2018-07-25,"* European stocks halt three-day worldwide equities rally * Markets focussed on Trump-Juncker trade meeting * Commodities bolstered by prospect of increased China demand * China yuan, Turkish lira steady in FX markets * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, July 25 (Reuters) - A three-day worldwide stocks rally was threatening to stall on Wednesday, as investors waited for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and the President of the European Commission to see where the global trade war was heading next. Asian stocks had inched up overnight after Wall Street had hit a five-month high, extending a month-long advance, but tech and commodity stocks Europe eased early on as the market’s focus returned to what may happen with tariffs. EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a Swedish newspaper on Wednesday that the bloc was preparing to introduce tariffs on $20 billion of U.S. goods if Washington imposes levies on imported cars. A monthly survey of German business confidence also showed some impact from the row, although there was no major plunge and traders in most markets seemed content to hold positions steady. China’s yuan had eased off a 13-month low which also soothed some nerves, while most major currencies, bond benchmarks and oil were tucked in tight ranges. “We have seen a lot of complacency over this entire trade war so the question is, unless we see a very negative outcome (from the EU-U.S. meeting), are we going to see a marked reaction?” Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said. “It is an odd one where two key trade partners, but also two key allies, are now fighting each other.” With another blizzard of multinational corporate earnings, a European Central Bank meeting and U.S. GDP figures still to come this week, there was plenty of scope for volatility. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was just off a two-week low at 94.506 and barely budged at $1.1692 against the euro and 111.24 yen. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which tends to act as the benchmark for global borrowing costs, eased to 2.937 percent, after climbing to a six-week peak of 2.973 percent overnight. Bond yields have been pushed up this week on speculation the Bank of Japan is edging closer to unwinding its aggressive stimulus programme. But with the Thursday’s ECB meeting looming, most bond yields in the euro area also edged down on Wednesday. Britain’s pound nudged up to $1.3150 after UK Prime Minister Theresa May had said on Tuesday that she would now lead negotiations on the country’s departure from the European Union. Turkey’s lira also clawed higher having sunk more than 3 percent on Tuesday, after its central bank shied away from raising rates in what was seen as another hit to its shredded credibility. State Street Global Advisors currency portfolio manager Aaron Hurd said the worry is that President Tayyip Erdogan’s government will put pressure on the central bank to keep rates down, fuelling what it already double-digit inflation. “The new (finance) minister and the new cabinet in total is an unknown quantity and we have to wait and see and learn how to interpret their behaviours,” Hurd said. “That means an even higher risk premium priced into the currency.” The decline in China’s yuan paused for the time being also. The currency was a shade firmer at 6.797 per dollar having hit a 13-month low of 6.829 this week on signs that Beijing is grabbing for the stimulus levers again. The Shanghai Composite Index closed fractionally lower after brushing a one-month high and enjoying a roughly 3-percent surge this week. Tokyo’s Nikkei ended 0.5 percent higher, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.9 percent and, though South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.4 percent, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained 0.4 percent. Those moves came after Wall Street’s S&P 500 closed at its highest level since the start of February as Google’s blowout results bolstered what has already been a bumper U.S. earnings season. In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 0.6 percent at $73.89 a barrel, adding to the previous day’s gains as market focus shifted away from oversupply concerns to the possibility of increasing Chinese demand. Copper on the London Metal Exchange (LME) traded down at $6,264 per tonne after soaring 2.7 percent overnight to a two-week peak of $6,328.00 on Chinese stimulus hopes. Iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange touched a two-month peak of 479.5 yuan a tonne, while precious metal gold was a touch higher at 1,228 an ounce.

2018-07-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Africa-focused Tullow Oil (TLW.L) will use free cashflow of $401 million (304.78 million pounds) to pay down debt and invest rather than pay an interim dividend, it said on Wednesday, after having raised the possibility of a return to payouts.    Tullow returned to profit last year after three years in the red and Chief Financial Officer Les Wood in April indicated that the company could start to pay dividends again.  “The Board considered carefully whether to pay an interim dividend but concluded that, for the moment, free cash flow is best used to continue to pay down debt and to invest in assets,” Tullow said in a statement. Wood said on Wednesday the company did not need to reach its general net debt target of $2.5 billion in order to reinstate payouts, adding both dividends and share buybacks had their merits. Tullow’s net debt of $3.1 billion was slightly below expectations for the first half. The company had said it expected free cashflow to come in at around $300 million for the first six months of the year.  On Wednesday it said it could potentially generate around $650 million in free cashflow for the full year, but this could be impacted by litigation costs.  A London judge ordered Tullow this month to pay Seadrill (SDLP.N) around $254 million, saying Tullow was wrong to end a contract between the companies on the grounds of force majeure over a maritime border dispute in West Africa.  Tullow had originally said its partners would pay in keeping with their stakes in the project, but Kosmos, which owns around 20 percent, successfully challenged this. “The focus of the Tullow investment case should now be on moving developments forward to convert resources into reserves, and more frequent exploration activity,” Barclays said in a note. “Shareholder returns can also play a role, emphasizing that a measured step-up in activity does not equate to a loss of capital discipline.” Tullow plans to drill an exploration well in Namibia in September and expand drilling in Ghana into next year. It aims for final investment decisions on Uganda towards the end of this year and Kenya in late 2019, which would open up those countries’ oil industries for exports.  In Kenya, however, Tullow has stopped a pilot scheme producing oil and trucking around 600 barrels a day to the coast due to security issues around cattle rustling and banditry, Chief Executive Paul McDade said. He said he did not expect this to change the overall timeframe for the project.

2018-07-25,"* Marks commitment to unruly western region * Comes as oil majors rush to replace ageing wells * Spending equal to PetroChina’s 2017 E&P expenditure (Adds details) BEIJING, July 25 (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) said on Wednesday it will spend more than 150 billion yuan ($22 billion) by 2020 to boost oil and gas production in the western region of Xinjiang, aiming to offset falling output from ageing fields in northeast China. The increased spending will push output in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region to more than 50 million tonnes of oil equivalent between 2018 and 2020, CNPC said. The investment is equivalent to the total expenditure by CNPC’s listed unit PetroChina, China’s top oil and gas producer, for oil and gas exploration and production in 2017. CNPC’s Xinjiang operations churned out 11.45 million tonnes of crude oil last year, while the company produced 23.5 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to 17.1 million tonnes of gas, from the Tarim in the region, one of China’s largest gas basins, according to PetroChina’s 2017 annual report. Based on these figures, the new investment would boost output from the region by at least 75 percent by 2020. The spending spree underscores the need to replace output from the Daqing oilfield in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang as well as a push to increase the country’s natural gas output to meet growing demand for the fuel as part of Beijing’s shift away from coal. Beijing also wants to increase development in the unruly Xinjiang region, which borders Central Asia, where hundreds have died in ethnic unrest in recent years. “I think that the primary factor is to support the central government policy to invest more and support economic development in the west,” said Liutong Zhang, director at Hong Kong-based WaterRock Energy Economics. “A portion of the money would be spent on the logistics, storage tanks, and also downstream gas infrastructure for the southern part of Xinjiang to use natural gas for environmental reasons.” The boost is unlikely to affect import demand from the world’s top crude importer because new output will replace lost capacity elsewhere. Still, it reflects the company’s growing confidence after a surge this year in the price of crude oil. State oil majors have also grabbed a bigger share of the lucrative fuel export market as smaller independent refiners struggle with tough new taxes and an environmental crackdown.

U.S. President Donald Trump struck a conciliatory tone as he welcomed the head of the European Commission, Jean Claude-Juncker, to the White House for talks. “We have seen a lot of complacency over this entire trade war so the question is, unless we see a very negative outcome (from the EU-U.S. meeting), are we going to see a marked reaction?” Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said. Amid the busiest reporting week for S&P 500 companies, a European Central Bank meeting and U.S. GDP figures still to come this week, there is scope for volatility. Sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell to an eight-month low in June and data for the prior month was revised sharply lower, the latest indications that the housing market is slowing down. The PHLX housing index fell 2.06 percent. General Motors fell 5.42 percent after the earnings forecast cut attributed to rising steel and aluminum costs due to U.S. tariffs. But markets focused on the positive. Of the 148 S&P 500 companies that have reported second-quarter earnings so far, nearly 86 percent have topped Wall Street forecasts, a record dating back to 1994, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Facebook Inc, which reports results later on Wednesday, gained 1.18 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 3.62 points, or 0.01 percent, to 25,245.56, the S&P 500 gained 10.92 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,831.32 and the Nasdaq Composite added 56.06 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,896.83. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.34 percent. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.27 percent, further scaling down from its July 19 peak for the year, when Trump suggested it had grown too strong. Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors LLC, said tariffs and weak-dollar policies could exacerbate pressure on company profits. “I’m very surprised that analysts have not factored any of this in - that people are shocked that tariffs are inflationary,” said Bernstein. Gold, used to guard against inflation, added 0.6 percent to $1,231.71 an ounce on the spot market. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, a benchmark for global borrowing costs, eased off a one-month peak of 2.973 percent hit on Tuesday. Bond investors were whipsawed this month by speculation the Bank of Japan could start unwinding stimulus and by bets that the gap between short and long-term bond yields would widen if Trump pressured the Federal Reserve to stop dollar-boosting rate hikes. The latter wager - on a “steeper” yield curve - unwound for a second straight day. Benchmark 10-year notes rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.9412 percent, and the gap between 2 and 10-year yields shrank to 28.2 basis points, from highs above 33 basis points on Tuesday. Oil prices rose for a second day after U.S. crude inventories fell to the lowest since February 2015, easing worries about oversupply. U.S. crude rose 1.15 percent to $69.31 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.95, up 0.69 percent on the day. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

Total, alongside two other oil companies, has been in talks with the country’s government about developing the area called B1 and B2 since 2013. “The Ministry of Petroleum regrets that negotiations with Total have concluded in no deal,” Petroleum Minister Ezekiel Lol Gatkuoth said in a statement. “But (it) looks forward to bringing new investors into talks for these licenses.” Total and the government failed to agree on the duration of the exploration and the commercial terms of a production-sharing agreement, Gatkuoth said. Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Landlocked South Sudan, which split from Sudan in 2011 after decades of conflict, has been mired in civil war since President Salva Kiir sacked former vice president Riek Machar in 2013. But on Wednesday South Sudan’s government and the main rebel group inked a power-sharing deal in the Sudanese capital, which they hope will end the conflict, a Reuters witness said, though smaller opposition groups have refrained from signing.

Disappointing results from Boeing Co and General Motors Co held back Wall Street a day after the benchmark S&P 500 index hit a five-month high, with U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission chief, Jean Claude-Juncker, set to meet at 1:45 p.m. Eastern time (1745 GMT). Market participants’ focus returned to what may happen with tariffs after EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a Swedish newspaper on Wednesday the bloc was preparing $20 billion of levies on U.S. goods if Washington imposes them on imported cars. “We have seen a lot of complacency over this entire trade war so the question is, unless we see a very negative outcome (from the EU-U.S. meeting), are we going to see a marked reaction?” Rabobank strategist Bas Van Geffen said. “It is an odd one where two key trade partners, but also two key allies, are now fighting each other.” Amid the busiest reporting week for S&P 500 companies, a European Central Bank meeting and U.S. GDP figures still to come this week, there is scope for volatility.

2018-07-25,"PARIS (Reuters) - French auto parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) cut its 2018 profitability goal on Wednesday, citing the introduction of new emissions test standards that are expected to disrupt production by some of its carmaker clients. Valeo, the maker of automotive lighting, self-driving sensors and electrified transmission parts, said its full-year operating profit “might be slightly below” the 7.8 percent of sales recorded last year, having previously pledged to match it. The company, which also reported a 10 percent decline in first-half net income to 463 million euros ($541 million), blamed the target cut on “disruptions to the production of certain vehicles in Europe” resulting from the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test (WLTP) that becomes mandatory in September. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization rose 11 percent to 1.341 billion euros or 13.6 percent of sales, from 12.9 percent a year earlier, Valeo said.  Revenue advanced 5 percent to 9.863 billion euros, short of the 9.93 billion expected by analysts, based on the median estimate in an Inquiry Financial poll for Reuters. Order intake came to 14 billion euros for the first half, down 6 percent year-on-year. New orders at Valeo’s electric-car parts venture with Siemens, however, jumped 57 percent to 4.7 billion euros. Valeo did not identify the carmakers or vehicles affected by the emissions-testing hiccups. However Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has acknowledged renting parking spaces to accommodate many of the 250,000 vehicles that may be caught up in testing delays. Mercedes maker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) also cited the new tests among factors that led to a June profit warning. Peugeot maker PSA Group (PEUP.PA), by contrast, insisted it was largely unaffected by the testing change, as Chief Executive Carlos Tavares unveiled record earnings on Tuesday. The new global test regime, designed to correspond more closely to actual driving habits, was already under discussion before the 2015 dieselgate scandal that led to closer scrutiny of widespread emissions test-rigging by carmakers. But European Union authorities say there are signs that some carmakers are already manipulating the new tests.

2018-07-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund has given its backing to Ukraine’s revised plans for an anti-corruption court, fulfilling one condition for unlocking the next $2 billion installment of aid to Kiev.  The court is being set up as part of Ukraine’s $17.5 billion bailout package and has become a symbol of its efforts to stamp out high-level corruption that has blighted the country for decades.     “The legislative framework for the High Anti-Corruption Court, once the recently adopted amendments are signed into law, will be consistent with the authorities’ commitments under Ukraine’s IMF-supported program,” an IMF spokeswoman told Reuters. Ukraine’s parliament approved amendments to the new law needed to set up the court on July 12 after a previous version was deemed by the Fund to be too loose. It is meant to ring-fence court decisions from political pressure or bribery in Ukraine, where corruption deters foreign investors and is estimated to knock two percentage points off economic growth each year. A number of other issues remain to be resolved, however, before Kiev finally receives the next installment of IMF money.   There is a standoff over plans to raise gas prices as well as over implementing additional spending cuts or money-raising measures needed to plug some shortfalls in revenues earlier in the year. Kiev has received only half the $17.5 billion earmarked for its aid program which is due to run out next year. It has not had any fresh money since April last year and needs to repay around $15 billion of foreign currency debt over the next two years. “Discussions on other outstanding issues, including gas prices and the government budget, are ongoing,” the spokeswoman said.

According to the IRNA news agency, Qassemi also said that Iran has filed an official letter of objection to the Swiss embassy in Tehran, which oversees U.S. diplomatic relations in the Islamic Republic.

2018-07-25,"(Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories last week tumbled more than expected to their lowest level since 2015 as exports jumped and stocks at the Cushing hub dropped, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell 6.1 million barrels in the week to July 20, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.3 million barrels. At 404.9 million barrels, inventories, not including the nation’s emergency petroleum reserve, were at their lowest level since February 2015.  “You’re seeing a 6 million draw ... so the tightening of the fundamental picture continues,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  Oil futures rebounded after the data, but pared those gains as investors discounted the drawdown as most of it came from the West Coast, which is isolated from the rest of the country’s supply.  U.S. crude CLc1 was at $68.40 a barrel, down 13 cents by 11 a.m. (1500 GMT), while Brent crude LCOc1 fell 10 cents to $73.35 a barrel.  It is unclear whether the market will sustain a rally due to concerns about global demand growth and talk of increased supply, McGillian said. Net U.S. crude imports USOICI=ECI fell last week by 2.5 million barrels per day, as exports jumped sharply by 1.2 million bpd to 2.7 million bpd, close to its record of 3 million bpd hit in the week to June 22. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub USOICC=ECI fell by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said.  Cushing’s inventories have been dwindling, in part due to an outage at a Syncrude facility in Canada that has reduced the flow of oil into the Oklahoma hub. Inventories at Cushing have fallen to 23.7 million barrels, lowest since November 2014.  Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 2.3 million barrels, compared with expectations in a Reuters poll for a 713,000-barrel drop.  Distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 101,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 207,000-barrel increase, the EIA data showed.

2018-07-25,"LONDON (Reuters) - Tullow Oil (TLW.L) has stopped work at its Kenyan oilfields and halted trucking operations after protests by the local community disrupted a transport scheme, its chief executive said on Wednesday. The British company aims to produce the first oil from the     $2.9 billion Kenya project by 2021, which would open up the country’s oil industry to exports.  But protests and security problems have halted a pilot scheme which currently trucks around 600 barrels of oil per day to a storage facility in Mombasa before a pipeline is built which should be operational by 2022. Kenyan media said the protests were to demand the deployment of more security forces in the area, which has long been plagued by banditry and cattle rustling. Turkana, where the oil blocks are located, also lies near South Sudan, a nation torn by years of conflict. Officials at the Ministry of Petroleum and Mining could not immediately be reached for comment. “What you saw locally was the local people, the community... using the trucking operation as a lever really to demonstrate to the national government that the security situation on the ground had to improve,” Tullow’s Chief Executive Paul McDade told Reuters. “We’d expect to be up there working, getting the field back operating again and trucks moving again in the near future. But it’s important to take the time out so that when we do return... we have a more secure environment.” Tullow is targeting production in Kenya of at least 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day after first oil in 2021/22.    The company is considering reducing its stake in the project to around 30 percent from 50 percent before the final investment decision, a spokesman said. The other partners in the project are Total (TOTF.PA) and Africa Oil (AOI.TO).

2018-07-25,"OSLO (Reuters) - Electricity prices in hydropower-dependent Norway hit a record high for this time of year last week due to lack of rainfall and the unusual warm weather the country has been experiencing since May, the power system’s regulator said on Wednesday. Between July 16 and July 23, power prices for the first time climbed above 0.50 Norwegian crowns ($0.0613) per kilowatt-hour, compared with the previous record 0.44 crowns hit in 2008. “The price increase is linked to a reduced hydrological balance due to dry and warm weather...,” the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) said. Unusually warm and dry weather has led to power costs in Norway almost doubling from 2017, NVE has said. Net rainfall for the week was estimated to total 0.2 terawatt-hour (TWh) of energy or 15 percent of the normal, the regulator added. So far this year Norway has received 45 percent less rain than it usually gets between January and July. Levels in Norwegian hydropower plant reservoirs have been decreasing since reaching 61.7 percent of full capacity at end-June, and were down to 60.4 percent last week. The reservoirs are fed by rainfall and snow melt in the mountains.  NVE said only the return of rains would help fill the reservoirs since there was much less snow left to melt compared with the previous year. Last year Norway’s reservoir levels peaked at 86.6 percent in late October.  Temperatures in the Nordic country hit a new record of 35.5 degrees Celsius on July 17. “What we’re seeing in northern Europe is unusual to say the least. Temperatures topped 30 degrees Celsius in the Arctic circle last week, this is more a typical July temperature for southern Europe, for Madrid,” a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Meteorological Organisation said on Tuesday. Norwegian authorities have banned outdoor barbecues, popular among Norwegians, to reduce risk of wildfires.

John Mitchell will leave the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company “to pursue another opportunity,” Chief Executive Luke Kissam told employees in the memo. A company spokeswoman declined to comment. Mitchell did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Albemarle is the world’s largest lithium producer and its annual lithium sales have spiked more than fourfold since 2015 to $1.3 billion. The company’s shares, however, have plunged 29 percent this year on competition concerns as rivals have forged ahead with fresh mine developments. With lithium mines across the Americas and Australia, Albemarle is a major supplier to Panasonic, which in turn supplies battery parts to global auto giants, including Toyota Motor Corp and Tesla. Mitchell will be replaced as Albemarle’s president of lithium by former FMC Corp executive Eric Norris, who joined the company in January as chief strategy officer. Norris’ “leadership style and wealth of business experience makes him a natural fit for the role,” Kissam said in the memo. Norris previously led FMC’s health and nutrition division, and had prior stints in the company’s lithium unit. FMC is spinning off its lithium division this fall as a stand-alone publicly traded company. Albemarle is also shuffling other executives, according to the memo. Dave Ryan will become head of Albemarle’s investor relations department. He joined the company in 2016 from corrugated packaging manufacture WestRock Co. Amy Dunbar will become Albemarle’s treasurer.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.2 percent. The index extended the previous day’s gains made after China said it will adopt a more vigorous fiscal policy to cushion the impact of external uncertainties. The Shanghai Composite Index was little changed after brushing a one-month high. It has advanced roughly 3 percent so far this week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climbed 0.6 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.15 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent. Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since Feb. 1 as Alphabet’s blowout results bolstered expectations of a robust earnings season. “Gains by U.S. shares are providing support for equities, as well as China’s stimulus plan. Corporate earnings will continue to come out and these will be a key focal point for the markets, which also have to keep an eye on trade developments,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. On the trade front, focus was on talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker set later on Wednesday, at which trade issues are likely to dominate. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 94.568, having edged up from a near two-week low of 94.207. The 10-year Treasury note yield stood at 2.943 percent after climbing to a six-week peak of 2.973 percent overnight. The yield shot up this week on speculation the Bank of Japan was edging closer to unwinding its aggressive monetary stimulus, following reports late last week that the central bank was holding preliminary discussions on possible changes to its monetary policy. The euro edged up 0.05 percent to $1.1688 while the dollar added 0.05 percent to 111.26 yen. The pound was up 0.05 percent at $1.3151, building on gains from the previous day on news that British Prime Minister Theresa May would lead negotiations on the country’s departure from the European Union. The decline in China’s yuan’s appears to have paused for the time being, with the currency a shade firmer at 6.797 per dollar . It pulled back from a 13-month low of 6.829 set the previous day on expectations that monetary conditions would be allowed to loosen further. The Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7411 after gaining 0.5 percent on Tuesday when hopes for China’s stimulus lifted the currency. The Turkish lira was on the defensive after the country’s central bank on Tuesday unexpectedly left interest rates on hold. The central bank’s decision was in focus amid investors’ concern over its perceived lack of independence from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. The president is seen wanting lower borrowing costs to fuel economic growth, although the central bank is tasked with combating inflationary pressure. The South African rand, on the other hand, stood tall after surging more than 1 percent on Tuesday on news that China would invest $14.7 billion in the local economy.

2018-07-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s acting administrator said on Tuesday he would follow up the work of his predecessor to overhaul the nation’s biofuel policy, including pursuing changes strongly opposed by the powerful corn lobby like counting ethanol exports toward annual biofuels quotas. The biofuel industry had been hoping that Andrew Wheeler would drop some of former Administrator Scott Pruitt’s overhaul efforts, which were aimed at helping the oil industry, and instead prioritize the interests of farmers in the U.S. heartland to expand domestic markets for corn-based fuel. Wheeler said the agency was open to changes sought by the biofuel industry, but only if it made concessions too. “When everyone is complaining about the program, we need to look at ways to change the program,” he said.     The comments at a briefing with reporters were among the first by Wheeler on such policy issues since Pruitt resigned as EPA administrator earlier this month in the face of ethics controversies.     Efforts to bring the rival corn and oil groups together around an overhaul to the Renewable Fuel Standard failed under Pruitt, but Wheeler said his decades of experience in Washington could make a difference. The RFS requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel supply each year, or purchase blending credits from those that do. The policy has helped farmers by creating a 15 billion-gallon market for ethanol, but has rankled some refining companies that say it costs them a fortune. Wheeler also said the agency wanted a “50-state solution” to the nation’s vehicle emissions standards, as the EPA opens the door to weakening Obama-era efficiency targets over the objections of California.     President Donald Trump’s administration is expected as early as Thursday to propose revoking California’s power to set state vehicle emissions rules, setting up what is likely to be a protracted legal battle between the state and Washington.     “We don’t want to see two different standards for the country,” Wheeler said.     Wheeler said he met last week with Mary Nichols, the head of California’ Air Resource Board, and shared the administration’s opinion.  Standards set under former President Barack Obama called for roughly doubling by 2025 the average fuel efficiency of new vehicles sold in the United States to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon - something the Trump administration has called too onerous for the auto industry but which proponents said could help spur innovation in clean technologies.  On biofuels, Wheeler said the agency would keep pursuing changes to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that Pruitt sought, including counting ethanol exports toward the nation’s annual biofuels blending quotas. Such a move would reduce costs for the refining industry by effectively lowering the domestic biofuel blending quota, and anger the corn lobby by undermining U.S. demand. He added that the agency could also look at changes that would help the biofuel industry, like expanding the sale of higher-ethanol gasoline blends and by requiring some refiners to blend more ethanol to compensate for volumes lost under an EPA waiver program for small refiners.  Reallocating the volumes would be a concession to the corn industry, which has said the waiver program undermines demand for corn-based ethanol. But Wheeler said any of those changes would need to come as a package deal, and would not be adopted piecemeal. Under the RFS, refineries up to 75,000 barrels per day can seek exemptions from the law each year if they can prove compliance would cause them financial hardship. The EPA issued data this month that said it granted 48 such waivers for the years 2016 and 2017, representing some 2.25 billion gallons of biofuels, significantly higher than under Obama.  The surge in waivers has caused the cost of compliance credits to plummet, saving refiners hundreds of millions of dollars. Wheeler said the lower credit costs should lead to fewer exemptions in the future.  “If credits cause a hardship, it would only make sense the lower credit costs reduce the hardship,” Wheeler said.

2018-07-25,"BANGKOK, July 25 (Reuters) - Rescuers searched in difficult conditions on Wednesday for  dozens of people feared dead and hundreds missing after a dam collapsed in a remote part of land-locked Laos, one of Asia’s poorest countries, a government official said. State media showed pictures of villagers, some with young children, stranded on the roofs of submerged houses. Others showed villagers trying to board wooden boats to safety in Attapeu province, the southernmost part of the country. A senior Lao government official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said dozens of people were feared dead and hundreds remain unaccounted for after the hydropower dam that was under construction collapsed on Monday. “We will continue with rescue efforts today but it’s very difficult, the conditions are very difficult. Dozens of people are dead. It could be higher,” the Vientiane-based official told Reuters by telephone. The once-isolated Southeast Asian country, one of the world’s few remaining communist states, has an ambitious dam-building scheme in order to become the “battery of Asia”. Its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build its planned portfolio of dams under commercial concessions that agree to export electricity to its more developed neighbours, including power-hungry Thailand. Environment rights groups have repeatedly warned about the human and environmental cost of the rapid pace of dam construction, including damage to the already-fragile ecosystem of the region’s rivers. Attapeu is a largely agricultural province that borders Vietnam to the east and Cambodia to the south. The dam that collapsed is part of the hydroelectric Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. The subsidiary dam, known as “Saddle Dam D”, was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. South Korea’s SK Engineering & Construction said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers near the site. An official at the firm said fractures were first discovered on the dam on Sunday and that the company had ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon as it became clear the dam could collapse. Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia programme, said a breach of a saddle dam could be “worse in terms of devastation” than that of a main dam. “With a saddle dam breaking, it’s flushing water into an area that’s not used to having water inside it and it will continue to breach until the water can be diverted again, which is one option, or until the reservoir is drawn down to a level below the breach,” Eyler told Reuters. “This is yet another major shock to Laos’ plan to become the battery of Southeast Asia,” he said. Tholakhong, a Lao language news site, said on Tuesday water levels at the gauge in one of the affected villages showed a decrease of 79 cm (31 inches).

2018-07-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans who control the U.S. Congress are hesitating to advance tough new Russia sanctions legislation as fears of damage to American companies slow efforts to quickly send Moscow a message against meddling in the next U.S. election. Unlike a year ago, when Congress worked with lightning speed on a sanctions law targeting Russia, North Korea and Iran, some lawmakers said on Tuesday the Senate and House of Representatives were carefully weighing their response to growing fears that Moscow is plotting to interfere in November’s congressional elections. Republicans and Democrats were united in their repudiation last week of President Donald Trump’s failure to publicly condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election, despite findings by U.S. intelligence. Russia has denied such meddling occurred.  With a five-week summer recess set to begin in the House on Friday and the Senate taking an early August week-long recess, backers of legislation to impose harsh new sanctions on Russia feared the effort could be losing steam. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, is pushing “DETER Act” legislation putting Putin on notice that his country would be slammed with a torrent of U.S. sanctions if Russia interfered in any future American election. It had the backing of several senior lawmakers, although it was unclear how quickly it could move through committees. “That proposal is one that I think is generating a good amount of interest, and I think it’s a pretty solid approach, really,” said No. 3 Senate Republican John Thune.  But leading congressional Republicans and U.S. energy firms concerned about losing business with Russia have been seeking to put on the brakes. Congressional sources said last week that U.S oil and gas firms were lobbying against the tighter sanctions that could affect their investments in Russia. “We don’t want to rush in with our hair on fire,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Tuesday, adding that a new sanctions bill had to be done “in a thoughtful way.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declared on Monday that new Russia sanctions legislation was “stuck in the mud,” as he accused Republicans of being “unwilling, maybe afraid” to push back against Trump. Despite a possible loss of momentum on sanctions, Republican leadership had tough words for Putin on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, separately proclaimed that Putin would not be welcome in the U.S. Capitol if he accepted Trump’s invitation to visit Washington this autumn. Last week, Ryan called Russia’s government “menacing” as he urged a new round of sanctions. But so far, the only firm action by Congress since Helsinki is a move to loosen - not tighten - the noose on Russia. The Trump administration has convinced a group of lawmakers to ease a sanctions regime aimed at Moscow that has made it difficult for U.S. allies such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam to purchase weapons from Russia. The legislation, deep inside a massive bill authorizing U.S. military programs, still has to be approved by the full House and Senate. But Democratic Senator Chris Coons predicted that the DETER bill would garner overwhelming support if brought to the Senate floor. The sanctions law last year passed 98-2. “Whatever the president’s concerns are, I think he would ultimately sign it. He can do math,” Coons told reporters.

The Turkish lira was on the defensive after the country’s central bank on Tuesday unexpectedly left interest rates on hold.

2018-07-25,"BANGKOK, July 25 (Reuters) - Rescuers searched in difficult conditions on Wednesday for  dozens of people feared dead and hundreds missing after a dam collapsed in a remote part of land-locked Laos, one of Asia’s poorest countries, a government official said. State media showed pictures of villagers, some with young children, stranded on the roofs of submerged houses. Others showed villagers trying to board wooden boats to safety in Attapeu province, the southernmost part of the country. A senior Lao government official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said dozens of people were feared dead and hundreds remain unaccounted for after the hydropower dam that was under construction collapsed on Monday. “We will continue with rescue efforts today but it’s very difficult, the conditions are very difficult. Dozens of people are dead. It could be higher,” the Vientiane-based official told Reuters by telephone. The once-isolated Southeast Asian country, one of the world’s few remaining communist states, has an ambitious dam-building scheme in order to become the “battery of Asia”. Its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build its planned portfolio of dams under commercial concessions that agree to export electricity to its more developed neighbours, including power-hungry Thailand. Environment rights groups have repeatedly warned about the human and environmental cost of the rapid pace of dam construction, including damage to the already-fragile ecosystem of the region’s rivers. Attapeu is a largely agricultural province that borders Vietnam to the east and Cambodia to the south. The dam that collapsed is part of the hydroelectric Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. The subsidiary dam, known as “Saddle Dam D”, was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. South Korea’s SK Engineering & Construction said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers near the site. An official at the firm said fractures were first discovered on the dam on Sunday and that the company had ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon as it became clear the dam could collapse. Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center’s Southeast Asia programme, said a breach of a saddle dam could be “worse in terms of devastation” than that of a main dam. “With a saddle dam breaking, it’s flushing water into an area that’s not used to having water inside it and it will continue to breach until the water can be diverted again, which is one option, or until the reservoir is drawn down to a level below the breach,” Eyler told Reuters. “This is yet another major shock to Laos’ plan to become the battery of Southeast Asia,” he said. Tholakhong, a Lao language news site, said on Tuesday water levels at the gauge in one of the affected villages showed a decrease of 79 cm (31 inches).

2018-07-25,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.17 pct, Nikkei rises 0.5 pct * US yields hover near 6-week highs, help prop up dollar * Commodities buoyant amid prospect of increased China demand By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, July 25 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rode higher on Wednesday thanks to strong U.S. corporate earnings and hopes China will boost fiscal support for its economy, while long-term U.S. yields hovered near six-week highs on speculation the Bank of Japan could be less accommodative. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.17 percent. The index extended gains from the previous day, when it was lifted after China said it will adopt a more vigorous fiscal policy to help tackle external uncertainties. Australian stocks dipped 0.1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.35 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent Overnight on Wall Street, the S&P 500 closed at its highest level since Feb. 1 as Alphabet’s blowout results bolstered expectations of a robust earnings season. “Gains by U.S. shares are providing support for equities, as well as China’s stimulus plan. Corporate earnings will continue to come out and these will be a key focal point for the markets, which also have to keep an eye on trade developments,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 94.594, having edged up from a near two-week low of 94.207 plumbed at the start of the week on the back of higher U.S. Treasury yields. The 10-year Treasury note yield stood at 2.950 percent after climbing to a six-week peak of 2.973 percent overnight. The yield had shot up on speculation the BOJ was edging closer to unwinding its aggressive monetary stimulus, following reports by Reuters and other media late last week that the central bank was holding preliminary discussions on possible changes to its monetary policy. The euro was flat at $1.1684 while the dollar edged up 0.1 percent to 111.31 yen. The pound was up 0.05 percent at $1.3151, building on gains from the previous day on news that British Prime Minister Theresa May would lead negotiations on the country’s departure from the European Union. The Australian dollar was also buoyant, trading a shade higher at $0.7427 after gaining 0.5 percent on Tuesday when hopes for China’s stimulus lifted the currency. The Aussie, which if often used as liquid proxy for China plays, also benefited as prices of commodities such as industrial metals rose on Chinese stimulus hopes.

2018-07-25,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans who control the U.S. Congress are hesitating to advance tough new Russia sanctions legislation as fears of damage to American companies slow efforts to quickly send Moscow a message against meddling in the next U.S. election. Unlike a year ago, when Congress worked with lightning speed on a sanctions law targeting Russia, North Korea and Iran, some lawmakers said on Tuesday the Senate and House of Representatives were carefully weighing their response to growing fears that Moscow is plotting to interfere in November’s congressional elections. Republicans and Democrats were united in their repudiation last week of President Donald Trump’s failure to publicly condemn Russian President Vladimir Putin for interfering in the 2016 presidential election, despite findings by U.S. intelligence. Russia has denied such meddling occurred.  With a five-week summer recess set to begin in the House on Friday and the Senate taking an early August week-long recess, backers of legislation to impose harsh new sanctions on Russia feared the effort could be losing steam. A bipartisan group of senators, led by Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, is pushing “DETER Act” legislation putting Putin on notice that his country would be slammed with a torrent of U.S. sanctions if Russia interfered in any future American election. It had the backing of several senior lawmakers, although it was unclear how quickly it could move through committees. “That proposal is one that I think is generating a good amount of interest, and I think it’s a pretty solid approach, really,” said No. 3 Senate Republican John Thune.  But leading congressional Republicans and U.S. energy firms concerned about losing business with Russia have been seeking to put on the brakes. Congressional sources said last week that U.S oil and gas firms were lobbying against the tighter sanctions that could affect their investments in Russia. “We don’t want to rush in with our hair on fire,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker told reporters on Tuesday, adding that a new sanctions bill had to be done “in a thoughtful way.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer declared on Monday that new Russia sanctions legislation was “stuck in the mud,” as he accused Republicans of being “unwilling, maybe afraid” to push back against Trump. Despite a possible loss of momentum on sanctions, Republican leadership had tough words for Putin on Tuesday. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, separately proclaimed that Putin would not be welcome in the U.S. Capitol if he accepted Trump’s invitation to visit Washington this autumn. Last week, Ryan called Russia’s government “menacing” as he urged a new round of sanctions. But so far, the only firm action by Congress since Helsinki is a move to loosen - not tighten - the noose on Russia. The Trump administration has convinced a group of lawmakers to ease a sanctions regime aimed at Moscow that has made it difficult for U.S. allies such as India, Indonesia and Vietnam to purchase weapons from Russia. The legislation, deep inside a massive bill authorizing U.S. military programs, still has to be approved by the full House and Senate. But Democratic Senator Chris Coons predicted that the DETER bill would garner overwhelming support if brought to the Senate floor. The sanctions law last year passed 98-2. “Whatever the president’s concerns are, I think he would ultimately sign it. He can do math,” Coons told reporters.
