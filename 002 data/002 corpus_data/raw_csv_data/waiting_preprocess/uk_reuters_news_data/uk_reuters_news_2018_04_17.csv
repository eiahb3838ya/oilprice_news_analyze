2018-04-17,"(Reuters) - A U.S. bankruptcy court judge on Tuesday granted a request by Suniva’s biggest creditor that will allow it to sell a portion of the company’s solar manufacturing equipment through a public auction. The development casts fresh uncertainty on the future for Suniva, the company that fought for and won stiff tariffs on solar panel imports from the administration of President Donald Trump in January, but still has not restarted manufacturing at its U.S. factories.  The creditor, SQN Capital Management, said Tuesday’s order by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross will enable it to attract an investor interested in injecting capital into Suniva’s idled operations. As of February, SQN was owed more than $58 million by Suniva, court papers show. “The outcome we want is for Suniva to be producing once again,” SQN Chief Executive Jeremiah Silkowski said in a phone interview following a hearing at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington.  Through a subsidiary, SQN last month asked Gross to lift a stay that prevents Suniva’s creditors from collecting the company’s debts while it is in bankruptcy.  In its request, SQN said it saw “no reasonable possibility of a successful reorganization within a reasonable time” for Suniva and that it and other lenders could no longer fund the company through the bankruptcy process. A public auction for the assets will be held at least 30 days following the judge’s order, according to court papers. At the hearing, Judge Gross granted SQN relief from the stay and at Suniva’s request, amended the company’s debtor-in-possession financing agreement to allow it to fund operations for the weeks ahead.  An attorney for Suniva, Jeremy Ryan, told the judge that the company was still hoping for a positive outcome to the bankruptcy case. “No one is sure exactly what that is,” Ryan said. “This case has a lot of twists and turns.” Suniva officials could not be reached for comment following the hearing. Suniva filed for bankruptcy a year ago, days before it petitioned the U.S. government for trade relief. The Norcross, Georgia-based company argued it could not compete with the cheap imports that dominate the U.S. market.  The Solar Energy Industries Association, the industry’s leading trade group, fought the tariffs, saying they would drive up the cost of solar and lead to thousands of job losses. The group also argued that the tariffs would not be enough to enable Suniva to restart operations.

2018-04-17,"NEW YORK, April 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Three Colorado communities filed a lawsuit against oil companies on Tuesday, launching the latest legal battle seeking damages for what they claim are the costs of adapting to climate change. The lawsuit, filed in Colorado by the city of Boulder and the counties of San Miguel and Boulder, accuses Suncor and Exxon Mobil Corp of creating a public nuisance by producing and selling fossil fuels that cause climate change. Scientific consensus holds that carbon dioxide pollution from burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas and coal is the main cause of climate change. Suncor and Exxon “sold and promoted fossil fuels knowing that climate impacts were substantially certain to occur if unchecked fossil fuel use continued,” the communities said in the complaint. Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri called the lawsuit part of a misplaced effort to pin the global phenomenon of climate change on oil producers alone. Exxon is the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. “Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is a global issue and requires global participation and actions,” he said in emailed comments. A spokeswoman for Suncor, one of Canada’s biggest oil producers, said the company could not comment because it had not yet seen a copy of the lawsuit. Both Exxon and Suncor have operations in Colorado, the complaint said. The lawsuit is the latest in a growing body of legal action against oil companies over climate change. However, earlier cases have been filed by coastal communities including California and New York, and this is the first to be brought in the nation’s interior, officials behind the lawsuit said. Their region of Colorado is vulnerable to a wide range of climate threats, from droughts that imperil farming to warm winters that harm the ski industry, they said. “Climate change is not just about sea level rise. It affects all of us in the middle of the country as well,” said Elise Jones, a Boulder County commissioner, in a statement. The case is part of a growing trend, said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University in New York. “This is now, I think, the tenth lawsuit of the sort that has been filed in the United States against fossil fuel companies seeking damages for costs associated with climate change impacts,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In January, the San Francisco suburb of Richmond filed a similar climate change-related public nuisance lawsuit against 29 oil companies including Exxon.

2018-04-17,"(Reuters) - CSX Corp (CSX.O) easily topped Wall Street forecasts for first-quarter profit as the No. 3 U.S. railroad operator benefited from a cut-throat efficiency and cost-cutting drive, sending its shares 5 percent higher on Tuesday. CSX has been cutting jobs and the number of locomotives and rail cars it operates to boost profitability, as part of an overhaul launched by Hunter Harrison, the industry veteran who took over as CEO last year but passed away eight months after. “We are drastically changing the way we operate the railroad by taking millions of unnecessary steps out of the business process that we use to run the railroad,” CSX Chief Executive Jim Foote, who has promised to take Harrison’s turnaround effort forward, said on a call with analysts. “When there was a change in upper management, people kind of compensated and said ‘well we are not going to get what Hunter Harrison was going to give us’,” said Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman. “But with (Tuesday’s) result it’s possible that’s not true at all, and we’ll get exactly what Hunter had promised,” Sherman added. Jacksonville, Florida-based CSX said its operating ratio, which measures operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, fell to 63.7 percent in the first three months of 2018 from 73.2 percent a year earlier. CSX wants to bring operating ratio — a closely watched measure for railroads — down to 60 percent by 2020 through more cost cuts. The railroad operator said last month it would cut an estimated 2,200 jobs by the end of the year and 4,000 more in 2020. The company’s profit rose to $695 million in the three months ended March 31, from $362 million a year earlier. Results in the year-earlier quarter included restructuring expenses of $110 million. Excluding one-time items, CSX earned 78 cents per share, topping analysts’ average expectation of 66 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose slightly to $2.88 billion. Freight volumes, however, fell 3.8 percent, impacted by a decline across all of CSX’s markets including chemicals and agricultural products. Shares of CSX rose 4.6 percent to $59.19 in after-hours trading on Tuesday.

2018-04-17,"CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Tuesday two of its executives were arrested in Venezuela, a rare move likely to spook foreign energy firms still operating in the OPEC nation stricken by hyperinflation, shortages and crime.  Venezuelan Sebin intelligence agents burst into the Petropiar joint venture’s office in the coastal city of Puerto La Cruz on Monday and arrested the two Venezuelan employees for alleged wrongdoing, a half-dozen sources with knowledge of the detentions told Reuters. Venezuela’s Information Ministry and state-run company PDVSA did not respond to information requests about the detentions, which come amid a crackdown on alleged graft in the oil sector.  One of the detainees, Carlos Algarra, is a Venezuelan chemical engineer and expert in oil upgrading whom Chevron had brought in from its Argentina operations. The other, Rene Vasquez, is a procurement adviser, according to his LinkedIn profile.  The U.S. major confirmed the arrests, which are believed to be the first to affect a foreign oil company’s direct employees.  “Chevron Global Technology Services Company is aware that two of its Venezuelan-based employees have been arrested by local authorities,” Chevron said in a statement.  “We have contacted the local authorities to understand the basis of the detention and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these employees. Our legal team is evaluating the situation and working towards the timely release of these employees.”  A Chevron spokeswoman declined to provide further details on the case or the status of its operations. The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The executives were arrested after disagreements with their PDVSA counterparts over procurement processes, two of the sources said. The arrests highlight risks for foreign firms in Venezuela. Some insiders say a fracturing ruling elite is using the purge to wage turf wars or settle scores.  “Oil industry companies would do well to be cautious and stop assuming that good relations with PDVSA can last forever due to a common interest in pumping oil,” said Raul Gallegos, associate director with the consultancy Control Risks.  “The level of corruption in PDVSA, especially under a military administration, can and will trump production logic.” President Nicolas Maduro since last year has overseen the arrest of dozens of oil executives, including the former energy minister and PDVSA president.  The purge comes years after industry analysts began criticizing PDVSA for widespread graft. The government long decried such accusations as “smear campaigns,” but last year Maduro started blaming “thieves” for rampant graft in the oil sector. Vowing a cleanup, many jailed executives have been replaced with soldiers, but PDVSA’s unpopular management has spurred a wave of resignations.

2018-04-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s top aide on domestic energy issues, including biofuels quotas and scrapping Obama-era rules on car and power plant carbon emissions, is stepping down to return to the lobbying practice he left last year, a White House official said on Tuesday. Mike Catanzaro, who has worked in the Washington energy and politics arena for at least 15 years, became special assistant to President Donald Trump for domestic energy and environmental policy in February 2017, a role within the National Economic Council.  He will be replaced by Francis Brooke, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, who will start on April 30, the official said. Catanzaro previously served in the U.S. Senate, the Environmental Protection Agency, and in the White House under President George W. Bush. Under Trump, he worked at the White House with George David Banks, who handled international energy and environmental issues such as the president’s plan to leave the 2015 Paris climate accord.  Catanzaro, whose move was first reported by E&E News, joins other economics officials who have recently left the White House after a chaotic year. Banks resigned in February because of difficulties getting security clearance. Gary Cohn, who was Trump’s top economic adviser, resigned last month. Larry Kudlow, Cohn’s replacement, said in a release that Catanzaro’s dedication to Trump’s energy priorities was “greatly valued and he will be missed.” Catanzaro will return to CGCN Group, an advocacy and public relations company, as a consultant and adviser. Previously he worked at CGCN for clients who pushed Washington to lift a 40-year-old ban on oil exports as shale drilling led to explosive growth in crude output. Congress killed the ban in late 2015 after President Barack Obama’s administration had allowed exports of some light oil. CGCN managing partner Steve Clark said in a statement that Catanzaro’s White House experience “will be an invaluable resource” to clients and that the firm will make sure he complies with all relevant ethics guidelines.  Days after taking office in 2017, Trump, who promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, signed an executive order that said his appointees would refrain from lobbying their own agency for five years after leaving, although there is no criminal penalty for doing so. The White House aide also said Catanzaro will abide by all ethics rules that apply to lobbying the administration.  Under Pence, Brooke has had a low profile. Last year he moderated a panel at U.N. climate talks on how fossil fuels and nuclear power will be part of the energy future.

2018-04-17,"* Midcat seen key for independence from Russia gas exports * Experts say existing cross-border infrastructure underused * Teregas, Enagas want to invest in pipeline plan * French regulator questions need for project By Geert De Clercq PARIS, April 17 (Reuters) - A report prepared for the European Commission has questioned the economic viability of plans to build a gas pipeline connecting Spain and France, designed in part to help reduce Europe’s reliance on Russian piped gas, five sources told Reuters. The Commission has long backed the 3 billion euro ($3.7 billion) Midi-Catalonia (Midcat) pipeline that would more than double the amount of gas that can be piped across the Pyrenees mountains that border the two nations. French pipeline operator Terega, owned by Italy’s Snam, and Spain’s Enagas want to invest in the project, which they say would give Europe greater access to Spain’s numerous liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals. Midcat is also supported by European Union Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete, a Spanish national. But the project has faced opposition from French energy regulator CRE, who says Midcat would push up consumer prices without improving security. French gas network firm Engie-owned GRTgaz has also questioned the need for the pipeline. Now a study by Poyry, a consultancy appointed to assess the first phase of Midcat for the Commission, indicates the project is unlikely to be economically viable. It said it would only achieve “financially viability ... in scenarios with a tight LNG market”. It said such tightness in the gas market could be caused by a sharp fall in Algerian gas supplies to Europe, a scenario that sources said was unlikely. Experts said existing gas infrastructure across the Pyrenees is already underutilised, even during periods of high demand. “If there were a real demand for Midcat, the market would already have built those interconnectors,” said one of the sources familiar with the Poyry report. The report, which has not been published by the Commission but which was seen by Reuters, will be the basis for a Commission discussion on Wednesday of priority EU infrastructure plans termed Projects of Common Interest (PCI). The Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Poyry declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Terega said: “The project is in line with European objectives to reinforce flexibility and security.” The project has attracted criticism from politicians and environmental activists. “By pouring billions of public money into new fossil gas infrastructure, Europe would wave goodbye to the Paris agreement,” Friends of the Earth Europe’s Antoine Simon said. Spanish European Parliament member Xabier Benito Ziluaga said Madrid backed the plan to support its gas industry. His French colleague Michele Rivasi, who also opposes the plans, told Reuters: “The Midcat project is not coherent with the European Union’s climate commitments and its promises to reduce reliance on fossil energies.” ($1 = 0.8089 euros) Additional reporting by Alissa de Carbonel

2018-04-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday, as support from the possibility of supply disruptions and a strong equities market offset the effects of profit-taking following last week’s rally above three-year highs. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 gained 16 cents to settle at $71.58 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 30 cents to settle at $66.52. “It seems as though the volatility has, for the most part, dissipated and part of that can be attributed to the lack of escalation in the events over the weekend, and we have an S&P that’s a little bit stronger today,” said Brian LaRose, technical analyst at United-ICAP. The S&P 500 .SPX and the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI were both up about 1 percent Tuesday. [.N] Over the weekend, the United States and allies launched air strikes on Syria, raising concerns about continued access to regional crude supplies.  Such concerns compounded existing supply worries related to the possibility of renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran and falling output in troubled Venezuela.  Brent has risen 1.8 percent so far this month. It hit a peak last week of $73.09, the highest since late 2014. “The rally upwards was purely on geopolitical risk and if now we haven’t had any further stimulus, we’re seeing prices slip off a bit,” Natixis commodities strategist Joel Hancock said.  Still, analysts expected uncertainty over the Iran nuclear deal to continue to support prices through May 12, the deadline that U.S. President Donald Trump gave to Congress and European allies to “fix” the deal.  If Washington does not renew sanctions relief, Iran may have difficulty exporting crude. Bullish enthusiasm over the outlook for oil prices, however, might be contained by an increase in supplies in Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures.  “We’ve seen that front May-June spread in WTI swing back into contango today. And that’s somewhat of a bearish...it implies a continued up trend in Cushing crude supply,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates.  “There’s not much volatility today, as we wait for API and EIA data,” Ritterbusch said. The American Petroleum Institute publishes weekly U.S. inventory data later on Tuesday, while data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) is due Wednesday. “If we can...move higher tomorrow that would be a constructive sign,” said LaRose. “We want to see follow through in order to be sure that this is a break out and not a fake out,” he said.

K.C. hard red winter wheat , which tracks the crop being grown in the drought-stressed U.S. Plains, was up 2-1/2 cents at $4.80-1/2 a bushel. “Wheat saw a large drop on Monday on forecasts for much-needed rain in the U.S. Plains, which took a fair level of risk out of the market,” said Charles Clack, agricultural commodity analyst at Rabobank. “This could be viewed as presenting a good buying opportunity today with some regarding the market as oversold.” The USDA said late on Monday that 31 percent of the U.S. wheat crop is in good to excellent condition, up from 30 percent last week. A year ago, the crop was rated 54 percent good to excellent. CBOT May soybean futures were up 4 cents at $10.46 a bushel. Prices found support from early weakness at the 30-day moving average. China said on Tuesday it will slap a hefty temporary deposit on imports of U.S. sorghum, stirring trade tensions between the world’s top two economies. China is the biggest buyer of U.S. soybeans and any moves it makes on its commodity purchases ripples across the agriculture sector.

2018-04-17,"TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar is on course to strengthen in April for the eighth time in the last 10 years, a sequence strategists link to seasonal vitality in stocks and energy products, rewarding investors who trade on market patterns. The potential to predict repetitive returns appears to contradict the well-known hypothesis of financial market efficiency. Still, the loonie has climbed 2.7 percent since the start of the month against its U.S. counterpart, making it the top-performing G10 currency. “It is playing out really well again this year,” said Amo Sahota, director at Klarity FX in San Francisco. “We lighten up our (USD) positions in the month of March knowing that in April the Canadian dollar is going to get more expensive.” Strategists say the tendency for energy prices to rise ahead of the U.S. summer driving season gives the loonie a spring boost. “I think that dynamic is important,” said George Davis, chief technical strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “The broader commodity complex and crude oil have bullish seasonal windows through April.” The price of oil, one of Canada’s major exports, has rallied this month to its highest in more than three years. Also bullish for the currency, the discount between Canadian crude and the U.S. benchmark has been cut in half since March to less than $15. April has also brought cheer to Wall Street, with the S&P 500  climbing in nine of the last 10 Aprils and on track to do so again this year. Historically, the Canadian dollar has correlated very well with the S&P 500 and other indicators of risk appetite, said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities.  Investors’ willingness to take risk often signals confidence in the outlook for the global economy, which is important for a trade-dependent country like Canada. To be sure, recent improvement in the prospects of a deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which could be welcomed by the Bank of Canada when it updates its projections on Wednesday for the domestic economy, is not a recurring event.  The Canadian dollar has also outperformed in April against the Mexican peso, which strategists say is the best proxy for the chances of a NAFTA deal being reached. A 1.9 percent April gain on average over the past 10 years is the best by far of any month for the loonie. But the currency has often declined during the following month, and investors may want to keep in mind a stock market adage that warns of a seasonally weaker period on Wall Street. “The ‘Sell in May (and go away)’ phenomenon kicks in” and the correlation between equities and the Canadian dollar starts to work in the opposite direction, McCormick said.

2018-04-17,"(Adds background on March offshore lease sale in last two paragraphs) By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Tuesday he will not lower royalty rates for offshore oil and gas lease sales “at this time” despite a recommendation from an advisory panel to do so. Zinke cited the success of President Donald Trump’s energy strategy as a reason for not adhering to the recommendation of his appointed Royalty Policy Committee, which in late February advised him to slash the royalty rate for offshore drilling by nearly one-third to 12.5 percent. “Right now, we can maintain higher royalties from our offshore waters without compromising the record production and record exports our nation is experiencing,” Zinke said. The committee’s late February recommendation to lower the royalty rate companies pay on petroleum produced in federal offshore waters to 12.5 percent from 18.75 percent was meant to encourage more U.S. energy production. Democrats and environmental groups decried the recommendation as a giveaway to some of the most profitable companies in the world that would rob taxpayers of revenues. Vincent DeVito, the chair of Zinke’s Royalty Policy Committee, said Tuesday’s decision reflected improving market conditions for the oil and gas industry. Last month, oil and gas drillers bid on only a tiny fraction of Gulf of Mexico acreage offered in the largest lease sale in American history, which Zinke said would be a “bellwether” of industry demand in the region. When asked about whether there was data supporting the policy committee’s recommendation last month at a Senate hearing, Zinke said there was no data yet but there was an argument to be made for lowering the royalty rate.

2018-04-17,"WASHINGTON, April 17 (Reuters) - The top White House official on domestic energy issues, including biofuels quotas and upending Obama-era rules on car and power plant emissions, is stepping down to return to the lobbying practice he left last year, the firm said on Tuesday. Mike Catanzaro became special assistant to President Donald Trump for domestic energy and environmental policy in February last year, a role within the National Economic Council. Catanzaro previously served in the Environmental Protection Agency and in the White House under President George W. Bush. Under Trump, he worked at the White House with George David Banks, who handled international energy and environmental issues such as the president’s plan to leave the 2015 Paris climate accord. Catanzaro joins other officials on economics who have recently left the White House. Banks resigned in February because of difficulties getting security clearance. Their boss, Gary Cohn, who was Trump’s top economic adviser, resigned last month. Next week Catanzaro will return to CGCN Group, an advocacy and public relations company, where he worked for energy clients who wanted Washington to lift a 40-year-old ban on U.S. oil exports as U.S. crude output exploded, thanks to shale drilling. Congress killed the ban in late 2015 after President Barack Obama’s administration had allowed exports of some light oil. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Catanzaro’s move, which was first reported by E&E News. CGCN managing partner Steve Clark said in a statement that Catanzaro’s experience in the White House “will be an invaluable resource for current and future clients and we will make every effort to ensure his work complies with all relevant ethics guidelines.” Days after taking office in 2017, Trump, who promised to “drain the swamp” of Washington, put restrictions on the types of lobbying that White House aides can accept after they leave government. Trump signed an executive order that said his appointees would refrain from lobbying their own agency for five years after leaving, although there is no criminal penalty for doing so.

2018-04-17,"CARACAS/HOUSTON, April 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela arrested two Chevron Corp employees, the U.S. oil major said on Tuesday, in what appeared to be the first arrests of a foreign oil company’s direct employees during a purge of alleged graft in the OPEC nation. Venezuelan intelligence agents arrested the two Venezuelan executives at the Petropiar joint venture in the coastal city of Puerto La Cruz on Monday for alleged wrongdoing, two sources in the oil industry told Reuters. One of the detainees, Carlos Luis Algarra, is a refining expert whom Chevron had drafted in from its Argentina operations, a third source said. Chevron confirmed the detentions in an emailed statement to Reuters on Tuesday. “Chevron Global Technology Services Company is aware that two of its Venezuelan-based employees have been arrested by local authorities on April 16th, 2018. We have contacted the local authorities to understand the basis of the detention and to ensure the safety and wellbeing of these employees. Our legal team is evaluating the situation and working towards the timely release of these employees,” the company said. Chevron declined to provide further details. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Leftist President Nicolas Maduro has since last year overseen a major crackdown on alleged graft in Venezuela, with dozens of oil executives, including the former oil minister and president of state oil company PDVSA, now behind bars. The purge comes years after industry analysts and opposition politicians began criticizing PDVSA management for widespread graft. A report by the opposition-led Congress in 2016 said at least $11 billion went “missing” at PDVSA between 2004 and 2014. For years, the government decried such accusations as “smear campaigns” against socialism and in favor of a U.S.-backed coup. But Maduro, who is running for re-election next month, later changed his tone. He now blames “thieves” and “traitors” for an economic crisis so severe that disease and malnutrition are spreading unchecked by a broken public health system. Vowing a cleanup, Maduro replaced many of the jailed executives with soldiers. But the major general now in charge of the oil industry has quickly alienated PDVSA’s embattled upper echelon and its rank-and-file, spurring thousands of resignations that further threaten to hurt the ailing industry.

An estimated 1,796 tonnes of butane gas leaked from the LPG tanker involved but this posed no danger to shipping and measures had been taken by the ship’s crew to stop the leak, MPA said in a statement. “As liquefied butane has a high evaporation rate, MPA has assessed that any leaked butane would have been carried southward away from mainland Singapore, where most of it would have rapidly dissipated to below flammable levels within an hour and pose no risk to shipping,” it said. The collision was between Singapore-registered LPG tanker Crystal Sunrise, chartered by Japanese firm Gyxis, and a westbound Greece-registered tanker, Astro Saturn, chartered by European trading house Trafigura, market and shipping sources said. “We can confirm that the Astro Saturn is on TC (time charter) to Trafigura and is carrying fuel oil,” a Trafigura spokeswoman said, without elaborating. According to data from Thomson Reuters Eikon, Crystal Sunrise is a Very Large Gas Carrier (VLGC) with a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 54,070 tonnes carrying Middle Eastern origin LPG. Astro Saturn is an Aframax with a DWT of 105,167 tonnes and is anchored at Tanjung Pelepas in Johor, Malaysia, but close to Singapore. According to MPA, the Crystal Sunrise was picking up her pilot near the designated western pilot boarding ground when the collision took place about one nautical mile south of Tuas Extension. The vessel sustained damage to her ballast tank in the collision while Astro Saturn sustained damage to her port anchor and bow. Both ships have been stabilised and no injuries were reported. But eight staff from PSA Marine, a marine services provider, who were in the vicinity of the collision, were given medical check-ups as a precaution.

2018-04-17,"April 17 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy will spend $105.5 million to fund 70 projects aimed at advancing solar energy technologies and smoothing their integration into the electricity grid, it said on Tuesday. The funding will be split among four areas of research: photovoltaics, concentrating solar, workforce development and grid integration, DOE said in a statement. Technologies that focus on integrating solar onto the grid, like power electronics, energy storage and sensors, will receive the largest share of the funding at $46 million. Late last year, DOE said the cost of solar energy had hit a U.S. government target three years ahead of schedule, prompting it to change the focus of its solar program to integrating higher levels of the renewable power source with the grid . The most widely used solar technology, photovoltaics, will receive up to $27 million. Those projects will aim to halve the cost of generating power from the sun’s light by 2030 to 3 cents per kilowatt hour, DOE said. Concentrating solar power technologies, which use the sun’s heat to generate power, will receive $24 million. CSP is far more expensive than photovoltaic solar panels, and the United States has only a few such projects. Job training and other workforce initiatives will receive up to $8.5 million, DOE said. The Solar Energy Industries Association, the industry’s primary trade group in Washington, cheered DOE’s announcement, calling it “a positive step in strengthening this important public-private relationship between the federal government and the American solar industry.” SEIA has been at odds with the Trump administration this year over tariffs imposed on imports of solar panels in January. The group argued vehemently against the tariffs, saying they would drive up the cost of solar and lead to job losses. Awards will range between $200,000 and $4.5 million, DOE said. DOE will start receiving applications for funding next month, and decisions are expected to be announced in September.

Italy’s Enel SpA has offered to pay 28 reais per Eletropaulo share, the two companies said. Enel’s offer came hours after Neoenergia SA (NEOE3B.SO), controlled by Spain’s Iberdrola SA (IBE.MC) and Brazilian pension funds, said it would pay 25.51 reais per share. Shares in Eletropaulo jumped 24 percent to 27.30 reais on Tuesday afternoon trading in Sao Paulo. Enel, an Italian utility that has invested in fast-growing Latin America to offset sluggish European markets, said in a statement that its investment would total up to around 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion). “The transaction is in line with the Enel Group’s current strategic plan and, if successfully executed, would mark another step forward in strengthening the group’s presence in the Brazilian distribution sector,” it said. Eletropaulo is the power distributor in Brazil’s largest and richest metropolitan area, Sao Paulo, and is one of the few private utilities that is up for sale. According to Eletropaulo’s security filing, Enel’s offer would be conditional on Eletropaulo canceling a previously proposed share issue. Earlier on Tuesday, Eletropaulo announced its board had approved the issue of 58.9 million new shares, equivalent to a 26 percent stake.   Neoenergia’s rival offer includes the commitment to buy that stake, paying 25.51 reais per share. Eletropaulo had agreed to sell the stake to Neoenergia as long as other investors do not bid higher than the 25.51 reais, according to the filings. If it succeeds in acquiring the minority stake, Neoenergia said it would acquire the rest of Eletropaulo’s shares, at a total cost of 5.7 billion reais ($1.7 billion).

2018-04-17,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations’ Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths said on Tuesday he plans to present a plan for negotiations within two months to end the conflict, but warned that any new military offensives could “take peace off the table.” A proxy war is playing out in Yemen between Iran and Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015, backing government forces fighting Iran-allied Houthi rebels. Iran has denied supplying weapons to the Houthis. Griffiths, a former British diplomat who replaced Mauritania’s Ould Cheikh Ahmed as the U.N. Special Envoy last month, briefed the U.N. Security Council for the first time on Tuesday. “My plan is to put to the (Security) Council within the next two months a framework for negotiations,” Griffiths said.  He warned, however, there were unconfirmed reports that movements of forces in Yemen are on the increase and the prospect of intense military operations around the Houthi-held port city of Hodeidah “may soon be forthcoming.” “Our concern is that any of these developments may in a stroke, take peace off the table,” he said. “We all need urgently and creatively to find ways to diminish the chances of these game-changing events, upsetting and derailing the hopes of the great majority of Yemenis.” Yemen’s U.N. Ambassador Khaled Hussein Mohamed Alyemany told reporters: “We don’t have the intention to advance on Hodeidah.”Coalition and Yemeni forces have made modest territorial gains in recent months against the group in an armed push moving northward from the Bab al-Mandab strait towards Hodeidah on the Red Sea, where 80 percent of Yemen’s crucial food imports arrive. The war has killed more than 10,000 people, displaced more than 2 million and driven the country to the verge of famine. The Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles at Saudi Arabia, which the United States and U.N. experts say were of Iranian origin. Tehran denies the charge.  U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Tuesday she would continue to push the Security Council for accountability.  “To achieve enduring peace in Yemen, Iran must stop its interference and its violations of the arms embargo this Council imposed,” Haley told the council.  The Saudi-led coalition has conducted thousands of air strikes targeting Houthi fighters and has often hit civilian areas, although it denies ever doing so intentionally. “We have called on all parties to take appropriate measures to mitigate the risk of civilian casualties,” Haley said. “The United States is working to offer support to the Saudi-led Coalition, while minimizing civilian casualties.” Reporting by Michelle Nichols; editing by Chizu Nomiyama and G Crosse",https://uk.reuters.com/article/yemen-security-un/update-1-u-n-yemen-mediator-to-come-up-with-talks-framework-in-two-months-idUKL1N1RU138,17 Apr 2018,"The United Nations'

2018-04-17,"(Updates with details, comments; adds bylines) By Jarrett Renshaw and Chris Prentice NEW YORK, April 17 (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of senators from U.S. farm states pressed the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday to stop issuing hardship waivers from the nation’s biofuels laws to refiners and to name the companies that already have them. The request is the latest sign of rising tensions over the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, or RFS, a controversial law requiring refiners to mix billions of gallons of biofuels into the nation’s gasoline and diesel supplies that has split the powerful corn and oil lobbies. The EPA has provided more than two dozen hardship waivers to refineries in recent months - exempting them from the program - in an attempt to help the industry cope with compliance costs, according to an agency source. The agency typically issues fewer than a dozen a year, according to a former official. Biofuels advocates say that excessive use of the waivers undermines the Renewable Fuel Standard by weakening demand for biofuels like corn-based ethanol. A federal judge in August said the EPA’s criteria for awarding exemptions was too strict, reversing a denial for Sinclair Oil and enticing others to apply. The waivers are intended for small facilities that would face “disproportionate economic hardship” if they comply with the RFS. EPA grants them in secret, arguing the information is business confidential. Reuters has reported, however, that at least one large and profitable company, Andeavor, is among the firms whose plants recently received exemptions, and that other big companies like Chevron Corp and Exxon Mobil also have applied. “Recent reports indicate dozens of small refiner waivers have been secretly granted to large, multibillion-dollar companies under the guise of the small refinery hardship exemption,” the 13 senators wrote in a letter to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. “This is extremely concerning to us,” they added. The group of senators was led by Republican Chuck Grassley from Iowa and Democrat Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota, both states with significant ethanol industries. The letter was dated Friday, April 13, but released by the senators to the public only on Tuesday. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman said halting the hardship waiver program would be a violation of the RFS. “EPA doesn’t have the authority to pick and choose which provisions of the RFS to follow,” she said. “The Agency has been both responsive and open about small refinery waivers, while being careful not to violate confidential business information protections,” she added. Last week, five of the senators called on President Donald Trump to halt use of the waivers temporarily. The RFS was implemented in 2005 to help farmers, reduce pollution, and cut petroleum imports. The program now requires the refining industry to ensure some 15 billion gallons of ethanol are added to the nation’s fuel mix. Refiners must prove their compliance by acquiring government-awarded blending credits - either by earning them or purchasing them from rivals. Oil companies have said the credits are costly and that the program needs to be reformed or repealed. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, home to several small refineries, applauded the expansion of the exemption program. “EPA, working with the Energy Department, must conduct a detailed, objective analysis based on confidential business information. They must look at each small refinery on an individual basis whether or not it is part of a larger company. “During the Obama administration, EPA didn’t follow the law and the courts rebuked the agency,” Barrasso said in a statement issued on Tuesday.

2018-04-17,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of demonstrators rallied in the centre of the Armenian capital on Tuesday to protest as parliament voted to allow former president Serzh Sarksyan to become prime minister in the former Soviet republic. Sarksyan was president from 2008 and demonstrators said he was switching jobs but clinging to power. Under a revised constitution approved by referendum in 2015, the prime minister will hold power while the presidency becomes largely ceremonial. Sarksyan’s ally Armen Sarkissian was sworn in as president last week after being elected by parliament and in March Sarksyan said he would become prime minister to allow him to share the benefit of his experience. “I have enough influence and power to make the executive and legislative branches of power work effectively,” Sarksyan told parliament on Tuesday. Parliament voted 77 to 17 in favour of his appointment. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning. The protesters massed in the main square and surrounded or blocked entrances to governments buildings and organised sit-ins. Local media said protests were also underway in Armenia’s two other big cities - Gyumri and Vanadzor. Police warned demonstrators to disperse or face tear gas. On Monday, dozens were injured in scuffles with police and around 80 protesters were arrested, police said. Opposition activists also held rallies in recent weeks to protest Sarksyan’s campaign to become prime minister and thousands blocked the centre of the capital Yerevan. “I am declaring a start of a peaceful, velvet revolution in Armenia,” opposition MP Nikol Pashinyan told protesters in central Yerevan, many of whom were young people with no affiliation to a political party.

Strong U.S. earnings from Netflix, Goldman Sachs and healthcare companies boosted stock prices on Wall Street and optimism about what is expected to be the strongest earnings season in seven years. Companies on the benchmark S&P 500 stock index are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, according to Thomson Reuters data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 255.24 points, or 1.04 percent, to 24,828.28, the S&P 500 gained 28.48 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,706.32 and the Nasdaq Composite added 115.92 points, or 1.62 percent, to 7,272.20. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.74 percent. European shares advanced, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rising 0.91 percent and poised to close higher. Germany’s Deutsche Boerse DAX index was last up 1.58 percent, despite fears of a trade war with the United States and the current tension in Syria pushing German investor morale to its lowest level in more than five years in April. “This (German data) has been a solid leading indicator in the past to a downturn,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. In China, stocks in Shanghai closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp hurt tech stocks. Beijing then said it would slap a hefty temporary tariff on U.S. sorghum imports, which sent grain futures prices jumping. Also weighing on the region was data showing March industrial output in China missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed. However, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, unchanged from the previous quarter. The country’s March retail sales also jumped over 10 percent, the strongest pace in four months. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.36 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.06 percent. The euro fell slightly after rising above $1.24 to a three-week high on the Chinese data, ebbing Syria retaliation fears and overall renewed risk sentiment. “There’s been a general weakness in the dollar and risk sentiment seems to be reviving somewhat. That is supporting the euro but also sterling and Asian currencies,” said Alvin Tan, FX strategist at Societe Generale. The dollar index rose 0.19 percent, with the euro down 0.25 percent to $1.2347. Sterling was last at $1.4304, down 0.22 percent on the day, after hitting nearly $1.438, its highest since British voters decided in June 2016 to exit the European Union. U.S. sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal drove aluminium prices to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed it all. Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil prices steadied as investors took profit on last week’s rally and amid concern over the potential for supply disruptions. U.S. crude fell 0.32 percent to $66.01 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.20, down 0.31 percent on the day. Additional Reporting by Marc Jones and Tommy Wilkes in London,

2018-04-17,"(Adds detail, updates prices) MOSCOW, April 17 (Reuters) - The rouble weakened in volatile trade on Tuesday after a brief attempt to regain ground, as the market continued to digest the implications of U.S. sanctions imposed against Russia. The U.S. envoy to the United Nations said on Sunday Washington was preparing further sanctions on Russia, though administration officials said on Monday President Donald Trump was unlikely to approve new measures unless Moscow carries out a new cyber attack or some other provocation. The rouble eased 0.6 percent to 61.52 against the dollar as of 1517 GMT, after briefly touching the 60 mark, its strongest level since April 9, when the sanctions-driven sell-off gathered steam. “Geopolitics will continue to have a serious impact on the Russian market in the mid- and longer-term,” analysts at Bank St Petersburg said in a note. “Non-residents remain worried about the prospects of a sanctions race and their impact on Russian assets,” they said, adding that the rouble was likely to trade within a range of 61-63 per dollar in the coming days. The United States on April 6 imposed sanctions against Russian entities and individuals to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and what the U.S. Treasury Department dubbed other “malign activity”. Moscow has denied the allegations. Washington is now considering further sanctions over Russia’s role in the Syrian conflict, while Moscow’s possible reaction to the U.S. measures has added to risk aversion in Russian markets. Last week, Russian lawmakers reacted to the U.S. sanctions already announced by proposing a wide list of retaliatory measures. But with Russian businesses warning that they could hurt Russia more than the West, a decision on the counter-measures has been postponed until mid-May. On the stock market, shares in Sberbank, Russia’s top lender that on Tuesday promised to double dividends for 2017, rallied 8.0 percent. Shares in Russian aluminium producer Rusal, targeted by the latest U.S. sanctions, rose 8.3 percent. Still, Rusal shares were nearly 40 percent cheaper than before the U.S. sanctions. The benchmark rouble-traded MOEX index climbed 1.9 percent to 2,184.5, retaining support from prices for oil, with Brent crude oil rising 0.1 percent to $71.5 a barrel.

2018-04-17,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s drive to build a large power-generating turbine to lessen its dependence on Western technology has suffered a major set-back after a prototype broke beyond repair, two sources familiar with the project told Reuters. In the past few years Russia has imported the large-capacity gas turbines required to run modern power stations from firms such as Siemens (SIEGn.DE), GE (GE.N) and Alstom (ALSO.PA). After Western sanctions were imposed on Russia over the conflict with Ukraine four years ago, Russian President Vladimir Putin urged officials to replace imported technology with home-grown substitutes in energy, software, aerospace and medicine. The mishap with the 110 Megawatt turbine, a capacity large enough to power a sizeable town, underlines the technical challenges. Testing was underway on a prototype 110 MW turbine at the Saturn engineering plant in Rybinsk, central Russia, in December last year according to one of the two sources, who are both in the energy sector and familiar with the results of the tests. “The turbine fell apart,” said the first source, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. “They tried to repair it in time for March, but they did not manage it.” March was the target date for completion of tests on the turbine. Putin, in power since 1999, won a second consecutive term in an election on March 18. The first source, and a second source, both said it was not possible to rebuild the prototype turbine and the project would have to start again with new equipment. “The turbine broke up,” said the second source, who requested anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. “There’s no turbine, that’s it.” Without any home-grown equivalents, Russia should in most cases still be able to buy turbines from Western suppliers, but U.S. and European Union sanctions have made it harder to import Western power technology under certain circumstances. Last year Russia clandestinely delivered turbines made by Siemens to a power station in Crimea, which is subject to sanctions, and the European Union retaliated by imposing extra sanctions on officials and companies involved in the operation. Set-backs to the domestic turbine programme could hamper the modernisation of power generation if growing tensions with Western states result in tighter sanctions since Russia’s modernisation plan is focused on using gas turbines. The technical hitch also carries a potential political cost: Putin has publicly trumpeted progress in replacing Western technology imports, so any failures will jar with the picture of success he has painted. The new turbine is being developed by a consortium of ODK, a unit of state-owned conglomerate Rostec that owns the Saturn factory where the testing was being conducted, Russian state technology firm RUSNANO, and state energy firm InterRAO. In a statement, ODK said one of the mechanisms of the prototype turbine had malfunctioned. It said that would delay work on the project, but could be fixed. “It is not fatal for the project.” It said set-backs were to be expected since this was a pioneering project for Russia. RUSNANO acknowledged there had been an accident but gave no details. It said it remained committed to the turbine project and expects it will be completed. InterRAO declined to comment. Russia’s Trade and Industry Ministry, which oversees the machine-building sector, declined to comment and referred questions to Rostec. Large capacity gas turbines have been in use around the world for years but their construction is tricky to perfect. Because they operate at extremely high speeds and high temperatures, they need to be engineered to very precise standards and they use sophisticated electronic control systems to make sure that they operate efficiently. For many years Russia made no major investment in developing the technology because it was able to import the turbines or the know-how to produce them. A scheme started in the 1990s to develop a large-capacity turbine produced prototypes but they did not go into production. At a meeting in Russia’s second city of Saint Petersburg in May last year, chaired by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said a 110 MW turbine had been developed and testing should be completed by March 2018. “This is the first Russian produced powerful machine with 100-percent domestic manufacture and it will, of course, help us to completely substitute purchases of foreign equipment of this capacity,” Novak told the meeting. His ministry did not respond to questions on Tuesday about the set-back.

Chinese data that provided a bit of something for everyone had kept Asia in check, but Europe was going for its third rise in four days and Wall Street was pointing higher as latest earnings from Goldman Sachs and Netflix pleased traders. More signs that China is opening up its economy and a ‘hotline’ being set up between North and South Korea helped too, while steadier bond and gold markets showed investors were also gradually shifting attention away from Syria tensions. Some of the upward moves though, including gains for sterling, metals and Russia’s rouble after Washington had held off from fresh sanctions, had started to reverse as profit-taking kicked in. “It looks like China may be willing to cooperate with the U.S. so that might be spurring risk appetite and the positive mood in markets,” said Rabobank analyst Bas Van Geffen. But there were still some trade war tensions being felt. Stocks in Shanghai closed near a one-year low, after a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp had hit tech stocks. Beijing then said it would slap a hefty temporary tariff on U.S. sorghum imports, which sent grain futures prices jumping. A plunge in German investor morale to its lowest in more than five years was also blamed on the trade war worries. “This (German data) has been a solid leading indicator in the past to a downturn,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy, as the euro swiftly slid back below $1.2365. China’s economic data meanwhile showed its economy grew 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year, unchanged from the previous quarter. March retail sales jumped over 10 percent too, the strongest pace in four months, though other figures saw industrial output miss expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed. The main S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq stock futures were up over 0.5 percent ahead of the Wall Street restart as a 27 percent rise in Goldman Sachs’ quarterly profit and strong earnings from Netflix and Johnson & Johnson all boosted optimism over what is expected to be a strong earnings season. Goldman’s 23 percent increase in fixed income trading revenue was in sharp contrast to those of larger rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co, which reported a flat number, and Citigroup , where it fell 7 percent. S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. Commodity markets meanwhile were still focused on the geopolitical situation in Syria and the fallout from U.S. sanctions on Russia. Buoyed by growing expectations over tighter supply in the aftermath of sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal, aluminium prices jumped to almost $2,500 a tonne, their highest since mid 2011, before profit-taking reversed it all. Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil steadied at $66.26 a barrel for U.S. crude and $71.43 a barrel for Brent, having tumbled nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over the Middle East eased. In another sign of the returning risk appetite, the yen fell flat at 107 per dollar and Southern European government debt outperformed better-rated peers. “We have had a long enough period of extended volatility now that some of the more extended positions in risk assets have been reduced, so that is also a positive,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. On sterling, which was buying just over $1.43, he added that with so much good Brexit news priced in by investors in recent weeks and rate hike bets growing, it was difficult to see how much further it could go. U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on Monday about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies continued to weigh somewhat on the dollar, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants a weaker currency. “It was a warning shot at China and Russia about devaluation. China has devalued their currency in the past,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin then said during a television interview early on Tuesday. “He’s watching it.” (Additional Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo Editing by Catherine Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-shares-rise-as-risk-appetite-recovers-goldman-roars-on-wall-street-idUKL8N1RU47Z,17 Apr 2018,"* Goldman Sachs sees 27 pct Q1 profit rise, Netflix

2018-04-17,"ZURICH (Reuters) - ABB (ABBN.S) faces renewed shareholder demands to break up its sprawling business empire and to start by ditching its struggling power grids division. The power and automation company reports first-quarter figures on Thursday, with investors braced for another tepid performance from power grids — its largest but least profitable division, which it decided to keep in 2016. Concerned by weak share performance since then, investors say ABB should simplify operations ranging from industrial plugs and fittings to electric motors for ships and factories.  “ABB is too big, it is too complicated and the company would gain significantly by achieving more focus,” said David Samra, portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, ABB’s fifth-largest shareholder with a 1.6 percent stake. “So far we have seen no evidence of an underlying improvement in power grids, nor in the company as a whole,” he told Reuters. Artisan, which describes itself as a long-term value-oriented investor, said that ABB should follow rivals Siemens  (SIEGn.DE) and Honeywell International (HON.N) in streamlining. Siemens floated its medical equipment business (SHLG.DE) as part of its drive to attract investors for businesses outside its core industrial engineering and automation operations. It also separated its wind power operations.  Honeywell, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, will also divest divisions. In contrast, ABB insisted in 2016 on keeping the power grids business — which makes transformers, substations and semiconductors to transmit electricity — despite pressure from Cevian Capital, its second-largest shareholder, to spin it off. Power Grids generated sales of $10.4 billion in 2017, accounting for 30 percent of ABB’s $34.3 billion in sales. Cevian argued that ABB was too complex and projected that separation would produce two companies with a combined share price of 35 Swiss francs. Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in October 2016 that ABB could reach a 35 franc share price while remaining intact. ABB stock has lost 15 percent this year to trade at about 22 francs. The CEO, who took charge in September 2013, has supervised a more than three-year reorganisation that has yet to pay off, with the company hit by a collapse in demand from the oil and gas market.  Spiesshofer has quit some businesses to improve the power grids division’s performance, selling high-voltage cables and exiting the engineering, procurement and construction business last year. “ABB has evolved significantly as we have strengthened and streamlined the business and we are making good progress against our strategic goals,” a company spokesman said. “Management and board are fully aligned.” One top-20 investor, who asked not to be named, said that Spiesshofer is under tremendous pressure, adding: “I am quite disappointed, in a very strong economy the company is treading water, if it does not perform now, when will it ever?” However, ABB’s biggest shareholder Investor AB supports the strategy.  “We believe the key focus for ABB is to execute on the transformation of Power Grids, continue to invest for the future and strengthen customer focus and cost efficiency,” the Swedish investor said. Fidelity, which has ABB as a top-10 holding in its Swiss fund, questioned the structure, adding that 2018 could bring limited growth and struggling profitability. “From the outside, there are some areas, like power grids,  that don’t really fit for many reasons — end markets, growth drivers or margin profile,” fund manager Andrea Fornoni told Reuters. “I don’t think this is something that necessarily needs to be done over the next six months, but over time a stronger view should be taken on this.” Thursday’s results are unlikely to provide much respite, with Power Grids’ revenues and profitability slipping, a Reuters poll showed.  Christer Gardell, managing partner at Cevian, has said he was disappointed with ABB’s performance since the 2016 decision. “The decision the board made a year and a half ago regarding the structure of ABB seems to have been wrong,” he told Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri this month. ABB shares have risen 1 percent since the decision, against a 17 percent gain for the Stoxx European industrial sector index .SXNP. “We want to see proof that the synergies and the advantage they [ABB] argue are there in keeping the structure intact are materialised in higher growth and profitability than for competitors,” said John Hernander, portfolio manager at ABB shareholder Nordea.

2018-04-17,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy last year, is now “lean and mean and ready to get to work” on its projects to build nuclear reactors in India, U.S. energy secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday. The show of support by Perry came after Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse’s bankruptcy filing had raised doubts about the proposed construction of six nuclear reactors in India’s Andhra Pradesh state. The agreement to build reactors, announced in 2016, was the result of a decade of diplomatic efforts as part of a U.S.-India civil nuclear agreement signed in 2008. “Nobody in the world makes better reactors than Westinghouse,” Perry told journalists after a meeting with India’s oil and gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan in New Delhi. “They had some challenges in the past from its business practices. We leave that where it is. The bottom line is, that’s all behind them. They are lean and mean and ready to get to the work.” Westinghouse, owned by Japan’s Toshiba Corp (6502.T) which is to be bought by a unit of Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc (BAMa.TO) (BAM.N), is one of the world’s leading suppliers of nuclear fuel and provides some form of service to 80 percent of the world’s 450 commercial reactors. Perry and Pradhan released a joint statement to “reaffirm their strong commitment to early and full implementation of our civil nuclear partnership, including the Westinghouse civil nuclear project”. They also said the two countries would deepen cooperation on oil and gas, power, renewable energy and coal. “In keeping with the shared objectives to provide a stronger business orientation to our energy cooperation, both sides noted with appreciation the growing investment of Indian companies in the United States and the beginning of oil and gas exports from the United States to India,” they said in the statement. The United States under President Donald Trump has been looking to sell more energy products to India, the world’s third-biggest buyer of oil. Pradhan said India wants to buy more U.S. crude oil “subject to reasonable pricing”. New Delhi has also sought U.S. companies’ participation in India’s strategic petroleum reserves.

2018-04-17,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 17 (Reuters) - The price of seaborne thermal coal in Asia may come under pressure as China moves to impose some import restrictions on imports of the polluting fuel. Several ports in southern and eastern China have introduced controls on coal imports, ranging from bans on unloadings to tightening customs clearances. Among ports banning imports is the Chuanshon anchorage at Ningbo port, according to a manager at a coal trading house quoted by Reuters on Monday, while Zhoushan near Shanghai is restricting the number of vessels allowed to dock. What is not clear yet is just how severe these restrictions are, how widespread they will become and how long they will last. What does appear somewhat clearer is that the authorities in Beijing wish to restrict growth in coal imports in order to support domestic coal prices and encourage an increase in local production. Certainly, news of the restrictions boosted domestic prices, with benchmark thermal coal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange jumping almost 3 percent on Monday to close at 570.2 yuan ($90.94) a tonne. This was the biggest gain since August last year, although the price is still well below the highest closing price so far this year, which was 678 yuan a tonne reached on Jan. 29. While the authorities don’t officially target domestic coal prices, it’s widely believed in the industry that a range anchored around 550 yuan a tonne is a level that Beijing feels provides miners with sufficient revenue while not unduly boosting costs for power generators. It’s also currently a price level that makes domestic coal attractive versus seaborne supplies, especially once the duties and taxes on imported coal are taken into account. The spot thermal coal price at Australia’s Newcastle port closed at $93 a tonne on Monday, up a mere 0.2 percent from Friday’s close. The price is also down about 15 percent from the peak so far this year of $109.50 a tonne, reached on Jan. 17. It’s not unusual for prices to retreat after the peak winter demand period, but the risk for the seaborne market is that the restrictions on imports in China actually cuts into demand. Imports of all types of coal rose 16.6 percent to 75.41 million tonnes in the first three months of 2018, compared to the same period last year, according to China’s preliminary customs data. While not as fast a pace of increase as in the first quarter of 2017, it’s likely that the authorities would rather see coal imports retreat rather than rise. Much will depend on the nature of the restrictions being put in place, making it key to track imports to try and calculate if they are dropping more than what may be seasonally expected. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts suggest April may see a drop in China’s coal imports. Filtering the data to show cargoes already discharged, or awaiting discharge, as well as those already en route to a Chinese port and expected to unload by the end of the month shows imports are likely to be around 17.6 million tonnes in April. Even if this figure does increase somewhat by the arrival of more cargoes from close-to-China suppliers such as Indonesia, it’s still likely that April’s imports will be below the seaborne imports of 23.2 million tonnes in March, the 20.8 million in February and the 21.4 million in January reported by Thomson Reuters. Again, a drop in China’s imports in the shoulder season between winter and summer won’t be too concerning for coal exporters, but any sign of a sustained downturn will likely result in prices of export coal coming under pressure. The domestic price of thermal coal normally tracks Newcastle prices, although a divergence is possible, with a notable occurrence being in late 2016 when seaborne prices surged as Chinese buyers stocked up for winter. It’s possible that a policy-driven event such as the current restrictions on imports could strengthen domestic prices relative to seaborne cargoes.

2018-04-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Legal & General Investment Management, one of Europe’s biggest asset managers, has written to the chief executives of some of the world’s top companies calling for more action on female representation on boards, gender pay gaps and climate change. LGIM, the fund arm of insurer Legal & General (LGEN.L), which manages nearly 1 trillion pounds ($1.4 trillion) in assets, has taken a lead in improving corporate governance and its voting intentions are keenly watched, particularly by major corporations, in which it is often a leading shareholder. In a shot across the bows for a number of companies, LGIM said it would vote against British companies where women did not represent at least a quarter of the board, and wanted a full breakdown of any gender pay gap and plans to close it. “The vast majority of companies are making significant progress – we simply believe there is more to be done,” Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at LGIM, said. It also said boards should consider creating an advisory committee of external experts to help challenge consensus views. LGIM’s tougher stance was backed up by industry trade body the Investment Association, which said it had written a separate letter to 35 FTSE 350 companies that it had singled out, calling on them to improve boardroom gender diversity. They included oil giant BP (BP.L) and Britain’s second-biggest builder Persimmon (PSN.L). BP and Persimmon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “The body of research is clear: firms with a diverse management team and pipeline make better decisions and drive innovation,” the Investment Association’s Chief Executive Chris Cummings said. The association’s members manage nearly 7 trillion pounds in assets out of Britain. LGIM’s April 17 letter and the IA’s letters, sent out between April 11 and April 16, come as annual general meetings get underway and as clients increasingly demand their investments take into account the impact on returns of environmental, social and governance-related matters. LGIM’s parent company Legal & General, has three females on its 10-member group board. In addition to diversity, LGIM said more needed to be done on climate change, long-term strategy and shareholder rights.  On climate change, LGIM said it wanted to see companies report in line with guidance from the Taskforce on Climate Related Financial Disclosures, which was set up by the G20. “We also expect you to outline the potential impact on your business, where material, of a rise in world temperatures above the two degrees Celsius target set in the Paris climate accord,” it said, referring to the 2015 deal on global warming. Companies should also relate their strategy to the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, where relevant, it said, referring to a plan to tackle a range of issues including poverty, hunger, illiteracy and disease by 2030. Firms should also make greater efforts to demonstrate their long-term strategy was sound by showing how sustainability was reflected in their operations, through an analysis of risks and opportunities, target setting and public disclosures. As more companies look to list with reduced shareholder rights, such as U.S. tech firm Snap (SNAP.N) did recently, LGIM said it was “increasingly concerned” and would work with regulators and others to “strengthen the integrity of the market”.

2018-04-17,"ZURICH, April 17 (Reuters) - ABB faces renewed shareholder demands to break up its sprawling business empire, starting with ditching its struggling power grids division. The power and automation company reports first-quarter figures on Thursday, with investors braced for another tepid performance from power grids — its largest but least profitable division that it decided to keep in 2016. Concerned by weak share performance since then, investors say ABB should simplify operations ranging from industrial plugs and fittings to electric motors for ships and factories. “ABB is too big, it is too complicated and the company would gain significantly by achieving more focus,” said David Samra, portfolio manager at Artisan Partners, ABB’s fifth-largest shareholder with a 1.6 percent stake. “So far we have seen no evidence of an underlying improvement in power grids, nor in the company as a whole,” he told Reuters. Artisan, which describes itself as a long-term value-oriented investor, said ABB should follow rivals Siemens and Honeywell International in streamlining. Siemens floated its medical equipment business as part of its drive to attract investors for businesses outside its core industrial engineering and automation operations, and separated its wind power operations. Honeywell, which makes everything from jet engines to thermostats, will also divest divisions. In contrast, ABB insisted in 2016 on keeping power grids — which makes transformers, substations and semiconductors to transmit electricity — despite pressure from Cevian Capital, its second-largest shareholder, to spin it off. Power Grids generated sales of $10.4 billion in 2017 equivalent to 30 percent of the ABB’s $34.3 billion in sales. Cevian argued ABB was too complex and projected separation would produce two companies with a combined share price of 35 Swiss francs. Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer said in October 2016 that ABB could reach a 35 franc share price while remaining intact. ABB stock has lost 15 percent this year to trade around 22 francs. Spiesshofer has quit some businesses to improve power grids’ performance, selling high-voltage cables and exiting the engineering, procurement and construction business last year. “ABB has evolved significantly as we have strengthened and streamlined the business and we are making good progress against our strategic goals,” a company spokesman said. “Management and board are fully aligned.” Sweden’s Investor AB, ABB’s largest shareholder, supports the strategy. “We believe the key focus for ABB is to execute on the transformation of Power Grids, continue to invest for the future and strengthen customer focus and cost efficiency,” it said. Fidelity, whose Swiss fund has ABB as a top-10 holding, questioned the structure, adding 2018 could see limited growth and struggling profitability, fund manager Andrea Fornoni said. “From the outside, there are some areas like power grids that don’t really fit for many reasons — end markets, growth drivers or margin profile,” he told Reuters. “I don’t think this is something that necessarily needs to be done over the next six months but over time a stronger view should be taken on this.” Thursday’s results are unlikely to provide much respite, with power grids’ revenues and profitability slipping, a Reuters poll shows.

2018-04-17,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Deisy Buitrago and Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, April 17 (Reuters) - Chauffeured around in a sleek black pick-up, the head of Venezuela’s oil industry, Major General Manuel Quevedo, last month toured a joint venture with U.S. major Chevron. Flanked by other trucks carrying security guards, Quevedo passed a handful of workers waiting by an oil well cluster. They wanted a word with the OPEC nation’s oil minister and president of its state-run oil firm, PDVSA, about the sorry state of the company. Quevedo and his caravan drove on by. “He didn’t get out to ask workers about what is going on,” said Jesus Tabata, a union leader who works on a rig in the oil-rich Orinoco Belt. “That way it’s easier to keep saying everything is fine - and at the same time keeping us on like slaves on miserable wages.” What’s going on is that thousands of oil workers are fleeing the state-run oil firm under the watch of its new military commander, who has quickly alienated the firm’s embattled upper echelon and its rank-and-file, according to union leaders, a half-dozen current PDVSA workers, a dozen former PDVSA workers and a half-dozen executives at foreign companies operating in Venezuela. Some PDVSA offices now have lines outside with dozens of workers waiting to quit. In at least one administrative office in Zulia state, human resources staff quit processing out the quitters, hanging a sign, “we do not accept resignations,” an oil worker there told Reuters. Official workforce statistics have become a closely guarded secret, but a dozen sources told Reuters that many thousands of workers had quit so far this year - an acceleration of an already troubling outflow last year. About 25,000 workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018, said union leader and government critic Ivan Freites, citing internal company data. That figure comes out of a workforce last officially reported by PDVSA at 146,000 in 2016. Resignations appear to have increased sharply this year, said Freites, a prominent union leader at Venezuela’s major refineries in the northern Paraguana peninsula. “It’s unstoppable,” he said. Many of those leaving now are engineers, managers, or lawyers - high-level professionals that are almost impossible to replace amid Venezuela’s economic meltdown, the PDVSA workers and foreign executives told Reuters. PDVSA and the Oil Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment. PDVSA board member and pro-government union representative Wills Rangel acknowledged the flight of talent is a serious problem. “The massive resignations are worrying,” Rangel said in an interview. “In refinery operations, many have left.” The pace of departures has quickened with the rapid deterioration of PDVSA’s operations and finances - radiating pain through the OPEC nation’s oil-based economy, now beset with food shortages and hyperinflation. Quevedo - a little known former housing minister who replaced two executives jailed for alleged graft - has further poisoned the atmosphere, according to the two dozen sources who spoke with Reuters. A stiff official who rose through the National Guard, Quevedo fired many long-term employees upon arrival and urged remaining ones to denounce any of their colleagues who oppose Maduro. He tapped soldiers for top roles, giving the oil firm the atmosphere of a “barrack,” two company sources said. “The military guys arrive calling the engineers thieves and saboteurs,” said a Venezuelan oil executive at a private company who frequently works with PDVSA. Quevedo is also fighting to retain control of a company increasingly riven by turf wars. The ruling socialists, once held together by late leader Hugo Chavez, have succumbed to infighting under Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader who lacks Chavez’ charisma and has seen his budget slashed with the decline in global oil prices. Quevedo has clashed with Venezuela’s powerful Vice-President Tareck El-Aissami. When El-Aissami in February appointed a vice-president to the PDVSA unit that oversees joint ventures with foreign companies, Quevedo removed the appointee and had him arrested, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident, which has not been previously reported. Quevedo is an ally of Socialist Party heavyweight Diosdado Cabello. “There is a fight between Diosdado and Tareck for control of the industry,” said Hebert Garcia, a former army general who later broke with Maduro and fled the country. The political turmoil and mass resignations threaten Maduro’s government, which depends on oil for 90 percent of export revenue. In the Orinoco Belt, some drilling rigs are working only intermittently for lack of crews, said two sources there. In PDVSA’s refineries, several small fires have broken out because there are no longer enough supervisors, two sources in the northern Paraguana peninsula said. Lack of personnel in export terminals have forced some ports to cut back working hours, according to two shippers and one trader. Oil production in the first quarter of this year slipped to a 33-year low of 1.6 million barrels per day. Jobs at PDVSA were once coveted for their generous salaries and benefits, including cheap credit for housing. Now, many PDVSA workers can’t feed their families on wages that amount to a handful of U.S. dollars a month. Rampant food shortages that caused Venezuelans to report losing an average of 11 kilograms (24 pounds) last year are particularly tough for oil workers tasked with grueling physical work in often remote oil fields. Some oil workers have resorted to working odd jobs on the side, taking vacation to work abroad, or even selling their work uniforms - red overalls - for money to eat. Some workers in Lake Maracaibo, a production region near Colombia, can no longer get to their jobs, according to two sources there. Transport can cost up to 55,000 bolivars - equal to only 10 U.S. cents, but close to what some workers earn in a day. “Now what we ask each other is: ‘When are you leaving and for where?’,” said one of the Maracaibo workers, who like thousands of other Venezuelans emigrated to Colombia this month. “Even in the bathroom, people are talking about quitting.” At PDVSA headquarters, Quevedo often walks through the offices with a half dozen bodyguards who clear his path, according to one current and one former PDVSA employee. The company’s ongoing decay is evident all around him in the once polished office tower: Broken elevators, poor cafeteria food, empty desks in once-crowded divisions. Maduro has overseen the arrest of dozens of high-level PDVSA executives since late last year, sometimes at the Caracas headquarters as shocked employees looked on. Workers now feel watched by supervisors and are loathe to make any business decision out of fear they will later be accused of corruption, the sources said. PDVSA workers, often visibly thinner, sometimes surreptitiously hand out resumes to executives from private companies, according to a source at a foreign firm. In a rare protest last month, angry Oil Ministry workers blocked access to the cafeteria, demanding better benefits and chanting that Quevedo should resign. Venezuela’s foreign oil partners, which include California-based Chevron, Russia’s Rosneft and China’s CNPC, are increasingly worried about PDVSA’s rapidly departing workforce, according to a half-dozen sources at multinational companies operating in Venezuela. But as minority partners, they have little or no sway over salaries and management. The foreign partners have also grown increasingly frustrated with Quevedo, who initially asked for their suggestions on fixing the state-run firm but now appears ill-disposed towards reforms, the sources said. At least one foreign company is considering bringing in foreign specialists to improve its operations, one of the sources added. But with crime, power cuts and shortages rampant in Venezuela, luring foreign professionals is tough. Still, in the Orinoco belt, some vow to stay in the belief that Maduro’s government can’t last. “We can’t give up,” said Tabata, the union leader who watched Quevedo’s truck drive by that day. “This government is unstable and could fall at any moment - and who will be left?” Reporting by Deisy Buitrago and Alexandra Ulmer

2018-04-17,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) By Alexandra Alper and Barbara Lewis SANTIAGO, April 17 (Reuters) - Two leaks in a month, a 90-day outage and $58 million in fines is not enough to temper Anglo American’s ambition for its long-delayed, multi-billion dollar Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil. Purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion, Anglo American was once counting on Minas-Rio to produce 26.5 million tonnes of iron ore by 2016. The mine’s strength is its high-grade iron ore that commands a premium as the world’s biggest commodity consumer China seeks to cut pollution. Minas-Rio is Anglo American’s biggest development project, and its bet on the future of iron ore, but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in ramp-up phase. The project has been delayed by Brazil’s labyrinthine permitting process, and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline, which will be shut during a three month inspection. Renewed focus on environmental standards at mines, after leaks at the Norwegian-owned Alunorte refinery and from Anglo’s pipelines, has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes. Brazil’s federal environmental regulator Ibama levied fines against Anglo American of 71 million reais ($21.1 million) related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine. That was in addition to 125.6 million reais ($37.3 million) from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais on April 4. Ibama said it will need to evaluate a technical report provided by Anglo after its pipeline inspection before it can resume operations. Ibama did not provide a timeline for that evaluation. Anglo American executives are confident Minas-Rio - a project that has cost more than $8 billion to build - will hit that 26.5 million tonne production target in 2020, and expect the mine will soon break even, with output expected at only around 10 million tonnes this year. “Regardless of the leak, we expect a cash flow very close to the break even (this year),” Anglo American CEO for Brazil Ruben Fernandes told Reuters, adding he expects the company to get a vital final permit from Brazil. Some industry veterans see financial woes weighing heavily, as Anglo continues to pay fixed costs and stops receiving revenue for the expensive mine. “This without a doubt is a setback,” for Anglo said Roberto Castello Branco, a former senior executive at Vale and board member at Petrobas of the Minas-Rio leak. He added it is also a negative for the Brazilian mining industry which may now face tougher scrutiny to operate a mine in a country that has suffered repeated environmental damage from mining. “It is a situation in which everyone loses,” said Branco. Rival miners have already pulled back production after their own leaks. Norway’s Hydro has halved capacity at its Alunorte alumina refinery after a leak, while Samarco - a joint venture between BHP  and Vale - has yet to resume output after a dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people. Recovering Anglo’s initial investment was complex but not impossible, Fernandes said. He has not put a figure on lost revenue during the shutdown over next few months, telling Reuters that the focus is on “stable production of 26 million and a half in keeping with the project. Then we will know the cost of production.” Without the permit to expand, Minas-Rio would run out of ore at the end of the year. Anglo American executives have played down the pipeline leaks, saying the spills were not toxic and swiftly contained. “We should be ready to apply for the operating license in the third quarter of this year,” Fernandes said. The stakes for Brazil are high when it comes to how strict its regulators get on mine safety, given the country is well-placed to supply the United States as President Donald Trump’s tariff war aims to boost his domestic steel industry. A more robust U.S. industry would need more iron ore and Brazil is geographically in the right region to supply it, having gotten a tariff exemption. “If the iron-ore price stays high, it will be a very profitable asset,” said Steve Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management, a top 20 Anglo American shareholder. “But we have to acknowledge that because of past mistakes, the company spent a huge amount on it, so the return on the total investment won’t be good.” That said, Anglo has outperformed peers this year in part because of improved efficiency in production of bulk commodities coal and iron ore and strong output from its Kumba operations in South Africa. For the full-year 2017, Anglo American’s most profitable divisions were coal followed by iron ore and manganese, accounting for respectively 32 and 27 percent of EBITDA. RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said the bank continued to see “relative upside in Anglo American versus peers on a 12-month view” because it has recovered well from 2015-16 crash, cost cutting and improved efficiency. But acquiring permits remains a worry. Hennie Faul, Anglo American’s global copper unit CEO, said “each country has its own challenges” but the company’s balance sheet was well-positioned to keep developing its Brazil assets, which also include nickel. “We’re certainly not trying to get out of Brazil,” Faul told Reuters in Santiago.

The company, controlled by billionaire Alexei Mordashov, previously said it had stopped steel supplies to the United States before Washington imposed an import duty of 25 percent on steel from several countries from March 23. Severstal increased sales of some of its products to the U.S. market and European destinations due to the attractive pricing environment in the first quarter, it said in a statement on Tuesday. It made no other mention of the U.S. market. It said last week it may redirect steel which it had previously been supplying to the United States to markets in the Middle East and Asia. Severstal said its first-quarter earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) totalled $706 million, up from $578 million in the same period a year ago. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast an EBITDA of $696 million. Its first-quarter revenue rose 23 percent to $2.2 billion. “In the first quarter of 2018, steel and raw material demand remained high. Global steel prices were supported by winter restrictions in China and a seasonal increase in Chinese demand in March, which contributed to higher prices of raw materials,” the company said. On Monday, it recommended a dividend payment of 38.32 roubles ($0.6) per share for the first quarter and amended its dividend policy, linking the payments to its free cash flow and net debt/EBITDA ratio instead of net income and net debt/EBITDA. Russian export prices are expected to follow global trends in the second quarter, Severstal said, adding that it expected Russian steel demand to grow by 2.6 percent in 2018. Severstal shares had risen 2.5 percent in Moscow by 0853 GMT in line with Moscow’s benchmark MICEX index. Russian stocks are supported on Tuesday by U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to delay additional sanctions on Russia. Shares in many Russian companies have come under pressure in recent days as Washington imposed sanctions on several Russian businessmen, companies and government officials on April 6 with aluminium company Rusal and its public debt most hit. Neither Severstal nor Mordashov is subject to sanctions.

2018-04-17," LONDON (Reuters) - Trade and investment restrictions are proliferating around the world, driven by a combination of security concerns and protectionist pressures. In each instance, policymakers can usually cite a justification of why trade and investment restrictions are necessary. But taken together, a thickening web of restrictions on cross-border transactions is imposing a growing burden on business as well as complicating supply chains. The United States and China have threatened to hit each other with tariffs covering up to $300 billion of bilateral trade in a dispute over intellectual property and technology transfers. The United States has already imposed anti-dumping and countervailing duties on imports of steel, aluminium and solar panels from China, citing concerns about unfair trade. China has responded with its own anti-dumping duties on imported sorghum from the United States and is investigating other products. U.S. officials have raised security concerns about telecommunications switch gear from Chinese firm Huawei and sought to exclude it from the United States market. The United States has also suspended export licences linked to Chinese telecoms company ZTE, while Britain has warned companies not to install any more ZTE equipment on the country’s network. ZTE is accused of violating secondary sanctions on the supply of equipment to Iran and North Korea, but there are also broader concerns about its equipment being used for spying and cyber-warfare. The U.S. government has pledged to restrict Chinese investment and acquisitions in sensitive high-technology sectors. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has already been applying heightened scrutiny to transactions involving Chinese firms. In turn, China’s antitrust authorities have started to slow down merger approvals involving western companies operating in the Chinese market. The United States has also hit Russian companies and individuals with multiple rounds of sanctions in a dispute over Ukraine. In many cases, the United States has imposed secondary sanctions, which apply extraterritorially and aim to catch businesses for transactions that occur wholly outside the country. The European Union has implemented its own sanctions on Russia, though it has generally refrained from extraterritorial application. The United States and the EU are both readying further sanctions on Iran in response to its ballistic missile programme and regional activities. The United States, the EU, China and other nations are enforcing sanctions on North Korea (including secondary sanctions) for nuclear-related activities. The United States also appears to be preparing sanctions on Venezuela. Enthusiasm for sanctions is spreading, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates imposing an economic boycott on Qatar (including a secondary boycott). Sanctions represent a relatively low-cost way of inflicting economic pain on an adversary and have become the instrument of choice for foreign policymakers (“The art of sanctions: a view from the field”, Nephew, 2018). The result is a rapidly growing sanctions-industrial complex led by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, security services and financial regulators in the United States and the European Union. The sanctions-industrial complex also includes a growing army of specialist compliance firms and compliance officers embedded within businesses. In addition to the sanctions-industrial complex, a growing number of regulators and trade authorities show an increasing propensity to favour greater restrictions. The Office of the United States Trade Representative, the U.S. Department of Commerce, CFIUS, and the departments responsible for antitrust policy all show a rising preference for protection rather than openness. HIGH-WATER MARK? For most of the period since 1945 and especially since the end of the Soviet Union, the main thrust has been towards greater openness on trade and investment. The dismantling of trade and investment barriers was embodied by eight rounds of successful trade negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade culminating in the ambitious Uruguay Round (1986-1994). But the liberalisation thrust has stalled in recent years with the failure to conclude any new multilateral trade agreement for almost a quarter of a century. The high-water mark of globalisation may have passed. Now trade and investment barriers are rising, rather than falling. Liberalisation, openness to trade and cross-border investment have few defenders within the U.S. and European political class. Left-wing politicians and labour unions blame trade liberalisation for stagnating wages and incomes in the advanced economies. Right-wing politicians and security hawks fear liberalisation, investment and technology transfer is strengthening potential adversaries. Sanctions experts, financial regulators, intelligence agencies and foreign policy specialists all increasingly employ trade and investment restrictions as their first-choice policy instrument. Traditional mechanisms for resolving trade and investment disputes through the GATT/WTO are ill-equipped to handle the new round of restrictions citing national security and foreign policy concerns. Complying with the ever-increasing number of restrictions is becoming increasingly difficult for businesses operating across national frontiers and is causing a growing number of distortions. Setting aside the question of whether restrictions are justified in individual cases, there are broader questions about the economic impact of the proliferating barriers: (1) If increasing openness to trade and investment was a major driver of improved efficiency and living standards in the post-1945 period, does its retreat threaten to slow economic growth? (2) Can the spreading web of trade and investment restrictions, often imposed at short notice, be consistent with a rules-based and predictable trading system that facilitates cross-border transactions? (3) If the global trade and investment regime becomes less predictable, will the growth in international trade and investment slow or even go into reverse? (4) Sanctions are generally treated as an extension of foreign policy, a traditional area reserved for executive authority, with minimal legislative and judicial oversight: does that raise concerns about due process? Policymakers are rapidly embracing trade and investment restrictions for a range of reasons, ranging from trying to raise wages to protect strategic sectors and national security concerns. But their enthusiasm for trade and investment barriers arguably threatens the foundations of the post-1945 international economic system and could end up doing more harm than good.

2018-04-17,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s Northern Territory on Tuesday lifted a nearly two-year moratorium on fracking to extract gas, unlocking vast onshore reserves in the resource-rich region and raising the possibility of other provinces following suit.     The Northern Territory (NT), a 1.4 million sq km (540,000 sq miles) expanse of outback extending from the center of Australia to its northern coastline, had banned hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, in September, 2016 amid concerns the drilling method could harm the environment. It commissioned an inquiry into the environmental, social and economic risks of the extraction process and on Tuesday accepted the inquiry’s conclusion that the risks were manageable.  “The moratorium on fracking in the Northern Territory will be lifted, with strict new laws to be in place before exploration or production can occur,” Chief Minister Michael Gunner told reporters in the Territory’s capital, Darwin. The announcement, which drew criticism from environmentalists, reopens shale gas reserves in the Beetaloo and McArthur basins for development. It immediately sent shares in commodity explorers in the region sharply higher, even though production is not expected to begin for about a decade. It also raised industry hopes for pushing Australia, with 88 trillion cubic feet of identified unconventional gas reserves, like the United States before it towards energy self-sufficiency if blocks on fracking were lifted elsewhere in the country.     Origin Energy Ltd said it would resume plans “as soon as practical” to drill and frack the Beetaloo Basin shale gas field, which it says contains 6.6 trillion cubic feet in contingent reserves. Its shares rose 1.4 percent. Shares of McArthur basin explorer Empire Energy Group Ltd jumped by two thirds and shares in Armour Energy Ltd, which also holds exploration acreage in the region rose 6.7 percent. The broader market edged higher.  Jemena Ltd [JEMLTD.UL], owned by China State Grid Corp Ltd [STGRD.UL] and Singapore Power Ltd [SINTT.UL], said it now intends to expand the capacity of a gas pipeline linking the Territory with the state of Queensland sevenfold.     “Given the vast geography we are talking about, some significant infrastructure investment will be needed to bring this gas to domestic and international markets,” said Andrew Koscharsky, director for energy at commodity trading house RCMA, which deals in Australian power and gas. (For a graphic on 'Australia's Northern Territory lifts fracking ban' click tmsnrt.rs/2JRs18Z) Tuesday’s announcement lifted industry hopes for an end to fracking bans elsewhere in Australia, where the process has become a flashpoint between a national government desperate to quell rising gas prices and popular environmentalist opposition. Victoria state has outlawed fracking. New South Wales and Tasmania have introduced moratoriums as has Western Australia in its gas-rich Canning Basin. In South Australia, a newly-elected centre-right government has promised a ban on fracking in the state’s gas-rich southeast. “There’s been this cascading effect and so one place has a moratorium then the next place has a moratorium,” said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of Energy Quest, an Adelaide-based energy consultancy.  “This should cause thoughts by other jurisdictions about moratoria,” he said. The NT government said it would tightly regulate the industry after lifting the ban. Almost half the territory will remain “frack-free”, including national parks and reserves. Drillers will need to make wells compliant with new design codes and present plans for decommissioning and rehabilitation before production begins, it said in a statement. But environmentalists condemned the move.    “This decision ... is a betrayal of the science and of the significant community opposition which has been expressed over the last few years,” said Lauren Mellor, a spokeswoman for environmental group Frack Free NT Alliance.

2018-04-17,"(Adds details, comments from earlier Eni statement) By Lamine Chikhi Oran, ALGERIA, April 17 (Reuters) - Eni plans “billions” of investments in Algeria over the next three years, the company’s CEO said on Tuesday, as the Italian energy firm said it had agreed to extend its partnership with Algerian state firm Sonatrach. “We need to invest more because Algeria still has a lot of gas,” Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi told an energy conference in the western Algerian city of Oran, adding that Eni was eyeing the OPEC member’s offshore holdings. “Offshore is very interesting in Algeria, we are working on it. But we did not get blocks yet,” Descalzi said. Last year, Eni invested $600 million in Algeria and imported 11 billion cubic metres of gas from the North African country, Descalzi said. The Italian government, which controls Eni, is keen to turn Italy into a Southern European gas hub capable of moving African supplies from Algeria and Libya and future flows from Azerbaijan into Europe. Italy’s gas imports have tipped away from Algeria towards Russia in recent years as Algerian production has stagnated. Sonatrach has struggled to attract foreign investment, a position that CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kadour is trying to reverse. One delayed Algerian gas field was brought online last year with three more expected to start producing this year, lifting annual gas output of 94 billion cubic metres by 9 billion cubic metres. In a statement released earlier on Tuesday, Eni said it had signed new deals with Sonatrach and that the launch of an exploration and development programme in Algeria’s Berkine basin would be “particularly important”. The programme would lead to the production of new gas reserves using existing infrastructure, Eni said. “The renewed collaboration between our companies, enshrined in today’s agreements, allows Eni to make a further important step forward in a key country like Algeria and to consolidate further our strategic partnership with Sonatrach,” Descalzi said in the statement.

2018-04-17," (Refiles this April 16 story to fix affiliation in 10th paragraph.) (Reuters) - Scientists in Britain and the United States say they have engineered a plastic-eating enzyme that could in future help in the fight against pollution. The enzyme is able to digest polyethylene terephthalate, or PET - a form of plastic patented in the 1940s and now used in millions of tonnes of plastic bottles. PET plastics can persist for hundreds of years in the environment and currently pollute large areas of land and sea worldwide. Researchers from Britain’s University of Portsmouth and the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory made the discovery while examining the structure of a natural enzyme thought to have evolved in a waste recycling center in Japan.  Finding that this enzyme was helping a bacteria to break down, or digest, PET plastic, the researchers decided to “tweak” its structure by adding some amino acids, said John McGeehan, a professor at Portsmouth who co-led the work.   This led to a serendipitous change in the enzyme’s actions - allowing its plastic-eating abilities to work faster. “We’ve made an improved version of the enzyme better than the natural one already,” McGeehan told Reuters in an interview. “That’s really exciting because that means that there’s potential to optimize the enzyme even further.”  The team, whose finding was published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal, is now working on improving the enzyme further to see if they can make it capable of breaking down PET plastics on an industrial scale. “It’s well within the possibility that in the coming years we will see an industrially viable process to turn PET, and potentially other (plastics), back into their original building blocks so that they can be sustainably recycled,” McGeehan said. Independent scientists not directly involved with the research said it was exciting, but they cautioned that the enzyme’s development as a potential solution for pollution was still at an early stage. “Enzymes are non-toxic, biodegradable and can be produced in large amounts by microorganisms,” said Oliver Jones, a expert in analytical chemistry at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University. “There is strong potential to use enzyme technology to help with society’s growing waste problem by breaking down some of the most commonly used plastics.” Douglas Kell, a professor of bioanalytical science at Manchester University, said further rounds of work “should be expected to improve the enzyme yet further”.  “All told, this advance brings the goal of sustainably recyclable polymers significantly closer,” he added.

2018-04-17,"JOHANNESBURG, April 17 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom, which is battling to recover from a financial and leadership crisis, said on Tuesday that it was facing coal shortages at seven power stations. Eskom supplies around 95 percent of South Africa’s electricity, predominantly by burning coal. The state-owned utility has been forced to introduce nationwide electricity cuts in the past decade, the latest in 2015, denting economic output. “No one wants load-shedding,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said, referring to forced interruptions to power supply. “Eskom will do everything possible to prevent that.” Phasiwe said Eskom was redirecting coal supplies from power plants with surpluses to the seven affected plants in Mpumalanga province, as winter approaches for southern hemisphere countries. Eskom has asked the finance ministry for permission to procure more coal and is temporarily using diesel-fuelled turbines to meet electricity demand. Part of the reason for the coal shortages is that Tegeta Exploration and Resources, a coal-mining firm owned by the Gupta family, has cut supplies to Eskom as it seeks insolvency protection, Phasiwe said. A judicial inquiry into state corruption is investigating whether the Guptas used their friendship with ousted president Jacob Zuma to influence cabinet appointments and win contracts at state firms including Eskom. The Guptas and Zuma have denied any wrongdoing.

Chinese data that provided a bit of something for everyone kept Asia largely in check overnight, but Europe started well with only London’s FTSE lagging as the pound’s power weighed on its big exporters. There were more signs of China opening up its economy too and a steadier Russian rouble showed investors were also gradually shifting attention away from Syria tensions back to corporate earnings and possible interest rate moves. The pound’s rise was its eighth in a row, coming as bets firm on another Bank of England rate hike next month, while yields on U.S. Treasuries were at their highest in over three weeks ahead of a flurry of top Fed speakers. “It looks like China may be willing to cooperate with the U.S. so that might be spurring risk appetite and the positive mood in markets,” said Rabobank analyst Bas Van Geffen. There were still some trade war noises being made though. Stocks in Shanghai closed near a one-year low, a U.S. move to ban American companies from selling components to Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp hit tech stocks. Beijing then said it would slap a hefty temporary tariff on U.S. sorghum imports after finding they had damaged the domestic industry. That set grain futures prices jumping. Economic data showed the Chinese economy grew 6.8 percent in the first three months of the year, unchanged from the previous quarter. March retail sales jumped over 10 percent too, the strongest pace in four months, though other figures saw industrial output miss expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth also slowed. “Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech. This is encouraging,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore. Commodity markets were still focused on the geopolitical situation in Syria and the fallout from the U.S. sanctions on Russia. Buoyed by growing expectations over tighter supply in the aftermath of sanctions on major Russian producer Rusal, aluminium prices jumped more than 1 percent to almost $2,500 a tonne to hit their highest since mid 2011. Rusal accounts for 6-7 percent of global aluminium supply. Oil steadied at $66.57 a barrel for U.S. crude and $71.66 a barrel for Brent having tumbled nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over Middle East tensions eased. In another sign of the returning risk appetite, the euro rose above $1.24 to a three-week high and Southern European government debt outperformed better-rated peers. “We have had a long enough period of extended volatility now that some of the more extended positions in risk assets have been reduced so that is also a positive,” said Michael Metcalfe, head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets. On sterling, which was buying just over $1.43, he added that with so much good Brexit news priced in in recent weeks and rate hike bets growing, it was difficult to see how much further it could go. It was curbed slightly too after data showed wage growth stalled last month despite the unemployment rate hitting a four-decade low. U.S. President Donald Trump’s comments on Monday about China and Russia trying to devalue their currencies continued to weigh on the dollar, with investors believing that the U.S. administration wants a weaker currency. Focus was also turning to first quarter results from the likes of Goldman Sachs and eBay later. S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2018-04-17,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - British private equity firm Actis is close to signing a deal to buy the solar power portfolio of Indian conglomerate Shapoorji Pallonji, three people aware of the development said on Tuesday. The acquisition of Shapoorji’s 400 megawatt (MW) solar power portfolio will be done via a renewable platform owned by Actis named “Sprng Energy” at an equity valuation of around 11 billion rupees (£116.7 million), one of the people said, asking not to be named as final negotiations are ongoing. “The due diligence is almost over and the equity value has been reached,” the person said, adding an announcement could come soon. A Shapoorji spokesperson confirmed the company was “in advanced talks with key investors” regarding the solar assets. “As these discussions are confidential in nature, we would not like to comment on the same,” the spokesperson said. Sanjiv Aggarwal, a partner at the firm, declined to comment directly on the deal but said Actis would “continue to grow through bids and M&A”. The firm’s long-term aim was to exit Sprng once it reaches capacity of 1,750 MW, he said. Actis said in an emailed statement it has around $8.5 billion (£5.9 billion) in assets under management. Gaurav Sood, Chief Executive Officer of Sprng, also declined to comment on the deal. Shapoorji’s portfolio currently comprises of seven operational projects with a total capacity of 272 MW and an additional 130 MW under development. A deal would come hard on the heels of Actis’ sale earlier this month of its first renewable energy platform, Ostro Energy, to Goldman Sachs-backed Renew Power Ventures (RENE.BO) at $1.5 billion. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi aims to have 175 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity by 2022, up from 62 GW currently, out of which 100 GW is expected to come from solar.

2018-04-17,"* Local governor tells broadcaster he may resign * Governor has been holding up restart of Tepco reactors * Tepco shares earlier rose by more than 4 pct (Adds comment from governor, updates shares) April 17 (Reuters) - Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc (Tepco) shares rose more than 4 percent on the expectation that Tepco could restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata prefecture after Japanese media reported that the region’s governor, who has opposed the restart, may resign. Niigata Governor Ryuichi Yoneyama said on national broadcaster NHK on Tuesday that he was considering resigning, but had yet to decide. When asked why, Yoneyama said it was because of a “woman problem,” without elaborating. He was responding to numerous media reports, including from Kyodo News, that he would resign. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa is the world’s largest nuclear power plant and restarting the site’s seven reactors is crucial to Tepco’s recovery plans in the wake of the meltdowns at its Fukushima plant in 2011. Yoneyama told Reuters last year a better understanding of the Fukushima disaster was needed before he would sign off on a restart at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa. Tepco shares closed 0.7 percent higher after gaining as much as 4.4 percent earlier. The broader market rose slightly. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa’s reactors can generate 8,212 megawatts of electricity, or about 20 percent of Japan’s nuclear capacity. Yoneyama told Reuters last year that he planned to review the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster and examine evacuation drills in Niigata. The health impacts of the radiation release during the Fukushima disaster, the world’s worst atomic crisis since Chernobyl in 1986, should also be analysed, he said, adding that it may take three years to complete the review. Tepco has approval from regulators to start two reactors at Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, but the company needs to carry out further work before the restarts. While not a legal requirement, the sign off of the governor is also required.

2018-04-17,"* Dues ‘have been pending for years’ - company official * ONGC has filed claim for nearly $100 mln - sources * Total dues pending add up to about $425 mln - sources * ONGC’s 1st arbitration case against any government-sources * Sudan govt says could not settle dues due to sanctions By Nidhi Verma and Promit Mukherjee NEW DELHI, April 17 (Reuters) - The foreign acquisition unit of India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp’s (ONGC) has filed an arbitration claim against the government of Sudan in a London court, a company official said, seeking to recover dues pending for years from a project hit by the breakaway of South Sudan in 2011. People familiar with the matter in India and Sudan said ONGC had filed a claim for $98.94 million, in what they said was a first for the South Asian nation’s top oil and gas explorer against any government. They declined to be identified because they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter with media. At the centre of the dispute is ONGC’s 25 percent stake the company acquired in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) in Sudan in 2003. Other stakeholders include China’s China National Petroleum Corp with a 40 per cent stake and Malaysia’s Petronas with a 30 per cent share. “Yes, we have filed an arbitration as our dues have been pending for years,” said N. K. Verma, managing director of ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL). “Notwithstanding this arbitration we will continue to work with Sudan going forward,” he said, declining to provide details on the timing and location of any hearings, or the amount being sought. The current arbitration is only for a part of pending dues that add up to about $425 million, sources said, adding ONGC has sued the government as the contracts were backed by sovereign guarantees. ONGC will also file arbitrations for the remaining outstanding amount in due course, said a company official, who declined to be identified. Officials in Sudan said contacts and negotiations with ONGC were being lined up. “We have addressed the company (ONGC) to show our commitment to serious negotiation and we (have) set up a committee to determine the time frame to pay back the sum in installments,” said Bekheet Ahmed Abdullah, under-secretary for Sudan’s Petroleum Ministry. OVL’s stake in the Greater Nile Oil Project (GNOP) comprised Blocks 1, 2 and 4, and the firm also agreed to build a 1,500-kilometre pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. But in 2011 South Sudan broke away from Sudan, after decades of civil war, and took control of blocks 1A, 1B and a part of block 4. Meanwhile, because of years of trade sanctions imposed on Sudan by the U.S. - only lifted in 2017 - Khartoum found it difficult to secure oil for its refineries, and asked foreign companies including OVL to sell their share of oil from the blocks to the African nation. In 2016, OVL signed a separate agreement with Sudan for the sale of its share of GNOP oil. Sudan has not yet paid $90.81 million to ONGC for purchases of oil in 2016 and 2017, according to people familiar with the matter. ONGC Videsh had expected Sudan to clear the dues after lifting of the U.S. sanctions last year. “We are committed to pay the money but due to the sanctions imposed on Sudan, we are facing problems in making payment,” said Sirajuddin Hamid Yousuf, Sudan’s ambassador to India. “The sanctions were eased on Oct. 12, 2017 but we still cannot have normal banking transactions with India and others,” he said.

2018-04-17,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Investment in new European wind farms and equipment is expected to increase this year after a sharp drop in 2017, helped by several large project auctions, according to a major industry body. Spending is forecast to rise 4 percent to 23.2 billion euros ($28.7 billion), WindEurope said in its financing report, after a 19-percent decline in 2017 due to a sector shift toward competitive tender-based auctions and away from subsidies. Investment is expected to rise to 26 billion euros next year, before falling back to 24.2 billion in 2020, the estimates show. “Both 2016 and 2017 have been transitional years for the wind sector,” WindEurope said. “However, investment volumes are expected to stabilize in 2018 with the roll-out of auctions across Europe and projects awarded support expecting to reach final investment decisions.” Europe is home to a large number of leading players in the global wind power sector, be it project developers or equipment manufacturers, including Vestas, Orsted, Siemens Gamesa, EnBW, Nordex and Innogy. At 22.3 billion euros, investments in new wind capacity were by far the biggest driver of spending on renewable energy projects on the continent in 2017, accounting for half of investments, WindEurope said. Spending on new assets does not reflect refinancing, mergers and acquisitions and the raising of debt across the industry. Including these figures, total wind investment stood at 51.2 billion euros in 2017, an all-time high. This was primarily driven by project and company acquisitions, which more than doubled to 14.4 billion euros last year, compared with 6.8 billion in 2016. “Sector maturity and technology competitiveness have brought in more investors as equity partners in projects, in particular from the financial services industry. These partnerships are key for power producers who need to recycle capital to finance new assets,” WindEurope said. It added infrastructure and pension funds, asset managers and other financial service companies owned more than a third of the capacity that was bought or sold last year, up from 27 percent in 2016.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open higher following overnight Wall Street gains, with Britain’s FTSE rising 0.15 percent, Germany’s DAX gaining 0.3 percent and France’s CAC climbing 0.3 percent. The dollar was barely changed, with demand for safe-haven U.S. Treasuries ebbing as risk appetite improved in parts of the broader market as investors took the view that Western-led strikes on Syria were a one-off intervention. China’s economy grew a welcome 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, unchanged from the previous quarter. But separate data showed March industrial output missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed, tempering equity market gains. “There are two stories here, one backward looking and one forward looking,” said Robert Subbaraman, chief economist for Asia excluding Japan at Nomura in Singapore. “Underneath the stable GDP growth is quite rapid rebalancing from industrial, investment and old economy sectors to consumption, services and new economy sectors like tech. This is encouraging.” “The more timely March data, however, point to nascent signs of a growth slowdown underway, led by these old economy sectors,” Subbaraman said. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.15 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.15 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat. Shanghai’s index shed 0.35 percent and Japan’s Nikkei was unchanged. Australian stocks gained 0.3 percent with mining shares gaining on higher aluminium prices. While Saturday’s missile strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syria, investor risk appetite improved on speculation that the attacks would not lead to prolonged conflict. “The markets had been bracing for a possible escalation in Syria following President Trump’s earlier warnings. Military action, however, has been limited, bringing relief,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “That said, the underlying picture has not changed. Conflict continues in Syria and trade issues remain unresolved. Geopolitics will impact the markets again.” The Dow gained 0.87 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent on Monday, with the biggest boosts from technology and healthcare sectors as investors were optimistic about the earnings season and appeared less worried about U.S.-led missile attacks in Syria. S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit, on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.415 after losing 0.4 percent overnight. The euro was steady at $1.2382. The dollar was effectively flat at 107.055 yen The pound rose to $1.4355, its highest since June 2016, with focus on data that could cement expectations of a May interest rate increase from the Bank of England. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped into the currency market again on Tuesday, buying HK$5.77 billion ($735 million) in Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the lower end of its allowable trading band. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was at 2.834 percent after rising to 2.865 on Monday, its highest since March 22. U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.5 percent to $66.57 a barrel after tumbling nearly 1.8 percent overnight as concerns over tensions in the Middle East waned. Brent crude climbed 0.3 percent to $71.66 a barrel. Aluminium hovered near seven-year highs reached the previous day after U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal stirred supply concerns.

2018-04-17," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The price of seaborne thermal coal in Asia may come under pressure as China moves to impose some import restrictions on imports of the polluting fuel. Several ports in southern and eastern China have introduced controls on coal imports, ranging from bans on unloadings to tightening customs clearances. Among ports banning imports is the Chuanshon anchorage at Ningbo port, according to a manager at a coal trading house quoted by Reuters on Monday, while Zhoushan near Shanghai is restricting the number of vessels allowed to dock. What is not clear yet is just how severe these restrictions are, how widespread they will become and how long they will last. What does appear somewhat clearer is that the authorities in Beijing wish to restrict growth in coal imports in order to support domestic coal prices and encourage an increase in local production. Certainly, news of the restrictions boosted domestic prices, with benchmark thermal coal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange jumping almost 3 percent on Monday to close at 570.2 yuan ($90.94) a tonne. This was the biggest gain since August last year, although the price is still well below the highest closing price so far this year, which was 678 yuan a tonne reached on Jan. 29. While the authorities don’t officially target domestic coal prices, it’s widely believed in the industry that a range anchored around 550 yuan a tonne is a level that Beijing feels provides miners with sufficient revenue while not unduly boosting costs for power generators. It’s also currently a price level that makes domestic coal attractive versus seaborne supplies, especially once the duties and taxes on imported coal are taken into account. The spot thermal coal price at Australia’s Newcastle port closed at $93 a tonne on Monday, up a mere 0.2 percent from Friday’s close. The price is also down about 15 percent from the peak so far this year of $109.50 a tonne, reached on Jan. 17. It’s not unusual for prices to retreat after the peak winter demand period, but the risk for the seaborne market is that the restrictions on imports in China actually cuts into demand. Imports of all types of coal rose 16.6 percent to 75.41 million tonnes in the first three months of 2018, compared to the same period last year, according to China’s preliminary customs data. While not as fast a pace of increase as in the first quarter of 2017, it’s likely that the authorities would rather see coal imports retreat rather than rise. Much will depend on the nature of the restrictions being put in place, making it key to track imports to try and calculate if they are dropping more than what may be seasonally expected. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts suggest April may see a drop in China’s coal imports. Filtering the data to show cargoes already discharged, or awaiting discharge, as well as those already en route to a Chinese port and expected to unload by the end of the month shows imports are likely to be around 17.6 million tonnes in April. Even if this figure does increase somewhat by the arrival of more cargoes from close-to-China suppliers such as Indonesia, it’s still likely that April’s imports will be below the seaborne imports of 23.2 million tonnes in March, the 20.8 million in February and the 21.4 million in January reported by Thomson Reuters. Again, a drop in China’s imports in the shoulder season between winter and summer won’t be too concerning for coal exporters, but any sign of a sustained downturn will likely result in prices of export coal coming under pressure. The domestic price of thermal coal normally tracks Newcastle prices, although a divergence is possible, with a notable occurrence being in late 2016 when seaborne prices surged as Chinese buyers stocked up for winter. It’s possible that a policy-driven event such as the current restrictions on imports could strengthen domestic prices relative to seaborne cargoes. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell/column-china-move-to-restrict-coal-imports-may-drive-price-divergence-russell-idUKL3N1RU2JP,17 Apr 2018,"The price of

2018-04-17,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Two leaks in a month, a 90-day outage and $58 million in fines is not enough to temper Anglo American’s (AAL.L) ambition for its long-delayed, multi-billion dollar Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil. Purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion, Anglo American was once counting on Minas-Rio to produce 26.5 million tons of iron ore by 2016. The mine’s strength is its high-grade iron ore that commands a premium as the world’s biggest commodity consumer China seeks to cut pollution. Minas-Rio is Anglo American’s biggest development project, and its bet on the future of iron ore, but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in ramp-up phase. The project has been delayed by Brazil’s labyrinthine permitting process, and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline, which will be shut during a three month inspection. Renewed focus on environmental standards at mines, after leaks at the Norwegian-owned Alunorte refinery and from Anglo’s pipelines, has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes. Brazil’s federal environmental regulator Ibama levied fines against Anglo American of 71 million reais ($21.1 million) related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine. That was in addition to 125.6 million reais ($37.3 million) from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais on April 4.     Ibama said it will need to evaluate a technical report provided by Anglo after its pipeline inspection before it can resume operations. Ibama did not provide a timeline for that evaluation. Anglo American executives are confident Minas-Rio - a project that has cost more than $8 billion to build - will hit that 26.5 million ton production target in 2020, and expect the mine will soon break even, with output expected at only around 10 million tons this year.  “Regardless of the leak, we expect a cash flow very close to the break even (this year),” Anglo American CEO for Brazil Ruben Fernandes told Reuters, adding he expects the company to get a vital final permit from Brazil. Some industry veterans see financial woes weighing heavily, as Anglo continues to pay fixed costs and stops receiving revenue for the expensive mine.  “This without a doubt is a setback,” for Anglo said Roberto Castello Branco, a former senior executive at Vale and board member at Petrobas of the Minas-Rio leak.  He added it is also a negative for the Brazilian mining industry which may now face tougher scrutiny to operate a mine in a country that has suffered repeated environmental damage from mining.  “It is a situation in which everyone loses,” said Branco. Rival miners have already pulled back production after their own leaks. Norway’s Hydro (NHY.OL) has halved capacity at its Alunorte alumina refinery after a leak, while Samarco - a joint venture between BHP (BHP.AX) BLT.L and Vale (VALE3.SA) - has yet to resume output after a dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people. Recovering Anglo’s initial investment was complex but not impossible, Fernandes said.     He has not put a figure on lost revenue during the shutdown over next few months, telling Reuters that the focus is on “stable production of 26 million and a half in keeping with the project. Then we will know the cost of production.” Without the permit to expand, Minas-Rio would run out of ore at the end of the year.  Anglo American executives have played down the pipeline leaks, saying the spills were not toxic and swiftly contained.     “We should be ready to apply for the operating license in the third quarter of this year,” Fernandes said.  The stakes for Brazil are high when it comes to how strict its regulators get on mine safety, given the country is well-placed to supply the United States as President Donald Trump’s tariff war aims to boost his domestic steel industry.  A more robust U.S. industry would need more iron ore and Brazil is geographically in the right region to supply it, having gotten a tariff exemption.     “If the iron-ore price stays high, it will be a very profitable asset,” said Steve Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management, a top 20 Anglo American shareholder.  “But we have to acknowledge that because of past mistakes, the company spent a huge amount on it, so the return on the total investment won’t be good.”    That said, Anglo has outperformed peers this year in part because of improved efficiency in production of bulk commodities coal and iron ore and strong output from its Kumba operations in South Africa.  For the full-year 2017, Anglo American’s most profitable divisions were coal followed by iron ore and manganese, accounting for respectively 32 and 27 percent of EBITDA.       RBC Capital Markets analyst Tyler Broda said the bank continued to see “relative upside in Anglo American versus peers on a 12-month view” because it has recovered well from 2015-16 crash, cost cutting and improved efficiency. But acquiring permits remains a worry. Hennie Faul, Anglo American’s global copper unit CEO, said “each country has its own challenges” but the company’s balance sheet was well-positioned to keep developing its Brazil assets, which also include nickel. “We’re certainly not trying to get out of Brazil,” Faul told Reuters in Santiago.

2018-04-17,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Chauffeured around in a sleek black pick-up, the head of Venezuela’s oil industry, Major General Manuel Quevedo, last month toured a joint venture with U.S. major Chevron. Flanked by other trucks carrying security guards, Quevedo passed a handful of workers waiting by an oil well cluster. They wanted a word with the OPEC nation’s oil minister and president of its state-run oil firm, PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], about the sorry state of the company. Quevedo and his caravan drove on by. “He didn’t get out to ask workers about what is going on,” said Jesus Tabata, a union leader who works on a rig in the oil-rich Orinoco Belt. “That way it’s easier to keep saying everything is fine - and at the same time keeping us on like slaves on miserable wages.” What’s going on is that thousands of oil workers are fleeing the state-run oil firm under the watch of its new military commander, who has quickly alienated the firm’s embattled upper echelon and its rank-and-file, according to union leaders, a half-dozen current PDVSA workers, a dozen former PDVSA workers and a half-dozen executives at foreign companies operating in Venezuela. Some PDVSA offices now have lines outside with dozens of workers waiting to quit. In at least one administrative office in Zulia state, human resources staff quit processing out the quitters, hanging a sign, “we do not accept resignations,” an oil worker there told Reuters. Official workforce statistics have become a closely guarded secret, but a dozen sources told Reuters that many thousands of workers had quit so far this year - an acceleration of an already troubling outflow last year. About 25,000 workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018, said union leader and government critic Ivan Freites, citing internal company data. That figure comes out of a workforce last officially reported by PDVSA at 146,000 in 2016. Resignations appear to have increased sharply this year, said Freites, a prominent union leader at Venezuela’s major refineries in the northern Paraguana peninsula. “It’s unstoppable,” he said. Many of those leaving now are engineers, managers, or lawyers - high-level professionals that are almost impossible to replace amid Venezuela’s economic meltdown, the PDVSA workers and foreign executives told Reuters. PDVSA and the Oil Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment. PDVSA board member and pro-government union representative Wills Rangel acknowledged the flight of talent is a serious problem.  “The massive resignations are worrying,” Rangel said in an interview. “In refinery operations, many have left.” The pace of departures has quickened with the rapid deterioration of PDVSA’s operations and finances - radiating pain through the OPEC nation’s oil-based economy, now beset with food shortages and hyperinflation. Quevedo - a little known former housing minister who replaced two executives jailed for alleged graft - has further poisoned the atmosphere, according to the two dozen sources who spoke with Reuters. A stiff official who rose through the National Guard, Quevedo fired many long-term employees upon arrival and urged remaining ones to denounce any of their colleagues who oppose Maduro. He tapped soldiers for top roles, giving the oil firm the atmosphere of a “barrack,” two company sources said. “The military guys arrive calling the engineers thieves and saboteurs,” said a Venezuelan oil executive at a private company who frequently works with PDVSA. Quevedo is also fighting to retain control of a company increasingly riven by turf wars. The ruling socialists, once held together by late leader Hugo Chavez, have succumbed to infighting under Maduro, a former bus driver and union leader who lacks Chavez’ charisma and has seen his budget slashed with the decline in global oil prices. Quevedo has clashed with Venezuela’s powerful Vice-President Tareck El-Aissami. When El-Aissami in February appointed a vice-president to the PDVSA unit that oversees joint ventures with foreign companies, Quevedo removed the appointee and had him arrested, according to three sources with knowledge of the incident, which has not been previously reported.  Quevedo is an ally of Socialist Party heavyweight Diosdado Cabello.  “There is a fight between Diosdado and Tareck for control of the industry,” said Hebert Garcia, a former army general who later broke with Maduro and fled the country. The political turmoil and mass resignations threaten Maduro’s government, which depends on oil for 90 percent of export revenue. In the Orinoco Belt, some drilling rigs are working only intermittently for lack of crews, said two sources there. In PDVSA’s refineries, several small fires have broken out because there are no longer enough supervisors, two sources in the northern Paraguana peninsula said. Lack of personnel in export terminals have forced some ports to cut back working hours, according to two shippers and one trader. Oil production in the first quarter of this year slipped to a 33-year low of 1.6 million barrels per day. Jobs at PDVSA were once coveted for their generous salaries and benefits, including cheap credit for housing. Now, many PDVSA workers can’t feed their families on wages that amount to a handful of U.S. dollars a month. Rampant food shortages that caused Venezuelans to report losing an average of 11 kilograms (24 pounds) last year are particularly tough for oil workers tasked with gruelling physical work in often remote oil fields. Some oil workers have resorted to working odd jobs on the side, taking vacation to work abroad, or even selling their work uniforms - red overalls - for money to eat.  Some workers in Lake Maracaibo, a production region near Colombia, can no longer get to their jobs, according to two sources there. Transport can cost up to 55,000 bolivars - equal to only 10 U.S. cents (7p), but close to what some workers earn in a day.  “Now what we ask each other is: ‘When are you leaving and for where?’,” said one of the Maracaibo workers, who like thousands of other Venezuelans emigrated to Colombia this month. “Even in the bathroom, people are talking about quitting.” At PDVSA headquarters, Quevedo often walks through the offices with a half dozen bodyguards who clear his path, according to one current and one former PDVSA employee. The company’s ongoing decay is evident all around him in the once polished office tower: Broken elevators, poor cafeteria food, empty desks in once-crowded divisions. Maduro has overseen the arrest of dozens of high-level PDVSA executives since late last year, sometimes at the Caracas headquarters as shocked employees looked on. Workers now feel watched by supervisors and are loathe to make any business decision out of fear they will later be accused of corruption, the sources said. PDVSA workers, often visibly thinner, sometimes surreptitiously hand out resumes to executives from private companies, according to a source at a foreign firm. In a rare protest last month, angry Oil Ministry workers blocked access to the cafeteria, demanding better benefits and chanting that Quevedo should resign. Venezuela’s foreign oil partners, which include California-based Chevron, Russia’s Rosneft and China’s CNPC, are increasingly worried about PDVSA’s rapidly departing workforce, according to a half-dozen sources at multinational companies operating in Venezuela. But as minority partners, they have little or no sway over salaries and management.  The foreign partners have also grown increasingly frustrated with Quevedo, who initially asked for their suggestions on fixing the state-run firm but now appears ill-disposed towards reforms, the sources said. At least one foreign company is considering bringing in foreign specialists to improve its operations, one of the sources added. But with crime, power cuts and shortages rampant in Venezuela, luring foreign professionals is tough. Still, in the Orinoco belt, some vow to stay in the belief that Maduro’s government can’t last. “We can’t give up,” said Tabata, the union leader who watched Quevedo’s truck drive by that day. “This government is unstable and could fall at any moment - and who will be left?” Reporting by Deisy Buitrago and Alexandra Ulmer; Additional reporting by Mircely Guanipa in Punto Fijo, Marianna Parraga in Houston, and Brian Ellsworth in Caracas; Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil-workers/insight-under-military-rule-venezuela-oil-workers-quit-in-a-stampede-idUKL1N1R32CE,17 Apr 2018,"Chauffeured around in a sleek

2018-04-17,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Two leaks in a month, a 90-day outage and $58 million in fines is not enough to temper Anglo American’s (AAL.L) ambition for its long-delayed, multi-billion dollar Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil. Purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion, Anglo American was once counting on Minas-Rio to produce 26.5 million tons of iron ore by 2016. The mine’s strength is its high-grade iron ore that commands a premium as the world’s biggest commodity consumer China seeks to cut pollution. Minas-Rio is Anglo American’s biggest development project, and its bet on the future of iron ore, but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in ramp-up phase. The project has been delayed by Brazil’s labyrinthine permitting process, and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline, which will be shut during a three month inspection. Renewed focus on environmental standards at mines, after leaks at the Norwegian-owned Alunorte refinery and from Anglo’s pipelines, has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes. Brazil’s federal environmental regulator Ibama levied fines against Anglo American of 71 million reais ($21.1 million) related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine. That was in addition to 125.6 million reais ($37.3 million) from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais on April 4.     Ibama said it will need to evaluate a technical report provided by Anglo after its pipeline inspection before it can resume operations. Ibama did not provide a timeline for that evaluation. Anglo American executives are confident Minas-Rio - a project that has cost more than $8 billion to build - will hit that 26.5 million ton production target in 2020, and expect the mine will soon break even, with output expected at only around 10 million tons this year.  “Regardless of the leak, we expect a cash flow very close to the break even (this year),” Anglo American CEO for Brazil Ruben Fernandes told Reuters, adding he expects the company to get a vital final permit from Brazil. Some industry veterans see financial woes weighing heavily, as Anglo continues to pay fixed costs and stops receiving revenue for the expensive mine.  “This without a doubt is a setback,” for Anglo said Roberto Castello Branco, a former senior executive at Vale and board member at Petrobas of the Minas-Rio leak.  He added it is also a negative for the Brazilian mining industry which may now face tougher scrutiny to operate a mine in a country that has suffered repeated environmental damage from mining.  “It is a situation in which everyone loses,” said Branco. Rival miners have already pulled back production after their own leaks. Norway’s Hydro (NHY.OL) has halved capacity at its Alunorte alumina refinery after a leak, while Samarco - a joint venture between BHP (BHP.AX) BLT.L and Vale (VALE3.SA) - has yet to resume output after a dam collapse in 2015 that killed 19 people. Recovering Anglo’s initial investment was complex but not impossible, Fernandes said.     He has not put a figure on lost revenue during the shutdown over next few months, telling Reuters that the focus is on “stable production of 26 million and a half in keeping with the project. Then we will know the cost of production.” Without the permit to expand, Minas-Rio would run out of ore at the end of the year.  Anglo American executives have played down the pipeline leaks, saying the spills were not toxic and swiftly contained.     “We should be ready to apply for the operating license in the third quarter of this year,” Fernandes said.  The stakes for Brazil are high when it comes to how strict its regulators get on mine safety, given the country is well-placed to supply the United States as President Donald Trump’s tariff war aims to boost his domestic steel industry.  A more robust U.S. industry would need more iron ore and Brazil is geographically in the right region to supply it, having gotten a tariff exemption.     “If the iron-ore price stays high, it will be a very profitable asset,” said Steve Magill, head of European Value at UBS Asset Management, a top 20 Anglo American shareholder.  “But we have to acknowledge that because of past mistakes, the company spent a huge amount on it, so the return on the total investment won’t be good.”    That said, Anglo has outperformed peers this year in part because of improved efficiency in production of bulk commodities coal and iron ore and strong output from its Kumba operations in South Africa.  For the full-year 2017, Anglo American’s most profitable divisions were coal followed by iron ore and manganese, accounting for respectively 32 and 27 percent of EBITDA.

2018-04-17,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Two leaks in a month, a 90-day outage and $58 million in fines is not enough to temper Anglo American’s (AAL.L) ambition for its long-delayed, multi-billion dollar Minas-Rio iron ore mine in Brazil. Purchased at the height of the commodities boom a decade ago for $5.5 billion, Anglo American was once counting on Minas-Rio to produce 26.5 million tons of iron ore by 2016. The mine’s strength is its high-grade iron ore that commands a premium as the world’s biggest commodity consumer China seeks to cut pollution. Minas-Rio is Anglo American’s biggest development project, and its bet on the future of iron ore, but so far it only accounts for a small percentage of its overall profits as it is still in ramp-up phase. The project has been delayed by Brazil’s labyrinthine permitting process, and production is now hampered by the leaks on the pipeline, which will be shut during a three month inspection. Renewed focus on environmental standards at mines, after leaks at the Norwegian-owned Alunorte refinery and from Anglo’s pipelines, has clouded its prospects in some investors eyes. Brazil’s federal environmental regulator Ibama levied fines against Anglo American of 71 million reais ($21.1 million) related to two spills last month from a pipeline that carries iron ore from the Minas-Rio mine. That was in addition to 125.6 million reais ($37.3 million) from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais on April 4.

2018-04-17,"(Reuters) - Nine states in the U.S. Northeast have slashed greenhouse gas pollution, created thousands of jobs in clean energy, and cut consumer power costs using a market-based scheme to slash carbon emissions, according to a study released on Tuesday. The report on the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative from Boston-based consultancy Analysis Group comes as the Trump administration seeks to unwind federal efforts to fight climate change, arguing they would kill jobs and stifle growth. The RGGI - a cap-and-trade scheme adopted in 2009 - has provided its nine members $1.4 billion in net economic benefits since 2015, according to the study. It has generated more than 14,500 job-years in the renewable energy and efficiency sectors. A job-year is the equivalent of a full-time job for a year. Those benefits come in addition to a more than 50 percent cut in emissions of carbon dioxide in the region since the RGGI’s inception - a trend aided by the retirement of aging fossil-fuel power plants, cheap natural gas, and sluggish demand in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. “All of the states have benefited from an actual reduction in carbon emissions,” Sue Tierney, a senior adviser with Analysis Group, said in an interview last week. “From a monetary and economic point of view ... consumers are a bit better off.” A report by the Congressional Research Service last year, however, said the RGGI program’s direct impact on reducing global greenhouse gas emissions was “arguably negligible,” in part because the region overall is responsible for just 7 percent of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. The RGGI system, which was meant as a model for other states and countries to join or replicate, seeks to encourage carbon cuts by requiring industries like power plants to acquire tradable permits to cover their emissions. Each year, fewer permits are made available by the states - creating an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon output. The revenue from the permit sales has amounted to some $2.8 billion since 2009. The revenue goes to the member states, which then invest in programs that support energy efficiency, renewable energy and jobs training, according to the report. Analysis Group said the permit costs had led some fossil fuel generators most affected to hike power prices, but that the states’ investments in energy efficiency and renewables had more than compensated for that by reducing consumer demand, resulting in an overall decline in costs for electricity.  Wholesale power prices in New England averaged roughly $33 per megawatt hour in 2017, among the highest in the country, but still less than half the level in 2008 before RGGI was adopted, according to data from grid operator ISO New England. The RGGI states include Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont. New Jersey, an original member, is seeking to rejoin after withdrawing in 2011.  The Analysis Group’s report was funded mainly by progressive and environmentalist foundations including the Barr Foundation, the Energy Foundation and the Merck Family Fund.

2018-04-17,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - While China has made progress cutting smog, the damage to the health of millions of people may already have been done, especially as the population ages, the head of a U.S.-based research agency said. China faces about 1.6 million premature deaths a year as a result of air pollution, the U.S.-based Health Effects Institute (HEI) said in a report, based on data going back to 1990, published on Tuesday. China cut concentrations of hazardous particles known as PM2.5 by 6.5 percent in 338 cities last year. Smog-prone northern regions also met 2013-2017 air quality targets after a winter campaign to cut industrial output, coal consumption and traffic. Nevertheless, deaths could still rise as China ages and overall air quality remains below the country’s own standards, the study showed. “People are living longer and older people are more susceptible to the diseases most closely linked to air pollution - the major causes of death in China like stroke, heart attack, and lung cancer,” HEI president Dan Greenbaum told Reuters in an interview. “We have done some projections in China up to 2030, and even with improvements in air quality, you see the number of deaths going up as the population gets older,” he added. The number of Chinese people over 60 reached 240 million at the end 2017, accounting for 17.3 percent of the population and up 55 million since 2011, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.  The China Association of Social Security, a government-registered research group, expects the number to reach 400 million by 2035.    As the government prepares a new smog action plan for 2018-2020, the next round of measures could prove harder to implement, Greenbaum said.  “The pollution itself gets harder to treat and even though China has been making progress, it has pretty much leveled off,” he said.  He pointed to the challenge of cleaning up smaller factories that emit PM2.5 particles, as well as the need to tackle other pollutants.  Concentrations of lung-damaging, ground-level ozone, caused in part by urban traffic congestion, are rising and experts say China should target it in its new action plan. Authorities should also focus on the countryside, where indoor pollution caused by direct fuel combustion is responsible for more than a third of total annual deaths, the HEI study said. Inhaling fumes from the indoor burning of coal or biomass for cooking and heating is associated with higher rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in rural areas. China has provided incentives allowing households to switch to cleaner natural gas and biogas from pigs and cattle. The number of annual deaths related to indoor burning in rural areas has halved since 1990 to 600,000, the study said.       However, the millions of migrant workers who moved to cities and industrial areas over that period may have replaced one serious health risk with another, Greenbaum said. Average PM2.5 stood at 43 micrograms in China last year, but rose to 65 micrograms in the heavy industrial region of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, according to environment ministry data. China aims to reach an “interim” national standard of 35 micrograms by around 2035, the environment ministry said last year.

The dollar was barely changed, with demand for safe-haven U.S. Treasuries ebbing as investor risk appetite improved in parts of the broader markets as investors took the view Western-led strikes on Syria were a one-off intervention. China’s economy grew a welcome 6.8 percent in the first quarter of 2018 from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, unchanged from the previous quarter. But separate data showed March industrial output missed expectations and first-quarter fixed-asset investment growth slowed, tempering equity market gains. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.05 percent. Australian stocks gained 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.15 percent. Shanghai rose  0.15 percent and Japan’s Nikkei was flat. While Saturday’s missile strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syria, investor risk appetite improved on speculation that the attacks would not lead to prolonged conflict. “The markets had been bracing for a possible escalation in Syria following President Trump’s earlier warnings. Military action, however, has been limited, bringing relief,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “That said, the underlying picture has not changed. Conflict continues in Syria and trade issues remain unresolved. Geopolitics will impact the markets again.” The Dow gained 0.87 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent on Monday, with the biggest boosts from technology and healthcare sectors as investors were optimistic about the earnings season and appeared less worried about U.S.-led missile attacks in Syria. S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit, on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.441 after losing 0.4 percent overnight. The euro was steady at $1.2377. The dollar was effectively flat at 107.060 yen The pound rose to $1.4355, its highest since June 2016, with focus on data that could cement expectations of a May interest rate increase from the Bank of England. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped into the currency market again on Tuesday, buying HK$5.77 billion ($735 million) in Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the lower end of its allowable trading band.

2018-04-17,"* March refinery runs at record on higher import quotas * Q1 crude runs 12.06 mln bpd, up 7.5 percent on year * March crude oil output near lows since June 2011 * Lower-cost oil producer CNOOC set to ramp up output By Chen Aizhu and Meng Meng BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - Chinese refineries processed a record of more than 12.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in March, boosted by ample government import quotas and steady margins. The world’s second-largest oil user processed 51.51 million tonnes of crude last month, equivalent to 12.13 million bpd, according to the National Statistical Bureau. That beat the previous record of 12.03 mln bpd, set last November, the bureau’s data showed. Last month’s number compared with an average of 11.56 million bpd for the first two months, and 11.19 million bpd in March last year. Throughput for the first quarter gained 7.5 percent on-year to 148.72 million tonnes, or 12.06 million bpd. That represents an increase in runs of 841,600 bpd during the period. The record March refinery output echoes bumper crude oil imports into the world’s top buyer, which made its second-highest purchases on record last month. At the end of last year China issued 121.3 million tonnes of crude oil import quotas under its first batch of allowances for 2018, mostly to independent plants. That compared with a total of 93.2 million tonnes of quotas issued to independents in 2017. But crude runs are now expected to head lower as refiners enter the peak maintenance season. At least three major state refineries, with combined crude processing capacity of 860,000 bpd, have kicked off overhauls that will last 40-60 days between April and May. Four independent plants with a combined capacity of 200,000 bpd also started maintenance this month. REF/OUT Meanwhile the statistics bureau data showed China’s March crude oil output stood at 15.96 million tonnes, or 3.76 million bpd, flat compared with the average levels in the first two months and near the lowest since June of 2011. While higher-cost producers like top state giants PetroChina and Sinopec may be slower to ramp up production as benchmark Brent crude tops $70 a barrel, lower-cost offshore producer CNOOC Ltd is set to pump more. CNOOC, which reported all-in per barrel development costs of $32.50 last year, aims to speed up development projects this year. The offshore oil and gas specialist has targeted output of 470-480 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) this year, up from 469 million boe in 2017. China’s natural gas output last month came in at 13.5 billion cubic metres (bcm), up 0.2 percent from the same month a year earlier, the statistics bureau said. That compared with a total of 26.2 bcm in the first two months of the year. The world’s No.3 consumer of the fuel last week began injecting gas into 25 underground storage units as demand drops after the peak heating season ended in March. 1 tonne = 7.3 barrels for crude oil

The country’s coal output came in at 290 million tonnes in March, according to data from the National Statistics Bureau, although that marked a 1.3-percent rise from the same month last year. The monthly decline came as local coal prices were down about 20 percent from records hit in January, with warmer weather crimping demand from utilities. The data showed Chinese coal output for the January-March period grew to 804.5 million tonnes, up 3.9 percent from the same time last year. Adding to worries of potential oversupply, China has approved five large-scale new coal mines since January. Traders and analysts said new supply from these mines could put further downward pressure on prices. China’s largest coal producer China Shenhua Energy lowered its sales and production forecasts recently. Shenhua aims to produce 290 million tonnes of coal in 2018, down 1.8 percent from a year ago, Shenhua said in its annual earnings report on March 23, while sales are likely to decline 3 percent from 2017 to 430 million tonnes.

Smelters in smog-prone northern Chinese cities were only allowed to return to full operating rates from March 15, after being ordered to cut production by at least 30 percent during the peak winter heating season that began in mid-November. But not all were planning to ramp up output immediately, given low aluminium prices last month, the lengthy and expensive process of restarting smelters, and the emergence of new capacity from state-run producers in the Inner Mongolia and Guangxi regions. The rising output will stir debate about the government’s efforts to shutter outdated, inefficient capacity as the country ramps up exports, adding to a global glut. Production of a group of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminium, lead, zinc and nickel – rose 3.0 percent in March to 4.55 million tonnes from a year earlier. Year-to-date output was up 2.4 percent at 13.39 million tonnes. The other non-ferrous metals are tin, antimony, mercury, magnesium and titanium.

2018-04-17,"(Repeats from April 16 with no changes to text) * GRAPHIC: Trends in China's trade, economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 16 (Reuters) - China’s imports of major commodities may be losing some of their strong growth momentum, with gains in the first quarter of this year failing to keep pace with those from the same period in 2017. At first glance, China’s imports of crude oil, iron ore, coal and copper looked to have bounced back in March after a poor showing in February. However, the first two months of the year generally result in some distortions in the data, depending on the timing of the Lunar New Year. This year’s holiday fell entirely within February, resulting in weaker import numbers. It’s always more illuminating to look at first quarter numbers when assessing China’s commodity imports, and here the story is far more mixed. Crude oil imports rose 7 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared to the same period a year earlier to the equivalent of about 9.1 million barrels per day (bpd). However, the growth rate in the first quarter of 2017 was 15 percent, meaning that although China’s imports of crude oil are still increasing, they aren’t doing so at the same pace as they did in the early part of last year. In volume terms, the gain still looks impressive, with imports in the first quarter some 600,000 bpd more than they were in the same period in 2017. However, it’s also worth noting that exports of refined fuels were about 1.27 million bpd, which is about 210,000 bpd more than they were in the first quarter of last year. This implies that of the additional 600,000 bpd of crude imported in the first quarter of 2018, just over a third was exported as refined products, a further factor pointing to the loss of some growth momentum in China’s crude demand. Coal imports also looked to have rebounded strongly in March, with a 27.8 percent jump over the previous month, but the gain for the first quarter as a whole was a more modest 16.6 percent. This growth rate is still robust, but it is about half the pace of what was achieved in the first quarter of 2017. The story is even weaker for iron ore, with first quarter imports of 270.5 million tonnes actually being 0.1 percent down from the same quarter last year. In the January-March period last year, iron ore imports were up 12.2 percent from the same period in 2016. It would appear that China’s vast steel sector may be taking a breather after several months of strong gains, and the build-up of iron ore inventories at ports to record levels in recent weeks probably has helped lower the appetite for imports. However, copper is an area of strength in China’s first quarter, with imports of unwrought copper increasing 7.3 percent in the first quarter, a reversal of the decline of 20 percent experienced in the first three months of 2017. However, it’s likely that some of this gain is due to a change in regulations, making it more difficult to import copper scrap and thereby boosting demand for the refined metal. Overall, the picture that emerges from China’s first quarter trade data is somewhat similar to an Australian government public information campaign on terrorism, which urged citizens to “be alert, not alarmed”. There is little to suggest that China’s economy is slowing faster than expected, and the data show that commodity imports are still relatively robust, even if the pace of growth is slowing. It’s likely that a healthy moderation is the best outcome for China, just so long as it doesn’t turn into something more pronounced in the current quarter.

2018-04-17,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday amid worries there could be a high risk of disruptions to supply, especially in the Middle East. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were at $71.80 per barrel at 0120 GMT, up 38 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 39 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $66.61 a barrel. Traders said oil markets were receiving general support due to a sense that there were high risks of supply disruptions, including a potentially spreading conflict in the Middle East, renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran and falling output as a result of political and economic crisis in Venezuela. “With so many potential supply disruptors in play and few signs that the current market upheaval will end any time soon, traders continue to pay the geopolitical risk premium,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “Oil prices should remain bid ... at least through the Iran nuclear deal deadline (May 12) if not for the remainder of 2018,” he added. Oil markets have generally been well supported this year, with Brent up by around 16 percent from its 2018-low in February, due to healthy demand which comes as the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) leads supply cuts aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices.

2018-04-17,"(Repeats April 16 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2EQ0vFd By John Kemp LONDON, April 16 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are holding a near-record bullish position in crude oil and refined fuels but the buying seems to have run out of momentum and is increasingly concentrated only in Brent. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum by 12 million barrels in the week to April 10. The net long position has increased by 149 million barrels over the last four weeks to 1.365 billion barrels. Net length across the petroleum complex is only 118 million below the record of 1.484 billion set on Jan. 23. But the increasing bullishness is becoming more selective and is almost entirely concentrated in Brent, according to an analysis of position records published by regulators and exchanges. Portfolio managers increased their net long position in Brent by 17 million barrels in the week to April 10 and have raised net length by a total of 48 million barrels since Jan. 23. By contrast, the net long position in WTI was cut by 3 million barrels last week and is down by 108 million barrels since Jan. 23. Net positions in U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil were cut or essentially unchanged in the most recent week (tmsnrt.rs/2EQ0vFd). The result is an increasing divergence between Brent and WTI and to a lesser extent between Brent and refined fuels. Portfolio managers now hold a record net long position of 632 million barrels in Brent, up from 584 million on Jan. 23. Hedge fund long positions outnumber shorts in Brent by more than 20:1, up from a ratio of 11:1 back in January. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about crude prices, including strong growth in oil consumption, continued output restrictions by OPEC, disruption in Venezuela, and the threat of new sanctions on Iran. OPEC members have indicated they want to see a further rise in oil prices to stimulate more upstream investment and may be targeting prices as high as $80 per barrel, up from just over $70 currently. The latest position data refers to positions at the end of trading on April 10, before the United States and its allies launched air strikes on Syria in the early hours of April 14. Rising political and military tensions across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, have created a speculative bid for oil prices. Nonetheless, hedge fund positioning in Brent has become exceptionally stretched and is a significant source of downside risk if and when fund managers try to realise some of their profits.

The dollar pulled back along with safe-haven U.S. Treasuries as investor risk appetite improved in the broader markets. The near-term focal point was on China’s gross domestic product data due at 0200 GMT. The world’s second biggest economy was expected to have carried most of its strong momentum from last year into the first quarter of 2018, after growing 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter. While Saturday’s missile strikes were the biggest intervention by Western countries against Syria, investor risk appetite in the broader markets improved on speculation that the attacks would not lead to prolonged conflict. “The markets had been bracing for a possible escalation in Syria following President Trump’s earlier warnings. Military action, however, has been limited, bringing relief,” said Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “That said, the underlying picture has not changed. Conflict continues in Syria and trade issues remain unresolved. Geopolitics will impact the markets again.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.22 percent. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.2 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.2 percent and Australian stocks added 0.45 percent. The Dow gained 0.87 percent and the S&P 500 rose 0.8 percent on Monday, with the biggest boosts from technology and healthcare sectors as investors were optimistic about the earnings season and appeared less worried about U.S.-led missile attacks in Syria. S&P 500 companies are expected to report an 18.6 percent jump in first-quarter profit, on average, the biggest rise in seven years, according to Thomson Reuters data. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was little changed at 89.407 after losing 0.4 percent overnight. The euro was a shade higher at $1.2383. The dollar was steady at 107.100 yen. The pound touched a near three-month high of $1.4346 and in reach of a post-Brexit referendum high with focus on data that could cement expectations of a May interest rate increase by the Bank of England. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) stepped into the currency market again on Tuesday, buying HK$5.77 billion ($735 million) in Hong Kong dollars as the local currency repeatedly hit the lower end of its allowable trading band. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was at 2.832 percent after rising to 2.865 on Monday, its highest since March 22. U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.3 percent to $66.43 a barrel after tumbling nearly 1.8 percent overnight on waning concerns about tensions in the Middle East. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-04-17,"BEIJING, April 17 (Reuters) - China’s shale gas production will likely reach 17 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2020, nearly double the 2017 level, as local oil companies make big progress with drilling technology and cost cutting, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a note on Tuesday. Nearly 700 new wells will come onstream between 2018 and 2020 at three key projects - Sinopec’s Fuling, and PetroChina’s Changning-Weiyuan and Zhaotong - all located in the country’s southwest, and at a total cost of $5.5 billion, Woodmac estimated. The forecast 17 bcm of output in 2020 falls short of Beijing’s goal of 30 bcm, which was slashed by more than half from the government’s initial target set in 2012. That means the world’s No.3 gas user will need to keep its imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) at elevated levels. Woodmac has separately forecast China’s LNG imports will increase by a quarter to nearly 49 million tonnes this year, from record highs in 2017. China produced 9 bcm of shale gas last year, or 6 percent of its total gas output. “China is eager to materialise its shale gas potential to fuel its massive gasification initiative and support rising demand growth,” said Wood Mackenzie’s Tingyun Yang. Despite estimates that China is home to the world’s largest recoverable shale gas resource, its shale formations tend to be deeper, more fractured and located in densely populated mountainous terrains, leading to higher costs and complications in drilling. However, state firms have managed to reduce well costs significantly - by 40 percent for exploration wells versus 2010 and 25 percent for commercial wells versus 2014 - by deploying local service companies, home-manufactured equipment and improving drilling technologies, said Yang. Explorations and joint studies by global majors such as Shell, BP, Exxon and Total at Chinese shale blocks have yielded little success. Shell, which pledged billions of dollars of investment in China’s shale sector, pulled out of shale operations in Sichuan several years ago.

2018-04-17,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Scientists aboard a Greenpeace ship have documented the existence of coral in an area off the northern coast of Brazil and plans by French major Total plans to drill for oil should be banned, the environmental organization said on Monday. Greenpeace said that a coral reef near the mouth of the Amazon extends further than previously thought and its findings would be published soon by the scientific journal Frontiers in Marine Science.  The research could further complicate plans by oil companies to explore an area that some geologists say could hold up to 14 billion barrels of petroleum, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico. “Now that we know that the Amazon coral overlaps the perimeter of Total’s two blocks, the Brazilian government has no choice but to deny the license for the company to explore for oil in the region,” Greenpeace said in a statement. Total led a group including Britain’s BP Plc and Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras in buying five exploration blocks in the Foz do Amazonas basin in 2013, but the discovery of a massive coral reef just 28 kilometers (17 miles) from the blocks has thrown environmental approval for drilling into doubt. As the operator, Total is responsible for applying for environmental licenses. Representatives for Total did not immediately reply to requests for comment on the Greenpeace statement. Brazil’s environmental regulator Ibama has repeatedly refused to accept Total’s environmental impact study. Last August Ibama warned that it needed more information or it would suspend the French oil firm’s license application. Environmentalists said potential oil leaks in the Foz do Amazonas basin, named for its location near the mouth of the Amazon river, could wreak havoc in the rainforest in Brazil’s far northern Amapá state in addition to harming the reef.
