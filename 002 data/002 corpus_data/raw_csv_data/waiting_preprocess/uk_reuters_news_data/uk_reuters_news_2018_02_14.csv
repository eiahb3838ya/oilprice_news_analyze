Odebrecht needs cash to pay debt maturing this year, including 500 million reais ($152 million) in bonds, according to the paper, which cited unnamed sources. In a statement, the group said it “is constantly talking to its creditor banks,” but did not confirm any new transactions. Part of the Braskem stake is already pledged in collateral to banks, and all dividends have also been surrendered to service the debt, Reuters reported last year.

2018-02-14,"(Recasts with lawmaker’s comments, adds Barrasso) By David Shepardson WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed hiking the federal gasoline tax by 25 cents a gallon in a meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday about funding his infrastructure spending proposal, a Democratic lawmaker said. Senator Tom Carper, who attended the meeting, confirmed a report by online publication Axios that the Republican president had backed the increase. The 18.4-cent-a-gallon tax on gasoline has not been hiked since 1993. The federal diesel tax is 24.4 cents a gallon. “To my surprise, President Trump, today in our meeting, offered his support for raising the gas and diesel tax by 25 cents a gallon and dedicating that money to improve our roads, highways, and bridges,” Carper said in a statement. “The president even offered to help provide the leadership necessary so that we could do something that has proven difficult in the past.” The White House did not confirm that Trump backed a gasoline tax hike in the meeting. A White House official noted that Trump “has said everything is on the table” to achieve infrastructure improvements. “The gas tax has its pros and cons, and that’s why the president is leading a thoughtful discussion on the right way to solve our nation’s infrastructure problems,” the official added. Trump expressed confidence on Wednesday a deal could be reached. “This is an issue where I really believe we can find common ground,” he said. Some in Congress have said they are open to the idea of increasing the gasoline tax but that Trump would need to provide cover to win approval for the politically risky move. Republican Senator John Barrasso, who attended the meeting, said he opposed a hike. Many in Congress say such an increase has little or no chance of approval. Trump wants to use $200 billion in federal funds to try to stimulate $1.5 trillion in infrastructure improvements over 10 years but would cut an equivalent amount in projected infrastructure spending from the federal budget as it shifted more costs to states and cities. Democrats insist any infrastructure plan must include new revenue. Congress has transferred nearly $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund since 2008. Lawmakers, to maintain current spending levels, would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026. Last month, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce backed hiking fuel taxes by 25 cents a gallon, which it said would raise $394 billion over the next 10 years.

2018-02-14,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Marathon Oil Corp posted a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by rising crude prices and cost cuts, sending its shares up more than 2 percent in extended trading.  Marathon said it plans to raise spending this year slightly from 2017, while hewing closely to a strategy favoring shareholder returns, a topic getting rising attention in the U.S. shale industry. “In 2018, we expect to improve corporate-level returns from our disciplined development capital program,” Chief Executive Lee Tillman said in a statement.     For the fourth quarter, Marathon posted a net loss of $28 million, or 3 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $1.38 billion, or $1.62 per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items, including a loss on hedging of fossil fuel output, Marathon earned 7 cents per share. By that measure, analysts expected earnings of a penny per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Production in the quarter rose 12 percent to 383,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Marathon expects to pump 390,000 to 410,000 boe/d this year. For 2018, Marathon plans a capital budget of $2.3 billion, up from last year’s $2.2 billion. About 60 percent of that will be spent in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation and the Eagle Ford shale of East Texas. The rest will be spent in the Permian Basin and projects in Oklahoma.  The budget should be break-even with oil prices at or above $50 per barrel, the company said. U.S. oil prices traded around $60.70 on Wednesday.  Shares of the Houston-based company rose 2.4 percent to $17.36 in after-hours trading. The company plans to hold a conference call with investors on Thursday morning.

2018-02-14,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas during President Donald Trump’s first year in office under a climate-friendly investment policy inherited from the Obama administration, according to a Reuters review of government documents. The growing U.S. support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U.S. solar loans abroad. It also deepens confusion about Trump’s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil-fuel development. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the government’s international finance institution, loaned more than $630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017, 90 percent of which were solar, wind, or other low-carbon ventures, according to the investment documents.  That compares to $797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016, 61 percent of which went to clean energy. The agency’s lending to solar projects doubled to more than $250 million in 2017, supporting ventures in India, Africa and Latin America, according to the records. (For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time, see: tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H ) White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment. OPIC is a self-funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance “U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities” by investing in ventures abroad. For 40 years, it has operated at no net cost to U.S. tax payers. The agency first set a goal to limit greenhouse gas emissions in 2007 and updated its policies several times during the Obama administration in ways that favour clean energy, most recently in 2017 as Trump prepared to take office. The policy dovetails with Obama’s larger effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration’s priorities.  Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms;  signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions; and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming. That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar - a leading climate-friendly competitor to fossil fuels - but the administration has never made that clear.  Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy, which were preserved by a Republican-controlled Congress in December tax legislation. But Trump has expressed scepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both “very, very expensive.” In January, Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports, saying the move would help domestic manufacturers. But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower-cost imported panels, often from China. OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama-enacted low-carbon policy and that its portfolio is “demand driven” – reflecting both global development needs and American foreign policy priorities. But policy “does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects,” she said, including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option. OPIC’s financing last year, for example, included $50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil.  Last year, Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal “to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market” - but Congress rejected the idea.  Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency. Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals: empowering women in the developing world, and serving U.S. strategic national security interests.  Washburne was not available for an interview, Orr said. Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies, a solar array in Zambia backed by First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp (AES.N). Orb Energy, an Indian solar company backed by U.S. venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc, secured $10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects. Such funding would not be available from India’s conservative banking sector, the company said. “Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables, so we were concerned,” Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview.  But he was told there was “no fundamental change” in its priorities for selecting projects, he said. Since 2011, more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar, wind or other non-hydroelectric forms of renewable power.  That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers, but has not always gone well for OPIC: the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly $1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted. At issue is whether OPIC properly stress-tested the projects adequately before offering loans. The agency’s losses on the deals could exceed $160 million, sources told Reuters last year. OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades. AES – which received up to $89.5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017 - said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade. The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES, which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal. “That’s the angle that the company has taken,” AES Treasurer Daniel Stadelmann said in an interview, referring to the company’s shift towards cleaner energy sources. “So it matches.” (GRAPHIC: U.S. agency's foreign energy investments favour renewables, tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H)  Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-solar-opic/update-1-in-trumps-first-year-u-s-agency-doubles-solar-investments-abroad-idUKL2N1Q41IN,14 Feb 2018,"The United States government

2018-02-14,"WASHINGTON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed a 25-cent hike in the federal gasoline tax in a meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday about funding his infrastructure spending proposal, congressional aides said. Two congressional aides confirmed a report by publication Axios that Trump had backed an increase. Democratic Senator Tom Carper, who attended the meeting, told CNN that Trump was open to a 25-cent increase in gas and diesel taxes. “He said he knew it was a difficult thing for legislators to support and said that he would ... provide the political cover to do that,” Carper said, according to a CNN reporter’s tweet. The White House did not confirm or deny that Trump backed a gasoline tax hike in the meeting. A White House official noted that Trump “has said everything is on the table” to achieve infrastructure improvements. “The gas tax has its pros and cons, and that’s why the president is leading a thoughtful discussion on the right way to solve our nation’s infrastructure problems,” the official added. Trump expressed confidence on Wednesday that a deal could be reached. “This is an issue where I really believe we can find common ground between Republicans and Democrats,” he said. Democrats insist any infrastructure plan must include new revenue. The federal gasoline tax has been 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, and inflation as well as rising vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced its usefulness in raising enough money to keep pace with repair needs. Congress has transferred nearly $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund from 2008 through 2015. Lawmakers, to maintain current spending levels, would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026.

2018-02-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Wednesday, shaking off earlier weakness as U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early.  Markets also benefited from more weakness in the dollar .DXY, which dropped 0.7 percent after stronger-than-expected U.S. consumer inflation figures. Oil tends to move inversely to the dollar, and has also of late been trading in tandem with stocks, which finished the day up more than 1 percent. [.N] “The demand fundamentals in today’s report were really strong,” said Richard Hastings, macro strategist at Seaport Global Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. “At the same time, you’ve got a little bit of a weaker dollar day on inflation and that could be that some of the price reaction here.”  Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.64 a barrel, or 2.6 percent, to $64.36 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 gained $1.41, or 2.4 percent, to $60.60 a barrel.  U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 1.8 million barrels last week, Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed compared with expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels. [EIA/S]     The market rallied after Al Falih said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said he would rather leave the oil market slightly short of supplies than lift output cuts too early. OPEC and its partners, including Russia, have curbed supply since January 2017 to drain global stocks in an agreement that continues through the end of the year.  There has been concern about that deal’s efficacy due to the sharper-than-expected increase in U.S. production, and that OPEC and Russia may look to exit the deal to preserve market share. Al Falih’s comments suggest that is not in the offing. “The comments from Al Falih are by far most significant thing, big-picture,” said Michael Wittner, managing director and global head of oil research at Societe Generale. “These statements are saying pretty strongly that they really don’t want to go below $60 Brent.”  U.S. production rose to 10.27 million bpd last week, the EIA said, which, if confirmed by monthly data, would represent an all-time U.S. record. The International Energy Agency on Tuesday said the rapid increase in supply, particularly in the United States, could overtake consumption.  Physical markets are reflecting this concern. Prices for crude from the North Sea, Russia, the United States and Middle East have dropped to multi-month lows.

2018-02-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Treasury prices plunged on Wednesday after a spike in U.S. consumer prices in January raised expectations the Federal Reserve may quicken the pace of interest rate hikes, while global stocks rallied as investors took inflation in stride. The U.S. dollar fell against a basket of major world currencies .DXY after the Labor Department said its highly anticipated Consumer Price Index increased 0.5 percent. Gold rebounded from losses as stocks swung higher. The report increased the likelihood that the Fed will raise rates when policy-makers meet March 20-21 - even as U.S. retail sales posted their largest decline in 11 months. The odds of a March rate hike rose 7 percentage points to 83.1 percent, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool. Shares in Europe gained more than 1 percent as did a gauge of global equity activity. Stocks on Wall Street opened lower but steadily climbed through the session after the initial shock of the big jump in monthly inflation was digested. Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist for the Americas at French bank Natixis in New York, said inflation had to be put in context. The year-over-year rate on core inflation at 1.8 percent was still below the Fed’s target of 2 percent, he said. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI shot up 0.3 percent in January.  Monthly data tend to be noisy, said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “The market is doing exactly what the market does, it shoots first and asks questions later,” Orlando said, adding investors are likely to remain jittery until the first Fed policy-setting meeting in March under new Chair Jerome Powell. “There ought to be some chop to it as we’re trying to figure out what’s going on in the economy and how might the Fed adjust monetary policy under a new leadership team given the backdrop of macroeconomic data,” Orlando said. MSCI's all-country world index of stocks in 47 countries .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.42 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading regional shares rose 1.03 percent to close at 1,469.00. Paul Eitelman, an investment strategist at Russell Investments, said it was unlikely the Fed would increase its forecasted rate hikes as such a move would be a bit bold for a new Fed chief and likely be an over-reaction to one data point.  Shares in Europe rose after initial declines as solid corporate results and economic data kept investors confident. Data earlier in the day showed Germany’s economy was set to power ahead in 2018, while a Thomson Reuters study said fourth-quarter European earnings growth expectations were revised upwards after 15 weeks of downgrades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 253.38 points, or 1.03 percent, to 24,893.83. The S&P 500 .SPX gained 35.75 points, or 1.34 percent, to 2,698.69 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 130.11 points, or 1.86 percent, to 7,143.62.     German government bond yields hit their highest in more than two years. The yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond DE10YT=TWEB, the benchmark for the region, reversed earlier declines and rose around 3 basis points to 0.774 percent - its highest level since September 2015, according to Tradeweb data. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a fresh four-year high. The notes US10YT=RR last fell 20/32 in price to yield 2.9131 percent.

2018-02-14,"LONDON/FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bridgewater has shown its hand in Europe with a $22 billion bet against some of the continent’s biggest companies, filings reviewed by Reuters show, part of a bigger shift by the world’s largest hedge fund manager. Although data was not available to show whether Bridgewater holds more European stocks than it “shorts” overall, an investor in the hedge fund firm’s Pure Alpha Major Markets strategy said that its position was slightly net “long” on Feb. 6. But Bridgewater had reduced that long exposure significantly this year, the investor added. Bridgewater, which declined to comment on its trading, bets on macro-economic events and has $160 billion under management.  Unlike the United States, where hedge funds are not required to disclose short positions, European rules brought in as a result of the financial crisis require publication once they go above a certain threshold. Short selling is a mainstay of hedge fund investing and is driven by expectations that shares will fall, which means they can later be repurchased at a lower price to make a profit. Although the filings do not say when Bridgewater first took out its European short positions, many of its above-threshold disclosures are recent, with some in Germany, Italy and France in the past two weeks.  Bridgewater’s billionaire founder Ray Dalio spoke last month of the end of a buoyant global investment market. “It just takes a little change in interest rates to have a bear market,” he told CNBC at the World Economic Forum, adding the late part of the cycle may still have quite a way to run. But in a post on Linkedin this week, he wrote: “Recent spurts in stimulations, growth, and wage numbers signaled that the cycle is a bit ahead of where I thought it was.” The European filings show Bridgewater has bet against firms ranging from Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever (ULVR.L) to French oil group Total (TOTF.PA), and from Deutsche Bank and German industrial group Siemens (SIEGn.DE) to Italian bank Intesa (ISP.MI). The group’s short positions have emerged piecemeal in a series of filings that were made public throughout January and February, although Bridgewater will likely have built up its trades in advance of those announcements. Bridgewater is not known for picking individual stocks and James Helliwell, chief investment strategist and director of the Lex van Dam Trading Academy, said he thought the manager’s position was the result of a view on the wider economy.  “Whilst the extent to which it may be an outright short bet is uncertain, I suspect that it was seen as a relatively cheap hedge against existing global equity exposure.” A London-based equity sales trader at a large U.S. bank said the shorts could just be a bet on fund outflows as volatility increases – which could explain why there are fewer Bridgewater shorts on the UK market – as UK stocks are very under-owned. Bridgewater’s short positions amount to more than $4.5 billion in France and top $7.3 billion in Germany, while in Spain its shorts in four groups amount to almost 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) and in Italy include Unicredit (CRDI.MI) and Enel ENEL.MI. Stock markets, after years of steady increases, wobbled last week amid concern that central banks, which have printed money and cut interest rates to bolster economic activity following the financial crisis, will pare back their support. Bridgewater’s portfolio is fluid and it has been adjusting its trades, cutting back on shorts in the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland, while increasing them in Germany and Italy, the data reviewed by Reuters shows. Bridgewater is not alone in its cautious stance, with BG Master Fund, based in Dublin, last week disclosing a 0.4 percent short position against German lender Commerzbank, while London-based Marshall Wace has made similar bets across Europe.

Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI shot up 0.3 percent in January. Monthly data tend to be noisy, said Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “The market is doing exactly what the market does, it shoots first and asks questions later,” Orlando said, adding investors are likely to remain jittery until the first Fed policy-setting meeting in March under new Chair Jerome Powell. “There ought to be some chop to it as we’re trying to figure out what’s going on in the economy and how might the Fed adjust monetary policy under a new leadership team given the backdrop of macroeconomic data,” Orlando said. MSCI’s all-country world index of stocks in 47 countries gained 1.28 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 1.03 percent to close at 1,469.00. Shares in Europe rose after initial declines as solid corporate results and economic data kept investors confident. Data earlier in the day showed Germany’s economy was set to power ahead in 2018, while a Thomson Reuters study said fourth-quarter European earnings growth expectations were revised upwards after 15 weeks of downgrades. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 205.55 points, or 0.83 percent, to 24,846. The S&P 500 gained 31.46 points, or 1.18 percent, to 2,694.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 117.72 points, or 1.68 percent, to 7,131.23. German government bond yields hit their highest in more than two years. The yield on Germany’s 10-year government bond , the benchmark for the region, reversed earlier declines and rose around 3 basis points to 0.774 percent - its highest level since September 2015, according to Tradeweb data. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note hit a fresh four-year high. The notes last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.9095 percent. Oil prices rebounded from earlier losses after U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major producers would prefer tighter markets than to end supply cuts too early. U.S. crude inventories rose 1.8 million barrels last week, Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed compared with expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels.

2018-02-14,"(Updates with additional comments, details of drawdown in Cushing hub) By David Gaffen Feb 14 (Reuters) - U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected last week, but the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, saw yet another drawdown that has halved stocks in the last three months, a trend that may continue until more refiners shut for maintenance. Crude inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9, short of analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. However, the most notable action took place in Cushing, where stocks fell by 3.6 million barrels, EIA said. The combination of a new pipeline running from the hub to Memphis, along with reduced flows from TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline, has dropped stocks to 32.7 million barrels, the lowest since January 2015, and down 49 percent from early November’s 64.6 million barrels. The Diamond Pipeline only started in December, but it can run 190,000 barrels a day across Arkansas to Memphis, and it has had a ripple effect across other markets. Gulf Coast cash prices have declined as fewer barrels are making their way north. “The Diamond Pipeline is increasing takeaway capacity out of Cushing directly, but there’s also 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day of new capacity commissioned and in the process of ramping up from (Texas’s) Permian directly to the Gulf Coast,” said Michael Wittner, managing director and global head of oil research at Societe Generale. Flows from Keystone into Cushing were restricted after a November leak in South Dakota; that line had been operating under reduced pressure, and it is a primary feeder route to Cushing. The sharp decline in flows comes even as Gulf Coast inventories have risen by 1.7 percent since early November. Some of this is a seasonal effect, Wittner said. As more refiners in the Midwest start to go into seasonal maintenance periods, inventories in Cushing should rise. However, the increased focus in the United States on exports has had some analysts saying the markets need to shift their benchmark to a Houston-based WTI figure, reflecting global trade. Gasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels, more than double the 1.2 million-barrel gain forecast by analysts polled by Reuters. Refinery crude runs fell by 635,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell 2.7 percentage points to 89.8 percent, the lowest since November, as refiners went into seasonal maintenance periods. Crude production rose again, hitting 10.27 million bpd on a weekly basis, which would be a record if confirmed by monthly figures. November’s monthly data showed production in the United States rose to 10.04 million bpd, and the country now ranks second in overall production, trailing only Russia. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 459,000 barrels, versus expectations for a 1.1 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. U.S. crude futures rose on the news, with West Texas Intermediate up $1.25 to $60.44 a barrel as of 2:17 p.m. EST (1917 GMT). Brent gained $1.49 to $64.21 a barrel.

2018-02-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - French start-up Sigfox, which builds networks to connect washing machines and other objects to the internet, says it is struggling to meet its growth targets due to high expectations for alternative, forthcoming 5G services. The company, whose shareholders include French oil major Total and U.S. group Salesforce.com, missed its revenue target last year, CEO Ludovic Le Moan told Reuters on Wednesday, but it still sees good prospects for its technology and aims to break even in the fourth quarter of this year. If it reaches that target, it could seek a stock market listing, Le Moan said in an interview.  Sigfox seeks to tap into the burgeoning so-called Internet of Things (IoT) sector where it faces competition from two other emerging networks: LoRa, backed by French telecom operator Orange and equipment maker Cisco Systems, and NB-IoT, which is backed by Japan’s Softbank. These three companies’ wireless networks enable devices to transfer small volumes of data over a wide area while maintaining battery life over many years, whereas 5G services can carry much bigger volumes but cost a lot more.  “There’s a lot of noise around 5G these days,” Le Moan said. “But these technologies that are being put in place are much more costly,” he added. “For telecom players, this is all about generating new revenue.” The first standards for 5G, the next generation of broadband mobile internet, were recently approved with first commercial offers expected in 2019 or 2020.  The roll-out for 5G will cost billions of euros for each national market, compared with a few million for Sigfox’s IoT networks, Le Moan said. Objects connected through Sigfox’s networks range from house alarms to public waste containers and water metres.  Set up in 2009, the Toulouse-based company generated revenues of 50 million euros in 2017, up from 32 million in 2016 but 10 million short of its initial target, Le Moan said.  Higher volume usage of IoT chips, such as those made by STMicroelectronics or Texas Instruments, will help drive down the cost of IoT chips to a few cents per unit, making the technology more attractive, he said.  Sigfox, which has raised more 270 million euros over the last seven years and has 380 staff, currently has 2.5 million connected objects on its networks, Le Moan said.

2018-02-14,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Agricultural merchant Bunge Ltd (BG.N) reported a worse-than-expected loss for the fourth quarter on Wednesday, the latest in a string of poor results that has left the company’s management fending off takeover bids from rivals. Several years of abundant grains supply on global markets have made it tough for Bunge and its rivals to turn a profit on their core business: buying, processing and selling corn, soy and wheat. That has left the sector open to consolidation, and Bunge has received interest from both U.S. rival Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) and Swiss-based commodities trader Glencore PLC (GLEN.L). “I have, and management has, the board’s support,” Chief Executive Soren Schroder told Reuters in an interview after the company reported a $69 million loss for the fourth quarter. The loss, compared with a profit of $262 million a year earlier, is likely to raise shareholder pressure on executives to find a buyer or take more aggressive steps to shore up the agribusiness division. “They have taken corrective actions,” said William Densmore, senior director at FitchRatings, after the earnings were announced. “However, management credibility has lessened during the past year and any further operating challenges in 2018 could likely ratchet up the pressure.” Bunge, whose shares fell more than 5 percent in midday trading, warned analysts the impact on margins of global grains oversupply was expected to spill into the first quarter of 2018. The company’s management insisted for the fifth quarter in a row their strategy would turn the company around. Divestments including selling or shutting the firm’s sugar trading desk, changing shipping arrangements in South America and focusing on grains and oilseeds businesses were all part of that strategy, Schroder said. Dutch food ingredients company Corbion (CORB.AS) said on Wednesday it is in talks to buy Bunge’s 49.9 percent stake in their oil joint venture in Brazil. Schroder pointed to improving soybean crush margins in the Americas and Europe, tightening global soymeal supplies and rising demand as motives for optimism for results in 2018. The company should also make savings on shipping costs due to changes it has made in hauling contracts in South America, he said. Schroder has forecast a brighter agribusiness outlook for more than a year, yet the segment, its largest in terms of revenues and volumes, has struggled. Bunge was forced to lower agribusiness earnings guidance for three straight quarters in 2017. On Wednesday, the company warned 2018 earnings for the segment would be well below historical averages. Schroder declined to comment on market and media reports about Bunge being approached by rivals ADM and Glencore.  Less than a year ago, Schroder had said he would like to lead consolidation in the global grains industry. In November, Bunge sweetened compensation packages for top executives in the case of a takeover, according to the company’s regulatory filings.     The company and other agricultural traders, including ADM and Cargill [CARG.UL], have been trying to diversify into higher-margin sectors such as food ingredients and aquaculture to compensate for the poor returns on their traditional grain handling businesses. Bunge said fourth-quarter 2017 sales in its agribusiness segment fell 3.5 percent to $7.90 billion even as volumes rose.  On an adjusted basis, Bunge earned a profit of 67 cents a share in the quarter, against analyst expectations for $1.37 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reported a net loss of 48 cents per share, which includes charges related to restructuring. Bunge took a $66 million charge due to tax law changes in the United States and Argentina. Net sales fell 1.6 percent to $11.61 billion. Additional reporting by Anirban Paul in Bangalore.

2018-02-14,"(Adds comments from CEO, analyst) By Tom Polansek and Chris Prentice CHICAGO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd is exiting the global sugar trading business and has identified “a few interested parties” in the business as it moves to concentrate on its grains and oilseeds operations, the company’s chief executive said on Wednesday. Bunge is getting out of sugar trading and distribution after reporting a fourth-quarter loss, which increased pressure on CEO Soren Schroder to improve results at the 200-year-old agricultural merchant that has received takeover approaches from Archer Daniels Midland Co and Glencore Plc. Schroder told Reuters he thinks Bunge’s sugar trading business should have value to other industry members. “We’ve got a few interested parties so that will be our first path of action,” he said in an interview. Schroder declined to name the interested parties. Bunge is a major player in the global sugar industry, both as a trader and as a producer. Trading “was historically positive” for the company, Citigroup analyst David Driscoll said on a Bunge conference call. “I’m not exactly clear why you’d really want to shut that one down,” he said. Bunge has been seeking to get out of the sugar milling business in top-grower Brazil since 2013 as a supply glut has pushed prices lower and made it tough for industry participants to turn a profit. Its eight Brazilian mills can produce sugar and ethanol and have a capacity of more than 20 million tonnes, according to Bunge’s website. The milling business will “have its own direction” from the trading business, Schroder told Reuters. Bunge has struggled to generate enough gross margin to cover costs in sugar, Schroder said on the conference call with analysts. Last year was a tough year for traders and producers, with raw sugar prices tumbling more than 20 percent. “We simply decided that it was time to really focus on what’s core to us, which is agribusiness, foods, grains and oilseeds and get on with it in a good way,” Schroder said on the call. Large grain traders that make money by buying, selling, storing and shipping crops have grappled in recent years with global oversupplies. Thin margins have squeezed core commodity trading operations, including those of ADM, Bunge, Cargill Inc and Louis Dreyfus Co, which dominate the grain industry and are known as the “ABCDs” because of their initials. Bunge has declined to comment on the takeover approach from ADM, which wound down its global sugar trading in 2015 and sold a Brazilian mill a few years ago. Bunge rebuffed Glencore’s approach last year. (Reporting by Tom Polansek and P.J.

2018-02-14,"BENI, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - A humanitarian disaster in eastern Congo is quickly worsening as  aid agencies have been forced to pull back due to growing insecurity and slashed budgets, the head of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) said on Wednesday. More than 4.4 million people have been displaced in Democratic Republic of Congo amid rampant violence that has been aggravated by a political crisis sparked by President Joseph Kabila’s refusal to step down at the end of his mandate in 2016. While conflict in the central Kasai region eased last year, persistent clashes between government soldiers, local militias and foreign rebels in the eastern borderlands have worsened. “We are overwhelmed and underfunded,” NRC head Jan Egeland told Reuters in an interview in the town of Beni in North Kivu province. “The crisis in Congo, especially here in the eastern part of Congo, is phenomenal. It is horrible. And we do not have the global solidarity and response that we need,” he said.  The area around Beni has witnessed some of the worst violence in recent years.  More than 800 people were killed — often hacked to death with machetes during the night — around the town between 2014 and 2016. Congolese authorities say the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist rebel group, were behind the killings, but Congolese army officers have also been accused of involvement. More than 532,000 people fled their homes in just two territories along the border with Uganda in 2016 and 2017. Last week the United Nations warned that a military offensive launched there in January by Congolese troops to root out the ADF is likely to displace nearly 370,000 more people. “Just outside of town, just here in Beni, there were several massacres in recent days,” said Egeland, who served as the United Nations’ top humanitarian official in 2003-2006. “These clashes go on endlessly. The civilian population comes in the crossfire.” Much of eastern Congo has remained a volatile patchwork of rebel and militia fiefdoms despite the ending of a civil war in 2003 that had killed millions, most from hunger and disease. Now, despite the presence of the world’s largest U.N. peacekeeping force, many fear the political crisis sparked by delayed elections is pushing it back to the brink of war. “Of course the United Nations operation also has to be more effective in providing protection because over these last 15 years it’s not really gotten better. The last two years it has actually gotten much, much worse,” he said.

2018-02-14,"(Adds forecasts for coal, copper, zinc and bitumen output, CEO comment on outlook, stock price) By Susan Taylor TORONTO, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Teck Resources Ltd, the world’s second-biggest exporter of steelmaking coal, said on Wednesday that growing global steel production is expected to boost demand for its coal in 2018, though coal trade competition will also likely rise. Vancouver-based Teck, which also mines copper, zinc, gold and oil sands, said it is “feeling pretty good about 2018” after reporting in-line financial results. “Most of us forget what this feels like, but it’s certainly very good for commodity markets, and they are now demand driven, rather than supply driven,” Chief Executive Don Lindsay said on a conference call. “We see continued strength in commodity prices and Teck is certainly well positioned to take advantage of that.” Steelmaking coal demand is expected to keep climbing in 2018, Teck said, while ongoing logistics and production issues at key Australian mines support prices. It is unclear how an expected recovery in Australian exports this year and coal trade rebalancing will affect pricing, but Teck said it can respond to changing markets. Teck sold 6.4 million tonnes of steelmaking coal in the fourth quarter, at an average realized price of $170 per tonne. It sees 2018 output of 26 million to 27 million tonnes of steelmaking coal. Production in 2019 to 2022 will range between 26.5 million and 27.5 million tonnes, despite this year’s closure of Coal Mountain operations. Copper production is forecast at 270,000 to 330,000 tonnes in 2018 and 270,000 to 300,000 tonnes for 2019 to 2022. Zinc production is seen at 645,000 to 670,000 tonnes in 2018, dropping to between 575,000 and 625,000 tonnes in 2019 to 2022. Teck expects its share of production from Fort Hills oils sands mine at 7.5 million to 9 million barrels of bitumen in 2018 and 14 million barrels in 2019 to 2022. It holds a 20.89 percent stake in Fort Hills, which produced its first oil in January, with partners Suncor Energy and Total SA. Production is seen reaching at least 90 percent of capacity by year-end. Lindsay said he hopes Teck will build up cash reserves from high commodity prices and see copper supplies tighten before moving ahead with its US$4.7 billion second-phase Quebrada Blanca project. Permits are expected in the first half of 2018 and a decision in the second half. Shares of Teck, up nearly 15 percent year-to-date, were about 1 percent higher at C$37.72 at mid-session.

2018-02-14,"AMSTERDAM, Feb 14 (Reuters) - An offshore seaweed farm in the North Sea will be turned into a large solar power farm that aims to pipe energy to the Dutch mainland in roughly three years. The project comes at a critical time for the Netherlands, which is struggling to curb fossil fuel use and meet greenhouse gas emission targets after years of underinvestment in renewable energy sources. After an initial pilot next year, a consortium comprising energy producers, scientists and researchers plans to ultimately operate 2,500 square metres of floating solar panels by 2021, said Allard van Hoeken, founder of Oceans of Energy, which devised the project. The pilot, which will have 1.2 million euros ($1.48 million) in government funding, will operate 30 square meters of panels from this summer. It will test equipment, weather conditions, environmental impact and energy output. Utrecht University will examine energy production at the offshore prototype, located around 15 kilometres (nine miles) off the coast of Dutch city of The Hague at a testing zone known as the North Sea Farm. “In addition to removing the problem of a land shortage, there are several other benefits to building at sea, similar to those in wind energy,” said solar energy expert Wilfried van Sark at Utrecht University, who is involved in the project. “There is more sun at sea and there is the added benefit of a cooling system for the panels, which boosts output by up to 15 percent,” he said. If successful, there is plenty of space to expand the farm, unlike on the overcrowded Dutch mainland where there has been public opposition to wind turbines. The panels will be more rugged than ordinary onshore models to account for the harsher weather conditions and tidal shifts at sea, Van Sark said. The panels will be moored between existing wind turbines and connected to the same cables, transporting energy efficiently to end users. Van Hoeken said he expects offshore solar energy to eventually be cheaper than offshore wind and mainland power sources, due mainly to a lack of land costs.

2018-02-14,"(Adds details, background) AMSTERDAM, Feb 14 (Reuters) - German energy company EWE plans to sharply reduce its use of gas from the Groningen field in the Netherlands, as the Dutch government seeks ways to drastically cut production at the earthquake-prone field. EWE expects to cut its demand for Groningen gas by 1.7 billion cubic metres (bcm) annually by the end of next year, a 75 percent reduction, the Netherlands’ Economic Affairs Ministry said on Wednesday. EWE, which imports gas from Groningen to Germany, plans to convert higher calorific gas from other Dutch fields to the low-calorific gas its infrastructure is built for. The Dutch government said earlier this month it would cut production in Groningen by 44 percent, to 12 bcm annually, “as quickly as possible” to limit seismic risks in the region. To meet this target, the government has urged large industrial users and energy companies in the Netherlands to stop using Groningen gas by 2022, while talks were opened with foreign buyers to see if they can reduce their dependence on the low-calorific gas. Economic Affairs minister Eric Wiebes called EWE’s plan “a big step”, as he seeks to present a list of possibilities to lower gas production by the end of next month. Earthquakes related to the decades of gas production remain a constant factor in Groningen, where three relatively small tremors were reported in the last week. These prompted gas sector regulator SodM on Wednesday to demand a new report on possible measures to increase safety from production company NAM. This report, however, is not expected to bring new insights after the measures announced earlier this month.

2018-02-14,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2svKweE By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - “The lexicon of exit is not found in our vocabulary”, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Cairo on Monday. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been anxious to counter speculation about an early end to production curbs. Barkindo was reinforcing the message that the current curbs will be maintained until at least the end of this year and could be continued into 2019 (“Barkindo stresses ongoing cooperation, not exit”, Argus, Feb. 12). OPEC will review progress towards its goal of eliminating excess global inventories at its next regular meeting in June, but ministers have downplayed suggestions the review could lead to an early exit from the accord. The Declaration of Cooperation signed in December 2016 between OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and selected non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, has become fundamental to OPEC’s strategy for managing the oil market. Both sides appear satisfied with the results achieved so far and keen to extend their cooperation in the medium term. Global oil inventories have been cut to just over 100 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million at the start of 2017. Benchmark Brent prices have risen by around $20 per barrel, or almost 50 percent, since the production cuts were announced, and futures prices have swung from contango into backwardation. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak are “apostles to the value of cooperation”, Barkindo told a separate conference in Riyadh on Wednesday. “They have proven to be the key strong pillars on which the historic OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation has been built” (“Introductory remarks by secretary-general”, OPEC, Feb. 14). The agreement between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers is therefore likely to be extended and evolve rather than terminated. In that sense, Barkindo is correct to note exit is not on the agenda. The critical question is how and when the agreement is modified not whether it is ended completely. The most likely outcome is that the agreement is eventually adjusted to include a new set of higher production limits while maintaining the framework of regular meetings between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But with Saudi Arabia and Russia among the only signatories that have the capacity to boost output and benefit from higher production limits, securing a broad agreement is likely to prove tricky. Production restraint has been far more successful in drawing down excess global oil stocks than most analysts expected or indeed OPEC itself originally expected (“Egypt petroleum show”, OPEC, Feb. 12). Crude oil stocks remain around 100 million barrels above the five-year average, but if they were pushed down to that level the oil market would almost certainly feel very tight, given the growth in consumption since 2013. Stocks of refined products are already close to the five-year average, and in some cases below it, which has left many fuel markets feeling under-supplied. While OPEC insists stocks need to fall further, by most indicators the oil market has already rebalanced and is now firmly in the tightening phase of the cycle (tmsnrt.rs/2svKweE). If OPEC and its allies maintain their production curbs too long, oil prices will rise and spur an even more drilling and production from U.S. shale producers. The most recent forecasts for production and consumption show U.S. shale producers and other non-OPEC suppliers will essentially capture all the forecast demand growth in 2018. If OPEC and its allies maintain their production curbs, they may secure higher prices, but only at the expense of losing more market share. The dilemma of whether to prioritise the price defence or protect market share is familiar. OPEC has regularly alternated between price defence and market share protection for 40 years. Before June 2014, the organisation was focused on protecting prices above $100 per barrel, even at the expense of losing market share to U.S. shale producers. Between June 2014 and June 2016, the priority shifted towards recapturing market share, at the expense of a wrenching slump in prices. Since December 2016, the focus has been on cutting excess oil stocks and pushing up prices, even though it has cost some market share, especially in Asia. The strategy of cutting stocks and boosting prices has been successful, but the costs associated with it are starting to rise as U.S. shale producers capture more and more of global demand growth. At some point, OPEC and its allies will be forced to shift their focus back towards boosting output and stemming the erosion of their market share. The only question is when. OPEC and its allies will probably adjust the declaration at some point to include higher production limits with the aim of defending their market share without triggering a steep fall in prices. The challenge is to get the timing and the scale of the output increase right so the extra supply is absorbing by growing consumption. But experience suggests OPEC will leave the adjustment too late, tighten the market too much and send prices surging. The organisation will then increase supply at the moment when non-OPEC supply is accelerating and demand growth is already slowing. OPEC allowed the market to tighten too much after both the two previous slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09 with the result that prices overshot its initial targets. Something similar is likely in 2018/19. The other challenge for OPEC is managing market expectations. Hedge funds and other money managers have built a record bullish position in crude in the expectation that OPEC and its allies will continue to restrain output and continue to tighten the market well into 2018. Position-building by fund managers has helped accelerate the accentuate the rise in oil prices and provided an early harvest for OPEC and its allies. Any sign that producers are preparing to increase their output could trigger a rush to exit from some of those bullish positions and a sharp fall in prices. TRICKY RE-NEGOTIATION Most OPEC members would prefer to tighten the oil market too much and benefit from a short-term revenue windfall rather than risk not tightening it enough and a renewed fall in prices. Saudi Arabia, the organisation’s de facto leader and the real swing producer, needs relatively high prices to balance the government budget and pay for ambitious social and economic modernisation programmes. The kingdom also needs high prices to help secure a favourable valuation in the forthcoming sale of sale of shares in its national oil company Aramco. Most other OPEC members also need higher prices to cut their budget deficits and maintain internal social stability. Among the non-OPEC signatories to the Declaration of Cooperation, Russia has expressed some reservations about the need to protect market share, but has so far agreed to continue with a price-defence strategy. Ultimately, most OPEC and non-OPEC members are aware of the dangers of pushing prices too high but negotiating revised production limits will prove tricky. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia are probably the only signatories with the capacity to boost their output significantly in the short term. Other OPEC and non-OPEC members have little to gain from higher production limits and would prefer higher prices instead. Saudi Arabia and Russia have the ability to raise production unilaterally, or in agreement with each other, but will probably want to maintain the broader framework of cooperation painstakingly built since 2016. Since negotiating an upward revision of production limits could prove contentious, it is easier for OPEC and non-OPEC producers to continue with the existing agreement for as long as possible.

2018-02-14,"LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s En+ Group (ENPLq.L) has invited international banks to pitch for the sale of $1 billion(721.60 million pounds) of shares in the company that manages the aluminum and hydropower businesses of Russian businessmen Oleg Deripaska, three sources said. The inclusion of Deripaska on a U.S. list of Russian oligarchs published on Jan. 29, however, is making some U.S. banks who worked with En+ on its initial public offering (IPO) in November wary about participating this time, one of the sources said. The source, whose institution has been asked to pitch for the new business, said while there was no suggestion advising on the share sale would attract U.S. fines, compliance departments were concerned about any risk of reputational damage. “Banks don’t want headlines. Client selection is a massive issue,” said the banking source. The U.S. Treasury has said the report, which also includes lists of senior political figures and the heads of state-run companies, was not a sanctions list.     A spokesman for En+ (ENPLDR.MM) declined to comment on the planned share sale or whether U.S. banks might be reluctant to work with the company because of the U.S. list. A spokeswoman for Deripaska said: “We do not comment on market rumors.” Deripaska and family members own 76.6 percent of En+, which has assets in metals and energy, including a 48 percent controlling stake in Hong Kong-listed Russian aluminum producer Rusal (0486.HK). When En+ listed in London, U.S. institutions Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Citi (C.N) and JP Morgan (JPM.N), along with Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) and Russian banks Sberbank (SBER.MM) and VTB Capital (VTBR.MM) led the float. The $1.5 billion IPO was the first major listing in London by a Russian company since 2014, when Russia’s annexation of the Crimea peninsula triggered Western sanctions against Moscow.  Since the IPO, Deripaska and another 95 Russians worth more than $1 billion were named in a report the U.S. Treasury Department was required by Congress to compile as part of the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA). “The inclusion of individuals or entities in this report, its appendices, or its classified annex does not, in and of itself, imply, give rise to, or create any restrictions, prohibitions, or limitations on dealings with such persons by either U.S. or foreign persons,” the U.S. Treasury said on its website. However, several businessmen on the list said Russian companies may start having problems in their dealings with international banks because of the report. Deripaska was ranked by Forbes magazine on Wednesday as Russia’s 20th richest man, with a net worth of $6.7 billion.     The industrial assets that form the core of his wealth were acquired during the chaotic sell-off of Russian state assets in the 1990s, following the collapse of the Soviet Union. Along with En+, Deripaska also controls Russian light vehicle maker GAZ (GAZA.MM) and has agriculture, airport and other businesses. One of the sources said the planned share sale by En+ was expected to happen after Russia’s presidential election in March, which incumbent Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win. It was not immediately clear why En+ wanted to sell shares or whether the offering would be of new or existing shares. Before the November listing of shares in London and Moscow, the company’s net debt was $13.1 billion. It reduced that by repaying a $943 million loan to VTB, Russia’s second-largest lender, following the listing.

2018-02-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Penguins, Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) latest oil and gas development in a remote corner of the British North Sea, epitomises the new doctrine for deepwater projects — keep it cheap and simple.     Shunned during the oil price crash of 2014-2016, deepwater projects are being embraced again, a challenge to the surge in onshore U.S. shale output. Penguins, the first new major deepwater project this year, will rejuvenate the 44-year-old field by drilling 8 new wells 165 metres (541 feet) underwater and connecting them to a new production vessel.  Due for completion in 2021 at a cost of around $1 billion, Penguins will cost a fraction of the average of giant developments earlier this decade, producing a modest 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. “It is another example of how we are unlocking development opportunities, with lower costs,” Andy Brown, head of Shell’s oil and gas production division, said. Like Shell, companies such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA) and BP (BP.L) have in recent years radically changed the way they design offshore fields - deploying steel platforms out at sea - to make them simpler and faster to build, and able to challenge the economics of shale fields such as the Permian basin in Texas. As executives gain confidence that their companies can make a profit with oil at around $50 a barrel - less than half the level of the early 2010s - boards are set to approve more projects. Oil currently trades at around $60 a barrel. Analysts at Bernstein expect around 40 new offshore projects to be approved in 2018, compared with 29 last year and 14 in 2016, when project numbers fell to the lowest since at least 1990.  Companies including Exxon, Shell and BP have set a rigid cost ceiling for new projects, requiring them to be profitable with oil at $40 a barrel in order to withstand an uncertain outlook clouded by the rise of electric vehicles.  As a result, most new projects are set to be significantly smaller than the traditional field size, averaging 42,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 69,000 last year, according to Bernstein. “You will see more deepwater over time, for sure,” Bernard Looney, head of BP’s oil and gas production division, told Reuters in January. BP is expected to approve a number of projects this year, he added, including in Senegal, Mauritania, Oman and Azerbaijan. Leaner projects can be achieved by drilling simpler wells and connecting them to existing platforms and pipelines, in what is known as infill drilling, or by swapping bespoke gear for off-the-shelf equipment and by processing vast amounts of data to streamline oil field construction.  A sharp drop in rig and services costs, by as much as 80 percent in some cases over the past three years, has further helped reduce the cost of projects. “Much is made of the Permian, its flexibility and the returns there. But actually infill drilling for a decade creates enormous sources of money,” Looney said. OFFSHORE OIL PROJECTS - reut.rs/2BpKCYe There are exceptions to the rule. Some fields are so vast that they require massive investment, while remaining profitable at low oil prices. Among the largest projects expected to be approved this year are Petrobras’s (PETR4.SA) Libra II in Brazil, at an expected cost of $10 billion, Shell’s Bonga Southwest in Nigeria at $12.2 billion and Exxon’s Mamba liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique at $30 billion, according to analysts at Jefferies.  For all the buzz around shale production, it accounts for around 7 percent of the world’s crude supply of around 98 million barrels per day while offshore production accounts for over one quarter. The scale of the highly complex projects - one platform can produce 150,000 bpd in some cases - helped tap new resources in recent decades to meet surging global demand for energy.  But some deepwater projects were plagued by huge cost over-runs and delays - one of the most famous examples being the giant Kazakh field Kashagan, later dubbed “cash-all-gone” as costs ballooned from $10 billion to $60 billion. But after years of spending cuts, companies urgently need to develop new resources to offset the natural decline of fields, which can reach 10 percent per year. “When you look at the mix you need offshore, you need deepwater. The onshore by itself won’t be enough to make up for the decline rates that you are seeing globally,” Lorenzo Simonelli, Chief Executive Officer of energy services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), told Reuters.     Exxon, the world’s top publicly traded oil company, last year gave the go-ahead for the development of the Liza field in Guyana. The project is expected to generate double-digit returns with oil at $40, the company said. Oil majors have made a number of major discoveries in recent months - Exxon in Guyana, BP in the North Sea, Shell in the Gulf of Mexico, Eni and Total offshore Cyprus - and their development will hinge on keeping costs low. “Discipline has to stay, we’re very determined in this space. We’re not going to say that now that the oil prices are back up, let’s do more, let’s spend more,” BP’s Looney said.

2018-02-14,"* Falih says OPEC needs to adjust metrics targeted by cuts * Saudi says to keep exports below 7 million bpd in March * Saudi king, Russia’s Novak discuss oil-market rebalancing * OPEC’s Barkindo says 2018 oil demand growth to be healthy (Updates after end of Falih/Novak news conference) By Rania El Gamal RIYADH, Feb 14 (Reuters) - OPEC would do better to leave the oil market slightly short of supplies rather than ending too early a deal on cutting output, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday. Oil prices have slid nearly 15 percent in the past three weeks, together with a broader decline in the stock market, due to fears about global inflation and rising U.S. oil production. The decline comes at a bad time for Saudi Arabia, which needs high and stable oil prices if it is to succeed in turning the planned share listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco this year into the world’s biggest share sale. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,” Falih said after meeting Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Riyadh. Novak and other Russian officials also met Saudi King Salman in the Saudi capital on Wednesday. “Rather than quitting too early and finding out we were dealing with less reliable information ... Stay the course and make sure that inventories are where the industry needs them,” Falih said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is de-facto leader, has agreed to extend oil supply cuts with Russia and other producers until the end of 2018. Moscow, however, has signalled a gradual exit might be needed from the second half of this year. Falih has insisted the cuts will continue throughout 2018 and, to avoid shocking the market, any exit after that would be very gradual. On Wednesday, Falih said OPEC and its allies would need to consider in coming months how to adjust targets, including how to measure the five-year average of oil stockpiles. OPEC has made the five-year average its main target and managed to reduce the glut to 100 million barrels above that benchmark, from 300 million when the cuts began in 2017. Falih said OPEC should take into account non-OECD inventories, floating storage and oil in transit. At present, targets are based on stockpiles in industrialised OECD nations. “It is way too premature to discuss an exit strategy ... Do we need to adjust for rising demand and look at forward day cover? How do we deal with non-OECD inventory? (It’s) less transparent and reliable,” Falih said. “We have to think of the global market, the centre of demand has shifted from OECD to non-OECD.” “We will discuss it in April and June ... I think we are going to be sticking with our policy throughout 2018 and that is necessary to balance markets”. As Novak and Falih met in Riyadh, the Saudi Energy Ministry said it would restrain oil exports in March despite lower domestic need for crude. The kingdom will keep its crude exports below 7 million barrels per day (bpd) next month, despite a maintenance shutdown of the 400,000-bpd SAMREF refinery, the ministry said, confirming a plan given by industry sources. “Saudi Arabia remains focused on working down excess oil inventories,” a ministry spokesman said in a statement. “Market volatility is a common concern for producers and consumers, and the kingdom is committed to mitigating this volatility and moderating its negative impacts by responsibly meeting its pledges” under the OPEC-led supply deal. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, who was also in Riyadh, said oil demand would grow this year at healthy levels and that data pointed to continued high compliance by producers in January with their pledges under the supply deal. OPEC has delivered more than 100 percent of the output cuts that members pledged under the deal, according to figures from OPEC and other analysts, helped in part by an involuntary drop in Venezuela, where output is falling amid an economic crisis. The Saudi ministry also said production by Aramco in March would be 100,000 bpd below February’s level, suggesting Saudi Arabia will continue to pump less than its OPEC target.

2018-02-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said on Wednesday it is establishing an office to protect the nation’s power grid and other infrastructure against cyber attacks and natural disasters. President Donald Trump’s budget proposal unveiled this week  included $96 million in funding for the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the DOE “plays a vital role in protecting our nation’s energy infrastructure from cyber threats, physical attack and natural disaster, and as secretary, I have no higher priority.” Last July, the DOE helped U.S. firms defend against a hacking campaign that targeted power companies including at least one nuclear plant. The agency said that the attacks did not have an impact on electricity generation or the grid, and that any impact appeared to be limited to administrative and business networks. The previous month, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had issued an alert to industrial companies, warning that for months hackers had targeted nuclear reactors and other power industry infrastructure, using tainted emails to harvest credentials and gain access to networks. In some cases hackers succeeded in compromising the networks of their targets, but the report did not identify specific victims. Nuclear power experts, such as Dave Lochbaum at the Union of Concerned Scientists nonprofit group, have said reactors have a certain amount of immunity from cyber attacks because their operation systems are separate from digital business networks. But over time it would not be impossible for hackers to potentially do harm, he said.

2018-02-14,"BERLIN (Reuters) - With inflation paramount in investors’ minds at a time of rising wages and oil prices, the line separating winners and losers in the global airline industry this year looks likely to be drawn on how well they manage costs, especially on the labor side. Industry body IATA in December flagged higher spending on labor and fuel - which make up about half of airlines’ operating expenses - as their members’ biggest challenge in 2018, especially after several years of record profits. Labor costs surpassed fuel as global airlines’ biggest single expense in 2016, at 22 percent of costs against just under 21 percent for fuel. That is expected to jump this year to 30.9 percent versus 20.5 percent for fuel. Back in 2013, when oil prices were much higher than now, fuel was 33 percent of expenses against 18 percent for labor. Staff costs are typically higher in North America and Europe than in Asia, where fuel remains the biggest expense.      The crux of the issue is that amid signs of a global shortage of workers generally, in some regions there’s also a scarcity of qualified pilots at a time of expanding fleets. “As airlines have been making profit, the workforce has got market power, so that is pushing up the cost of labor,” IATA Chief Economist Brian Pearce said in an interview.  Overall, unit costs - the measure of how much it costs an airline to operate each kilometer and seat flown - will rise 4.3 percent this year versus 1.7 percent in 2017, IATA forecasts. In the highest profile example of the pressures, budget carrier Ryanair (RYA.I) was compelled last year by pilot shortages to cancel thousands of flights, and in December recognized trade unions for the first time. The battle that forced Ryanair’s hand could put wage pressures on other European budget carriers such as Wizz (WIZZ.L), industry experts say.  The bigger carriers feel it too. At Air France (AIRF.PA), 10 unions representing pilots, cabin and ground staff have called for a strike on Feb. 22 to push a demand for a 6 percent pay rise. “After three years of strong profitability improvements in the sector, we believe personnel and suppliers are asking for wage/price increases and thus keeping non-fuel costs under control will remain a challenge for the sector,” Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Ruxandra Haradau-Doser wrote. The wage issue has even extended to the United Arab Emirates, the Middle East trade and financial hub where labor disputes are rare and unions and industrial action are banned. The region’s largest airline, Dubai-based Emirates, is facing calls from cabin crew to improve conditions and benefits. Employees say management is considering their requests. Last week, brokerage Kepler Cheuvreux cut its rating on German flagship carrier Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) - already on its lists of stocks to avoid and least preferred in the sector - to “reduce” from “hold”. In the United States, investors are worried that the three largest carriers - American (AAL.O), Delta (DAL.N) and United UAL.N - are heading for a price war just as higher costs from pay increases agreed last year start to bite. Lufthansa, British Airways parent IAG (ICAG.L) and Air France-KLM are all expected to report improved 2017 profits when they publish results over the next few weeks. All airlines will need to look at areas where they can save, however. “The most successful airline managements are the ones that have been very cost-focused every day - not just on staff costs but on aircraft costs, airport charges, distribution costs and so on,” said aviation consultant John Strickland. The success of Ryanair, which boasts of having the lowest costs in Europe, is partly down to hard negotiating with manufacturers and airports to get good deals on orders and fees, those in the industry say.  Strickland said that while pilot costs would rise, Ryanair was unique in having much lower overall costs than rivals. “If they can continue to keep other items such as airport and aircraft costs down, then they will still be in a very strong position.”   Lufthansa has been taking a tougher stance lately both with staff and airports. Unlike in previous negotiations for its main brand in Germany, Lufthansa stayed firm during a series of pilot strikes from 2014 to 2016 and has now struck a deal to cut its cockpit staff costs by 15 percent, while an increase in ground staff’s wages will be partly linked to company profits. Last year, it also put pressure on Frankfurt Airport operator Fraport (FRAG.DE) by moving planes to Munich. It predicts unit costs will fall by 1-2 percent this year. Analysts at Barclays say while such measures should help Lufthansa, the rate of improvement is not sustainable and progress still needs to be made at budget unit Eurowings, which earns less than half the margin of its nearest peer. “There is a significant amount more work for the company to do on its cost base,” they wrote in a note.  Along with strong travel demand thanks to robust economies and low oil prices last year, European airlines have also benefited from some consolidation following the insolvencies of Air Berlin and Monarch, which helped lead to higher ticket prices. In addition, many European carriers hedged on jet fuel - unlike their U.S. counterparts who got burned making the wrong bets when the oil price starting tumbling in mid-2014 - meaning the impact of higher fuel prices will come through for European airlines later than U.S. ones.  EasyJet’s EZY.L revenue per seat rose 6.6 percent at constant currencies in the quarter to end-December, the no-frills airline said, citing the struggles of rivals including Air Berlin, Monarch, Ryanair and Alitalia. It forecast a rise of 5-9 percent for the six months to March. “Airlines need to be careful they don’t lock themselves into cost structures that are too high for weaker economic conditions,” IATA’S Pearce warned. “At the moment, they’re not doing that but it’s always a risk.”  Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Sonya Hepinstall",https://uk.reuters.com/article/airlines-wages-inflation/analysis-higher-wages-fuel-prices-turn-up-cost-pressure-on-airlines-idUKL8N1PZ4G0,14 Feb 2018,"* Labour costs biggest expense for airline industry this

Full-year net profit in 2017 rose 9.5 percent, short of analyst estimates, as the group was hit by one-time costs including paying Goldman Sachs to defend against activist shareholder White Tale, as well as for environmental cleanup. The activists sold their 25 percent stake to SABIC in January, two months after scuttling Clariant’s bid to merge with U.S.-based Huntsman. Kottmann wants the next five months to discuss with SABIC chief Yousef Al-Benyan how their arrangement will work, including governance issues and board representation. While stopping short of labelling SABIC a white knight, the Clariant boss was clearly pleased with White Tale’s departure. “It depends on the definition of a ‘white knight.’ I consider SABIC as a strategic anchor shareholder which will allow Clariant to continue in its current structure,” he said. Kottmann said he expected an eventual accord with SABIC to include restrictions on any move by the world’s fourth-biggest chemicals group to take control of Clariant. “My colleague Yousef Al-Benyan is a very reliable and credible internationally experienced executive. He has clearly stated several times there is no interest in SABIC taking Clariant over,” Kottmann told a news conference. “This will be, let’s assume it, part of the contract.” He added SABIC was awaiting anti-trust clearance in around 10 jurisdictions for its Clariant stake. The strategy update is set to be released after “late June or early July”, he said. Clariant stock slipped 2.8 percent by 1400 GMT, extending a fall of about 15 percent since late January, when SABIC said it was becoming Clariant’s largest shareholder. Analysts say the decline reflected disappointment that SABIC would not seek to buy Clariant outright, although some still say the Saudi company, 70 percent owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, will not be content with just a quarter share. “Clariant’s stock took a hit after White Tale sold,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz. “The market’s view is that SABIC is not going to do much with its stake, while we believe the opposite, at least in the mid-term, is true.” Clariant’s 2017 sales rose to 6.38 billion Swiss francs ($6.8 billion), in line with the average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts. But its net profit after minority interests rose only 9.5 percent to 277 million francs, compared with an average estimate of 332 million. In addition to a roughly 45 million franc hit linked to U.S. tax changes, Clariant had 180 million francs in one-time costs, compared with just 107 million in 2016, as it turned to Goldman to help defend itself against White Tale. The activist, led by New York City real estate heir David Winter and hedge fund investor Keith Meister, wanted three board seats and a strategic review by investment bankers as a possible precursor to a split-up of Clariant. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said the failed merger with Huntsman and the White Tale defence cost more than 50 million francs, on top of 30-40 million francs in provisions for environmental clean-up of sites in France and Latin America. Clariant said it would raise its dividend 11 percent to 0.50 francs, matching the poll forecast. It stuck to its mid-term target of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation before exceptional items of 16 to 19 percent of sales. For 2017, its adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3 percent, up from 15.2 percent in 2016. $1 = 0.9322 Swiss francs

2018-02-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - French grid operator RTE would be keen to play a part in European Union power grid consolidation and in favour of changing its legal status in order to achieve that, its chief executive said on Wednesday.  The largest grid operator in Europe, RTE is majority owned by French state-controlled utility EDF (EDF.PA), but it remains a purely national player in an industry where more and more grid operators have stakes in foreign grids.  “RTE is not meant to be merely an observer in the consolidation of the European power grid industry,” RTE Chief Executive Francois Brottes told reporters.     Most European power grids were split off from the utilities that owned them more than a decade ago in a process called unbundling that was supposed to give all power producers equal access to the networks. But RTE remains one of a few so-called “Independent Transmission Operators” (ITOs) still owned by vertically integrated utilities.  There are just eight ITOs among Europe’s 43 grid operators and these ITOs are not allowed to buy stakes in unbundled independent power grid operators. But Brottes said he would be in favour of changing RTE’s ITO status to be able to take part in any EU-wide power grid consolidation.  “I personally think we should get out of it,” he said.  Brottes, who met energy sector reporters, said that he agreed that not much could happen in terms of major grid operator consolidation in Europe as long as a key player like RTE remains an ITO.  “We can only court other ITOs, we cannot try to seduce other companies,” he said.  Brottes said the European grid industry is consolidating right now and that therefore RTE needs to reconsider its business model.  In 2016, RTE had prepared a bid for Greek grid operator ADMIE, one of the few other European grid operators with the ITO status, but it was outbid by the State Grid Corporation of China of China Corporation (SGCC), which paid 320 million euros for a 24 percent stake. SGCC also bought stakes in grid operators in Portugal and Italy in recent years.  “The Chinese are already in Portugal and Italy, and in Germany they are negotiating now. ... The Chinese want to buy everything that is for sale,” Brottes said.  Brottes said its status as a regulated company charging state-set tariffs also made it harder to bid for foreign peers.  “We are not an investment fund, we cannot put a bag of dollars on the table, our regulator would challenge that,” he said.

2018-02-14,"BAMBOLIM, India (Reuters) - Indian resources conglomerate Adani Enterprises Ltd (ADEL.NS) is looking to buy mines in countries such as Indonesia, a company executive told Reuters on Wednesday, despite its struggles to develop a controversial coal project in Australia. The company already owns a coal mine in Indonesia, but has been unable to secure financing for the long-delayed Carmichael mine in Australia amid numerous court challenges from environmental groups concerned about climate change and potential damage to the Great Barrier Reef. “We have a mine in Indonesia, and we are looking for more options there,” Rajendra Singh, chief operating officer of Adani’s coal trading business, said on the sidelines of the  Coaltrans India conference in the coastal town of Bambolim in Goa state. “We’re also keeping our eyes open for options in other areas like south African countries, countries like Russia. We are not eying for specific grades, we are looking for viable options. We mainly look at reserves, production costs and logistics.” He said there was “opportunity in the U.S.” as well given that India imports coal from there. Singh, however, did not say if any deal was in the works. Adani is also India’s biggest trader of coal, with volumes of 81 million tonnes in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, 2017, sourced mainly from Indonesia and Africa. India, the world’s second biggest coal importer after China, brought in a total of 190 million tonnes last fiscal year. Singh said the company’s market share in coal trading in the country was going to increase after it extended to retail markets, especially brick kilns and sponge irons. The company has also recently started trading coal in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, in addition to its operations in Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam and China, he said. “Asian countries are going to add a lot of demand in the coal market, especially South Asian countries like Bangladesh and Pakistan,” Singh said. “On the supply side, there are limitations. Tonnages are increasing, but quality is decreasing. And to compensate for quality, they have to increase tonnages.” Pakistan imported 11.2 million tonnes of coal last year, up from around 3.4 million tonnes bought in 2013. Its purchases are expected to jump to 40 million tonnes by 2025. Populous and power-starved Bangladesh is also ramping up coal imports to light up new homes in an election year.

2018-02-14,"LONDON/YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - The Court of Appeal in London ruled on Wednesday that two Nigerian communities cannot pursue Royal Dutch Shell in English courts over oil spills in Nigeria’s Delta region. The split decision upheld a High Court ruling last year that was a setback to attempts to hold British multinationals liable at home for their subsidiaries’ actions abroad. The court rejected the appeal from law firm Leigh Day on behalf of Nigeria’s Bille and Ogale communities, and upheld a ruling that English courts do not have jurisdiction over claims against Shell’s Nigerian subsidiary Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC).  SPDC is jointly operated with the Nigerian government. Shell said the court “rightly upheld” the earlier ruling, and said Nigeria’s “well-developed justice system” was the correct place for the claims. Its subsidiary SPDC has also denied responsibility for the spills, which it says were due to sabotage and illegal refining. One of the three senior High Court judges, the Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Sales, disagreed with the majority ruling, writing that the communities have “a good arguable claim that (Shell) assumed a material degree of responsibility in relation to the management of the pipeline and facilities” operated by SPDC.  Leigh Day said the two Nigerian communities intended to bring the case to Britain’s Supreme Court.  “We are hopeful that the Supreme Court will grant permission to appeal and will come to a different view,” Leigh Day partner Daniel Leader said.     King Okpabi, the ruler of the Ogale community, said the English courts were the only hope, and that they “cannot get justice” in Nigeria.  The case is significant in determining whether multinational companies can face legal action in England over their subsidiaries’ actions abroad.  Last year, an appeals court upheld a ruling that a case brought by Zambian villagers against mining company Vedanta Resources over environmental pollution could be heard in England. Vedanta said it would seek the right to appeal to the Supreme Court.

In the past, Gazprom and Germany’s E.ON, from which Uniper was divested as a separate legal entity two years ago, had a history of arbitration proceedings over gas prices. “The application for an arbitration in order to resolve a contractual dispute is a standard practice foreseen in such contracts,” a Gazprom spokesman said, adding that Gazprom wants the contract revision for gas prices starting from Feb. 1. Uniper said it was studying the matter, without elaborating. Uniper is Gazprom’s key partner in Germany, the biggest consumer of Russian gas. Gazprom has four contracts with the company until 2035.

2018-02-14,"NEW DELHI, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani will be seeking billions of dollars of Indian investment during a visit to New Delhi, diplomats said, a trip that comes amid U.S. pressure to review a 2015 international nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on Iran. India is trying to develop the port of Chabahar on Iran’s east coast as a way to gain access the markets of central Asia as well as Afghanistan by by-passing arch-rival Pakistan. But progress is slow because of concern that President Donald Trump’s administration may eventually scrap the Iran nuclear deal. Soon after the sanctions were lifted, India said its firms could spend as much as $20 billion on not just the port but also petrochemical plants, railway lines and other industries in the areas. But progress has only been made on the port. Iranian officials say the slowdown is largely because India has become hesitant following Trump’s attempts to undermine the Iran nuclear deal and that Rouhani would be urging India to make good on its commitments. “There are a number of projects for expansion of ties in the pipeline that not only will be in the interests of both nations but also in the interest of the region,” Iran’s ambassador to India, Gholamreza Ansari, said in a national day speech last week. Rouhani, who arrives in the southern city of Hyderabad on Thursday, where he will address a Muslim congregation, will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday. The two sides are expected to sign an agreement allowing India to run operations in the first phase of the Chabahar port project. The port is about 72 km from the Pakistani port of Gwadar, which China is developing. The plan is for India to equip and operate two berths in the port with a capital investment of $85.21 million on a 10-year lease. Modi has said the government could spend up to $500 million on the port, India’s first major overseas port venture, as it tries to offer alternatives to China’s One Belt One Road initiative to build trade and transport links across Asia. But the uncertainty over U.S. policies has cast a shadow over the project, officials say. India is struggling to get equipment such as cranes for the port because Western banks were not ready to facilitate transactions. “They don’t want to antagonise the U.S.,” said an Indian source involved in the port’s development but who is not authorised to speak to the media. “The banks’ American interests are more important ... the moment you mention that THE destination is Iran they don’t come forward.” Iran had hoped for swift reintegration into global trade after the easing of sanctions in 2016 but its failure to persuade Western banks to accept Iranian business has been the main roadblock to rehabilitation. Indian officials said the two sides were also trying to narrow differences over a giant gas field that an Indian consortium led by state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp discovered a decade ago. India wants to develop the Farzad B gas field but Iran says the terms it has offered are not profitable. A delegation from Iran’s Pars Oil and Gas Company is holding talks.

2018-02-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - As OPEC watches a near 15 percent drop in the oil price in three weeks, important indicators in the physical crude market are flashing signals that the decline might be far from over. The warnings come not from the heavily traded futures market, but from less transparent trading activity in crude oil and products markets, where key U.S., European and Russian crude prices have fallen of late, suggesting less robust demand. Benchmark oil futures have plunged in recent days together with global stock markets due to concerns over inflation as well as renewed fears that rapid output increases from the United States will flood the market with more crude this year. OPEC, including its Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo,  argues the decline is just a blip because demand is exceeding supply and that prices won’t plunge again to $30 per barrel as they did in 2015 and 2016. Traditionally, when oil futures decline, prices in the physical markets tend to rise because crude is becoming cheaper and hence more attractive to refiners. But in recent weeks, differentials in key European and U.S. markets such as North Sea Forties, Russia’s Urals, West Texas Intermediate in Midland, Texas, and the Atlantic diesel market have fallen to multi-month lows. The reasons tend to be different for most physical grades but overall the trend paints a bearish picture.  “Physical markets do not lie. If regional areas of oversupply cannot find pockets of demand, prices will decline,” said Michael Tran of RBC Capital Markets.   “Atlantic Basin crudes are the barometer for the health of the global oil market since the region is the first to reflect looser fundamentals. Struggling North Sea physical crudes like Brent, Forties and Ekofisk suggest that barrels are having difficulty finding buyers,” he added. This follows a run-up in U.S. production to 10.04 million barrels per day as of November, the highest since 1970. The increase pushed the United States into second place among crude producers, ahead of Saudi Arabia and trailing only Russia, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.  On Tuesday, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said increased U.S. supply could cause output to exceed demand globally in 2018. Forties crude differentials to dated Brent have fallen to minus 70 cents, from a premium of 75 cents at the start of the year as the Forties pipeline returned to normal operations. Forties differentials are now not far off their lowest since mid-2017, when the benchmark Brent crude price was around $45 per barrel, compared to $62 now and $71 a few weeks ago. In the United States, key grades traded in Texas and Louisiana have fallen to their lowest in several months.   A similar pattern can be observed in the Russian Urals market, one of the biggest by volume in Europe. At a discount of $2.15 to dated Brent, Urals’ differentials in the Mediterranean are now at their lowest since September 2016, when Brent futures were around $40-$45 per barrel. “Sour grades are not in good shape worldwide” and neither are Urals, said a European crude oil trader, who asked not to be identified as he is forbidden from speaking publicly.  That contrasts with the start of 2017, when OPEC cuts to predominantly sour grades made them attractive to buyers. “Supply is more than ample in Europe, Urals face strong competition from the Middle Eastern grades,” said another trader on the Russian crude oil market, adding that supplies of Urals to Asia were uneconomic due to a wide Brent-Dubai spread. Adding pressure on Urals, traders expect loadings of the grade to rise in the coming months due to seasonal maintenance at Russian refineries. A decline in physical crude values generally means better margins for refiners. But it is also not happening this time. The profit margin refiners make on processing crude into diesel collapsed in Europe and the United States by over 18 percent in the past week, according to Reuters data.  Europe, where nearly 50 percent of vehicles are fueled by diesel, is home to the global benchmark for diesel prices and the biggest storage hub for the road fuel as regional refineries are unable to meet local demand. “Oil demand isn’t that bad in general, but heating oil demand has been horrible, particularly in the United States and Germany,” Robert Campbell, head of global oil product markets at consultancy Energy Aspects, said.  “European refineries are running at very high rates since December so there is plenty of supply in the region while the weather has been warmer than usual, which led to weaker demand.” The refined product markets were expected to tighten significantly in March and April due to a busy schedule for seasonal refinery maintenance. [REF/E] But in a further indication of wavering confidence, the spread between the April low-sulfur gasoil futures to the May contract also crashed in recent weeks from an all-time high premium of $5 on Jan. 26 to a discount of 50 cents on Tuesday.

2018-02-14,"* US Jan CPI forecast at 1.9 pct, core at 1.7 pct * Dollar under pressure before inflation data * European stock markets open higher, US stock futures firm * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a 15-month low against the yen on Wednesday, while world stock markets found firmer ground ahead of U.S. inflation numbers that could soothe, or inflame, fears of faster interest-rate hikes globally. European stock markets were broadly higher thanks to strong earnings results and data confirmed the fastest euro zone economic growth for more than 10 years in 2017. Blue-chip indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt were up around 0.7 percent each, while higher U.S. stock futures  pointed to a positive start for Wall Street shares which climbed on Tuesday for a third straight day. The VIX stocks volatility index meanwhile dipped to a one-week low at 22.81, a sign that a degree of calm had returned to markets after last week’s ructions. Still, Asian shares were mixed and Japan’s benchmark Nikkei closed down 0.4 percent as the yen rose and with investor sentiment generally strained ahead of the U.S. January inflation report at 1330 GMT. That data has taken on particular significance after recent strong wage growth data prompted investors to ratchet up expectations for U.S. rate hikes this year and sparked a rout in world stock markets. “Markets have suddenly woken up to the fact that central banks are tightening rates and economists have been saying for a year now that inflation is being artificially suppressed by non-market forces,” said UBS global chief economist Paul Donovan. “As a result, today’s data has the potential to get investors really excited if it comes in higher than expected.” Headline consumer price inflation is forecast to slow to an annual 1.9 percent and core inflation to 1.7 percent, an outcome that could help calm nerves. Unease about the looming inflation data was perhaps greatest in currency markets, where the dollar slid to a 15-month low against the Japanese currency at around 106.82 yen. It recovered to 107.37 yen in London but was still down 0.4 percent on the day. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was steady at 89.74, having dipped to a one-week low. The euro was flat at around $1.2348. The dollar index has now given up two-thirds of the gains it notched up this month when investors rushed into the greenback as equity markets suffered a violent sell-off. “My read is the dollar has not benefited in line with previous corrections of this magnitude. The dollar move also reflects the fact this has not yet become a correction where markets and investors are worried about the macro backdrop,” said Kamakshya Trivedi co-head of global FX and EM strategy at Goldman Sachs. “(Today’s) CPI  will be key to see if the correction extends further or if we are near the end of it.” In Europe, strong economic data reinforced the brighter outlook for the world economy, supporting sentiment towards risk assets such as southern European bonds. Euro zone industrial production jumped more than expected in December, while the euro zone statistics office confirmed its a preliminary estimate of gross domestic product growth in the last three months of 2017 at 2.7 percent against the same period of 2016. Overall in 2017, euro zone GDP rose 2.5 percent, the fastest growth rate since 2007. That followed news earlier on Wednesday that Japan’s economy posted its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s boom as fourth quarter growth was boosted by consumer spending. The drop in the dollar meanwhile gave a fillip to commodities, with copper firm after jumping 2.7 percent overnight. Spot gold edged up 0.1 percent to $1,331.08 per ounce, leaving behind last week’s one-month low of $1,306.81. Oil prices dipped, squeezed by lingering oversupply including rising U.S. inventories and ample physical flows, though the prospect of Saudi output dropping in March, economic growth hopes and a weaker dollar all combined to cap losses. U.S. crude futures eased 0.7 percent to $58.79 a barrel, while Brent futures slipped 0.3 percent to $62.50. Elsewhere, South Africa’s rand rose to its strongest level against the dollar in about 2-1/2 years as investors awaited the latest twist in the saga surrounding the departure of President Jacob Zuma, who has been ordered by the ruling ANC to quit as head of state.

2018-02-14,"LOS ANGELES, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a climate-friendly investment policy written in the last days of the Obama administration, according to a Reuters review of government documents. The growing U.S. support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U.S. solar loans abroad. It also deepens confusion about President Donald Trump’s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil-fuel development. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the government’s international finance institution, loaned more than $630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017, 90 percent of which were solar, wind, or other low-carbon ventures, according to investment documents. That compares to $797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016, 61 percent of which went to clean energy. The agency’s lending to solar projects doubled to more than $250 million in 2017, supporting ventures in India, Africa and Latin America, according to the records. (For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time, see: tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H ) White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment. OPIC is a self-funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance “U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities” by investing in ventures abroad. For 40 years, it has operated at no net cost to U.S. tax payers. The agency formalized its preference for climate-friendly energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before Trump’s inauguration. The document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote low- and no-carbon fuels and technologies, efficiency and conservation. That dovetails with former President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration’s energy priorities. Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms; signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions; and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming. That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar - a leading climate-friendly competitor to fossil fuels - but the administration has never made that clear. Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy, which were preserved by a Republican-controlled Congress in December tax legislation. But Trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both “very, very expensive.” In January, Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports, saying the move would help domestic manufacturers. But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower-cost imported panels, often from China. OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama-enacted low-carbon policy and that its portfolio is “demand driven” – reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources. But policy “does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects,” she said, including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option. OPIC’s financing last year, for example, included $50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil. Last year, Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal “to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market” - but Congress rejected the idea. Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency. Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals: empowering women in the developing world, and serving U.S. strategic national security interests. Washburne was not available for an interview, Orr said. Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies, a solar array in Zambia backed by First Solar Inc and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp. Orb Energy, an Indian solar company backed by U.S. venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc, secured $10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects. Such funding would not be available from India’s conservative banking sector, the company said. “Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables, so we were concerned,” Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview. But he was told there was “no fundamental change” in its priorities for selecting projects, he said. Since 2011, more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar, wind or other non-hydroelectric forms of renewable power. That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers, but has not always gone well for OPIC: the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly $1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted. At issue is whether OPIC properly stress-tested the projects adequately before offering loans. The agency’s losses on the deals could exceed $160 million, sources told Reuters last year. OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades. AES – which received up to $89.5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017 - said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade. The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES, which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal. “That’s the angle that the company has taken,” AES Treasurer Daniel Stadelmann said in an interview, referring to the company’s shift toward cleaner energy sources. “So it matches.” Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and

Full-year net profit in 2017 rose 9.5 percent, short of analyst estimates, as the group was hit by one-time costs including paying Goldman Sachs to defend it against activist shareholder White Tale. The activists sold their 25 percent stake to SABIC in January, two months after scuttling Clariant’s bid to merge with U.S.-based Huntsman. Kottmann wants the next five months to discuss with SABIC chief Yousef Al-Benyan how their arrangement will work, including governance issues and eventual board representation. He said he expected an accord with SABIC to include restrictions on any move by the Saudi company, the world’s fourth-biggest chemicals group, to take control of Clariant. “My colleague Yousef Al-Benyan is a very reliable and credible internationally experienced executive. He has clearly stated several times there is no interest in SABIC taking Clariant over,” Kottmann told a news conference. “This will be, let’s assume it, part of the contract.” He added SABIC was awaiting regulatory clearance in around 10 jurisdictions for its Clariant stake. The strategy update is set to be released “in late June or early July” followed by a road show, he said. Clariant stock slipped 1 percent by 1030 GMT, extending a fall of about 15 percent since late January, when SABIC said it was becoming Clariant’s largest shareholder. Analysts say the decline reflects disappointment that SABIC will not seek to buy Clariant outright, although some still say the Saudi company, 70 percent owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, will not be content with just a quarter share. “Clariant’s stock took a hit after White Tale sold,” said Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Christian Faitz. “The market’s view is that SABIC is not going to do much with its stake, while we believe the opposite, at least in the mid-term, is true.” Clariant’s 2017 sales rose to 6.38 billion Swiss francs ($6.8 billion), in line with the average estimate in a Reuters poll of analysts. But its net profit after minority interests rose only 9.5 percent to 277 million francs, compared with an average estimate of 332 million. In addition to a roughly 45 million franc hit linked to U.S. tax changes, Clariant had 180 million francs in one-time costs, compared with just 107 million in 2016, as it turned to Goldman to help defend itself against White Tale. The activist, led by New York City real estate heir David Winter and hedge fund investor Keith Meister, wanted three board seats and a strategic review by investment bankers as a possible precursor to a split-up of Clariant. Clariant Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said the failed merger with Huntsman and the White Tale defense cost about 50 million francs. Clariant said it would raise its dividend 11 percent to 0.50 francs, matching the poll forecast. It stuck to its mid-term target of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation before exceptional items of 16 to 19 percent of sales. For 2017, its adjusted EBITDA margin was 15.3 percent, up from 15.2 percent in 2016. $1 = 0.9322 Swiss francs

2018-02-14,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Russia is seeking to finalise multi-million-dollar investment deals with Saudi Arabia in the next three months including partnerships with state oil giant Aramco, Russia’s top state investment officer said on Wednesday. Russian banks and a Russian-Chinese investment fund are also keen to take part in Aramco’s initial public offering (IPO), the head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, Kirill Dmitriev, told reporters, reiterating comments he made last month. The move is aimed at strengthening energy ties between the two major oil producers. Dmitriev told Reuters last month that there was great interest in the Aramco IPO from Russian pension funds and Chinese partners.  Sources told Reuters last year that Chinese state oil companies were willing to be cornerstone investors in the Aramco IPO, which could become the world’s biggest, valuing the firm at up to $2 trillion (1.44 trillion pounds) and raising more than $100 billion. “There are a number of investors who would like to invest in the Aramco IPO, including several banks,” Dmitriev said on Wednesday. “Not only this, we have a Russia-China investment fund, and through that Russia-China investment fund we see a major interest in the Aramco IPO from a number of leading Chinese institutions.” Saudi officials have said the government plans to sell up to 5 percent of Aramco shares on one or more foreign exchanges in addition to Riyadh. “We will see how the IPO process progresses but we see significant interest to invest in the Aramco IPO, from Russia, from China. We believe this is very good for, once again, thinking jointly about oil,” he said. Dmitriev also said the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the Saudi Public Investment Fund and Aramco planned to invest in several projects through their joint energy platform including in Russia’s Eurasia Drilling, a major independent driller.  “We expect to finalise an agreement very shortly to have our energy platform with Saudi Aramco invest in Eurasia Drilling and also provide services to Saudi Aramco,” Dmitriev said. An announcement is expected later on Wednesday on a partnership between Aramco and a liquefied natural gas project in Russia, Dmitriev said. Russia also has significant investments in Saudi Arabia’s petrochemicals industry, he said. Sibur, Russia’s largest producer of petrochemicals, is building a petrochemicals facility in the kingdom. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak had said in October the deal would be worth $1.1 billion. “Sibur, jointly with us, is building a petrochemical facility focussed on ... manufacturing, which is really one of the big Russian projects in Saudi Arabia and underscores the potential for cooperation in petrochemicals,” he added. In October, Russia and Saudi Arabia announced a $1 billion fund to invest in energy projects. Dmitriev also said a global deal between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and some non-OPEC producers to cut crude supply was stabilising the oil market. Russia and Saudi Arabia are leading the supply deal, which runs until the end of 2018.

Most European power grids have been split off from the utilities that owned them more than a decade ago. However, RTE - majority owned by French state-controlled utility EDF - is one of a few so-called “Independent Transmission Operators” (ITOs) still owned by vertically integrated utilities. These ITO firms are not allowed to buy stakes in independent power grid operators, but RTE chief executive Francois Brottes said he would be in favour of changing RTE’s legal status to be able to take part in any EU-wide power grid consolidation. “RTE is not meant to be merely an observer in the consolidation of the European power grid industry,” Brottes told reporters. He said there was no urgency in changing RTE’s legal status and that this was a medium-term project. He also said he was not too keen on an initial public offering (IPO).

2018-02-14,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Sime has planted 10k ha at its 200k Liberia concession * Uncertainty over new RSPO rules main reason for stall * New rules expected by November on planting in forested areas * Africa disappoints as new frontier for palm oil By Edward McAllister and Emily Chow GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR, Feb 14 (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development. Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards. “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said. The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps. The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs. While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils. But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop. “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”. The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years. Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes. If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said. Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules. It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur. “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015. Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand. Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge. The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families. Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk. A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said. Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.” Reporting By Edward McAllister in GBAH, Liberia and Emily Chow

2018-02-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy taxes in major advanced economies are not doing enough to reduce energy use, improve energy efficiency and drive a shift towards low-carbon sources, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said on Wednesday. Taxes on energy use, such as fuel, carbon taxes and excise duties, are used by many governments to make energy consumers pay for the costs of pollution, thereby reducing harmful greenhouse gas emissions which lead to global warming. The OECD examined taxes on energy use between 2012 and 2015 in 42 OECD and G20 economies, which represent around 80 percent of global energy use and carbon emissions from energy use. The study did not include carbon market prices, such as in the EU’s Emissions Trading System, but the OECD said they do little to change the report’s findings. The OECD found that almost all taxes are too low to help combat global warming, compared to a benchmark level of 30 euros per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) - a conservative minimum estimate of the damage from emitting one tonne of CO2.  “A bird’s eye view of effective taxes per tonne of CO2 across all countries reveals that there is hardly any change in the tax rates on emissions outside the road transport sector,” the report said. “Taxes continue to be poorly aligned with environmental and climate costs of energy use, across all countries,” it added. In the road transport sector, 97 percent of emissions are taxed and rates were above 50 euros/tCO2 for 47 percent of emissions in 2015, compared to 37 percent in 2012. In non-road sectors, which collectively account for 95 percent of carbon emissions from energy use, 81 percent of emissions were untaxed and rates were below 30 euros/tCO2 for 97 percent of emissions. Coal, which accounts for almost half of carbon emissions in the 42 countries, goes untaxed in many countries, and was taxed above 5/tCO2 in just five countries examined. Taxes on oil products were relatively high at over 100 euros/tCO2 on average across all sectors and particularly high in road transport, a sector which remains almost entirely dependent on oil products.  Taxes on diesel for transport use are lower than taxes for gasoline in every country except two, although this pattern appears to be changing, the report said. Some governments have started to raise diesel fuel taxes amid pressure to improve air quality in major cities. “Apart from transport fuel tax increases in some large low- to-middle income economies, and some first steps towards aligning diesel taxes with gasoline taxes, there is no structural change to the pattern of taxes on energy use between 2012 and 2015,” the OECD said.

2018-02-14,"TOKYO (Reuters) - JFE Holdings Inc, parent of Japan’s second-biggest steelmaker, plans to spend more than 650 billion yen (£4.3 billion) over the next three years upgrading domestic production facilities in a bid to raise productivity and competitiveness. A key goal of the capital expenditure plans, outlined by JFE Holdings President Eiji Hayashida in an interview on Wednesday, will be to help the firm meet growing demand from the auto industry for lighter steel and new materials to make electric and other cars of the future more fuel-efficient. The pivot comes as Asia’s steelmakers seek to make the most of still-robust demand from China. But while sales in the world’s second-biggest economy offer hope, festering tensions on global trade as U.S. President Trump ponders tariffs and quotas on imports of steel and aluminium are becoming a major headache for industry executives like Hayashida. “We’ve spent a bit more than 650 billion yen in the past three years on domestic facilities and we will need to do it again for the next years, which would give us a very competitive foundation,” Hayashida told Reuters. “We may even increase spending,” he said, with Japan home to most of JFE’s crude steel manufacturing. Details of JFE’s new business plan through March 2021 will be announced around April. “I think we don’t have to worry about China (economic) risk, at least this year,” Hayashida said, warning he sees slower Chinese demand from next year. “My biggest fear is how far President Trump will close down trade,” the executive said. “If the U.S. takes action (to curb imports), it may trigger retaliation by other countries. What is most troublesome is to see the world heading to protectionism.” Japan’s steelmakers, including JFE’s bigger rival Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp, are making hefty investment in ageing domestic plants. Glitches at the plants - some more than 40 years old - have prevented them from manufacturing as much steel as they would have liked, as well as more modern products. Steel has dominated car material usage for over a century, but it now faces fierce competition from rivals such as aluminium and carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) as automakers turn to lighter materials to make more fuel-efficient cars.     “For both electric vehicles and gasoline-powered cars, demand for shedding weight will only get stronger,” Hayashida said. “Automakers see there is still room to cut the weight of gasoline car by 10-15 percent. We will mainly pour resources into such efforts,” he said, pointing to advanced high-tensile steel and new components to be created through cooperation with chemicals manufacturers. JFE said in December that it and a unit of Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings have jointly developed lightweight car door panels by combining steel and carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP). “We want to accelerate similar collaborations with multiple partners,” Hayashida said.   Outside Japan, Hayashida said JFE may build new lines at its automotive steelmaking plants in China and Thailand - if demand picks up. Meanwhile Hayashida said there were no plans for JFE to increase its 15 percent stake in Indian partner JSW Steel Ltd to capitalise on potential market growth in India. “I don’t see any benefit from raising our stake from the current 15 percent,” he said. “I feel comfortable with the current level.”   Reporting by Yuka Obayashi and Ritsuko Shimizu; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/jfe-holdings-strategy/interview-japans-jfe-to-focus-on-lighter-steel-in-6-bln-upgrade-warns-on-u-s-trade-policy-idUKL4N1Q42HF,14 Feb 2018,"* Sees China demand solid in 2018, slower from next year

2018-02-14,"(Removes extraneous word from headline) * Eight storage locations approved, most owned by state-run firms * Exchange will use 3.15 mln cubic meters of capacity * Long-awaited crude futures contract to launch on March 26 BEIJING, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE) said on Wednesday it had approved the use of six bonded storage warehouses at eight locations in China, ahead of the launch of its crude oil futures contract next month. The storage capacity across the eight listed locations totals 5.95 million cubic meters, according to an INE statement, although the exchange will use only 3.15 million cubic meters of capacity, equivalent to 19.8 million barrels. The eight locations include sites owned by PetroChina in Dalian, in the northeastern province of Liaoning, Zhanjiang in the southern province of Guangdong, and Ningbo in the eastern province of Zhejiang. The bonded warehouses, where oil is stored until import duties are paid or until it is re-exported, are the INE’s designated delivery locations for its crude futures contracts. Six crude grades can be delivered on the INE, including five from the Middle East. Two further storage sites are owned by Sinopec, in Shandong and Zhejiang, another by Sinochem in Zhoushan. The remaining two sites are in Qingdao, in Shandong, and in Yangshan in Zhejiang. The three back-up warehouses included one owned by China National Offshore Oil Corp in Yantai, Shandong, as well as another site in Dalian and one in Yingkou, also in Liaoning. After years of delays, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced last week that China’s oil futures contract would start trading on March 26. In a separate statement, the INE named four firms that had been approved to inspect the crude delivered into the bonded warehouses. The companies are China Certification & Inspection Group Inspection Co Ltd., SGS-CSTC Standards Technical Services Co Ltd, Shanghai Orient Intertek Testing Services Co Ltd and the Technical Center for Industrial Product and Raw Material Inspection and Testing at the Shanghai Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau.

2018-02-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was considering a range of options to address steel and aluminium imports that he said were unfairly hurting U.S. producers, including tariffs and quotas. Trump’s comments - his strongest signal in months that he will take at least some action to restrict imports of the two metals - came in a meeting with a bipartisan group of U.S. senators and representatives at the White House. Reporters were present for part of the meeting. Some of the lawmakers urged him to act decisively to save steel and aluminium plants in their states, but others urged caution because higher prices would hurt downstream manufacturers that consume steel and aluminium. Trump is weighing options presented last month by the U.S. Commerce Department in parallel “Section 232” investigations into whether import restrictions on steel and aluminium are needed to protect national security. The probes were authorized under a 1962 trade law that has not been invoked since 2001. “What we’re talking about is tariffs and/or quotas,” Trump said to the group. “Part of the options would be tariffs coming in. As they dump steel, they pay tariffs, substantial tariffs, which means the United States would actually make a lot of money.” Trump said that the steel and aluminium industries were being  “decimated by dumping” and talked about the empty steel mills he saw on the campaign trail in 2016. “I look at it two ways: I want to keep prices down, but I also want to make sure that we have a steel industry and an aluminium industry, and we do need that for national defence,” Trump said. U.S. steel stocks rose broadly after the comments, with the S&P 1500 steel index closing up 1.1 percent and  outperforming the broader market. Alcoa Inc shares ended 1.4 percent higher, with Century Aluminum up 0.5 percent. Trump now has until around April 11 to decide whether to impose steel import curbs and April 20 to decide on aluminium restrictions. The Commerce Department has not revealed its recommendations in the probes launched last spring. But Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told the lawmakers that Section 232 powers “can be applied in a much more surgical way” that could lead to tariffs on imports from certain countries and quotas from other nations suspected of transhipping products. Some lawmakers came away from the meeting with the impression that Trump would impose some restrictions but understood the need for a balanced approach. “My belief is he’ll take some action, but he was truly open to seeking input at the meeting today,” Senator Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, told reporters at the Capitol. Blunt, who said Missouri industries both make and consume  steel and aluminium, told Trump in the meeting: “I think we do need to be careful here that we don’t start a reciprocal battle on tariffs.”   Several lawmakers cited the need to maintain U.S. energy independence and the electrical grid. They urged steps to protect U.S. producers of oil drilling and transport pipe and noted  AK Steel is the last American producer of electrical steel for electric transformers.  Senator Rob Portman, a Republican from steel-intensive Ohio, told Trump that without relief from imports, AK Steel is “going to pull out of this business, so we won’t have the steel that goes into our transformers and our grid.” Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania cautioned that it would be difficult for Trump to justify a national security ruling when defence products consume only 3 percent of domestic steel output.”So I think it’s implausible to believe that we’re not able to meet the needs of our defence industry, which is absolutely essential,” he said. Steelmakers recently urged Trump to take broad action to reduce steel imports to curb global excess steel production capacity, largely in China.. Asked about Trump’s steel comments, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the world economy was recovering and all parties should cherish the momentum and send signals of cooperation and mutual benefit.  At this time, any unilateral or protectionist moves would harm countries and damage the trade environment, Geng told reporters in Beijing.  “All parties should make an all-out effort to avoid this.”  A Chinese government think-tank warned earlier that “unreasonable” U.S. trade actions on steel will be met with “countermeasures” under World Trade Organization rules. Steel and aluminium users, meanwhile, have urged caution in any restrictions to avoid disruptions or price spikes in the raw materials used in everything from autos to appliances and aircraft and construction. The Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, representing auto parts makers with 871,000 U.S. employees,  urged Trump in a letter on Tuesday to exclude an extensive list of products from import restrictions, from tire cord steel to high-pressure aluminium die castings.

The communist-run island has seen its financial situation deteriorate in recent months following the deepening of Venezuela’s economic crisis, lower revenue from commodity and related exports, devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma and tightening of business and travel restrictions by the U.S. administration under President Donald Trump. In 2015, Cuba reached a debt deal with members of the Paris Club of creditor nations, but having not dealt with its defaulted commercial creditors in the London Club means the country is in effect shut out of international capital markets. “The committee reached out to Cuba in late January,” said Rodrigo Olivares-Caminal, coordinator of the creditor group and a law professor at London’s Queen Mary University. “We have made a good faith proposal to the government.” The creditor group holds obligations representing a face value of $1.4 billion worth of Cuban debt and is made up of three funds - Stancroft Trust Ltd, Adelante Exotic Debt Fund Ltd and CRF I Ltd - as well as one commercial bank. “We are trying to give the country another chance to reach an amicable understanding with creditors,” Olivares-Caminal told Reuters. “This would give them very beneficial terms to remedy their situation vis-à-vis capital markets.” While details of the proposal were confidential, it would convey “very significant debt relief” said Lee Buchheit at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP, one of the world’s top restructuring lawyers who was retained by the group last year. “Cuba negotiated a generous debt relief package with most of its bilateral creditors at the very end of 2015,” Buchheit told Reuters. “The London Club offer draws on certain features of the deal with the bilateral creditors but in some respects it is even more generous to the Cubans.” Under the 2015 deal, a number of Paris Club of creditor nations forgave $8.5 billion of $11.1 billion official debt it had defaulted on through 1986, plus charges. Repayment of the remaining debt was structured over 18 years, and Havana paid the first two instalments due since. As part of the accord, some creditors were also preparing to swap debt for an equity stake in local development projects. This was seen as a breakthrough with Cuba agreeing for the first time to give rich capitalist countries equity in development projects in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. Cuba does not publish up-to-date information on its foreign debt, citing a need to keep sensitive economic information from Washington, which it has long accused of trying to disrupt its financial and trade relations under a comprehensive U.S. sanctions regime. However, the creditor group estimated it was holding at least 50 percent of Cuba’s private sector debt. Olivares-Caminal added the proposal would be open for a limited period of time, though declined to give further detail. Cuba’s cash crunch and lower oil supplies from Venezuela have forced the government to slash imports and reduce the use of fuel and electricity.

2018-02-14,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Soaring gas demand from China, India and Southeast Asia is sucking up an LNG supply glut previously expected to last for years, opening opportunity for new production from East Africa to North America that had been deemed part of the overhang.  Trade flows in Eikon show global liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have risen 40 percent since 2015, to almost 40 billion cubic metres (bcm) a month. Growth accelerated in 2017, with imports up by a fifth, largely due to China, but also South Korea and Japan.  Asia’s LNG market has been glutted since 2015, following  massive development that began in the early 2000s. But a  gasification programme in China last year and strong economic growth across Asia pushed up demand, contributing - along with a cold winter - to a doubling of LNG spot prices from mid-2017.  The market is expected to remain relatively tight for the remainder of 2018, with China’s gas programme continuing and delays at several export projects.  “The tight market is going to continue simply because demand is growing and expected projects have been delayed,” said Jun Nishizawa, senior vice president at the energy division of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp’s.  Nishizawa cited delays in projects at Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana, in which Mitsubishi has a stake, and Freeport LNG in Texas. Freeport’s first LNG train is scheduled to be completed in November 2018 and no delays have been announced.  “I don’t think substantial LNG will be produced by these two projects by end of the year,” Nishizawa said, speaking at an LNG industry conference last week in Bali, Indonesia. In Australia, the Ichthys project developed by Japan’s Inpex and France’s Total has seen several delays and cost blowouts. Total’s CEO said first exports now may not come until the second quarter.  The LNG tanker market is also tight, with few ships ordered in recent years.  “The global LNG tanker market looks increasingly bullish for 2018 and 2019, as strong demand growth and a thinning order-book pressure the available supply,” BMI Research said this week. This unexpected tightening potentially opens the way for new projects for the first time in several years.  Many projects were delayed or axed when oil and gas prices started tumbling in mid-2014. Now energy companies are returning to health as prices have improved.  “The entire Asian LNG market will increase. It will stimulate more producers to take the risk to develop projects to get into Asia,” said Jarand Rystad, chief executive of consultancy Rystad Energy.  In East Africa, U.S. energy firm Anadarko Petroleum is getting closer to a final investment decision (FiD) as it lines up potential buyers for its Mozambique gas field.  Tokyo Gas is the latest to near an offtake agreement, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named as they could not talk about ongoing contractual negotiations.  Anadarko and Tokyo Gas declined to comment.  Anadarko’s Mozambique concession holds an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet (2.1 trillion cubic metres) of gas, its website says, four times 2017’s globally imported LNG volumes.  Several export projects in North America also hope for FiD this year.  They include LNG Canada, or Kitimat, a $40 billion, 6.5 million-tonnes-a-year venture involving Royal Dutch Shell, PetroChina, Korea Gas Corporation and Japan’s Mitsubishi.  In the United States, Cheniere Energy plans to expand, and Pembina Pipeline hopes for FiD on its 7.8 million-tonne-a-year Jordan Cove plant in Oregon. Also, top LNG exporter Qatar plans to expand output to over 100 million tonnes a year by 2024, from 77 million tonnes now.  Other projects and expansions are planned from West Africa to Papua New Guinea. Just a few of these projects would lift specialist LNG firms like Norway’s Hoegh LNG.  “Now that they (China) are setting up (import) terminals, more demand could emerge,” said Parth Jindal, managing director of Hoegh LNG Asia.  One risk to new projects, though, are emerging price disputes between buyers and sellers, with importers demanding cheaper and more flexible terms.  Poten and Partners, an energy brokerage and consultancy, said this week a “dearth of commitments” from buyers to long-term contracts would make it hard for developers to finance new capacity.  North Asia has been anchoring demand for the past decade - Japan, China and South Korea being the top three LNG importers - with China accounting for most of the growth.  South and Southeast Asia are now providing new demand.  India is starting a gas development programme that could match China’s, planning to add 11 LNG import terminals to an existing four..  Pakistan started importing LNG in 2015 and has ambitious expansion plans. Bangladesh and Myanmar also plan to develop import terminals. Thailand expects its LNG imports to climb nearly sevenfold, to 35 million tonnes a year by 2036, and Indonesia, the world’s fifth-biggest LNG exporter, is expected to become a net importer as domestic production stalls.  By 2030, Thailand and Indonesia together could import nearly 70 million tonnes of LNG a year, said Azam Mohammad of consultancy McKinsey, comparable to all the gas China imported in 2017.

Chief Executive Peter Coleman of Woodside Petroleum , operator of the NWS Project, said in an analyst call on Wednesday that “North West Shelf’s view is that KOGAS owes the North West Shelf money, not the other way around.” Reuters previously reported that state-run KOGAS, one of the world’s biggest importer of LNG, and the North West Shelf LNG export project were in arbitration over the pricing of a mid-term supply contract, after a KOGAS spokesman on Monday confirmed arbitration without further comment. The KOGAS spokesman said on Wednesday the company has no further comment on the matter. Woodside’s Coleman said the arbitration, under which contract counterparts agree a neutral arbiter to resolve disputes outside formal legal courts, was over a supply deal that expired in 2016. The LNG contract was for about eight cargoes a year over a couple of years, he said. Woodside’s equity was one-sixth. “It’s just about price ... every contract has this in it, that you renegotiate prices,” Coleman said in a separate media call. “It’s just a buyer is taking a view that we fundamentally disagree with ... and is inconsistent with the way other buyers have treated these price discussions,” Coleman said. Arbitration cases tend to be confidential, with neither party publishing details. Woodside’s Coleman said he was only able to comment on this case as “clearly someone in Korea has broken confidentiality”. Woodside is Australia’s biggest oil and gas company, with stakes in several large-scale LNG export projects. “LNG price review activity and arbitration cases are highly confidential and it is exceptionally rare that they become known publicly,” said Saul Kavonic of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. That NWS took this to arbitration is a sign of how aggressive some buyers are becoming in pushing for contractual concessions, Kavonic said. But “price reviews are a normal part of LNG contracts, including arbitration provisions, so there is nothing here to suggest that there are any broader implications for ... the broader business relationship between the parties,” he said. Kavonic said many buyers demand better supply deals as they struggle to pass on costs to their own customers. Many utilities across North Asia struggle with regulated domestic prices, and falling structural demand because of stagnating populations and improving energy efficiency. Rising renewable output, as well as rising competition in liberalizing markets, also eats away at incumbent power operators. As a result, and hoping to take advantage of increased competition among producers, Asian LNG buyers have over the past year increased pressure on producers to grant cheaper and more flexible terms in multi-year supply contracts, under which the majority of the region’s LNG is sold. Producers including Woodside and Royal Dutch Shell have said they are open to contracts with more flexibility, but have resisted granting changes to existing deals. Woodside’s venture partners in the NWS Project are BHP , BP, Chevron, Shell and Japan Australia LNG, which is a joint venture between Japan’s Mitsui and Mitsubishi.

Japanese demand for yen also saw the dollar break last year’s low and skid to a 15-month trough at 107.01, dragging the U.S. currency down broadly. That in turn pressured Japan’s Nikkei which slipped as much as 1.4 percent to test four-month lows. Dealers said there was a lot of focus on the 200-day moving average at 21,031 as a break there would ring bearish alarm bells. The Nikkei was last down 0.4 percent at 21,154.17. Other Asian markets were steadier, as were E-Minis for the S&P 500. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.8 percent, pulled higher by South Korea and Hong Kong indices. Moves elsewhere were tentative with investors clearly scarred by the return of volatility. BofA Merrill Lynch’s February Fund Manager Survey found a record one-month jump in the net percentage of investors taking out protection against a sharp fall in equity markets. Funds were rotating into cash and out of equities, reducing their stock allocation to a net 43 percent overweight, from 55 percent, the largest one-month decline in two years. Much now rested on what the U.S. consumer price report showed for January, given it was the risk of accelerating inflation that triggered the global rout in the first place. Headline consumer price inflation is forecast to slow to an annual 1.9 percent and core inflation to 1.7 percent, an outcome that could help calm nerves. The concern is the figures could surprise on the high side as wages did a couple of weeks ago. “The risk seems asymmetric to me,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader. “Even a slightly higher number could set the cat among the pigeons given the late cycle stimulus the Trump Administration is pumping into the U.S. economy.” In currency markets, the U.S. dollar was under fire again losing 0.2 percent on a basket of currencies to 89.5. The euro firmed to $1.2378 and away from last week’s trough at $1.2204. It was aided by expectations German GDP data later on Wednesday would show strong growth. Analysts said investors were becoming nervous about the prospect of swelling U.S. budget and trade deficits given the passage of huge tax cuts and spending plans. “The re-emergence of the twin deficit should send shivers down the dollar’s spine,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities. He noted the IMF had estimated that a 1 percent rise in the budget deficit led to a 0.6 percent increase in the U.S. current account deficit. That suggested the twin deficit could exceed 7 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, all of which had to be funded by offshore money. “Those numbers do not bode well for the greenback in the medium term,” concluded McCormick. The drop in the dollar gave a fillip to commodities, with copper firm after jumping 2.7 percent overnight. Spot gold edged up 0.3 percent to $1,333.78 per ounce, leaving behind last week’s one-month low of $1,306.81. Oil prices steadied for now, though concerns about oversupply were never far away. U.S. crude futures eased 1 cent to $59.18 a barrel, while Brent futures gained 8 cents to $62.8. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Shri

2018-02-14,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines and China have agreed to set up a special panel to work out how they can jointly explore oil and gas in part of the South China Sea that both sides lay claim without having to address the explosive issue of sovereignty. China claims most of the South China Sea, where $3 billion in sea-borne trade pass every year, and has competing claims in various parts of it with Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. “It’s just the start of a process,” Philippine ambassador to China, Chito Sta. Romana, told reporters late on Tuesday after diplomats from both sides met for the second time under a bilateral mechanism aimed at defusing longstanding maritime tensions. He said the decision to form a working group on cooperating on energy was a “breakthrough”. Forming an agreement for a joint project would be extremely complex and sensitive as both countries claim jurisdiction of the site of the oil and gas reserves, so sharing them could be deemed legitimising the other side’s claim, or even ceding sovereign territory. The idea of joint development was first hatched in 1986, but disputes and the sovereignty issue have stopped it from materialising. But time is of the essence for the Philippines, which relies heavily on energy imports to fuel its fast-growing economy. That is complicated by estimates that its only domestic natural gas source, the offshore Malampaya field, will be depleted by 2024.  Sta. Romana said a second coordinating group was created to address sovereignty issues and “to prevent any crisis from escalating”. The Philippines in 2011 accused Chinese ships of harassing a survey vessel hired by a Forum Energy, which won a contract to explore oil and gas in the Reed Bank, near the Spratly. The Philippines went the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2013 to question that, among other bones of contention. The tribunal’s 2016 ruling, which China refuses to recognise, included clarifying that the Reed Bank was within the 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines and therefore it had sovereign rights to exploit resources there.  A senior Philippine official also said Southeast Asian countries and China would next month start negotiations on a long-awaited maritime code of conduct.

2018-02-14,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum, Australia’s biggest independent gas and oil producer, launched a surprise A$2.5 billion ($1.96 billion) share sale on Wednesday to raise funds to take control of and develop a long-stranded gas field off the country’s west coast. Woodside said on Wednesday it had agreed to pay $744 million for ExxonMobil Corp’s 50-percent stake in the Scarborough field, a project that has been stuck on the drawing board for nearly 40 years due to factors including its remote, deepwater location. The company said that soaring international demand for gas meant the time was right for the acquisition, with the field expected to feed an expansion of its Pluto liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in the state of Western Australia. “The difference between supply and demand is opening up very, very quickly,” said Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman, adding that Chinese appetite for LNG was growing rapidly. But some analysts underscored the challenges of developing the field, with Ben Wilson at Royal Bank of Canada describing the site in a broker note as “deep, distant, dirty and dry”. The move puts Woodside, seen as short on near-term growth prospects, in control of Scarborough with a 75-percent stake, working with BHP Billiton on a project now estimated to cost up to $9.7 billion.  The rest of the money raised through the A$2.5 billion offer to existing shareholders will be used to support work on Scarborough, the Browse LNG project in Australia and the SNE oil development off Senegal. Analysts said that even with the large equity raising, Woodside may have to come back to investors in a few years to fund the development of Scarborough and Browse. Woodside has a market value of A$26 billion,  “There’s a lot of money to pay,” said Macquarie analyst Andrew Hodge. The company announced the Scarborough deal after reporting an 18-percent rise in annual profit of $1.02 billion, just short of analyst forecasts. Woodside’s shares were on a trading halt for the offering, which closes on Thursday. It is offering one new share for every nine shares owned at A$27 a share, a 13-percent discount to Woodside’s last trade. The company also said it was pushing out a final investment decision on the Browse LNG project off Western Australia to 2021, a year later than last flagged and now estimated to cost $15 billion to get to start-up. “A lot of Woodside capital is due to be chewed up in coming years with the Senegal, Scarborough and Browse developments,” said Saul Kavonic, an analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie.  “All face uncertainties and risk delays ... but Scarborough could now prove the most ‘do-able’ of the three.” BHP Billiton welcomed Woodside’s expanded role in Scarborough. “This development could enhance the commercial viability of Scarborough and the region,” BHP’s petroleum president Steve Pastor said in a comment emailed to Reuters. Part of the $744 million cost of the stake in Scarborough will only be due when the project, in 900 meters of water with no liquids to boost the value of the gas, gets its final go-ahead. “Exxon aren’t in the habit of making dumb decisions. They probably see more future in Qatar, PNG (Papua New Guinea), Mozambique and Golden Pass (in Texas),” said Andrew Blakely, an analyst at fund manager Perpetual. Meanwhile, Woodside on Wednesday said the North West Shelf LNG joint venture is pursuing arbitration on an LNG contract dispute with Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS).

2018-02-14,"LOS ANGELES, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The United States government doubled its financial support for solar power projects overseas last year under a climate-friendly investment policy written in the last days of the Obama administration, according to a Reuters review of government documents. The growing U.S. support for foreign solar projects comes despite an ongoing federal investigation into past U.S. solar loans abroad. It also deepens confusion about President Donald Trump’s position on government support for renewable energy as his administration downplays the global warming threat and aggressively promotes fossil-fuel development. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the government’s international finance institution, loaned more than $630 million to foreign energy projects in 2017, 90 percent of which were solar, wind, or other low-carbon ventures, according to investment documents. That compares to $797 million in total OPIC energy financing in 2016, 61 percent of which went to clean energy. The agency’s lending to solar projects doubled to more than $250 million in 2017, supporting ventures in India, Africa and Latin America, according to the records. (For a graphic detailing OPIC energy investments over time, see: tmsnrt.rs/2F0op2H ) White House spokeswoman Kelly Love did not respond to requests for comment. OPIC is a self-funded government agency whose website says it aims to advance “U.S. foreign policy and national security priorities” by investing in ventures abroad. For 40 years, it has operated at no net cost to U.S. tax payers. The agency formalized its preference for climate-friendly energy in an environmental and social policy statement adopted days before Trump’s inauguration. The document says the agency aims to support reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and promote low- and no-carbon fuels and technologies, efficiency and conservation. That dovetails with former President Barack Obama’s effort to fight climate change but clashes with the current administration’s energy priorities. Since taking office, Trump has rolled back regulation limiting carbon dioxide emissions to help coal and oil firms; signed an executive order requiring government agencies to reduce the influence of climate considerations in decisions; and announced the withdrawal of the United States from an international pact to combat global warming. That might seem to suggest the administration would oppose continuing generous government support for solar - a leading climate-friendly competitor to fossil fuels - but the administration has never made that clear. Trump has never proposed repealing the billions of dollars worth of federal incentives for renewable energy, which were preserved by a Republican-controlled Congress in December tax legislation. But Trump has expressed skepticism about the viability of solar and wind, calling both “very, very expensive.” In January, Trump slapped tariffs on solar panel imports, saying the move would help domestic manufacturers. But what helps manufacturers may hurt solar installers that have relied on lower-cost imported panels, often from China. OPIC spokeswoman Andrea Orr said the agency adheres to the Obama-enacted low-carbon policy and that its portfolio is “demand driven” – reflecting the shift globally toward lower carbon energy sources. But policy “does not prohibit OPIC from considering the full spectrum of energy projects,” she said, including in impoverished nations where fossil fuels are the most feasible option. OPIC’s financing last year, for example, included $50 million for a power plant in the West African nation of Guinea that will run on fuel oil. Last year, Trump sought to eliminate OPIC as part of his 2018 budget proposal “to reduce unnecessary federal interventions that distort the free market” - but Congress rejected the idea. Trump has since appointed Texas businessman Ray Washburne to lead the agency. Washburne has said he would focus OPIC on two goals: empowering women in the developing world, and serving U.S. strategic national security interests. Washburne was not available for an interview, Orr said. Renewable energy projects that received OPIC funding last year include a Honduras geothermal plant sponsored by Ormat Technologies, a solar array in Zambia backed by First Solar Inc and solar facilities in Jordan and El Salvador by power plant owner AES Corp. Orb Energy, an Indian solar company backed by U.S. venture capital fund Acumen Fund Inc, secured $10 million in OPIC financing last year for commercial rooftop projects. Such funding would not be available from India’s conservative banking sector, the company said. “Donald Trump does not go out of his way to support solar or renewables, so we were concerned,” Orb Chief Executive Damian Miller said in an interview. But he was told there was “no fundamental change” in its priorities for selecting projects, he said. Since 2011, more than three quarters of energy generation projects that have received OPIC funding were for solar, wind or other non-hydroelectric forms of renewable power. That approach has been a boon for renewable energy developers, but has not always gone well for OPIC: the agency is currently under investigation by a federal watchdog over nearly $1 billion of loans to solar farms and a hydroelectric project in Chile that got into financial trouble when power prices in that nation plummeted. At issue is whether OPIC properly stress-tested the projects adequately before offering loans. The agency’s losses on the deals could exceed $160 million, sources told Reuters last year. OPIC has said it is confident it will recover the loans over the coming decades. AES – which received up to $89.5 million for its projects in Jordan and El Salvador in 2017 - said it has tapped OPIC financing for more than a decade. The shift in the priorities matches the evolution over time at AES, which now invests more in renewable energy and natural gas and less in oil and coal. “That’s the angle that the company has taken,” AES Treasurer Daniel Stadelmann said in an interview, referring to the company’s shift toward cleaner energy sources. “So it matches.” Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and

2018-02-14,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The Indian government’s plan to spend $230 million over two years to prevent crop residue burning is below the spending estimates of its policy advisors for the task and may do little to cut the air pollution that envelops the capital region of Delhi. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet is expected to sign off on the plan as early as this month, three senior government officials involved in the talks told Reuters. The planned expenditure is far less than the $600 million per year that NITI Aayog, a government policy advisory group, estimated last November needed to be spent to prevent farmers from burning the crop waste left over after harvesting. It was not clear if the amount was recommended to the government. Crop stubble burning caused one-quarter of the air pollution that blanketed Delhi in November, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change told parliament last week. The particles from the stubble burning combine with industrial pollution, vehicle exhaust and dust to cover the region every year as winter approaches and wind speeds drop.    The proposed plan would give money to farmers in three states bordering Delhi - Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh - to cover 80 percent of the cost of machinery to remove the crop stubble, said the officials, who declined to be named ahead of cabinet discussions on the matter. This would keep the farmers from burning the residue ahead of winter planting. “This is an important step but a lot will depend on how quickly the scheme is rolled out at a scale that can make a difference,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director of New Delhi-based think-tank the Centre for Science and Environment. The government officials said the funding can be raised if needed but warned against expecting immediate results. “We won’t be able to improve more than 20 to 25 percent of air quality even if the crop residue scheme is fully implemented,” acknowledged one of the government officials. “But we have to accept that the efforts to clean Delhi’s air will not take less than five years.” Modi’s office did not respond to an email seeking comment. Spokesmen for the farm and environment ministries declined to comment. In November, Delhi’s pollution index climbed to 12 times higher than the upper limit for healthy air. The air quality in central Delhi on Wednesday morning remains “unhealthy” at more than three times the limit, according to the United States embassy in New Delhi. Delhi was dubbed a “gas chamber” by its chief minister, and the federal government was widely criticized after U.S.-based United Airlines suspended flights to New Delhi because of the pollution. Sri Lankan cricket players threw up on the field during a match in the Indian capital last December.  Government officials have vowed to reduce the pollution. “A strong message has to go down that pollution is a serious economic and health issue and it is linked to our national image too,” Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said at the launch of a “Clean Air Campaign” last week. “We mean business now.” Farmers are welcoming the plan since the majority of them cannot afford the machinery on their own.  “For farmers, the cost of most agricultural machineries are prohibitive,” said Kartar Singh, a farmer from Punjab. “And that’s why the subsidy will come as a relief to those who want to buy modern harvesters and straw management machines.” U.S.-based John Deere and India’s Mahindra & Mahindra are some of the main sellers of farm machinery in India.  Other plans to deal with the stubble include state electric utility NTPC buying it to use as fuel in a coal-fired power plant. Reporting by Neha Dasgupta and Mayank Bhardwaj; Editing by Krishna N.

2018-02-14,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Soaring gas demand from China, India and Southeast Asia is sucking up an LNG supply glut previously expected to last for years, opening opportunity for new production from East Africa to North America that had been deemed part of the overhang.  Trade flows in Eikon show global liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports have risen 40 percent since 2015, to almost 40 billion cubic meters (bcm) a month. Growth accelerated in 2017, with imports up by a fifth, largely due to China, but also South Korea and Japan.  Asia’s LNG market has been glutted since 2015, following  massive development that began in the early 2000s. But a  gasification program in China last year and strong economic growth across Asia pushed up demand, contributing - along with a cold winter - to a doubling of LNG spot prices from mid-2017.  The market is expected to remain relatively tight for the remainder of 2018, with China’s gas program continuing and delays at several export projects.  “The tight market is going to continue simply because demand is growing and expected projects have been delayed,” said Jun Nishizawa, senior vice president at the energy division of Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp’s.  Nishizawa cited delays in projects at Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana, in which Mitsubishi has a stake, and Freeport LNG in Texas. Freeport’s first LNG train is scheduled to be completed in November 2018 and no delays have been announced.  “I don’t think substantial LNG will be produced by these two projects by end of the year,” Nishizawa said, speaking at an LNG industry conference last week in Bali, Indonesia. In Australia, the Ichthys project developed by Japan’s Inpex and France’s Total has seen several delays and cost blowouts. Total’s CEO said first exports now may not come until the second quarter.  The LNG tanker market is also tight, with few ships ordered in recent years.  “The global LNG tanker market looks increasingly bullish for 2018 and 2019, as strong demand growth and a thinning order-book pressure the available supply,” BMI Research said this week. This unexpected tightening potentially opens the way for new projects for the first time in several years.  Many projects were delayed or axed when oil and gas prices started tumbling in mid-2014. Now energy companies are returning to health as prices have improved.  “The entire Asian LNG market will increase. It will stimulate more producers to take the risk to develop projects to get into Asia,” said Jarand Rystad, chief executive of consultancy Rystad Energy.  In East Africa, U.S. energy firm Anadarko Petroleum is getting closer to a final investment decision (FiD) as it lines up potential buyers for its Mozambique gas field.  Tokyo Gas is the latest to near an offtake agreement, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be named as they could not talk about ongoing contractual negotiations.  Anadarko and Tokyo Gas declined to comment.  Anadarko’s Mozambique concession holds an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet (2.1 trillion cubic meters) of gas, its website says, four times 2017’s globally imported LNG volumes.  Several export projects in North America also hope for FiD this year.  They include LNG Canada, or Kitimat, a $40 billion, 6.5 million-tonnes-a-year venture involving Royal Dutch Shell, PetroChina, Korea Gas Corporation and Japan’s Mitsubishi.  In the United States, Cheniere Energy plans to expand, and Pembina Pipeline hopes for FiD on its 7.8 million-tonne-a-year Jordan Cove plant in Oregon. Also, top LNG exporter Qatar plans to expand output to over 100 million tonnes a year by 2024, from 77 million tonnes now.  Other projects and expansions are planned from West Africa to Papua New Guinea. Just a few of these projects would lift specialist LNG firms like Norway’s Hoegh LNG.  “Now that they (China) are setting up (import) terminals, more demand could emerge,” said Parth Jindal, managing director of Hoegh LNG Asia.  One risk to new projects, though, are emerging price disputes between buyers and sellers, with importers demanding cheaper and more flexible terms.  Poten and Partners, an energy brokerage and consultancy, said this week a “dearth of commitments” from buyers to long-term contracts would make it hard for developers to finance new capacity.  North Asia has been anchoring demand for the past decade - Japan, China and South Korea being the top three LNG importers - with China accounting for most of the growth.  South and Southeast Asia are now providing new demand.  India is starting a gas development program that could match China’s, planning to add 11 LNG import terminals to an existing four..  Pakistan started importing LNG in 2015 and has ambitious expansion plans. Bangladesh and Myanmar also plan to develop import terminals. Thailand expects its LNG imports to climb nearly sevenfold, to 35 million tonnes a year by 2036, and Indonesia, the world’s fifth-biggest LNG exporter, is expected to become a net importer as domestic production stalls.  By 2030, Thailand and Indonesia together could import nearly 70 million tonnes of LNG a year, said Azam Mohammad of consultancy McKinsey, comparable to all the gas China imported in 2017.

The move puts Woodside, seen by some as short on near-term growth prospects, in a better position to develop the Scarborough field off Western Australia, as it will have a 75-percent stake and take over running the project, now estimated to cost up to $9.7 billion. Woodside’s share of that cost would be up to $7.9 billion. Analysts raised concern that even with the large equity raising, the company may have to come back to investors in a few years to fund development of Scarborough and the competing Browse LNG project, also off Western Australia. “There’s a lot of money to pay,” said Macquarie analyst Andrew Hodge. Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said the company could now accelerate development of Scarborough to feed an expansion of its Pluto LNG plant, which would help fill a need for new LNG supply, particularly as Chinese demand grows rapidly. “This gives greater alignment and certainty over a low-cost, high value opportunity,” Coleman told analysts on a conference call. “The difference between supply and demand is opening up very, very quickly.” The company said it was pushing out a final investment decision on the Browse LNG project off Western Australia to 2021, one year later than last flagged and now estimated to cost $15 billion. Woodside announced the equity raising and acquisition after reporting an 18-percent rise in annual profit of $1.02 billion, which missed analyst forecasts. However, investors were more focused on the stake-acquisition and plans to develop Scarborough. The company has agreed to buy ExxonMobil’s 50-percent stake in Scarborough for up to $744 million, with part of that due pending a final investment decision on developing the field. The other partner in Scarborough, BHP Billiton , welcomed the deal. “This development could enhance the commercial viability of Scarborough and the region,” BHP’s petroleum president Steve Pastor said in a comment emailed to Reuters. The rest of the money Woodside is raising through the A$2.5 billion offer to existing shareholders will be used to support work on Scarborough, the SNE oil project off Senegal and progress on Browse. Woodside will be offering one new share for every nine shares owned at A$27 a share, a 13-percent discount to Woodside’s last trade, which Macquarie’s Hodge said was a “reasonable” discount. The company maintained its forecast for 2018 output at 85 million to 90 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) as production ramps up at the Wheatstone LNG project in Australia, operated by Chevron Corp.

2018-02-14,"SINGAPORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - The arbitration between Australia’s North West Shelf (NWS) liquefied natural gas (LNG) project and Korea Gas Corp (KOGAS) over the price of an expired supply contract comes as Asian buyers are putting pressure on producers to grant more flexible supply terms. Most of Asia’s LNG is supplied under long-term contracts that ensure buyers get regular supplies through fixed monthly cargoes and grant producers a steady stream of revenue. Before 2015, when supplies were tight, buyers were willing to sign up to terms that allowed them little flexibility on price and volume. But with supplies now more abundant, LNG buyers are demanding changes. There are three sticking points which buyers are contesting. LNG buyers receive fixed monthly volumes. Even if a buyer cancels a cargo due to a period of unusually low demand, payment is still due under so-called “take-or-pay” obligations. Most Asian long-term supply contracts contain “destination clauses” that prevent buyers from on-selling LNG to third parties. To protect buyers and sellers from sharp price swings, the LNG under most long-term contracts is indexed to oil under what are known as “s-curves”. When oil prices rise quickly, the s-curve grants buyers a “slope” once oil has reached a pre-defined level, under which the price for LNG rises more slowly and with a time-lag. Sellers of LNG are granted a similar “slope” which slows down a price fall in oil, once crude has fallen to a certain level. Buyers prefer a flat slope at high oil prices, while LNG producers and sellers prefer flat slopes at low oil prices. In most existing contracts, a slope of around 15 percent of oil prices is applied under a time lag versus crude of several weeks or even months. Many buyers are now asking for a lower slope of 11 percent to 12 percent. At current prices for Brent crude oil of around $63 per barrel, a reduction of the slope from 15 percent to 12 percent for buyers would lead to a fall in the LNG price of $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) to $7.50 per mmBtu. Many LNG supply contracts span years, some even decades. Typically, a window for review is allowed at defined periods. Should no agreement be reached during such review periods, the contracts include the possibility of going into “arbitration”, where both sides agree an arbiter to resolve the dispute without involving a legal court. Between 2008 and 2014, European utilities entered into dozens of cases against producers at specialist courts in Paris, London and Stockholm, mostly winning awards in their favour. The KOGAS case with North West Shelf is Asia’s first LNG arbitration to become public. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC) is lobbying to become Asia’s key LNG arbitration centre.

Japanese demand for yen also saw the dollar break last year’s low and skid to a 15-month trough at 107.01, dragging the U.S. currency down broadly. That in turn pressured Japan’s Nikkei which slipped 0.6 percent to test four-month lows.

2018-02-14,"* Weaker dollar potentially spurs fuel demand * Healthy economic growth also supports oil markets * But physical crude falls as exporters compete for customers * U.S. crude inventories rise -API * Oil supplies could outgrow demand again in 2018 -IEA By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Wednesday, supported by healthy economic growth and expectations that a weaker dollar could spur fuel demand. Despite this, crude prices remain well below recent highs due to signs of lingering oversupply, including rising U.S. inventories and ample physical flows globally. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $59.17 a barrel at 0123 GMT, down 2 cents from their last settlement. WTI was trading above $65 in early February. Brent crude futures were at $62.77 per barrel, up 5 cents from their last close. Brent was above $70 a barrel earlier this month. Ongoing weakness in the U.S. dollar, which potentially stokes demand from countries using other currencies at home, as well as healthy economic growth were supporting oil markets, traders said. “While we continue to see a firming fundamental backdrop over the course of this year ... investors should not discount the caution signs that have been emerging,” investment bank RBC Capital Markets said in a note to clients. “Pockets of oversupply have been emerging in the physical market,” the Canadian bank said, adding that “the tempering physical oil backdrop is ... playing a central role in the recent price softness”. The American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.9 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9, to 422.4 million. That was largely due to soaring U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by over 20 percent since mid-2016 to over 10 million barrels per day (bpd), surpassing output of top exporter Saudi Arabia and coming within reach of Russia, the world’s biggest producer. U.S. crude is increasingly appearing on global markets. More is set to come as the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port in the Gulf of Mexico starts testing supertankers for exports. The surge in U.S. production and exports means oil may be in oversupply again soon, flipping a deficit from 2017 induced by supply restraint led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia. The International Energy Agency said on Tuesday oil demand would grow by 1.4 million bpd in 2018, but added output growth could outpace demand. The physical market is already reacting, with prices for regional crudes from the North Sea, Russia, the United States, and Middle East becoming cheaper as producers struggle to remain competitive amid ample supplies. Despite the warning lights from within oil markets, economic fundamentals remain healthy. High consumer spending drove Japan’s economy to eight straight quarters of growth in October-December, its longest continuous expansion since the 1980s bubble economy, Cabinet Office data showed on Wednesday.

2018-02-14,"GBAH, Liberia/KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - When Malaysia’s biggest plantation company Sime Darby leased 220,000 hectares of lush forest in northwest Liberia in 2009, executives said they had found a much needed new frontier in global palm oil development. Undulating hills, a tropical climate and plenty of untouched land made the West African country’s interior ideal for palm oil growers running out of room in Southeast Asia. Nine years later, however, Sime Darby Plantation has planted only 10,000 hectares in Liberia and has not laid a seed in two years, stalled by uncertainties over new environmental standards.  “We are losing money. We have to balance our books or there is no future,” said David Parker, the head of Sime Darby Plantations in Liberia. In its earnings report for the financial year ending in June 2017, Sime Darby said it had filed a 202 million ringgit ($51.3 million) impairment - a permanent reduction in the value of the asset - on its Liberia operations. The operations were “affected by a number of factors, including the Ebola outbreak and more stringent environmental plans that have stalled expansion since 2014”, it said.       The $62 billion palm oil industry is considering whether to adopt new “no deforestation” rules for an oil found on supermarket shelves across the world, from cooking oil to snack food and soups to soaps.  The rules mark a more environmentally friendly form of palm oil development, but leave producers with a major conundrum: how to meet growing demand and make money with so much land now potentially off limits. The debate is unfolding at the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), an industry watchdog that consists of planters, companies and NGOs.  While awaiting those rules, Sime Darby has stopped planting palm in Liberia, Parker said. Singapore-listed Olam International in Gabon has also paused development on all but grassland areas until the rules are published, said Ranveer Chauhan, its managing director of edible oils.  But back at corporate headquarters in Kuala Lumpur, Sime says it is trying out a new method using satellite data to measure a forest’s carbon content so it can tell exactly how much land it can and cannot develop.  “A new plan for land development in Liberia is currently being prepared following the completion of these trials,” Sime’s chief sustainability officer Simon Lord told Reuters. Darrel Webber, chief executive officer at the RSPO secretariat in Malaysia, said he cannot comment with the review under way “and no conclusive decisions on the changes have been made yet”.  The rules are expected to come to a vote at RSPO’s annual meeting in November. Concerns about the amount of forests and peatlands cleared for plantations - and the greenhouse gases that are then emitted into the atmosphere - have plagued the palm oil industry for years.      Over the past decade, consumer activist groups have pressed big palm oil buyers such as Pepsico, Unilever and Nestle with supermarket boycotts and other protests over palm oil’s perceived links to climate change. Many companies are willing to pay a premium price for palm oil labelled with a valued RSPO sustainability certificate. The new rules will decide if land can be cleared for palm based on its carbon content. A dense forest might hold up to 150 tonnes of carbon per hectare, grassland about 35 tonnes.  If the RSPO decides an area holding above 100 tonnes an hectare is off limits, then Sime Darby may be unable to develop most of its Liberia concession, said Ahmad Rifqi, Sime Darby’s  manager of plantation sustainability in Liberia. “Almost all here is over 100 tonnes per hectare. The only low-carbon areas are farmlands already cultivated by local communities,” he said.  Sime Darby boasts of being the world’s biggest producer of sustainable palm oil. It has an online “dashboard” displaying information about its supply chain and compliance with RSPO rules.  It’s land bank of nearly 990,000 hectares, an area larger than Puerto Rico, makes it the world’s largest palm plantation firm by land size. The Liberia concessions account for over a fifth of that. With governments and companies under increasing pressure to adhere to higher deforestation standards, “greenfield” expansions in Southeast Asia have become uncommon, says Ivy Ng, regional head of plantations research at CIMB Investment Bank in Kuala Lumpur.	         “In recent years, company expansion is largely via buying stakes of other companies,” Ng said. Sime Darby’s only major expansion in Southeast Asia since its 2007 merger with two other large plantation firms has been its acquisition of New Britain Palm Oil in Papua New Guinea in 2015.      Oil palm originated in West Africa and was used there for thousands of years. And with global demand growing by an average 5 percent a year, growers had looked to Africa to expand.     Yet production in Africa has grown by less than 4 percent since 2012, compared to around 18.5 percent for Southeast Asia and globally. Latin America is now the number two producing region. From a watchtower on Sime Darby’s Liberian plantation, low lines of palm can be seen trailing to the horizon, a duller green than the natural forest canopy that towers above the concession’s edge.  The serene view belies a cascade of troubles. Local residents, who claimed Sime had encroached on community ands, set up roadblocks to halt workers and stole keys from bulldozers, community leaders and workers told Reuters. Sime says the land came from a government concession. But to appease residents, it built schools and offers free medical services to workers and their families.     Its own ambitions, meanwhile, have shrunk.  A new mill that doesn’t have enough fruit to press into oil to run at full capacity and crop theft by local residents costs the company about 20 percent of its harvest in some areas, Parker said.  Sime hopes to plant another 10,000 hectares once it can show the first 10,000 are profitable, Parker said. “Sime Darby is committed to the long term - if we can make a profit on the first 10,000 hectares.”  Reporting By Edward McAllister in GBAH, Liberia and Emily Chow in Kuala Lumpur",https://uk.reuters.com/article/palmoil-sime-darby-africa/focus-sime-darbys-africa-ambitions-stall-pending-new-deforestation-rules-idUKL3N1PA4F9,14 Feb 2018,"* New rules expected by November on planting in forested

It was aided by expectations German GDP data later Wednesday would show strong growth. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was down at 89.722 having shed 0.5 percent overnight. Analysts said investors were becoming nervous about the prospect of swelling U.S. budget and trade deficits given the passage of huge tax cuts and spending plans. “The re-emergence of the twin deficit should send shivers down the dollar’s spine,” said Mark McCormick, North American head of FX strategy at TD Securities. He noted the IMF had estimated that a 1 percent rise in the budget deficit led to a 0.6 percent increase in the U.S. current account deficit. That suggested the twin deficit could exceed 7 percent of GDP by the end of the decade, all of which had to be funded by offshore money. “Those numbers do not bode well for the greenback in the medium-term,” concluded McCormick. The drop in the dollar gave a fillip to commodities, with copper boasting a hefty 2.7 percent jump. Spot gold edged up to $1,331.86 per ounce, leaving behind last week’s one-month low of $1,306.81. Oil prices dipped after data showed a surprisingly large increase in U.S. crude stockpiles. The International Energy Agency on Tuesday said a rise in global oil production, led by the United States, is likely to outpace growth in demand this year. U.S. crude futures eased 22 cents in early trade to $58.97 a barrel. Brent futures were yet to trade at $62.72.
