2018-03-06,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - East Timor and Australia signed a treaty at the United Nations in New York on Tuesday to resolve a long-running dispute over their maritime border and struck a deal on how to share revenue from the offshore Greater Sunrise gas field.     East Timor will receive a bigger share of the revenue than Australia depending on the development concept - 70 percent of the revenue if the gas is piped to the tiny country or 80 percent if the gas is piped to Australia for processing. The agreement also establishes a maritime boundary in the Timor Sea for the first time. Australia had sought a boundary aligned with its continental shelf, but East Timor argued the border should lie half way between it and Australia - placing much of the Greater Sunrise field under its control. “With this treaty we open a new chapter in relations between Australia and Timor-Leste,” said Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who signed the treaty alongside East Timor’s Deputy Minister of the Prime Minister for the Delimitation of Borders Hermenegildo Augusto Cabral Pereira. The protracted dispute had led the owners of Greater Sunrise - Woodside Petroleum, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell and Japan’s Osaka Gas - to shelve the project. The Greater Sunrise field is estimated to hold 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas and 226 million barrels of condensates, which analysts have previously estimated could be worth $40 billion. However, development could be at least a decade away, with Woodside looking at the latter half of the next decade. Australian Associated Press reported shortly before the signing ceremony that East Timor had accused Australia of colluding with the oil companies to have the gas piped to Australia for processing. “Australia rejects absolutely any suggestion that we have acted other than in utmost good faith throughout this conciliation process,” Bishop told reporters at the United Nations.  “The way is now clear for Timor-Leste, as the majority beneficiary of the division of the resource, to find a way with the joint venture partners to develop Greater Sunrise in an economically viable fashion,” she said.  East Timor had been pushing hard for the building of an onshore processing plant to boost its economy. Bishop said Australia does not have a position and that the main concern was that any project was economically viable.  “It’s a conciliation process, it was never meant to be easy. We had ups and downs in this 22, 23 months,” said Pereira, adding that the focus should be on Tuesday’s treaty signing.   Ending years of opposition, Australia agreed in 2017 to accept Dili’s formal notice to terminate an agreement to split petroleum revenue equally from Greater Sunrise and set a 50-year timetable for negotiating a permanent sea boundary. Dili had taken the long-running maritime border dispute to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, an intergovernmental organization based at The Hague, which ordered compulsory arbitration between the two parties.

White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, seen as a bulwark against protectionist forces within the Trump administration, said on Tuesday he was leaving. S&P 500 futures dropped more than one percent in early Wednesday trade. In the currency market, the dollar fell as much as 0.6 percent against the yen to 105.48 yen, near its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar also shed 0.4 percent to 0.9365 franc, while the euro ticked 0.15 percent to $1.2422. “The worst outcome for financial markets, in terms of potential to create volatility, would be a confirmation of rising trade friction and benign neglect of the dollar in the short term,” said analysts at ANZ. The Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso tumbled as Cohn’s departure was seen as raising risks Washington could walk out of NAFTA. The Canadian dollar fell 0.4 percent to C$1.2920 per dollar while the Mexican peso dropped 0.6 percent to 18.85 to the dollar. Cohn’s resignation poured cold water on a recovery in risk appetite following news on Tuesday that South Korea would hold its first summit with the North in more than a decade.

2018-03-06,"(Adds details on oil cooperation, Petrocaribe and Mexico background) By John Myers Jr. KINGSTON, March 6 (Reuters) - Mexico is looking into ways to deepen energy cooperation with Jamaica, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Tuesday on a Caribbean trip to promote U.S.-backed efforts to erode Venezuela’s diplomatic influence. Videgaray said he was hoping to get more Mexican firms to come to Jamaica as suppliers of oil and as potential investors in developing Jamaican oil resources. Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that Mexico, Canada and the United States were looking at how to mitigate the effect sanctions on OPEC-member Venezuela would have in the Caribbean. Videgaray, who visited St. Lucia before Jamaica, said deeper Mexican-Jamaican energy ties could serve as a model elsewhere in the island region. “Whatever we do in Jamaica can be a learning experience for what we do with other Caribbean countries,” he said, without directly mentioning efforts to weaken Venezuela’s support among countries grateful for past oil largesse. While Jamaica no longer imports Venezuelan crude, it was a founding member of the South American nation’s Petrocaribe program that provided cheap loans for oil to Caribbean nations. The legacy of the program has helped Venezuela win votes in the Organization of American States to defeat motions against President Nicolas Maduro, whose socialist government has overseen an economic crisis in Venezuela. Mexico’s oil output has fallen sharply and the energy ministry has said it would be difficult for the country to replace Petrocaribe. “We are a market-based economy and any kind of cooperation that we do, and any business that we foster, is according to market principles,” said Videgaray, standing next to his Jamaican counterpart Kamina Johnson Smith. He added Mexico would be signing a memorandum of understanding to provide technical support to Jamaica’s oil refinery, Petrojam, which is jointly owned by a unit of Venezuelan national oil company PDVSA. Jamaica already buys spot cargos of crude from Mexico, a major oil supplier to the United States. Mexico has been gradually opening up its oil sector following a constitutional reform in 2013 that ended decades of monopoly control by national oil company Pemex. Its ability to maximize crude processing has been hobbled, however, by little new investment, accidents and natural disasters.

2018-03-06,"CARACAS (Reuters) - The Venezuela government will start auctioning its new petro cryptocurrency to private companies via its Dicom foreign exchange platform in a few weeks, Vice President Tareck El Aissami said on Tuesday. The OPEC country last month began selling the new digital token, which President Nicolas Maduro has said will be backed by oil reserves, in a private sale to investors. Maduro says the petro will help skirt U.S. financial sanctions. Opposition critics call the petro an illegal debt issue, and the U.S. Treasury Department has warned that it may violate sanctions and thus constitutes a legal risk for investors. “The petro is going to be auctioned on Dicom,” El Aissami said in a meeting with businessmen broadcast on state television, adding that companies will be able to use petros to pay for imports of raw materials.  “The petro is going to be our powerful international currency, above the dollar.” It is not immediately evident if and how the petro can function as foreign currency or how it would help Venezuelan businesses with international commerce transactions.  Foreign companies are unlikely to accept it as payment given the legal doubts surrounding it, and few investors have publicly announced having purchased it. El Aissami also called on local banks to buy the petro at a discount during the preliminary phase, which ends on March 20. During this phase, petros can be acquired with “dollars, euros or any other currency,” he said, and may be held by banks as assets on their balance sheets.

2018-03-06,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy executives say the Trump administration’s proposed steel and aluminum tariffs could bump up the cost of big-ticket projects needed for rapidly rising U.S. shale oil and gas output by three to 10 percent. Higher construction costs could slow growth in production and exports of crude and natural gas from shale that has made the United States the world’s largest gas producer and second largest oil producer. President Donald Trump’s proposal is emerging as a potential spoiler for new U.S. pipelines, drilling rigs, offshore platforms and refineries to handle coming oil and gas production. Companies including Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) and others have outlined tens of billions of dollars of new steel-intensive petrochemical and pipeline expansions in the United States. The administration has not yet formally unveiled its plan. It is unclear whether exemptions would be available for certain sectors, or for steel from places such as Canada, the biggest foreign provider of the metal to the United States. U.S. trading partners have said they could counter tariffs with their own levies on U.S. exports. If the proposed tariffs were in place when natural gas company Freeport LNG was building its first three liquefied natural gas (LNG) production lines, they would have raised the multi-billion dollar construction cost by about $200 million, or between 3.5 percent and 5 percent, Chief Executive Michael Smith said in an interview. Freeport LNG is in the process of building a fourth production line at the LNG plant in Texas. Steel tariffs would affect the economics of the plant but not deter the company from building it, Smith said on the sidelines of an industry gathering in Houston. If the tariffs lead to a trade war with China, then Freeport LNG could suffer because China is among the long-term buyers for the gas, he said. U.S. export capacity was less than 2 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) in 2015, and is expected to top 77 Mtpa by 2022, which would make it the world’s No. 2 exporter behind Australia. Steel accounts for as much as 30 percent of new drilling project costs. While higher costs would not halt new drilling in U.S. shale fields, “it could slow it down,” Jim Burkhard, vice president of oil research for consultancy IHS Markit, said in an interview. Benchmark U.S. steel prices hit a seven-year high on Monday, according to data provider S&P Global Platts.  Last month, Turkey’s Borusan Mannesmann said it would provide about half the steel for the Gulf Coast Express pipeline, a $1 billion Kinder Morgan project to move nearly 2 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Permian to Texas Gulf Coast. Kinder Morgan declined to comment on the pipeline suppliers. When the proposal was first announced, sources at Exxon Mobil told Reuters that increased costs from tariffs could affect the company’s plans to build another crude oil distillation unit at its Baytown refinery that would make it the largest in the United States. The proposal is part of a $20 billion expansion of several refining and petrochemical complexes along the U.S. Gulf in coming years. Since 2010, $85 billion worth of petrochemical projects have been started or completed across the United States. The shale production boom has overcome bigger hurdles, including the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’  efforts to stem its rise a few years ago by flooding the market with oil. U.S. energy production is projected to reach 13.2 million barrels of oil per day in 2023, up from an average of 9.3 million bpd last year, IHS estimates.  Some pipeline projects could be hamstrung if developers cannot buy parts made outside of the United States, said Greg Armstrong, CEO of energy storage and transport company Plains All American Pipeline (PAA.N). His firm has about $1.5 billion in steel-intensive projects on the drawing board, and some of the steel required is not made domestically.  “It’s a thornier issue than is printed in the headlines,” said Armstrong. “If you can’t get what you need, you kind of have to go somewhere else” outside the United States, he said.

The carrier dropped an earlier order of Airbus A330neos to go with the Boeing series.   “We ran a competitive process between two great aircraft types. It was a complex decision that factored in many aspects of aircraft capability, passenger experience, fleet complexity and the total lifetime cost of ownership, and the 787 came out on top,” Hawaiian spokesman Alex Da Silva said.

2018-03-06,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Pioneer Natural Resources Co Chief Executive Tim Dove on Tuesday said proposed U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum would negatively impact his shale oil production company’s profits. Dove’s remarks echoed several other energy executives who this week said they faced higher costs from tariffs, and said there are certain types of metal that are not made by U.S. companies. Pipeline and refining expansions could be revisited if the tariffs significantly raise costs.  The Trump administration has proposed putting a 25 percent tariff on steel and 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports to support U.S. metal producers and manufacturing jobs. “I hope there will be some focus on what this tariff will actually end up being. It will be impactful in a negative way on our returns,” Dove said during a panel discussion at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. Sara Ortwein, president of Exxon Mobil Corp’s XTO Energy shale business, also said the oil and gas industry “is really the engine behind the economic growth in the U.S. Clearly anything that limits that is not something that we’re looking for.” Pioneer’s Dove said he attended a dinner on Monday with OPEC officials and shale executives where rising global demand for oil was central to the conversation. It was the second time in two years that the two rivals have met in Houston.  “It’s the shale producers, it’s the OPEC producers, it’s the non-OPEC producers that are going to be needed to make sure we fill that demand as we go through the next many years,” Dove said. “I think shale has an important role to play, and I think that was acknowledged last night.” Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Tom Brown and Susan Thomas",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ceraweek-energy-pioneer-natl-rsc/ceraweek-u-s-metals-tariff-would-hurt-future-returns-shale-company-ceo-idUKL2N1QO26A,06 Mar 2018,"Pioneer Natural Resources Co

2018-03-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday, supported by a weaker dollar but U.S. crude’s gains were limited by expectations for a weekly rise in U.S. crude stockpiles. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 25 cents to settle at $65.79 a barrel, a 0.4 percent gain. Brent reached a low of $65.30 a barrel and a six-day high of $66.16 a barrel during the session. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 3 cents to settle at $62.60 a barrel. WTI notched its own six-day high at $63.28 a barrel. Oil prices fell in post-settlement trade after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude inventories rose by 5.7 million barrels last week, a bigger-than-expected rise. Oil drew support as the U.S. dollar fell to its lowest in more than a week against a basket of currencies on news from South Korea that North Korea was willing to hold talks with the United States on denuclearization, and would suspend nuclear tests during any discussions.  South Korea also said it would hold a summit with North Korea for the first time in more than a decade. The news led investors to sell the U.S. dollar and instead buy riskier assets such as commodities. The dollar index last was down by half a percent. A weaker greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for holders of other currencies. “If you reduce geopolitical risk in the world, it might be a better place to do business and that could be bullish,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. U.S. oil prices were under pressure from expectations that weekly crude inventory data from the U.S. government, due on Wednesday, would show a second straight rise. Analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the data on average expect U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.7 million barrels in the week ended March 2. Inventories are rising during the seasonal maintenance period for refineries, when shutdowns mean they need less crude. A surge in U.S. crude production to more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) has helped the country overtake top exporter Saudi Arabia. Output hit a record 10.057 million bpd in November, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report it expected fourth-quarter U.S. crude output to reach an average of 11.17 million bpd, up from its forecast a month ago of 11.04 million bpd. The continued growth of U.S. shale has been a theme at the CERAWeek conference in Houston this week, said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.  Brent had dipped closer to $65 in earlier trading, pressured by the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) warning on Monday that U.S. oil output was set to surge over the coming five years. The prospect of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-member producers, including Russia, maintaining crude output cuts in the face of a boom in U.S. shale production helped lift Brent back above $65 a barrel this week. April U.S. gasoline futures RBc1 rose as much as 0.50 percent to hit $1.9443 a gallon, the highest since Jan. 30, before retreating.

2018-03-06,"* Mohammed bin Salman on first official trip as crown prince * Will meet queen, top officials on three-day London visit * Anti-war protesters to target Saudis and Brits over Yemen By William James LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Britain’s grand welcome for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman will begin on Wednesday with a lunch with Queen Elizabeth, as the two countries seek to widen longstanding defence ties into a far-reaching partnership. Both sense an opportunity to broaden their existing relationship: Britain is looking for trading partners as it exits the European Union, and Saudi Arabia needs to convince sceptical investors about its domestic reforms. But as Prince Mohammed and Prime Minister Theresa May meet, demonstrators will protest both countries’ roles in Yemen where war has killed an estimated 10,000 people and where 8.3 million people depend on food aid and 400,000 children have life-threatening levels of malnutrition. Inside May’s Downing Street offices the two leaders will launch a “UK-Saudi Strategic Partnership Council” - an initiative to encourage Saudi Arabia’s economic reforms and foster more cooperation on issues such as education and culture, as well as defence and security. “It will usher in a new era of bilateral relations, focused on a partnership that delivers wide-ranging benefits for both of us,” May’s spokesman told reporters. Britain is vying to land the stock market listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, but no decision is expected this week. Later this month Prince Mohammed visits the United States, which also wants the lucrative listing, although sources said both countries may miss out. British officials were privately delighted at the decision by Prince Mohammed, 32, to choose Britain as the major western destination on his first foreign trip since becoming heir to the Saudi throne last year. The British government is keen to transform its historic defence relationship into two-way trade and investment, eyeing both an expanded market in Saudi Arabia for service sector exports, and attracting Saudi cash to finance domestic projects. Business deals are possible with British defence group BAE Systems and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and other industries, according to British and Saudi sources. The three-day visit will include two audiences with the British Royal family, a briefing with national security officials, and a prestigious visit to the prime minister’s country residence. May intends to use the private dinner at Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London, to bring up concerns over the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, her spokesman said. A Saudi-led military coalition is fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen, generating what the United Nation said in January was the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. “You can expect them to discuss Yemen, and the prime minister to raise deep concerns at the humanitarian situation,” May’s spokesman said. “She will also reiterate how seriously we take allegations of violations against international humanitarian law.” Speaking to reporters in London on Monday, Saudi foreign minister Adel al-Jubeir said his country had failed to effectively communicate the reasons behind its involvement in Yemen, but that they had not chosen to start the war. Protestors are planning to target the Saudi officials over Yemen and other human rights issues, and Britain for licensing 4.6 billion pounds of weapons sales to Saudi Arabia since 2015. Buses have spent two days touring London with banners accusing Prince Mohammed of war crimes, with more planned for Wednesday ahead of the main rally. “It is vital that people show up to the protest tomorrow outside Downing Street to make clear that the UK government’s complicity in the war on Yemen is not supported by the public and that we demand a peaceful and humane foreign policy,” said Lindsey German of the Stop the War Coalition.

2018-03-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar touched a two-week low on Tuesday as traders bet on riskier currencies on new signs of a thaw in relations between North and South Korea and the North’s willingness to discuss denuclearization with the United States.  North and South Korea, still technically at war since 1953 but with tensions having eased since the Winter Olympics hosted by the South last month, will hold their first summit in more than a decade next month, South Korea said on Tuesday. It also said the North would suspend nuclear tests while proposed talks with the United States on denuclearization were under way. But the U.S. stock market focused on concerns over a possible trade war after U.S. President Donald Trump announced planned tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum last week. The major indexes eked out small gains on Tuesday as investors weighed mixed signals from Washington. Republican lawmakers stepped up calls for Trump to pull back from the tariffs as key trading partner Mexico rejected a bid by Washington to drive a wedge between it and Canada in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, while Trump reiterated his plan to go ahead with the tariffs. The U.S. dollar, seen as a safe haven against risk in recent months, fell further after news of the North and South Korea talks as investors bought the Australian and New Zealand dollars and some emerging market currencies. “It’s too early to wholeheartedly buy these currencies because of the chances of escalating trade tension between the U.S. and its trading partners,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell 0.56 percent, up 0.04 percent after touching its lowest level since Feb. 20. The euro rose 0.57 percent to $1.2405.  The Japanese yen weakened 0.02 percent versus the greenback, to 106.16 per dollar, while sterling was at $1.3888, up 0.02 percent. Traders await clues on monetary policy direction when the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan hold policy meetings on Thursday and Friday. “The strength of the euro is starting to put pressure on the euro-zone economy. This is putting pressure on the ECB,” said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia. Stocks edged higher in Europe, as well as in the United States, while a global gauge of major equity markets was  boosted largely by gains in Asia after stocks there were battered Monday on concerns over a global trade war. Those worries eased during U.S. market hours on Monday, so Asian equities were catching up. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 rose for a third straight session, though it was unclear what Trump’s final decision on tariffs would be. “The market is basically grasping for straws around what the (tariff) policy is going to be. Based on the action we saw today it’s hoping it doesn’t turn into a trade war,” said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders Investment Management in New York, adding that the news out of the Korean peninsula “helps around the margin.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 9.36 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,884.12, the S&P 500 gained 7.18 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,728.12, and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.30 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,372.01. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.10 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.65 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.51 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.67 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.79 percent to snap a four-day losing run. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed in choppy trading as optimism grew that Trump may back down from his proposed tariffs, even though he said he would not. Trump’s suggestion that Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new North American Free Trade Agreement was reached drove market participants to see his tariff plan as leverage in NAFTA talks. “It does seem as though Trump has laid out the fact that he’s using these tariffs as a negotiating tactic,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.  Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8863 percent, from 2.879 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last fell 2/32 in price to yield 3.1531 percent, from 3.151 percent late on Monday. Treasuries prices were also pressured by strong demand for CVS Health’s $40 billion M&A bond, which gave a shot of confidence to the U.S. high-grade bond market Tuesday after a recent bout of volatility in the usually rock-solid asset class. U.S. crude fell 0.19 percent to $62.45 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.66, up 0.18 percent. U.S. crude fell in post-settlement trading after crude inventories rose by 5.7 million barrels compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 2.7 million barrels, data from the American Petroleum Institute showed up 0.03 percent Gold rallied on the weaker dollar.

2018-03-06,"(Updates prices, comments) * Crude prices wobble alongside risk appetite * Gold up as greenback weakens * Japan stocks rally; Asia boosts emerging market equities By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped to a two-week low on Tuesday as traders bet on riskier currencies on news North and South Korea would hold their first summit in more than a decade and after the South said the North was willing to discuss denuclearization with the United States. North and South Korea, still technically at war since 1953 but with tensions having eased since the Winter Olympics hosted by the South last month, will hold their first summit in more than a decade next month, South Korea said on Tuesday. It added that the North would suspend nuclear tests while proposed talks with the United States on denuclearization were underway. The impact of the news on stock markets was clouded by concern over a possible trade war, triggered by tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum proposed last week by U.S. President Donald Trump. But Republican lawmakers stepped up calls for Trump to pull back from those tariffs as key trading partner Mexico rejected a bid by Washington to drive a wedge between it and Canada in talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The U.S. dollar, seen as a safe haven against risk in recent months, fell further after news of the North and South Korea talks as investors bought the Australian and New Zealand dollars and some emerging market currencies. “It’s too early to wholeheartedly buy these currencies because of the chances of escalating trade tension between U.S. and its trading partners,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other major currencies, fell 0.51 percent, with the euro up 0.54 percent to $1.2402. The dollar index touched its lowest since Feb. 20. The Japanese yen weakened 0.01 percent versus the greenback to 106.24 per dollar, while sterling was at $1.3885, up 0.27 percent on the day. Traders await clues on monetary policy direction after European Central Bank and Bank of Japan policy-makers meet on Thursday and Friday. “The strength of the euro is starting to put pressure on the euro zone economy. This is putting pressure on the ECB,” said Jack McIntyre, portfolio manager at Brandywine Global in Philadelphia. Stocks edged higher in Europe and rose slightly in the United States, while a global gauge of major equity markets was boosted largely by gains in Asia after stocks were battered Monday on concerns over a global trade war. Those worries eased during U.S. market hours on Monday, so Asian equities were catching up. On Wall Street, trade war worries ebbed, lifting the S&P 500 for a third straight session, though it was unclear what Trump’s final decision on tariffs would be. “The market is basically grasping for straws around what the (tariff) policy is going to be. Based on the action we saw today it’s hoping it doesn’t turn into a trade war,” said Jonathan Mackay, investment strategist at Schroders Investment Management in New York, adding that the news out of the Korean peninsula “helps around the margin.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 29.2 points, or 0.12 percent, to 24,903.96, the S&P 500 gained 7.86 points, or 0.29 percent, to 2,728.8 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.92 points, or 0.54 percent, to 7,370.62. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.10 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.69 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.82 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.9 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.79 percent. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed in choppy trading as optimism grew that Trump may back down from his proposed tariffs, even though he said he would not. His suggestion that Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was reached drove market participants to see his tariffs talk as leverage in NAFTA talks. “It does seem as though Trump has laid out the fact that he’s using these tariffs as a negotiating tactic,” said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities in New York.

2018-03-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s foreign minister on Tuesday sidestepped questions on whether his country should end weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates because they were being used in Yemen, saying that Iran also had “lots” of weapons there.  The kingdom is leading a coalition formed in 2015 to fight the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa, in a war that has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million. The French administration under President Emmanuel Macron has drawn criticism in particular from rights groups over its support of the kingdom’s actions and allowing weapons it has sold to Riyadh potentially to be used in its Yemen operations. When asked specifically why France continued to sell weapons to Saudi and the Emirates in the current context, Jean-Yves Le Drian skirted the issue and said the priority was to find a political solution to the Yemen crisis. “I’m really worried by the situation in Yemen,” Le Drian told parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “It’s an absurd war. It’s true that there are Saudi weapons, but would you believe it there are Iranian weapons too, lots (of them).”  Iran has denied supplying the Houthis weapons. The two Gulf Arab states are among France’s main weapons’ clients receiving tanks, armoured vehicles, munitions, artillery and in the case of the Emirates, fighter jets.  Unlike some European states, Paris has shown no concrete signs of reducing or suspending sales to the Saudi-led coalition despite warnings that some of its weapons could be used in the war in Yemen, sources aware of the issue have said. However, Paris has grown increasingly concerned by the worsening humanitarian situation and in December Macron called for a “complete lifting” of a Saudi blockade on Yemen. “The problem is the sovereignty of the states that commit their own armies to an absurd conflict, and we hope that ... we will quickly (re-)start the political solution, because it is probably the crisis in the region that would be easiest to resolve if there was the political will on all sides.” Reporting by John Irish, Editing by William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/yemen-security-france/skirting-saudi-arms-sales-france-says-iran-has-lots-of-weapons-in-yemen-idUKL5N1QO6JG,06 Mar 2018,"France's foreign minister on

2018-03-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - French hydropower firm CNR, anticipating the impact of climate change and the possible disappearance of glaciers in the Swiss Alps, plans to sharply increase its solar and wind capacity to compensate for lower water levels on the Rhone river. The Rhone, running from Lake Geneva to the French Mediterranean, is one of Europe’s biggest rivers but also one of the most exposed to climate change as it is fed mainly by Alpine glaciers, which are shrinking due to global warming.  An exceptional drought last year reduced water flow by 27 percent and reduced electricity production at the Compagnie Nationale du Rhone (CNR) hydropower group by the same percentage to 10.7 terawatthours, compared to 17.4 TWh in record year 2013. Some scientists forecast the Rhone’s flow to fall by 10 to 40 percent in coming decades and also see more violent swings in flow rates as droughts alternate with floods.  “Scientists say the Alps’ glaciers could disappear by the end of the century. That does not mean they will, but we must act responsibly,” CNR CEO Elisabeth Ayrault told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing for energy reporters.  To make up for this, CNR plans to boost its renewables capacity five-fold. “Our plan is to have as much capacity away from the river as on the river, probably by 2035,” she said.  CNR has 3,035 megawatt (MW) of hydropower capacity - making it France’s second-biggest hydropower producer after EDF - and has already built some 600 MW of mainly wind and some solar power since 2015.  By 2020, it wants to boost that to 1,000 MW and then accelerate renewables investment with a further 1,500 MW in 2020-25 to eventually reach 3,000 MW of renewables capacity. Ayrault said the problem was not just slower flow rates but also increasing volatility. Last year’s drought was followed by three major floods in December-January. Floods also weigh on output, as CNR is forced to open dams to evacuate excess water.  “What is worrying is the huge swings in river flow. We no longer have the regularity we had before,” she said.  Ayrault said the irregular flow also affects other industries, such as nuclear energy, agriculture and shipping.  In the past 18 months, France twice had to ask Switzerland to increase the outflow of Lake Geneva to ensure sufficient cooling water for the Bugey nuclear plant, she said.  Owned 49.97 percent by gas utility Engie, 33.2 percent by state financial group Caisse des Depots and 16.83 percent by local authorities, CNR accounts for 25 percent of French hydropower output and has a monopoly on Rhone river hydropower under a concession that runs till 2023.

2018-03-06,"SOFIA, March 6 (Reuters) - Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Krasimir Karakachanov said on Tuesday that Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova’s resignation would not be accepted. Last month Petkova tendered her resignation to Prime Minister Boyko Borissov following media reports she was linked to the owners of Inercom, a small company slated to buy Czech utility’s CEZ’s assets in Bulgaria. A few hours later Borissov said he would accept Petkova’s resignation despite saying the government “had not influenced that deal in any way”. On Tuesday, however, Bulgaria’s government performed a U-turn, saying Petkova has no reason to quit and would keep her post. “Temenuzhka Petkova’s resignation would not be accepted,” Karakachanov, who is also defence minister, said, adding the decision had been taken at a meeting with the participation of most of the ministers in the centre-right government. The deal prompted concerns across the political spectrum that strategic energy assets in the European Union country were passing into the hands of owners about which little was known. Inercom, with assets worth around 100 million levs ($63 million), is set to acquire a business with annual turnover of about 1.8 billion levs ($1.1 billion) that operates one third of the Balkan country’s power grid. On Tuesday Inercom’s owner Ginka Varbakova started talks with CEZ in Prague over final approval of the sale as well as the potential Bulgarian state involvement in the deal. CEZ said talks on both points would continue until the end week. Borissov, who has previously dismissed opposition Socialists’ calls for the state to buy back private energy assets, said the government was considering legal changes that would allow the state to have a say in similar deals despite objections from analysts and political parties, including Bulgaria’s ethnic Turkish MRF. Last week Borissov urged the central bank and intelligence services to look into the deal, estimated to cost about 320 million euros. Inercom has said it will be financed by bank loans, but has declined to elaborate. The Socialist party (BSP), the largest opposition party in the ex-communist country, has started a campaign against the CEZ sale, saying the Bulgarian state should be able to try and buy the power distributor and compete on the market. BSP also initiated a petition to stop the deal and asked the chief prosecutor to check the origins of the funds with which Inercom plans to complete the deal. BSP will take part in a protest against CEZ sale in Sofia on Wednesday. Energy prices are politically sensitive in the EU’s poorest member state, and a spike in electricity bills in 2013 toppled Borissov’s first government.

2018-03-06,"* Battery sector seen using 500,000 T nickel/year by 2025 * Nornickel fixes quality issue that hit cobalt sales * Russian firm still eyes new projects amid shareholder row * Company seeks to reduce palladium stockpile in first half (Adds battery industry demand, cobalt sales, palladium stockpiles) By Polina Devitt MOSCOW, March 6 (Reuters) - Russian mining firm Norilsk Nickel said on Tuesday rising use of batteries in electric vehicles would create strong demand for nickel from the 2020s. Nornickel, which vies with Brazil’s Vale SA to be the world’s biggest nickel producer, said the battery industry would use more than 500,000 tonnes a year of the metal by 2025. It said this “equals almost half of the current consumption of Class 1 nickel”, referring to the highest quality nickel that is now mainly used as an ingredient to produce stainless steel. Nornickel, which is well positioned to benefit from the rise in electric vehicles as it mines cobalt which is also used in battery production, sold 215,000 tonnes of nickel in 2017. It sold 3,000 tonnes of cobalt in 2017, down from 5,000 tonnes in 2016, citing “a problem with its quality” that Nornickel said had been fixed. It said it would work to reduce its cobalt stockpile soon. “The forthcoming shift in favour of more nickel-intensive technologies in battery cathode material alongside the growing share of electric vehicles ... should drive up strongly the demand for Class 1 nickel products towards 2025,” it said. It made the comments in its financial statement for 2017, in which the firm reported 2 percent growth in its core earnings in 2017 thanks to higher prices for its metals. Its shares dipped 0.3 percent in line with the broader MICEX index, as investors remained focussed on conflict between Nornickel’s biggest shareholders, Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin and aluminium producer Rusal. The dispute partly revolves around whether the firm should deliver a big dividend or focus on robust capital spending. The company said on Tuesday its board would issue a recommendation for its final dividend for 2017 in April or May The firm’s 2018 capital expenditure is set at $2 billion and it continues to consider several projects in Russia. Nornickel is also the world’s top producer of palladium, which is chiefly used in emission-curbing auto catalysts. The metal was Nornickel’s largest revenue generator in 2017 as prices soared on fears of shortages. The company said it did not see any immediate threat to palladium from electric vehicles, forecasting the market deficit to widen to 1.2 million troy ounces this year. Nornickel said its 2017 earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $4.0 billion were held back by several factors, including the accumulation of palladium stock to deliver under 2018 contracts. Nornickel accumulated the stockpile of more than 500,000 ounces of palladium at the end of 2017, it said, adding that it planned to sell the bulk of that by the end of June to meet the rising demand from its customers.

The No.2 U.S. oil producer’s shares rose as much as 2 percent after Chevron cut $2 billion off the top-end of its capital spending plans and promised, cashflow permitting, to return to share buybacks for the first time since 2015. The company now expects to invest between $18 billion and $20 billion each year until 2020, compared to an earlier forecast of $17 billion to $22 billion and reassured investors paying dividends remained a top priority. Chief Executive Michael Wirth said he planned to generate extra free cash by selling off assets, producing more oil at higher margins and cutting expenses, as U.S. oil firms ramp up production in response to a recovery of crude prices. “We intend to maintain capital discipline,” he said in a statement. “Even with no (further) commodity price appreciation, we expect to deliver stronger upstream cash margins and production growth. This is a powerful combination,”  Chevron, which said it intended to raise free cash flow “in 2018 and thereafter,” said only that buybacks would start “as we generate surplus cash”. The company said it would increase output of high-margin barrels of oil by more than 200 mboe/d in 2018.  Production in its low-cost shale acreage in the Permian basin in New Mexico and Texas, was expected to reach about 500,000 barrels per day by the end of 2020 and 650,000 by the end of 2022.  The 2018 production estimate excluded asset sales and was based on oil prices at $60 a barrel, versus $66 for Brent crude and $62 for U.S. light crude on Tuesday. “Our initial takeaway from Chevron’s annual analyst day are positive with the company providing encouraging production guidance beyond 2020 while also tightening the range in forward capital spending,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel wrote in a note. “This adds confidence to our view that the steep ramp up in Chevron’s cash generation will be a key driver of the stock, leading to incremental shareholder returns.” The company’s shares were up about 1 percent at $114.33 in afternoon trading.

2018-03-06,"(Updates prices, changes comment, dateline; previous LONDON) * Crude prices wobble with risk appetite * Japan stocks rally; Asia boosts EM equities By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar dropped to a two-week low on Tuesday as traders bet on riskier currencies on news North and South Korea would hold their first summit in more than a decade and after the South said the North was willing to discuss denuclearization with the United States. The impact on stock markets of the news from the Korean Peninsula was clouded by concern over a possible trade war triggered by tariffs proposed by President Donald Trump last week on imports of steel and aluminium. North and South Korea, still technically at war but with tensions having eased since the Winter Olympics hosted by the South last month, will hold their first summit in more than a decade next month, South Korea said on Tuesday. It added that the North would suspend nuclear tests while proposed talks with the United States on denuclearization were underway. Reduced safe-haven holdings of the greenback and a renewed appetite for the Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar and emerging market currencies were limited by worries about a trade war stemming from Trump’s proposed tariffs. “It’s too early to wholeheartedly buy these currencies because of the chances of escalating trade tension between U.S. and its trading partners,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.5 percent, with the euro up 0.53 percent at $1.24. The dollar index touched its lowest since Feb. 20. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.12 percent versus the greenback to 106.07 per dollar, while sterling was at $1.3873, up 0.18 percent on the day. News on the Koreas summit also helped reduce demand for safe-haven U.S. bonds, which were trading in a tighter range after benchmark yields rose Friday and Monday. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.868 percent, from 2.879 percent late on Monday. The 30-year bond last rose 11/32 in price to yield 3.1325 percent, from 3.151 percent late on Monday. Hedging needs as CVS Health Corp announced a nine-part corporate bond sale were also seen as weighing on bonds. Stocks fell in the United States and edged higher in Europe, but a global gauge of major equity markets was up, boosted by gains in Asia after stocks were battered Monday on concerns over a global trade war. Those worries eased during U.S. market hours on Monday, so Asian equities were catching up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 105.77 points, or 0.43 percent, to 24,768.99, the S&P 500 lost 0.91 points, or 0.03 percent, to 2,720.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.73 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,352.43. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.17 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.51 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.78 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.84 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.79 percent.

2018-03-06,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The global oil and gas industry needs to invest more than $20 trillion (14.4 trillion pounds) over the next 25 years to meet expected growth in demand and compensate for the natural decline in developed fields, Saudi Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on Tuesday. Speaking at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, Nasser said the industry has already lost $1 trillion of investments since the oil price downturn from 2014 to 2016. Future investments needed “will only come if investors are convinced that oil will be allowed to compete on a level playing field, that oil is worth so much more, and that oil is here for the foreseeable future,” Nasser said. “That is why we must push back on the idea that the world can do without proven and reliable sources. We must challenge mistaken assumptions about the speed with which alternatives will penetrate markets.” He noted that about 99 percent of passenger vehicles on the road use internal combustion engines, even hybrid vehicles, and said electricity produced for battery-powered vehicles comes through power generation, which is still dominated by coal, particularly in markets like India and China. Nasser said that even with the growth of electric vehicles, increased demand from petrochemical markets over the next two decades will necessitate additional investment and need for crude oil. He noted “even conservative estimates” suggest the need for about 20 million barrels per day of new capacity in the next five years.  He said he was confident that oil market fundamentals and future demand growth would be healthy, despite significant oil price volatility and forecasts of rising shale oil production.  Nasser only briefly referenced the plans for Saudi Aramco to go public, saying it is “proceeding very well,” but the company’s shareholder, the Saudi government, will ultimately decide when and where it will be listed.  The company is expected to list the IPO domestically, but there is significant jockeying between New York, London and Hong Kong for a potential second listing. Hong Kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise, according to two sources familiar with the matter.  The decision on the venue must be taken by March or April at latest if the IPO is to list in October or November, or it could be delayed until 2019, sources familiar with the IPO discussions have said. Nasser, speaking in Houston, did not comment specifically on the timeline.

2018-03-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Russian petrochemical group Sibur is in talks with Saudi Aramco to set up a venture to produce synthetic rubber, its chief said in a move highlighting growing cooperation between OPEC leader Saudi Arabia and Russia, the biggest non-OPEC oil exporter. Russia and Saudi Arabia have forged closer ties in the past two years as part of efforts to prop up oil prices by curbing output.  The deal between OPEC and Russia has opened the door to political dialogue and has also encouraged talks on broader bilateral investment in the energy sector. “The Saudi-Russian dialogue has probably accelerated the project, even though we started discussion some four years ago,” Sibur head of management board Dmitry Konov told reporters. The two companies signed a cooperation memorandum last year when Saudi King Salman visited Russia but so far have not disclosed project details. Konov said Sibur was looking to export its synthetic rubber technology because of low feedstock availability in Russia and low domestic demand growth. Good feedstock availability in Saudi Arabia and growing Asian markets could make the project attractive, Konov said. He said the venture would likely involve other companies as it would require technologies which Sibur or Aramco do not possess.  Sibur focuses mainly on serving clients in the former Soviet Union but its exports of polymers are set to rise with the launch of a new $9 billion plant in Tobolsk in Siberia over the next couple of years. It also wants to build a major complex in east Siberia in the next decade to serve Asian markets as part of a broader plan by gas export monopoly Gazprom to supply gas to China. Konov said he saw global competition rising steeply due to the U.S. shale oil boom, which provides cheap feedstock to the local petrochemical industry. The International Energy Agency raised its outlook for U.S. shale oil growth this week, saying the country was poised to grab market share from rival OPEC and further develop its chemical industry. The IEA also said petrochemicals would become one of the main sources of global oil and gas demand growth. Konov said that despite rising U.S. output, global demand for polymers was set to grow faster than U.S. capacity additions, meaning the market was unlikely to face a significant glut any time soon. “People are more concerned about having not enough projects rather than having too many,” he said.

2018-03-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Plc (RIO.L)(RIO.AX) and two former top executives said civil fraud charges brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a failed African coal project are “plainly wrong” and should be thrown out. In a court filing late Monday night, Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott rejected SEC claims they should have written down Mozambique coal assets no more than 11 months after buying them in 2011 for $3.7 billion (2.66 billion pounds), rather than waiting 17 months. The delay enabled the big Anglo-Australian mining group to raise about $5.5 billion from U.S. investors kept in the dark about the deterioration, the SEC argued in a lawsuit filed in October with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. The defendants said that in the months after the acquisition they had reason to believe the value of the assets had actually grown by $1.2 billion, as rising prices for “scarce” coking coal helped offset lower barging and rail capacity. The market viewed the eventual $3 billion writedown as immaterial “in the context of a company with total assets of about $120 billion,” they also said, adding that the SEC did not claim that Rio Tinto’s stock or bond prices were harmed. “The SEC alleges that Rio Tinto should have taken the impairment within just 11 months of acquisition - at a time when Rio Tinto had not yet completed its analysis of the quantity and quality of available coal or determined whether there was a viable means for transporting that coal to market,” the defendants said. “The SEC is plainly wrong, and each of its claims consequently ... must be dismissed,” they added. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres set a March 19 deadline for the SEC to respond. Rio Tinto wrote off most of the assets, which it had acquired in a takeover of Riversdale Mining and later renamed Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique, in January 2013, and sold them in late 2014 for just $50 million. The Monday filing came three days after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission brought its own civil court action against Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliott over the coal assets.

2018-03-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May will hold talks with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at her country residence on Thursday, diplomatic sources said, in another sign of the importance with which London is treating his visit. The visit to Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60 km) northwest of London, will be in addition to a previously announced meeting at May’s London office on Wednesday, the sources said on Tuesday.  Prince Mohammed’s visit, part of his first foreign tour as heir apparent, is aimed at persuading Britain that his reforms have made his country a better place to invest and a more tolerant society. The trip will include lunch with the Queen, a dinner with heir to the throne Prince Charles and his son Prince William, and meetings with British intelligence chiefs. The inclusion of the prestigious trip to Chequers and two audiences with the British royal family demonstrate the extent to which London is prepared to endorse reforms in Saudi Arabia which have loosened social restrictions on women. The visit is expected to attract protests from human rights campaigners particularly over Britain’s licensing of 4.6 billion pounds worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia since the start of a conflict in Yemen where more than 10,000 people have been killed. Nevertheless, the British government is keen to use the trip to expand their longstanding alliance beyond defence and security, and into two-way trade and investment, eying both an expanded market in Saudi Arabia for service sector exports, and attracting Saudi cash to finance domestic projects. The three-day visit, and a trip to the United States later this month, could also shape Saudi Arabia’s decision on where to list oil giant Aramco - something Britain is keen to attract to the City of London - at a time when sources say the chances of London and New York hosting the IPO appear to be receding.

2018-03-06,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil services company Saipem (SPMI.MI) expects its revenues to fall this year as energy majors keep a tight grip on purse strings and pressure oil contractors’ order books. Saipem, controlled by oil major Eni (ENI.MI) and state lender CDP, said it expected sales to be around 8 billion euros (7.14 billion pounds)this year, a billion euros less than in 2017. The recent uptick in oil prices has not yet prompted oil service company clients to speed up investments despite a few timid signs of recovery in some segments, it said.  “Most oil companies are keeping their budgets flat in 2018, if not lower,” Chief Executive Stefano Cao told analysts, after the company reported an 80 percent drop in adjusted net profit for 2017. Production cuts by OPEC have helped crude prices, but recovery for oil contractors is expected to be patchy, with those finding it tougher to cut capacity and costs lagging others with more flexible business models. “The company’s outlook for the year is below expectations and that could potentially lead to consensus for 2019 coming down,” said Alessandro Pozzi, oil analyst at Mediobanca. Saipem, a market leader in subsea engineering and construction (E&C), is looking to develop new lines of business to boost order books, including floating wind power farms and dismantling oil and gas platforms, especially in the North Sea. The company, present in around 65 countries, is looking to expand its footprint in Latin America and is keen to catch opportunities in the Middle East and North Africa. Cao said he was particularly keen to restore business in Algeria after reaching a deal last month with state energy firm Sonatrach to end a legal dispute that had left it on a blacklist for new orders.  “Saipem is now in a position to access a vital market for our business,” he said. Asked about alliances and tie-ups, Cao said the company was ready to look at opportunities if they came along, including assessment of its cooperation agreement with Aker Solutions (AKSOL.OL) to develop subsea oil and gas projects. “We need to decide whether to do something more structural with Aker,” he said. Adjusted net profit last year fell to 46 million euros, far below company guidance of around 200 million euros. The adjustment strips out writedowns and restructuring and tax charges which resulted in a reported net loss of 328 million euros for the full year. Analysts, however, pointed to a good downward trend in debt which is seen at about 1.1 billion euros at the end of this year, from 1.3 billion euros at the end of last December. Saipem shares, which hit a six-month low on Monday after it said it would re-publish its 2016 accounts, fell after Tuesday’s results but later recovered to trade up 3.4 percent at 1526 GMT.

2018-03-06,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Lisin, controlling shareholder of Russian steel producer NLMK (NLMK.MM), displaced natural gas magnate Leonid Mikhelson at the top of Russia’s rich list for 2018, Forbes magazine, which compiles the list, said on Tuesday. Another steel tycoon, Alexei Mordashov, who controls NLMK’s leading competitor Severstal (CHMF.MM), retained his grip on second place. Like Lisin, his fortunes were buoyed by rising global steel prices.  Of the 2,208 billionaires included by Forbes in its global rankings this year, 102 are Russian, of whom one is a woman. Lisin, 61, is in first place and 57th worldwide, having seen his net worth increase by $3 billion to an estimated $19.1 billion as of this year, the magazine said.   Mordashov, 52, in close second with an estimated personal fortune of $18.7 billion, has enjoyed an increase of $1.2 billion since last year’s Forbes list, placing him 60th globally. Mikhelson, head of natural gas company Novatek (NVTK.MM), was pushed into third place in the Forbes list of Russian billionaires. Earlier this year, the U.S. Treasury Department published a list of 96 “oligarchs” deemed close to the Kremlin that bore a close resemblance to the Forbes rankings for 2017.  The list was published as required by a package of sanctions legislation that U.S. President Donald Trump signed into law last year. Those included on the U.S. list were not immediately subject to sanctions, but the publication cast a shadow of uncertainty over them and President Vladimir Putin labeled the list an “unfriendly act”.

2018-03-06,"RIYADH/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s crown prince wants to persuade his British and  U.S. allies that “shock” reforms have made his country a better place to invest and a more tolerant society on his first foreign tour as heir apparent. But it could be a tough sell. Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who starts talks in London on Wednesday, has won Western plaudits for seeking to reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and transform the deeply conservative, mainly Sunni Muslim kingdom.  But the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November, after Prince Mohammed ousted an older cousin as crown prince in a palace coup last June, has unnerved some investors. Though London and New York are rivals to host the partial public listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, the enthusiasm of  some Western business leaders — even for such an important contract — has been sapped by concerns about human rights and a lack of limitations on executive power in Saudi Arabia. “Investors are intrigued by MbS’s (Prince Mohammed’s) reform projects, and there will be a huge amount of interest in hearing his views, but uncertainty lingers,” said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at Chatham House think tank.   Rachel Reeves, head of an influential business committee in British parliament, warned against risking London’s reputation as a finance centre by watering down corporate governance rules to secure the Aramco listing. This, she said, could “ultimately damage our attractiveness to foreign investment.” Prince Mohammed has defended last November’s crackdown, in which dozens of top business leaders and princes were detained, as necessary to combat “the cancer of corruption”. Most detainees have now been released, and the authorities say they have arranged to seize more than $100 billion in assets. The ambitious young prince, just 32, is sure to repeat his message at talks in Britain with Prime Minister Theresa May and when he meets President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States starting on March 19. He will also have a rare audience with Queen Elizabeth and dinner with Prince Charles, the heir to the throne in Britain, after arriving from Egypt. Any visit to the London Stock Exchange — and later the New York Stock Exchange — will be watched closely by investors because of the potentially lucrative Aramco listing expected later this year.  London and New York have long been the frontrunners to host the international leg of the flotation, alongside a Riyadh listing, but Hong Kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Talks with faith leaders in Britain including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, offer Prince Mohammed an opportunity to project a more tolerant image of Saudi Arabia, sources close to the trip told Reuters. Under the reforms closely associated with the crown prince, social restrictions have been loosened, such as bans on cinemas and women driving. He has promised to promote a more moderate form of Islam. Business deals are possible with British defence group BAE Systems and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and industry, according to British and Saudi sources. They gave no details of the potential deals. Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Monday that Britain’s planned exit from the European Union did not reduce its attractiveness as an investment destination, adding: We think that Britain is one of the great powers.” British foreign minister Boris Johnson lauded security ties with “one of Britain’s oldest friends in the region” in a newspaper article last week and praised Prince Mohammed’s reforms.       But rights groups and opposition members of parliament have criticised London’s support for the prince, particularly over the licensing of 4.6 billion pounds ($6.39 billion) worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the start of the Yemen conflict. Anti-war and human rights groups plan a protest outside May’s Downing Street office on Wednesday. “Theresa May should use this visit to announce the UK will no longer supply arms to Saudi Arabia while the devastating Saudi-led bombing of Yemen continues and make clear Britain’s strong opposition to widespread human and civil rights abuses in Saudi Arabia,” opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said. Prince Mohammed will hold talks with Trump before going to New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco for meetings with industry leaders, as he seeks to shore up investments and political support from Riyadh’s closest Western ally. Several dozen Saudi chief executives will join him in touting investment opportunities in the kingdom, particularly in the areas of technology, entertainment and tourism, a Washington source said. Talks will also include a U.S. bid to build two nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia and a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement needed for that to proceed, an industry source said. Riyadh wants to diversify its energy supply mix, enabling it to export more crude oil rather than burning it to generate electricity. But it has previously refused to sign up to any agreement that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium. The political agenda in Washington will feature a new push to end the dispute between Arab allies of the United States that has isolated Qatar over alleged ties to terrorism, a senior U.S. official has said.  The crown prince is also likely to reiterate to Washington and London the view of Saudi Arabia that its regional rival, Iran, should not be trusted over its nuclear programme. Under a deal reached with major powers, Tehran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting on economic sanctions.

2018-03-06,"DUBAI/LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s upcoming trip to Britain and the United States could shape the decision on where to list oil giant Aramco, at a time when sources say the chances of London and New York hosting the IPO appear to be receding. The two leading financial centres have long been the clear frontrunners to host the international leg of the flotation, alongside a Riyadh listing.  Yet this may no longer be the case as Hong Kong is emerging as an increasingly likely compromise because Riyadh wants to help Asian nations that are expected to become “cornerstone” investors, including China and Japan, according to two sources familiar with the matter. To be sure, both London and New York are still in the running, but their requirement for greater disclosure of sensitive information on Aramco than the Hong Kong exchange is viewed as a drawback by some Saudi officials and advisers, the sources said. A final decision has yet to be made by Prince Mohammed, who oversees the kingdom’s economic and oil policies, the sources said. The complexity of the listing, legal worries and conflicting recommendations of the different advisers have delayed decision-making, they added.  Saudi Aramco said it was still reviewing its international listing options, and that no decision had been made, but declined to comment further. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, the city’s exchange operator, said: “Hong Kong is well positioned for the listing of Aramco. We have not received any indication of how the company is likely to proceed with its international listing plan.”  The London Stock Exchange declined to comment, while the New York Stock Exchange did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prince Mohammed will arrive in London on Wednesday for talks with British Prime Minister Theresa May and other senior ministers in his first trip to Britain since being named heir to the throne last summer.  He is expected to travel to the United States from March 19 to the first week of April, where he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump, and make stops in New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco among other cities. Both May and Trump want to attract the IPO, which could be the largest in history. Senior Saudi officials, including Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and Aramco CEO Amin Nasser, are likely to accompany the crown prince on his foreign tour.    Britain has proposed loosening rules on listing state companies by creating a new category for such firms to accommodate Aramco.  “The British want a strategic partner post-Brexit,” said a third source familiar with the crown prince’s trip. In November, Trump publicly appealed for Saudi Arabia to list Aramco’s shares in the United States, describing the listing as a priority for Washington. The U.S. visit will give the Saudis a chance to discuss the IPO on a senior level, according to two separate sources familiar with the trip.  Prince Mohammed has said Aramco is worth $2 trillion (1.44 trillion pounds), meaning the listing of about 5 percent of the company could raise $100 billion. He himself favours New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing for political reasons, given the longstanding ties between Riyadh and Washington and also because it gives the company access to a larger pool of capital, the first two sources said.  However, as well as the high disclosure requirements, the company’s advisers have warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA, the sources added. The law allowed lawsuits to proceed against the Saudi government claiming it had helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Riyadh denies the allegations. In Britain, meanwhile, the moves by regulators to loosen rules on listing state companies have been met with resistance from some politicians. The head of an influential parliamentary committee said on Monday that such efforts could cost London its reputation for good corporate governance. Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges. The IPO is the centrepiece of a Saudi economic reform plan, known as Vision 2030 and championed by Prince Mohammed, to diversify the economy beyond oil. But the IPO plan has caused misgivings among some Saudi officials and Aramco employees who believe Riyadh is relinquishing its crown jewels to foreigners and would like the whole idea to be shelved, sources have previously said. Bankers and analysts say Riyadh needs to list Aramco on either New York or London to show it is serious about its economic reforms and a willingness to attract foreign investment after an anti-corruption crackdown last November that led to the detention of several businessmen unnerved some investors.  “If the Aramco deal is going to have any credibility a listing on either New York or London has to happen,” said a senior Gulf-based banker familiar with the IPO process.  “Anything else will not cut it for international investors, in terms of transparency and corporate governance.” The decision on the listing venue must be taken by March or April at latest if the IPO is to be carried out in October or November, otherwise it could be delayed until 2019, sources familiar with the IPO discussions have said.

2018-03-06,"DUBAI, March 6 (Reuters) - Gulf stocks were mixed on Tuesday, with the Saudi market up on steady oil prices and Abu Dhabi dragged down by First Abu Dhabi Bank’s stock going ex-dividend. Outside of the Gulf, Egypt’s index continued to climb, reaching an all-time high as it benefits from the central bank’s decision to cut interest rates last month, the first time it has done so since letting the currency float freely in 2016. The Egyptian exchange closed at 16,012.66 points, up 1.99 percent, fuelled by gains in the consumer and real estate sectors. Stronger global stocks on Tuesday – with U.S. President Donald Trump facing increasing pressure to pull back from a proposed increase in steel and aluminium tariffs – had a positive effect on the Saudi market, which was also boosted by gains in the petrochemical sector due to steady oil prices. The Tadawul climbed 0.96 percent, with petchem companies such as Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic) gaining 1.5 percent and Saudi International Petrochemical Co up 0.9 percent. Banks were also all up, with Al Rajhi Banking & Investment Corporation seeing the highest trading volumes in the sector and climbing 1.32 percent, while Arab National Bank was the top gainer, jumping 3.7 percent. “Global markets have improved and the Saudi market is already balanced, so people are optimistic and the bet is still on leading stocks and banks,” said Mazen Al Sudairi, head of research at Rajhi Capital. The Qatar market lost 0.29 percent, despite initial gains. Vodafone Qatar was the worst performer, losing 3.76 percent. The company’s board announced last week a decision to reduce the share capital of the company by halving the nominal value of the company to 5 riyal per share. The real estate sector also weighed on the index, with United Development Company and Barwa Development Company losing 1.79 percent and 0.88 percent respectively. The Dubai exchange was broadly flat, losing only 0.05 percent. Abu Dhabi, though, slipped 1.87 percent, pulled by First Abu Dhabi Bank which dropped 6.47 percent as the stock went ex-dividend. FAB announced a cash dividend of 0.7 dirhams. On the ex-dividend date, the exchange reduces the stock price by the amount of the dividend to account for the fact that new investors are not eligible to receive dividends and are therefore unwilling to pay a premium. * Index went up 0.96 percent to 7,437.61 points. * Index shed 0.05 percent to 3,204.91 points. * Index dropped 1.87 percent to 4,523.49 points. * Index went down 0.29 percent to 8,429.30 points. * Index rose 1.99 percent to 16,022 points. * Index was flat 6,805.74 points. * Index was up 0.01 percent to 1,374.766 points. * Index dropped 0.81 percent to 4,947.400 points.

2018-03-06,"* Global shares snap four-day losing streak on Monday * Trade war fears ease after backlash against Trump’s plan * Euro shrugs off inconclusive Italian election * European shares seen rising 0.5-0.8 pct By Marc Jones LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - World share markets regained ground on Tuesday as news that the United States and North Korea will meet for talks next month came on top of hopes that President Donald Trump’s political allies would convince him to avoid a global trade war. The broadest gauge of global stocks, MSCI’s All Country World Index, was up more than 0.6 percent for a second day and Wall Street looked set for its third rise running as the rebound gathered momentum. It gained pace as North Korea said it was willing to talk to Washington about denuclearisation and would suspend its long-running nuclear tests while those talks were under way. “It looks like ‘risk on’ sentiment is coming back,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy, also pointing to weaker safe-havens like the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. Europe’s mood was also supported after Germany reformed its coalition government to end more than five months in political limbo and as the initial unease caused by a hefty election vote for anti-establishment parties in Italy ebbed. Italian bonds outperformed and shares in Milan bounced almost 1.5 percent having slipped to a six-month low after its weekend vote. Europe’s big three - Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac  - were up 0.5 - 1 percent too, while the euro and pound both climbed as the dollar lost its footing again. “Over and above the noise about (U.S.) protectionism we are getting now, we would need to see real evidence it is damaging growth and that is going to take some time,” said head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, Michael Metcalfe. “We have been here before in 2002 and 2003 with steel tariffs and that wasn’t devastating.” Top U.S. Republicans, including House speaker Paul Ryan, urged Trump on Monday not to go ahead with tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminium. Even though the president said he would not back down, he suggested Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new NAFTA trade deal was agreed. There was speculation that this had been the main motivation behind the plan. After Wall Street’s S&P 500 had put on more than 1 percent, Asia’s bourses rallied in concert overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, snapping five straight days of losses. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.8 percent from a five-month low, helped too by reassurances from the head of the Bank of Japan that it would not suddenly end stimulus. Korean shares also erased the remainder of the hit they took after Trump’s tariff warnings last week. The country is seen as being among the most exposed in Asia due to the large amount of steel it exports to the United States. “Even in the face of such bad news, it shows the volume of money in the equity market that is looking for an entry point,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s chief markets strategist for the UK and Europe, Karen Ward. The threat of a trade war is not the only source of tension for the world’s financial markets. As the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up and lead to fast interest rate hikes. The European Central Bank meets this week and looks almost certain later this year to end its three-year-old, 2.5 trillion euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus programme. U.S. 10-year bond yields reared back up to 2.89 percent ahead of U.S. trading and euro zone yields followed suit with German Bunds off a five-week low at 0.69 percent. “The ECB is going to be presenting growth forecasts that are likely to be stronger, but will be at pains to stress that the move away from monetary easing will be delicately done,” said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho. The euro traded back above $1.2410, having extended its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.2154. In Italy, where currency traders are keeping an eye on post-election developments as none of the three main factions has emerged with enough seats to govern alone, the country’s President, Sergio Mattarella, is expected to open formal coalition talks in April. Early elections are possible if no coalition accord is found. The dollar’s swoon helped the Canadian dollar off an eight month low C$1.2995 it had hit on Monday as the latest round of NAFTA renegotiations fanned the trade nerves. Canada is most exposed U.S. tariff threats but its central bank holds a rate meeting on Wednesday and if it keeps the door open to further hikes, the currency “is likely to be able to resist further notable depreciation,” Commerzbank said. In commodities, crude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at an industry meeting in Houston this week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $63.03 per barrel, up 0.7 percent following a 2.2 percent gain on Monday. Bellwether industrial metal copper gained 1.5 percent in easily its biggest jump in almost a month. China’s government said on Monday it was confident about keeping its growth rate at around 6.5 percent this year and on Tuesday defended a move to hike military spending by the biggest amount in three years.

2018-03-06,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The accelerating demise of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining their plans to meet looming European Union CO2 goals and avoid big annual fines. Executives gathered on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices: re-engineer existing vehicles at huge expense, restrict sales of some profitable models; or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties. Others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest Euro 6 diesels may yet be rehabilitated, and their fortunes restored. “I am worried,” Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in a Reuters Television interview. “But it’s our job to solve these problems,” he said. “I’m firmly convinced that diesel will experience a revival.” But a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin. While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. As consumers shun diesels, more carmakers are on track to miss tougher EU carbon dioxide goals taking effect in 2020-21. Some industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the EU’s 95 grammes/kilometer CO2 target. Ford (F.N) is reviewing its European line-up in light of diesel’s slide and is likely to “restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit”, a company source said. Steven Armstrong, the carmaker’s head of European operations, played down that prospect. “We’re not having to rethink the model line-up,” he said. “Of course we’ll have to fine-tune the volume by powertrain by vehicle, but it’s not going to be a fundamental shift for us.” VW brand sales chief Juergen Stackmann told Reuters his business would have to consider price increases for larger models and/or restricting sales.  “We are required to be compliant (with EU targets) - which steps are necessary will become clear in 1-1.5 years. A significantly lower mix of diesels is not helpful,” he said.  Initially sparked by VW’s 2015 emissions test-cheating scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of NOx emissions, the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilizing, as Mueller and others had hoped it would. Sales of diesel cars fell 8 percent in Europe last year, reducing their market share to 44 percent from a 55 percent peak in 2011. Partly as a result, average CO2 emissions increased in Europe in 2017 for the first time in a decade, according to  researchers JATO Dynamics. That was before the latest PR setbacks, in which VW admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas, and a court ruled that German cities were free to ban older diesel cars - joining Paris, London and a host of other urban centers that have vowed to run them off the road. Diesel sales were down another 19 percent in Germany last month, and a whopping 24 percent in Britain, amid concern that the decline in second-hand values would give way to collapse. French carmakers, which have relied heavily on diesels to meet CO2 goals, are now scrambling for alternatives. Renault (RENA.PA) has stepped up development of a low-cost hybrid known as “Locobox”, but the powertrain won’t even begin rolling out until 2021. PSA Group (PEUP.PA) Chief Executive Carlos Tavares insisted last week the Peugeot maker remained on track. In a newspaper interview the same day, however, he urged governments to suspend penalties for non-compliance until electric car charging networks are better developed. Tavares said on Tuesday he would seek backing for his demands from Europe’s ACEA car industry lobby group, which he currently chairs. Fuel-saving 48-volt hybrids being rushed out across the Peugeot, Citroen and newly acquired Opel line-ups are not expected to arrive before 2022 under current plans. “It’s not just at PSA that it’s happening too late – it’s happening too late everywhere,” said Philippe Houchois, a London-based automotive analyst with investment bank Jefferies. “The cost of CO2 compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession,” Houchois said. “Manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets, and that’s going to hit sales overall.” Already last October, investment research house MSCI was warning that “all carmakers apart from Toyota (7203.T) are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in 2021”. The Japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its European fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in petrol-electric hybrids. Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) is expected to announce a diesel phase-out in its mid-term plan, due in June. German premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock, by ramping up sales of plug-in hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out 48-volt technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups - including the two-year-old Mercedes (DAIGn.DE) E-Class. But the strategy of leaning on costly plug-ins for CO2 compliance has limits, as well as profitability perils. BMW (BMWG.DE) admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its X5 SUV, priced 600 euros below the diesel version at 72,500 euros ($89,500), despite its higher cost. “The profitability of plug-in hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines,” a company spokesman said. That spells bigger trouble for volume brands, which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset “compliance cars” sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet CO2 goals. “If everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles, the prices are going to collapse,” said one PSA Group engineer. “And since it’s a market that’s already quite unprofitable, people are just going to lose their shirts.” Reporting by Laurence Frost and Andreas Cremer; Additional reporting by Edward Taylor, Costas Pitas and Gilles Guillaume; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autoshow-geneva/update-2-diesel-collapse-gives-automakers-carbon-headache-idUKL5N1QO2R1,06 Mar 2018,"* VW boss ""worried,"" but still sees diesel revival

2018-03-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - French power utility Engie is looking at big acquisitions that will generate cash, in a strategy switch following the sale of 15 billion euros of assets that have shrunk its earnings base, according to two sources close to the company.  Between 2012 and 2016, Engie’s revenue fell by a third, from 97 billion euros ($119 billion) to 66.6 billion, and analysts expect it to have dropped further during 2017. Over the same period, core earnings have slumped, from 17 billion euros in 2012 to a forecast 9.3 billion euros at end 2017. Engie’s stock has followed the same pattern, dropping more than 40 percent from 2012 highs. Its $39 billion market value puts the one-time top European utility way behind peers Iberdrola and Enel, worth $61 billion and $48 billion respectively.  New Engie CEO Isabelle Kocher, appointed in May 2016, has reinvested part of the proceeds from sales of fossil fuel related assets in a string of smaller renewable energy, power grids and energy services assets.  But the acquisitions have not made up for the lost earnings so far and investors are hoping to get more clarity on Engie’s strategy at the release of 2017 earnings on Thursday. With the stock price lower than when she took charge, Kocher is cautiously considering bigger deals in a bid to restore earnings flow and regain investor confidence, the sources said. A source close to the board told Reuters that management is presenting potential major acquisitions to the board every three months. The last such meeting took place at the end of 2017. “Selling the ‘old-world’ assets has blown a hole in the earnings and it is not going to be filled with renewables, so Kocher is on the lookout for an acquisition,” the source said. The sources declined to name possible acquisition targets, but bankers said Dutch utility Eneco could prove attractive. Eneco’s owners want to pursue a private sale to another industry player in coming months, Reuters has reported.  Engie declined to comment. An investment banker who has worked on several deals for Engie said the arrival of Solvay CEO Jean-Pierre Clamadieu, who will take over as chairman of Engie’s board in May, could speed up the switch in strategy.  “The way Engie is run may change in coming months. Engie has to do something big,” he said.  Shortly after he was nominated in February, Clamadieu said on French TV that Kocher’s strategy was “coherent”, but that Engie needed to “identify growth engines and consider external growth”. A first wave of asset sales in 2012-15 was aimed at reducing debt, but Kocher’s strategy is to sell and reinvest. By late 2017, Engie had completed nearly 90 percent of her divestment plan with the sale of its upstream liquefied natural gas assets for $1.5 billion, its oil and gas exploration and production business for $3.9 billion and the Loy Yang B coal-fired power station in Australia for $835 million. How Engie has reinvested, or will reinvest, the proceeds of the sales, and how much cash is left, is less clear.  While asset sales were big chunks counted in billions, acquisitions have been mainly counted in millions, like the 430 million euro for solar energy firm SolaireDirect and the $762 million for 40 percent in Dubai air-conditioning firm Tabreed.  Last year in May, sources said Germany’s RWE and Engie had studied the possibility of RWE swapping its renewables and grids unit Innogy in exchange for a stake in Engie.

2018-03-06,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Asian imports of U.S. crude vs. WTI discount to Brent: reut.rs/2D1MbJ2 By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 6 (Reuters) - Exports of U.S. crude oil to Asia appear to be starting to struggle under the weight of a narrowing discount for its domestic benchmark crude to international grades and efforts by other suppliers to maintain competitiveness. Vessel-tracking and port data suggest Asian imports of U.S. crude were equivalent to about 560,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February, down sharply from 676,190 bpd in January. March’s figure may be even weaker with data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts pointing to Asian imports of only about 290,000 bpd. While these estimates are subject to revision, the March data shouldn’t change dramatically given any cargo due to be offloaded in Asia this month would have to have left a U.S. port by now, or at least within the next day or so. The main culprit for a slowdown in U.S. shipments to Asia is likely the narrowing discount of benchmark U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to Brent, the light crude grade used as a price marker for the rest of the world. The discount of WTI to Brent CL-LCO1=R was $3.11 a barrel at Monday’s close, slightly more than $3 on March 1, which was the smallest gap in seven months. The spread between the two benchmarks blew out to $7.07 a barrel in late September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which knocked out refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, cutting demand for WTI crudes. It remained relatively wide for several months after that, ending the year at $6.48 a barrel, but the differential has been steadily narrowing this year in response to strong demand from U.S. refineries and from overseas buyers. Asian imports of 726,600 bpd of U.S. crude in November and January’s 676,190 bpd were the strongest two months on record, showing that the region’s traders were quick to take advantage of the weakening of WTI relative to Brent. It’s also likely that the spread for physical crude is actually narrower than that implied by the futures contracts. Dated Forties and Oseberg crude BFO-, a physical price for two Brent grades, ended last week at $64.77 a barrel, just $1.74 above the physical WTI Houston price of $63.03, as assessed by price reporting agency Argus. At this level it doesn’t make economic sense for Asian buyers to import crude from the U.S. Gulf, with a discount of at least $4 a barrel needed to overcome the higher freight rates involved for the longer sea journey. Tanker rates from the United States to Asia have also been rising recently, with the cost of shipping a tonne of oil from Houston to China TC-HOU-DLC assessed by Thomson Reuters at $29.01 on March 2, up from $18.44 at the start of February and $16.79 in late September last year. Another factor undermining U.S. crude exports to Asia is the likelihood of plentiful cargoes from traditional suppliers in the Middle East and Africa. Several refineries in Asia undertake routine maintenance in the low-demand second quarter, which usually prompts both lower official selling prices (OSPs) from Middle Eastern producers such as Saudi Arabia, as well as sharper discounts in the physical markets. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s state-owned producer, said in a statement on Monday that it would trim the OSP for its main Arab Light grade to a premium of $1.10 a barrel over regional benchmark Oman-Dubai crude for April-loading cargoes, down from $1.65 for March shipments. This matched the expectations of traders and refiners in the region surveyed ahead of the release, and shows the Saudis are still trying to ensure their crude remains competitive, even as they maintain a commitment to restrain output by the terms of the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia. The Saudi OSP sets the trend for official prices from other producers in the Middle East, such as Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. Overall, it seems that U.S. crude exports to Asia are facing headwinds that will likely only be alleviated by a re-widening of WTI’s discount to Brent. That will most likely require rising shale oil output, a levelling out of U.S. refinery demand and ongoing OPEC curbs to keep prices other than WTI at elevated levels.

2018-03-06,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Jaguar Land Rover is waiting for more information on trading conditions after Brexit before it decides whether to make electric cars in its home market, the boss of Britain’s biggest carmaker told Reuters.  The Indian-owned automaker, which makes just under one in three of Britain’s 1.7 million cars at three factories, is building its new I-PACE electric model in Austria. The company is due to decide this year whether to build electric vehicles in Britain but, like its peers, is worried about the imposition of tariffs or customs checks after Brexit, snarling up supply chains and adding costs to production.  “That makes the decision this year very, very critical and I don’t know whether we can make it,” Chief Executive Ralf Speth told Reuters at the Geneva Motor Show. London and Brussels hope to agree on a transitional deal this month to maintain free and unfettered trade until at least the end of 2020 ahead of a long-term Brexit agreement to be decided by the end of the year. Speth cited the need for support from government and academia but when asked whether Brexit was a factor in the decision-making process, he said:  “We are waiting for these kinds of decisions. It goes without saying because uncertainty is really challenging us very much and not only us, it’s for the complete industry. “You hardly see inward investment any more or every decision is taking longer from every faculty.

2018-03-06,"* Global shares snap four-day losing streak on Monday * Trade war fears ease after backlash against Trump’s plan * Euro shrugs off inconclusive Italian election * European shares seen rising 0.5-0.8 pct By Marc Jones LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Share markets in Asia and Europe regained ground on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs and a potential global trade war. European sentiment was also supported after Germany reformed its coalition government to end more than five months in political limbo and as initial unease caused by a hefty election vote for anti-establishment parties in Italy began to ebb. Italian bonds gained and shares bounced almost 1 percent having slipped to a six-month low after the weekend vote. Europe’s big three - Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac  - were up 0.5-1 percent too, with euro a fraction higher and the pound a touch weaker as the dollar steadied. “Over and above the noise about (U.S.) protectionism we are getting now, we would we would need to see real evidence it is damaging growth and that is going to take some time,” said head of global macro strategy at State Street Global Markets, Michael Metcalfe. “...We have been here before in 2002 and 2003 with steel tariffs and that wasn’t devastating.” Top U.S. Republican politicians, including House speaker Paul Ryan, urged Trump on Monday not to go ahead with tariffs on foreign imports of steel and aluminium. Even though the president said he would not back down, he suggested Canada and Mexico could be exempted if a new NAFTA trade deal was agreed. There was speculation that this had been the main motivation behind the plan. After Wall Street’s S&P 500 had put on more than 1 percent, Asia’s bourses rallied in concert overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, snapping five straight days of losses. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.8 percent from a five-month low, helped too by reassurances from the head of the Bank of Japan that it would not suddenly end stimulus. Korean shares also erased the remainder of the hit they took after Trump’s tariff warnings last week. The country is seen as being among the most exposed in Asia due to the large amount of steel it exports to the United States. “Even in the face of such bad news, it shows the volume of money in the equity market that is looking for an entry point,” said JP Morgan Asset Management’s chief markets strategist for the UK and Europe, Karen Ward. The threat of a trade war is not the only source of tension for the world’s financial markets. As the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up and lead to fast interest rate hikes. The European Central Bank meets this week and looks almost certain later this year to end its three-year-old, 2.5 trillion euro ($3.08 trillion) stimulus programme. U.S. 10-year bond yields had reared back up to 2.8888 percent on Monday and most euro zone yields -  with the exception of those in Italy - were following suit with German Bunds off a five-week low at 0.65 percent. “The ECB is going to be presenting growth forecasts that are likely to be stronger, but will be at pains to stress that the move away from monetary easing will be delicately done,” said Peter Chatwell, head of euro rates strategy at Mizuho. The euro traded at $1.2340, having extend its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.2154. In Italy, where currency traders are keeping an eye on post-election developments as none of the three main factions has emerged with enough seats to govern alone, the country’s President, Sergio Mattarella, is expected to open formal coalition talks in April. Early elections are possible if no coalition accord is found. The Canadian dollar was stuck near an eight month low at C$1.2995. Canada is most exposed U.S. tariff threats but its central bank holds a rate meeting on Wednesday and if it keeps the door open to further hikes, the currency “is likely to be able to resist further notable depreciation,” Commerzbank said. In commodities, crude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at an industry meeting in Houston this week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded at $62.69 per barrel, up 0.2 percent following a 2.2 percent gain on Monday. Bellwether industrial metal copper gained 1 percent in its biggest jump in almost a month. China’s government said on Monday it was confident about keeping its growth rate at around 6.5 percent this year and on Tuesday defended a move to hike military spending by the biggest amount in three years.

The potential suspension of penalties if charging network rollouts fall short of targets is “to be discussed”, he added. In a newspaper interview last week, Tavares suggested carmakers should not be fined for non-compliance if the density of electric-car charging networks remained inadequate.

2018-03-06,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Covestro (1COV.DE), a maker of materials for insulation foams and transparent plastics, will replace broadcaster ProSiebenSat.1 Media (PSMGn.DE) in Germany's blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI, after Bayer (BAYGn.DE) sold off Covestro shares. The surprise switch was based on the fast-entry rule, stock exchange operator Deutsche Boerse said late on Monday, which allows a company to enter an index ahead of the stock exchange’s regular review if it ranks among the biggest 25 companies in terms of market capitalisation and turnover. Covestro shares gained 3.3 percent in early Tuesday trade, as the DAX inclusion qualifies the stock for funds that passively track the index and for large-cap portfolio managers that use the DAX as part of their investment universe. ProSieben shares slipped 0.2 percent. Covestro’s former parent Bayer last year sold 4.7 billion euros worth of shares in the plastics business to help finance its planned takeover of seeds company Monsanto, boosting the number of freely traded shares. That reduced the stake held directly by Bayer to 14.2 percent and moved the drugs and pesticides maker closer to its planned exit of Covestro. Covestro, formerly known Bayer MaterialScience, is generating cash faster than previously thought, helped by buoyant demand for materials that the chemicals industry is struggling to meet and amid limited opportunities to invest in new plants and equipment. Its shares have gained almost 38 percent over the past six months, helped by a boost in earnings and a share buyback programme that will likely continue beyond 2019. ProSieben will move to the MDAX index of Germany’s 50 biggest companies below the blue-chip level. The index changes will become effective on March 19. The next regular index review will be held on June 5. Separately, Raymond James analyst Patrick Lambert lifted his recommendation for Covestro to “strong buy” from “outperform”, citing the company’s confident outlook for 2018 and the use of transparent polycarbonate plastics in cars and electronics. “Covestro remains the cheapest stock in our sector on all metrics, trading at a 21 percent discount,” he said.

Aggreko’s power solutions utility business, which installs and operates modular, mobile power plants in emerging markets, has been under pressure primarily due to lower pricing and volumes in Argentina. The company, which powers major events and covers electricity shortfalls, said its operating margin fell to 13 percent in 2017 from 16 percent a year earlier with margins in the power solutions utility declining 11 percentage points. Aggreko expects to renew about 174 megawatts (MW) of contracts in Argentina but at a further price discount to the extensions it secured in 2016, it said. The company forecast profit before tax this year to be in line with 2017, excluding the impact of currency, and said order intake was 137 MW so far this year. The British company said pretax profit before exceptional items fell to 195 million pounds in 2017, from 221 million pounds in the preceding year.

Evonik derived about 1.5 billion euros in 2017 sales from clear acrylic sheet and the methacrylate chemicals, accounting for about 10 percent of its 2017 revenue of 14.4 billion. “We are concentrating on our four defined growth engines,” said Chief Executive Christian Kullmann, citing ingredients for healthcare and personal care products, smart materials, additives and animal nutrition. Helped by its recent purchases of additives businesses from Air Products and of J. M. Huber’s silica operations, Evonik on Tuesday reported an 8 percent gain to 474 million euros ($585 million) in fourth-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted for one-offs. That was slightly below the 479 million expected by analysts in a Reuters poll as weak prices for poultry feed additives outweighed strong demand for engineering plastics and rubber silica. Evonik in November said it would slash administrative costs as profit margins narrowed and after recent acquisitions accounted for most of its earnings growth. The company, which is controlled by a state-backed foundation, lags peers such as BASF, Lanxess or DSM in trading multiples of expected core earnings.

2018-03-06,"* FGV eyes palm oil refineries in Myanmar, Cambodia, Philippines * Company’s 2018 production seen rising 15 pct from last year By Emily Chow and Naveen Thukral KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Reuters) - Felda Global Ventures Holdings Bhd (FGV), the world’s biggest crude palm oil producer, is looking to new markets as traditional customers India and Europe take steps to curb purchases, the company’s chief executive said on Tuesday. The Malaysian firm is planning to build palm oil refineries in Myanmar, the Philippines and Cambodia in the next two years, Zakaria Arshad told Reuters in an interview. “We want to spread our sales to various countries, looking at new markets which are looking for additional crude palm oil and olein supply,” he said. Peanut oil supplies have not been able to keep pace with growing demand in Myanmar, Zakaria said, meaning there is scope to boost palm oil sales there. The Philippines, which traditionally uses coconut oil, is facing tight supplies of the product as coconut water becomes popular with some health-conscious consumers. “There is (also) scope to meet growing demand in Pakistan where we have a refinery,” Zakaria said on the sidelines of an industry event in Kuala Lumpur. The European Union in mid-January approved draft measures to reform its power market and reduce energy consumption to meet more ambitious climate goals. The draft includes banning the usage of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021. India, the world’s biggest edible oil importer, last week raised import tax on crude and refined palm oil to the highest level in more than a decade, in a move designed to support local farmers. “India has to import, they have (supply) limitations. Sooner or later they have to import palm oil. This is only temporary,” Zakaria said. FGV’s production of fresh fruit bunches of palm oil are expected to rise 15 percent in 2018 from a year ago, Zakaria added. “We are looking at a much better crop this year,” he said. “We have new areas that are starting production and we have sorted out other issues such as labour shortages and the weather has improved.” Two thirds of palm oil produced at FGV comes from small-scale farmers across Malaysia.

2018-03-06,"* Feb diesel sales plunged 19 pct in Germany, 24 pct in UK * Decline makes it harder for firms to meet EU CO2 goals * VW boss “worried,” but still sees diesel revival By Laurence Frost and Andreas Cremer GENEVA, March 6 (Reuters) - The accelerating demise of diesel, long used by carmakers to boost fuel-efficiency, is undermining their plans to meet looming European Union CO2 goals, and avoid big annual fines. Executives gathered on Tuesday at the Geneva auto show are grappling with unpalatable choices: re-engineer existing vehicles at huge expense, restrict sales of some profitable models; or risk hundreds of millions of euros in penalties. Others are clinging to the hope that the image of the latest Euro 6 diesels may yet be rehabilitated, and their fortunes restored. “I am worried,” Volkswagen Chief Executive Matthias Mueller said in a Reuters Television interview. “But it’s our job to solve these problems,” he said. “I’m firmly convinced that diesel will experience a revival.” But a fresh flurry of bad headlines and the growing prospect of outright diesel vehicle bans are already sending their sales into a steeper tailspin. While diesels produce more toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulates than gasoline engines, their efficiency has been instrumental in cutting greenhouse gases. As consumers shun diesels, more carmakers are on track to miss tougher EU carbon dioxide goals taking effect in 2020-21. Some industry insiders predict carmakers will be forced to rein in sales of larger models by raising prices to avoid overshooting the EU’s 95 grammes/kilometre CO2 target. Ford is reviewing its European line-up in light of diesel’s slide and is likely to “restrict the sale of some vehicles that push us over the limit”, a company source said. Steven Armstrong, the carmaker’s head of European operations, played down that prospect. “We’re not having to rethink the model line-up,” he said. “Of course we’ll have to fine-tune the volume by powertrain by vehicle, but it’s not going to be a fundamental shift for us.” Initially sparked by VW’s 2015 emissions test-cheating scandal and subsequent studies exposing the true levels of NOx emissions, the diesel slump has since deepened rather than stabilising, as Mueller and others had hoped it would. Sales of diesel cars fell 8 percent in Europe last year, reducing their market share to 44 percent from a 55 percent peak in 2011. Partly as a result, average new-car CO2 emissions actually rose in the UK for the first time in 17 years. That was before the latest PR setbacks, in which VW admitted using monkeys and humans to test exhaust gas, and a court ruled that German cities were free to ban older diesel cars - joining Paris, London and a host of other urban centres that have vowed to run them off the road. Diesel sales were down another 19 percent in Germany last month, and a whopping 24 percent in Britain, amid concern that the decline in second-hand values would give way to collapse. French carmakers, which have relied heavily on diesels to meet CO2 goals, are now scrambling for alternatives. Renault has stepped up development of a low-cost hybrid known as “Locobox”, but the powertrain won’t even begin rolling out until 2021. PSA Group Chief Executive Carlos Tavares insisted last week the Peugeot maker remained on track. In a newspaper interview the same day, however, he urged governments to suspend penalties for non-compliance until electric car charging networks are better developed. Fuel-saving 48-volt hybrids being rushed out across the Peugeot, Citroen and newly acquired Opel lineups are not expected to arrive before 2022 under current plans. “It’s not just at PSA that it’s happening too late – it’s happening too late everywhere,” said Philippe Houchois, a London-based automotive analyst with investment bank Jefferies. “The cost of CO2 compliance is one of the potential triggers of the next auto recession,” Houchois said. “Manufacturers are going to have to raise prices on larger petrol cars to meet their emissions targets, and that’s going to hit sales overall.” Already last October, investment research house MSCI was warning that “all carmakers apart from Toyota are at risk of missing regulatory targets for fleet emissions in 2021”. The Japanese carmaker is dropping diesels from its European fleet as it benefits from two decades of dominance in petrol-electric hybrids. Fiat Chrysler is expected to announce a diesel phase-out in its mid-term plan, due in June. German premium automakers are also better resourced to absorb the shock, by ramping up sales of plug-in hybrids already in their portfolios or pipelines while rushing out 48-volt technology to curb emissions across existing model lineups - including the two-year-old Mercedes E-Class. But the strategy of leaning on costly plug-ins for CO2 compliance has limits, as well as profitability perils. BMW admits it is already taking a hit on the hybrid version of its X5 SUV, priced 600 euros below the diesel version at 72,500 euros ($89,500), despite its higher cost. “The profitability of plug-in hybrids is below that of cars with pure combustion engines,” a company spokesman said. That spells bigger trouble for volume brands, which lack the lucrative luxury models to offset “compliance cars” sold at lower profit or even a loss to meet CO2 goals. “If everybody wants to sell a lot of electrified vehicles, the prices are going to collapse,” said one PSA Group engineer. “And since it’s a market that’s already quite unprofitable, people are just going to lose their shirts.” $1 = 0.8105 euros

Sentiment was also supported by receding risk aversion in Europe with the euro gaining support from the creation of a coalition government in Germany and the impact of Italy’s inconclusive election results limited to a mild sell-off in domestic bonds and stocks. European shares are expected to gain, with financial spreadbetters tipping Britain’s FTSE and France’s Cac to rise 0.5 percent and Germany’s Dax 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, snapping five straight days of losses, while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.8 percent from a five-month low. Korean shares have erased all the losses they had taken after Trump’s announcement even though the country is seen as being among the worst affected in region by the tariffs due to its big steel exports to the United States. U.S. S&P500 have also now recouped all the losses incurred after Trump’s tariff plan. Leading Republicans, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, turned up the pressure on Trump to rethink the plan on Monday. “Given the opposition from Republican lawmakers and trading partners, there is speculation that Trump may not be able to force through the plan,” said Soichiro Monji, chief strategist at Daiwa SB Investments. Some investors also saw the tariffs threats as a U.S. negotiating tactic to get a better deal on NAFTA. Still, uncertainty remains with confusion about the timing and extent of the planned tariffs inside the White House. Trump said on Monday he would not back down. Trump was expected to finalise the planned tariffs later in the week, although some observers familiar with the process said it could occur next week. The spectre of a trade war was not the only source of concern for the stock market. As the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up. While moderate inflation generally supports equity investors, rapid inflation, or fear of it, could prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates faster, undermining the attraction of equities. “Given the importance of bond yields to equity valuation, equity investors are affected by potential changes in bond yields just as much as fixed-income investors,” said Colin Moore, Global Chief Investment Officer at Boston-based Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “In the current environment, although inflation appears to be increasing, it’s still not likely to cause 10-year yields to rise to levels that would be problematic for equities. I estimate that problematic level to be a 4 percent yield.” U.S. bond yields rose as Wall Street shares rallied. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose back to 2.888 percent from last week’s low of 2.793 percent. A break of last month’s peak of 2.957 percent could trigger fresh selling in Treasuries, traders say. In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.2343, extending its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday. The euro managed to recover losses made on Monday after two anti-establishment leaders made early plays to govern Italy following an inconclusive election where voters shunted mainstream parties to the sidelines. As none of the three main factions had enough seats to govern alone, President Sergio Mattarella is expected to open formal coalition talks in April, with early elections possible if no accord is found. “With any coalition that can be formed likely to have a right of centre bias, this ought to be bad for the euro but the German election result appears to have counterbalanced any detrimental effects. We are holding to our pre-election stance that this is not the time to be adding Italian risk,” said Paul Hatfield, Global Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alcentra, part of BNY Mellon Investment Management. The dollar fetched 106.41 yen, up 0.2 percent for the day, crawling back from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday on improved risk appetite. The Canadian dollar hit an eight-month low of C$1.3002 per U.S. dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump used proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium as a bargaining chip in talks to revamp NAFTA. The Australian dollar was almost flat at $0.7773 after the Reserve bank of Australia kept its policy on hold as expected. Crude prices held firm, underpinned by robust demand forecasts and prospects for informal contacts sought by OPEC with U.S. shale oil producers at a key industry meeting in Houston this week.

2018-03-06,"(Repeats March 5 item, with no changes) By Aidan Lewis TUNIS, March 5 (Reuters) - Two of Libya’s largest oilfields with combined production of nearly 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) have suffered shutdowns in quick succession, casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the OPEC member’s oil output. Libya’s national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months, and most recent closures have been quickly resolved. A shutdown that began on Sunday at El Sharara, Libya’s biggest field, lasted less than 24 hours. But the latest disruptions - caused by guards at El Feel field complaining about pay and benefits, and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land - highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralised security forces or political control. Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa, and has been a key supplier of light, sweet crude to Europe. Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd, and before the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago, it was pumping more than 1.6 million bpd. Last year the state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) outlined plans that would raise production to 2.2 million bpd by 2023, but said this would need around $18 billion of investment. Foreign oil companies including Italy’s Eni, Total of France and U.S. firms ConocoPhillips and Hess have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC. Since Libya’s 2011 uprising, power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands. Armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports, including a long blockade of terminals in Libya’s eastern oil crescent from 2014-2016. Prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells. As Libya’s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices, demands for salaries, local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread. Islamic State militants attacked oilfields and ports in 2015-2016 before being driven back by local forces. Their destruction of storage tanks at two of Libya’s biggest terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, has yet to be repaired. Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed. After disputed elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east, eastern-based factions tried to sell oil independently. They failed, but the split added to uncertainty in Libya’s oil sector. The causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards, armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members, and apparent political manoeuvring in the east. Sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals, sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves. Production at the key Sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near Zintan, a western town that became militarily powerful in the 2011 uprising. The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital, often has little means of ending blockades. Oil installations are meant to be protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG). But as with other parts of Libya’s security forces, their official status is effectively self-declared and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority. Even as longer blockades ended from mid-2016, financial constraints have been an underlying drag on Libya’s production rebound. The NOC has had rocky relations with the GNA, and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up. The GNA says its own resources are limited. A bigger political risk also looms. Factions in the east, where most of Libya’s oil wealth is located, are opposed to the GNA and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions. Some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has good relations with the NOC in Tripoli, has kept fields and ports open. Security is still volatile. In December an explosion at a pipeline in eastern Libya caused an outage of up to 100,000 bpd, though it was quickly repaired. International companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore, keeping exploration and development programmes mostly on hold. Along with Nigeria, Libya has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of 2018. Despite speculation that the two troubled nations would be pressured into joining the output-curbing deal, both have signalled their intention to raise production.

2018-03-06,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Asian imports of U.S. crude vs. WTI discount to Brent: reut.rs/2D1MbJ2 By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 6 (Reuters) - Exports of U.S. crude oil to Asia appear to be starting to struggle under the weight of a narrowing discount for its domestic benchmark crude to international grades and efforts by other suppliers to maintain competitiveness. Vessel-tracking and port data suggest Asian imports of U.S. crude were equivalent to about 560,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February, down sharply from 676,190 bpd in January. March’s figure may be even weaker with data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts pointing to Asian imports of only about 290,000 bpd. While these estimates are subject to revision, the March data shouldn’t change dramatically given any cargo due to be offloaded in Asia this month would have to have left a U.S. port by now, or at least within the next day or so. The main culprit for a slowdown in U.S. shipments to Asia is likely the narrowing discount of benchmark U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) to Brent, the light crude grade used as a price marker for the rest of the world. The discount of WTI to Brent CL-LCO1=R was $3.11 a barrel at Monday’s close, slightly more than $3 on March 1, which was the smallest gap in seven months. The spread between the two benchmarks blew out to $7.07 a barrel in late September in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey, which knocked out refineries along the U.S. Gulf Coast, cutting demand for WTI crudes. It remained relatively wide for several months after that, ending the year at $6.48 a barrel, but the differential has been steadily narrowing this year in response to strong demand from U.S. refineries and from overseas buyers. Asian imports of 726,600 bpd of U.S. crude in November and January’s 676,190 bpd were the strongest two months on record, showing that the region’s traders were quick to take advantage of the weakening of WTI relative to Brent. It’s also likely that the spread for physical crude is actually narrower than that implied by the futures contracts. Dated Forties and Oseberg crude BFO-, a physical price for two Brent grades, ended last week at $64.77 a barrel, just $1.74 above the physical WTI Houston price of $63.03, as assessed by price reporting agency Argus. At this level it doesn’t make economic sense for Asian buyers to import crude from the U.S. Gulf, with a discount of at least $4 a barrel needed to overcome the higher freight rates involved for the longer sea journey. Tanker rates from the United States to Asia have also been rising recently, with the cost of shipping a tonne of oil from Houston to China TC-HOU-DLC assessed by Thomson Reuters at $29.01 on March 2, up from $18.44 at the start of February and $16.79 in late September last year. Another factor undermining U.S. crude exports to Asia is the likelihood of plentiful cargoes from traditional suppliers in the Middle East and Africa. Several refineries in Asia undertake routine maintenance in the low-demand second quarter, which usually prompts both lower official selling prices (OSPs) from Middle Eastern producers such as Saudi Arabia, as well as sharper discounts in the physical markets. Saudi Aramco, the kingdom’s state-owned producer, said in a statement on Monday that it would trim the OSP for its main Arab Light grade to a premium of $1.10 a barrel over regional benchmark Oman-Dubai crude for April-loading cargoes, down from $1.65 for March shipments. This matched the expectations of traders and refiners in the region surveyed ahead of the release, and shows the Saudis are still trying to ensure their crude remains competitive, even as they maintain a commitment to restrain output by the terms of the agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, including Russia. The Saudi OSP sets the trend for official prices from other producers in the Middle East, such as Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. Overall, it seems that U.S. crude exports to Asia are facing headwinds that will likely only be alleviated by a re-widening of WTI’s discount to Brent. That will most likely require rising shale oil output, a levelling out of U.S. refinery demand and ongoing OPEC curbs to keep prices other than WTI at elevated levels.

Jamaluddin Nor Mohamad, Chief Executive of Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Bhd, said the exchange is aiming to add more delivery points for the RBD palm olein contract to make it more attractive for domestic and international users. “We are in discussions with securities commissions,” Jamaluddin told Reuters, speaking on the sidelines of an industry conference in Kuala Lumpur. “We do have an olein contract at the moment and we also have crude palm kernel oil, with limited interest at the moment.” Olein is one of the main derivatives of crude of palm oil, used largely as a cooking oil and in a wide variety of food products, but the olein contract has not traded for over six months due to limited commercial interest. “Olein usage is very much global in nature,” Jamaluddin said. “We are looking at providing wider alternatives in terms of delivery points.” Jamaluddin didn’t disclose details on potential changes to the crude palm kernel oil contract.

2018-03-06,"* Foreign investors unnerved by November detentions * London offers rare audience with the queen * U.S., Britain hope to win Saudi Aramco public offering * Trump talks could pave way to wider Gulf Arab summit By Stephen Kalin and William James RIYADH/LONDON, March 6 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s crown prince wants to persuade his British and  U.S. allies that “shock” reforms have made his country a better place to invest and a more tolerant society on his first foreign tour as heir apparent. But it could be a tough sell. Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who starts talks in London on Wednesday, has won Western plaudits for seeking to reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, tackle chronic corruption and transform the deeply conservative, mainly Sunni Muslim kingdom. But the severity and secrecy of an anti-corruption crackdown last November, after Prince Mohammed ousted an older cousin as crown prince in a palace coup last June, has unnerved some investors. Though London and New York are rivals to host the partial public listing of state oil firm Saudi Aramco, the enthusiasm of some Western business leaders — even for such an important contract — has been sapped by concerns about human rights and a lack of limitations on executive power in Saudi Arabia. “Investors are intrigued by MbS’s (Prince Mohammed’s) reform projects, and there will be a huge amount of interest in hearing his views, but uncertainty lingers,” said Jane Kinninmont, a Middle East expert at Chatham House think tank. Rachel Reeves, head of an influential business committee in British parliament, warned against risking London’s reputation as a finance centre by watering down corporate governance rules to secure the Aramco listing. This, she said, could “ultimately damage our attractiveness to foreign investment.” Prince Mohammed has defended last November’s crackdown, in which dozens of top business leaders and princes were detained, as necessary to combat “the cancer of corruption”. Most detainees have now been released, and the authorities say they have arranged to seize more than $100 billion in assets. The ambitious young prince, just 32, is sure to repeat his message at talks in Britain with Prime Minister Theresa May and when he meets President Donald Trump during a visit to the United States starting on March 19. He will also have a rare audience with Queen Elizabeth and dinner with Prince Charles, the heir to the throne in Britain, after arriving from Egypt. Any visit to the London Stock Exchange — and later the New York Stock Exchange — will be watched closely by investors because of the potentially lucrative Aramco listing expected later this year. Talks with faith leaders in Britain including the Archbishop of Canterbury, the senior bishop and principal leader of the Church of England, offer Prince Mohammed an opportunity to project a more tolerant image of Saudi Arabia, sources close to the trip told Reuters. Under the reforms closely associated with the crown prince, social restrictions have been loosened, such as bans on cinemas and women driving. He has promised to promote a more moderate form of Islam. Business deals are possible with British defence group BAE Systems and European weapons maker MBDA, and initial agreements could be concluded on gas exploration, petrochemicals and industry, according to British and Saudi sources. They gave no details of the potential deals. Foreign minister Boris Johnson lauded security ties with “one of Britain’s oldest friends in the region” in a newspaper article last week and praised Prince Mohammed’s reforms. But rights groups and opposition lawmakers have criticised London’s support for the prince, particularly over the licensing of 4.6 billion pounds ($6.37 billion) worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia since the start of the Yemen conflict. Anti-war and human rights groups plan a protest outside May’s Downing Street office on Wednesday. “Theresa May should use this visit to announce the UK will no longer supply arms to Saudi Arabia while the devastating Saudi-led bombing of Yemen continues and make clear Britain’s strong opposition to widespread human and civil rights abuses in Saudi Arabia,” opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn said. Prince Mohammed will hold talks with Trump before going to New York, Boston, Houston and San Francisco for meetings with industry leaders, as he seeks to shore up investments and political support from Riyadh’s closest Western ally. Several dozen Saudi chief executives will join him in touting investment opportunities in the kingdom, particularly in the areas of technology, entertainment and tourism, a Washington source said. Talks will also include a U.S. bid to build two nuclear reactors in Saudi Arabia and a civilian nuclear cooperation agreement needed for that to proceed, an industry source said. Riyadh wants to diversify its energy supply mix, enabling it to export more crude oil rather than burning it to generate electricity. But it has previously refused to sign up to any agreement that would deprive it of the possibility of one day enriching uranium. The political agenda in Washington will feature a new push to end the dispute between Arab allies of the United States that has isolated Qatar over alleged ties to terrorism, a senior U.S. official has said. The crown prince is also likely to reiterate to Washington and London the view of Saudi Arabia that its regional rival, Iran, should not be trusted over its nuclear programme. Under a deal reached with major powers in 2016, Tehran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for a lifting on economic sanctions.

2018-03-06,"MELBOURNE/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Aid workers struggled to reach remote areas of Papua New Guinea’s rugged highlands on Tuesday as aftershocks rattled the region, more than a week after a powerful 7.5 magnitude earthquake killed dozens of people. Two aftershocks above magnitude 5 hit the mountainous Southern Highlands, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby, with the constant shaking driving people from their homes to makeshift shelters for fear of landslides. Local media outlets on Tuesday reported the death toll had grown to 75, after government officials said previously that 55 people had been killed. James Komengi, a United Church project officer, speaking from Tari, the capital of quake-affected Hela province, said his church’s assessment and response centre had counted up to 67 deaths in that province alone. “Mothers and children are so traumatised. Even my own children are refusing to sleep in our house. Every little movement scares them,” said Komengi. Concerns were also growing about access to safe drinking water after the shaking destroyed many water tanks, while land slips had poured mud into natural water sources. “Because of the landslides ... it’s very dirty water,” said Udaya Regmi, Director the International Red Cross in Papua New Guinea. Provincial health officials and Red Cross volunteers were urgently trying to improve sanitation systems and carry out hygeine training to avoid an outbreak of dystentry, Regmi said.

Australia, New Zealand and the Red Cross have all pledged aid, although reaching the remote area has proved difficult as forbidding terrain and bad weather, as well as damaged roads and runways, have delayed aid efforts. “Right now the main challenge in the affected areas is accessibility by roads. There are big cracks along the roads and even roads completely cut off. So that’s making it quite difficult to get water, food and medicine to the remote areas,” said Milton Kwaipo, Caritas Australia’s disaster response and management officer in Papua New Guinea. The quake has also been felt on global gas markets, with ExxonMobil Corp declaring force majeure on exports from Papua New Guinea, according to an industry source, pushing up Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices. The company declined to comment on the force majeure, but said it would take about 8 weeks to restore production.

2018-03-06,"(Repeats item published on March 5, no changes in text) * Palm exports to the Middle East seen rising for Ramadan * But full-year Middle East demand seen flat * SE Asia demand also lukewarm without govt policy action By Emily Chow KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 (Reuters) - A push by palm oil producers to cultivate new markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East is unlikely to move the dial on exports this year, traders and analysts say, as customers favour cheaper rival oils while holding out for palm price cuts. The impetus for Indonesia and Malaysia, the number 1 and 2 palm oil suppliers respectively, to seek out new buyers comes from the European Union’s move to curb palm oil use in biofuels as part of broader climate change goals. The EU is the second largest buyer of the top two producers’ palm oil. But while buying in regions outside traditional markets could pick up ahead of the Ramadan Muslim fasting season, which begins mid-May, full-year demand for the product used in everything from soap to cooking oil is set to remain unchanged, market watchers told Reuters. The new market quest is set to be a theme at a key industry conference in Kuala Lumpur next week. “Demand in the Middle East won’t pick up unless the economy is really growing, or we see big names invest in refineries there. This region is not a major demand driver,” said William Simadiputra, an analyst at DBS Vickers. “Demand during Ramadan usually picks up but for a full-year basis we don’t expect much change (from last year),” he said. Demand rises during Ramadan, known for its communal feasting, when the oil is used to prepare meals to break day-long fasts. Egypt, one of the key Middle East consumers, is seen importing 1.25 million tonnes of palm oil in 2017/18, down from 1.32 million tonnes the previous year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Data from the Iranian Vegetable Oil Industry Association showed the country’s palm oil imports ranged between 300,000-400,000 tonnes from 2013 to 2015. “Palm oil usage will stagnate at 400,000-420,000 tonnes a year,” said Saeid Vaygani, an association representative. “Soyoil is widely used in Iran.” Traders say buyers are holding off purchases in hopes of prices falling to the 2,300-2,400 ringgit a tonne range. Palm oil production this year is widely expected to rise this year, recovering after being hit by the El Nino weather pattern and likely bringing lower prices. Benchmark prices was trading around 2,489 ringgit ($636.08) on Friday afternoon. In Southeast Asia, industry players don’t see significant uptakes of palm oil without government policy action to promote it, or a reduction in other edible oil supplies. The Philippines, one of the region’s most populated countries, relies on coconut oil, and while Myanmar is seeing some pick-up in palm oil demand the gains are not significant, said David Ng, a derivatives specialist at Phillip Futures. “This is not a major market for palm. It needs promotional effort before we see contributions from these countries getting higher.” $1 = 3.9130 ringgit

2018-03-06,"(Repeats late Monday item, no change to text) By Drazen Jorgic ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Reuters) - As U.S. influence in Islamabad wanes, Pakistan’s former adversary Russia is building military, diplomatic and economic ties that could upend historic alliances in the region and open up a fast-growing gas market for Moscow’s energy companies. Russia’s embrace of Pakistan comes at a time when relations between the United States and its historical ally are unravelling over the war in Afghanistan, a remarkable turnaround from the 1980s, when Pakistan helped funnel weapons and U.S. spies across the border to aid Afghan fighters battling Soviet troops. Though the Moscow-Islamabad rapprochement is in its infancy, and it is neighbour China that is filling the growing void left by the United States in Pakistan, a slew of energy deals and growing military cooperation promise to spark life into the Russia-Pakistan relationship that was dead for many decades. “It is an opening,” Khurram Dastgir Khan, Pakistan’s defence minister, told Reuters. “Both countries have to work through the past to open the door to the future.” The cosier diplomatic ties have so far focused on Afghanistan, where Russia has cultivated ties to the Afghan Taliban militants who are fighting U.S. troops and have historic links to Islamabad. Moscow says it is encouraging peace negotiations. Both Russia and Pakistan are also alarmed by the presence of Islamic State (IS) inside Afghanistan, with Moscow concerned the group’s fighters could spread towards central Asia and closer to home. In Pakistan, IS has already carried out major attacks. “We have common ground on most issues at diplomatic levels,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told Reuters. “It’s a relationship that will grow substantially in the future.” During a trip to Moscow last month by Pakistan’s foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, the two countries announced plans to establish a commission on military cooperation to combat the threat of IS in the region. They also agreed to continue annual military training exercises that began in 2016 and followed the sale of four Russian attack helicopters to Pakistan, as well as the purchase of Russian engines for the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 fighter jets that Pakistan’s military assembles on its own soil. The detente has been watched with suspicion by Pakistan’s neighbour and arch-foe India, which broadly stood in the Soviet camp during the Cold War era. In the last two decades, the close Russia-India relationship has been underpinned by huge arms sales by Moscow to a country it calls a “strategic partner”. “If the Russians start backing the Pakistanis in a big way at the political level, then it creates a problem for us,” said Sushant Sareen, a leading expert on India’s relations to Pakistan and Afghanistan with New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. India’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Russia’s ties with Pakistan, but has previously said that its own relations with Moscow have stood the test of time, and that the two nations are building up defence and energy relations, including collaboration on nuclear reactors in India. Russian overtures to Pakistan offer a badly needed diplomatic lifeline for the South Asian nation as it faces growing friction with Western powers over its alleged links to militants. At U.S. urging, and with backing from Britain, France and Germany, a global financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), last month decided to place Pakistan back on its watchlist of countries with inadequate terrorist-financing controls, potentially hurting Pakistan’s fragile economy. The U.S. move, which Islamabad angrily dismissed as an effort to “embarrass” Pakistan, followed Washington’s announcement in January to suspend $2 billion in military assistance. Asif, Pakistan’s foreign minister, said his nation made a historical error by “tilting 100 percent” to the West and was now eager build alliances closer to home with the likes of China, Russia and Turkey. “We want to correct the imbalance of our foreign policy over 70 years,” Asif told Reuters. “We are not divorcing that relationship (with the West). But we want to have a balance in our relationships, we want to be closer to our friends in our region.” Defence minister Khan said Pakistan’s military, which has historically been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons and aircraft, may have no choice but to ramp up purchases from the likes of Russia. The cooling relationship with Washington is already pushing Islamabad closer to China, which is investing about $60 billion in infrastructure in Pakistan. But analysts say Pakistan is wary of becoming overly dependent diplomatically on Beijing. Pakistan is among several nations that have been courted by Moscow after falling out with Washington, including the Philippines and Qatar, but Russia’s long-term aims for the Pakistan relationship are unclear, according to Petr Topychkanov, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. “It’s not very transparent, even in Russia,” he said. “There is no serious public debate, there is no detailed explanation to the Russian public about what Russia wants in Pakistan.” Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Moscow’s increasingly close relations with Pakistan. Russia and Pakistan are negotiating potential energy deals worth in excess of $10 billion, according to Pakistani energy officials. Asif said four to five huge power projects “will cement our relationship further”. Russia last month appointed an honorary council in the Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, where its companies are in talks to build an oil refinery and a power station. But the biggest deals focus on gas supply and infrastructure to Pakistan, one of the world’s fastest growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) import markets. “On a strategic basis, Russia is coming in very fast on the energy side,” said a senior Pakistani energy official. In October, Pakistan and Russia signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on energy, paving the way for Russian state-giant Gazprom to enter negotiations to supply LNG to Pakistan. The talks are expected to conclude within three months and Gazprom is considered “one of the front-runners” to clinch a long-term supply deal, according to the Pakistani official. Based on two monthly LNG cargo deliveries, that deal would be worth about $9 billion over 15 years, he added. There is also growing confidence that a gas pipeline due to be built by Russia, stretching 1,100 km (680 miles) from Lahore to the port city of Karachi, will go ahead. U.S. sanctions against Russian state conglomerate Rostec, as well as a dispute over North-South pipeline transport fees, have held up the $2 billion project since it was signed in 2015. The North-South pipeline would be the biggest infrastructure deal by Russia since early 1970s, when Soviet engineers constructed the Pakistan Steel Mills industrial complex. A Russian company, according to defence minister Khan, is eying up a deal to take over the disused Soviet-built steel mills.

2018-03-06,"* No trade talks until palm oil issue resolved - minister * EU’s draft curbs restrict use of palm oil in biodiesel (Adds minister comment, details) By Emily Chow and Naveen Thukral KUALA LUMPUR, March 6 (Reuters) - Malaysia will respond with “might and tact” if the European Union proceeds with a plan to limit use of palm oil in biodiesel, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday. “Malaysia does not want a trade war with Europe but if one is foisted on us, we will respond with might and tact,” said Mah Siew Keong, Malaysia’s minister for plantation industries and commodities, speaking at an industry conference in Kuala Lumpur. The E.U. in mid-January approved draft measures to reform its power market and reduce energy consumption to meet more ambitious climate goals. The draft includes banning the usage of palm oil in motor fuels from 2021. Mah said Malaysia, the world’s second-biggest producer of the oil used in everything from soap to foodstuffs, would withhold cooperation on trade talks if the E.U. move is confirmed. A significant portion of the palm oil exported to the E.U. is used as feedstock to make biofuel, leaving Malaysia’s producers fearing overall demand will fall. “There will be no trade negotiations until we solve the palm oil issue,” Mah said in a speech, describing the E.U.’s plan as “discrimination”. The European Union is the world’s second-largest palm oil importer after India, having bought 6.7 million tonnes in 2016/17, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Commenting on India’s recent move to increase import duties on palm oil, Mah said the trend of increasing duties is a protectionist policy. “We will write to our Indian counterparts to ask them to consider,” he told, speaking to reporters at a news conference after his speech. India has raised import tax on crude and refined palm oil to the highest level in more than a decade, the government said in a statement last Thursday, in a move designed to support local farmers.

2018-03-06,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican and U.S. officials pushed on Monday to speed up NAFTA negotiations, with the United States floating the idea of reaching an agreement “in principle” in coming weeks to avoid political headwinds later this year. U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, showing impatience at the slow pace of the talks, said Mexico’s presidential election and the looming expiry of a congressional negotiating authorization in July put the onus on the United States, Mexico and Canada to come up with a plan soon. “We probably have a month, or a month and a half, or something to get an agreement in principle,” Lighthizer told reporters at the conclusion of a seventh round of talks to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement in Mexico City. He was speaking after meeting Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo and Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland for a joint event marked by a more cordial mood than in previous rounds, despite major disagreements over U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose steel tariffs. Trump has threatened to dump NAFTA unless it boosts U.S.  manufacturing and employment, arguing the 1994 accord has caused the migration of jobs and factories southward to lower-cost Mexico. Guajardo told reporters the three countries aimed to hold lower-level discussions on NAFTA over the next five weeks before an eighth round, probably in early April. During that period, he and his two counterparts also aimed to meet to narrow differences on the most complex issues in the talks, which include agreeing on new auto content rules, a dispute-resolution mechanism and agricultural market access. Lighthizer said time to rework the deal was running “very short” and again raised the possibility of the United States pursuing bilateral deals with its partners - albeit stressing that his government would prefer a three-way agreement. He said the United States was making more headway with its southern neighbor than with Canada. Freeland declined to give details on a prospective timeline for the next round and said alongside Lighthizer that Trump’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum imports was “unacceptable”. The U.S. trade promotion authority, or TPA, is authorized by Congress and is needed to implement legislation for new trade agreements such as the renegotiation of NAFTA. The TPA expires on July 1 and analysts expect it to be extended. The United States also holds congressional elections in November. Early on Monday, the U.S. president ratcheted up tension before the ministerial meetings in Mexico by tweeting that “Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.” Lighthizer said that meant Canada and Mexico would enjoy tariff exemptions once a NAFTA deal was reached, calling the tariffs an “incentive” to conclude the talks.  Canada and Mexico say they should be exempted from such moves, and have warned they could retaliate.  Guajardo said there would be no concessions made in the NAFTA negotiations to placate Trump on steel and aluminum, while Freeland said the two issues were separate. Guajardo urged all sides, however, to avoid a trade war and said Mexico would wait for a U.S. decision. If the United States did impose tariffs, a response should be tailored to the sector in question to avoid complicating other issues, he added. “Contaminating strategies just ends up making you escalate the nature of the conflicts,” Guajardo said. Talks to overhaul the 24-year-old pact are moving slowly, in part because Canada and Mexico have resisted U.S. demands to boost the North American content of autos produced inside NAFTA. When asked about the discussions on the rules of origin for autos, Guajardo noted that no trade deal could depend only on the interests of one particular sector. Although Mexico holds its election in July, it will not change governments until December, and Guajardo pledged to keep negotiating for as “as long as necessary” while President Enrique Pena Nieto’s administration is in office. Lighthizer said only six chapters had been concluded since talks began in August. Negotiators are working on 30 chapters overall, he said, including a new one on energy.  Uncertainty over the talks, and the potential for a wider global trade war, are making investors nervous.  During the latest round, negotiators concluded talks on rules governing food safety and animal health, good regulatory practices, plus administration and publication, officials said.

2018-03-06,"(Repeats March 5 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2D1lwfo By John Kemp LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Hedge funds rediscovered some of their confidence in the oil market in the final week of February, as OPEC reiterated its commitment to output restraint and benchmark prices stabilised above $60 per barrel. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 68 million barrels in the week to Feb. 27. Portfolio managers boosted their net long position for the first time after reducing it by a total of 263 million barrels over the previous four weeks, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. Net length increased in Brent (+21 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (+18 million barrels), European gasoil (+15 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (+9 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (+5 million barrels). The mild bout of liquidation that occurred between mid-January and the middle of February appears to have run its course without making much of a dent in hedge fund long positions (tmsnrt.rs/2D1lwfo). Fund managers still hold more than 11 long futures and options positions for every short across the petroleum complex, not far off the record set at the end of January. Bullish positions in crude and refined fuels remain at levels that had never been recorded before the start of this year, with fund managers holding long positions amounting to more than 1,400 million barrels. Yet few dare express a contrary bearish view. Short positions actually declined by 11 million barrels in the most recent week to just 126 million, the lowest level since June 2014, when Islamist militants were threatening the oilfields of northern Iraq. Lopsided hedge fund positioning remains an important source of downside risk to oil prices if and when fund managers try to realise some of their profits. For the time being, however, most portfolio managers seem convinced prices will rise further before the eventual correction. Global growth remains strong and oil consumption is set to increase by more than 1.5 million barrels per day for the fourth year running in 2018. Most of the excess inventories that accumulated between 2014 and 2016 have been eliminated, with oil stocks in industrialised countries now reduced close to the five-year average. Production from U.S. shale plays is rising strongly but OPEC’s willingness to sacrifice market share to support prices has convinced many investors that downside risk is limited in the near term. For now, the oil market remains locked in a bullish phase (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex systems”, Sornette, 2003). The bull market has survived its first test of resolve, but there will be others.

2018-03-06,"* Global shares snap four-day losing streak on Monday * Nikkei up 2 pct, Australia gain 1.2 pct, Korea 1.0 pct * Trade war fears ease after backlash against Trump’s plan * Euro shrugs off inconclusive Italian election By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, March 6 (Reuters) - Asian share regained some ground on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump faced growing pressure from political allies to pull back from proposed steel and aluminium tariffs, easing investor worries about an imminent trade war. The impact of Italy’s inconclusive election results was limited to a mild sell-off in Italian bonds and stocks, with the euro gaining support from the creation of a coalition government in Germany. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent while Japan’s Nikkei jumped 2.0 percent, a day after it hit a five-month low. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets snapped four-day losing streak on Monday by notching up 0.67 percent. It added 0.16 percent in Asia on Tuesday. Wall Street shares have now recouped all the losses incurred after Trump unveiled a plan to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium late on Thursday. Leading Republicans, including House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady, turned up the pressure on Trump to rethink the plan on Monday. Some investors also saw the tariffs threats as a U.S. negotiating tactic to get a better deal on NAFTA. Still, concerns over a trade war were far from dispelled, with Trump describing them as “easy to win”, repeating his earlier comments. Trump was expected to finalise the planned tariffs later in the week, although some observers familiar with the process said it could occur next week. The spectre of a trade war was not the only source of concerns for the stock market. As the global economy steams ahead, investors have become increasingly concerned that U.S. inflation, which has been subdued since the 2008 financial crisis, could finally pick up. While moderate inflation generally supports equity investors, rapid inflation, or fear of it, could prompt the Federal Reserve to hike rates faster, undermining the attraction of equities. “Given the importance of bond yields to equity valuation, equity investors are affected by potential changes in bond yields just as much as fixed-income investors,” said Colin Moore, Global Chief Investment Officer at Boston-based Columbia Threadneedle Investments. “In the current environment, although inflation appears to be increasing, it’s still not likely to cause 10-year yields to rise to levels that would be problematic for equities. I estimate that problematic level to be a 4 percent yield.” U.S. bond yields rose as Wall Street shares rallied. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rose back to 2.883 percent from last week’s low of 2.793 percent. A break of last month’s peak of 2.957 percent could trigger fresh selling in Treasuries, traders say. In the currency market, the euro traded at $1.2333, extending its recovery from a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday. The euro managed to recover losses made on Monday after two anti-establishment leaders made early plays to govern Italy following an inconclusive election where voters shunted mainstream parties to the sidelines. As none of the three main factions had enough seats to govern alone, President Sergio Mattarella is expected to open formal coalition talks in April, with early elections possible if no accord is found. “With any coalition that can be formed likely to have a right of centre bias, this ought to be bad for the euro but the German election result appears to have counterbalanced any detrimental effects. We are holding to our pre-election stance that this is not the time to be adding Italian risk,” said Paul Hatfield, Global Co-Chief Investment Officer at Alcentra, part of BNY Mellon Investment Management. The dollar fetched 106.18 yen, crawling back from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday on improved risk appetite. The Canadian dollar hit an eight-month low of C$1.3002 per U.S. dollar as U.S. President Donald Trump used proposed tariffs on steel and aluminium as a bargaining chip in talks to revamp NAFTA. Crude prices rose with the U.S. stock market on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns that output from OPEC producers would grow at a much slower pace in coming years. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures traded almost flat at $62.63 per barrel after 2.2 percent gain on Monday.

2018-03-06,"WASHINGTON, March 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has alarmed the Republican establishment and world leaders by threatening tough steel tariffs, a message that might be meant not just to shake the world trade order but to help defend a congressional seat in Pennsylvania. Some Republican strategists said Trump’s tariff threat appeared to be timed, at least in part, to sway voters in the steel country of Pennsylvania, including its 18th District where Republican Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb are facing off. In a special election on March 13, the two will vie to replace Republican Tim Murphy, who resigned in October in a sex scandal. If Saccone loses, it would be a blow to Trump, the first loss by Republicans of a seat in the House of Representatives since he took office in January 2017. The results will not affect Republican control of the chamber. Trump has endorsed Saccone and is scheduled to visit the Pittsburgh area on Saturday for a campaign event. Saccone met Trump on arrival for a similar event in January. Republican strategist Ford O’Connell said Trump’s stance on steel and aluminum tariffs could help Republicans, not only in southwestern Pennsylvania, but across the industrial Midwest. “The timing definitely helps Saccone,” O’Connell said. The 18th District covers steel, farm and coal country on the West Virginia border, as well as well-to-do Pittsburgh suburbs. Trump won the district by nearly 20 points in the November 2016 presidential election, helping him carry the pivotal battleground state. But in recent political races in other states, Democrats, upset by Trump policies, have been energized to turn out to vote. In the Pennsylvania race, Lamb is rising in the polls and is neck and neck with Saccone, who has said: “I was Trump before Trump was Trump.” Peter Navarro, the White House trade and manufacturing policy director, defended Trump’s trade plan on Fox Business Network’s “Varney & Co.” show on Monday. “Of course, if you go to Ohio or Pennsylvania, or you go to the heartland of American Main Street, there’s universal support,” he said. Trump threatened to impose 25 percent steel and 10 percent aluminum tariffs in an announcement on Thursday, prompting a steep stock sell-off and expressions of concern about a possible trade war from Washington to foreign capitals. Establishment Republicans should not be surprised that Trump is following through on his tough-on-trade campaign pledge, said Chris Barron, a pro-Trump Republican strategist. “If Republicans are going to hold on to the majority in the House, they need to hold on in places like Pennsylvania. This is a winner,” he said, adding the rally on Saturday would be good for Trump, who will get positive feedback from the crowd. “It’s going to be hard to talk the president back from that, because he’s going to feel first-hand that support from those grassroots working-class voters,” Barron said. Democrats said the tariff issue would likely be a factor in the 18th District race, but one that would cut two ways. Pennsylvania Democratic strategist Mike Mikus said: “The issue of steel tariffs is a very popular idea here in western Pennsylvania. However, I don’t believe it will be enough to help Rick Saccone in this election. I don’t view it as a game-changer because the issue has been championed by Democrats for so long.” Republican strategist Mike DeVanney said tariff rhetoric may help Saccone, but that any boost could be muted in the diverse district. He added that the president’s comments could backfire. “It’s not without risks in equally energizing Lamb’s base,” DeVanney said. “President Trump is obviously a figure who can energize and divide, depending on who’s listening.” Writing by Kevin Drawbaugh and Peter Cooney",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-election-pennsylvania-trade/trumps-tariff-threat-may-be-timed-for-pennsylvania-u-s-house-race-idUKL2N1QK1WL,06 Mar 2018,"President Donald Trump has
