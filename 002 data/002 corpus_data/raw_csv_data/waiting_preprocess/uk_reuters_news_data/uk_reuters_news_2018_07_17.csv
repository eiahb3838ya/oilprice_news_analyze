Joint venture Aliança Geração de Energia SA is evaluating Renova’s Alto Sertão III complex in the northeastern state of Bahia, which when complete will have capacity of roughly 400 megawatts, the sources said, declining to be named as the talks are confidential. Renova Energia and Cemig did not immediately respond to request for comment. Aliança Geração declined to comment. The complex has generated interest among half a dozen potential buyers, including Aliança Geração, one of the people said. “There are various proposed buyers, not just Aliança. No one has been given exclusivity,” a second source said. The sources declined to name other potential buyers. Renova, which is owned by Cemig and its subsidiary Light SA , had tentatively agreed to sell Alto Sertão III to a unit of Brookfield Asset Management Inc for 650 million reais ($169.13 million) but the deal was later called off. Renova had invested 390 million reais in the project before halting work at the end of 2016 due to lack of resources.

2018-07-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil futures steadied on Tuesday as the focus turned to falling inventories in the United States and further output constraints in Venezuela and Libya.  Supply disruptions in Venezuela returned to the forefront as two of the country’s four crude upgraders are scheduled to undergo maintenance in the next few weeks. The units have the ability to process a combined 700,000 barrels per day, and are used to prepare extra-heavy oil for export. “Every time there’s an update that the situation in Venezuela is, in fact, worsening, it props up the market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.   U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) CLc1 settled up 2 cents at $68.08 a barrel.   Brent futures LCOc1 rose 32 cents to $72.16 a barrel, after earlier trading as low as $71.35 a barrel, its lowest level since April 17.  In addition to Venezuela’s falling output, traders are looking at U.S. inventories, which are expected to decline 3.5 million barrels in the week to July 13, according to a preliminary Reuters poll.  Oil prices fell in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude inventories rose by 629,000 barrels in the week ending July 13, to 410.7 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.6 million barrels. The market is seeking clear signals on supply, including whether the United States will release crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve and whether Libya’s oil production will rebound following military clashes in late June and early July, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. “You really have to see how much Saudi is going to produce, along with Russia,” he said.  Oil prices have fallen by almost 10 percent over the past week as crude export terminals in Libya have reopened and exports from other OPEC countries and Russia have increased. But late on Tuesday, Libya’s National Oil Corp said it had declared force majeure on crude oil loadings at Zawiya port as of Monday. This contractual provision allows the oil producer to halt deliveries if production falls for reasons beyond its control. The oil company said output from its Sharara field had fallen by 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) following the recent attack and kidnapping of four employees of the oil company Akakus at the field.  Production from seven major U.S. shale oil formations is expected to rise by 143,000 bpd to a record 7.47 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. Output is expected to rise in all seven formations. Intercontinental Exchange (ICE.N) announced plans to launch a contract for WTI crude deliverable in Houston, compared with the current WTI contract that has its delivery point at the Cushing, Oklahoma, storage hub. The new contract will facilitate crude purchases for foreign buyers that export the crude. The contract underscores the rising volumes of crude from the Permian that are increasingly available for export.  Also undermining prices is concern that the growing trade dispute between the United States and other major trading blocs, particularly China, could dampen economic activity and squeeze oil demand. China this week reported slightly slower growth for the second quarter and the weakest expansion in factory activity in June in two years, suggesting a further softening in business conditions in the coming months as trade pressures build. Beijing’s state planning agency said it was still confident of hitting its economic growth target of around 6.5 percent this year, despite views that it faces a bumpy second half as the trade dispute with Washington intensifies. Goldman Sachs said it expects price volatility to remain elevated, keeping Brent in a $70-$80 per barrel range in the short term. “Supply shifts, alongside the ongoing surge in Saudi production, create the risk that the oil market moves into surplus” in the third quarter, the report said.

2018-07-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose on Tuesday against a basket of major currencies following an upbeat economic assessment from the head of the U.S. Federal Reserve, while world stocks climbed as a heavy week of corporate earnings also kicked into gear. Wall Street’s main indexes erased losses from the start of the session to end solidly positive. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield rose to its highest level in nearly a decade, with the yield curve at its flattest in nearly 11 years.  In testimony, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he sees the United States on track for years more of steady growth.  “He reiterated the view of the economy as being strong, growing at a solid pace with recent inflation data as more or less encouraging,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. Powell was challenged in a congressional hearing by senators worried the Trump administration’s trade policies were already damaging businesses. Concerns over a global trade dispute have roiled markets over the past few months. But in written testimony to the Senate Banking Committee and in his response to questions about a possible “trade war,” Powell largely discounted the risks.  “He basically completely dismissed any concerns about a trade tariff war,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55.53 points, or 0.22 percent, to 25,119.89, the S&P 500 gained 11.12 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,809.55 and the Nasdaq Composite added 49.40 points, or 0.63 percent, to 7,855.12. As a busy week of corporate earnings began, Netflix Inc shares dropped 5.2 percent after the company’s subscriber growth fell short of Wall Street expectations, while Johnson & Johnson shares gained 3.5 percent, boosting the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials, after the healthcare company’s results topped estimates. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.26 percent, helped by Powell’s testimony, amid a batch of mixed company updates. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. The dollar index, tracked against a basket of major currencies, rose 0.47 percent, with the euro down 0.4 percent to $1.1662. Sterling dropped to a four-month low against the euro and a roughly three-week trough versus the dollar as investors expected more Brexit challenges after Theresa May’s government only narrowly won a vote on a trade bill before the British parliament. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8637 percent, from 2.856 percent late on Monday.  The spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields hovered at its tightest level since July 2007, as Powell’s comments supported traders’ views of further rate increases from the U.S. central bank. Crude oil prices steadied after falling steeply on Monday as the focus turned to falling inventories in the United States and further output constraints in Venezuela and Libya. U.S. crude settled up 2 cents at $68.08 per barrel and Brent settled at $72.16, up 32 cents, or 0.45 percent.

2018-07-17,"BARCELONA, July 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Grinding poverty and climate change are pushing communities in West Africa’s Sahel region into the arms of extremist groups like Boko Haram, but providing people with clean energy could help slow that trend, said a top international official. Rachel Kyte, CEO of Sustainable Energy for All, set up by the United Nations, learned on a trip to Niger this month how women and girls are being recruited by Islamist militants who offer them work, food and other essentials. Kyte, who serves as the U.N. Secretary-General’s special representative on energy access, said Boko Haram “is moving into the provision of basic social services”. At the same time, in impoverished Niger, recurring and more intense drought “is absolutely punishing”, she said. The Islamist group is based in northeast Nigeria but active in other West African states. Kyte said villagers needed better ways to grow crops to feed their families and boost incomes to make them less susceptible to the extremists targeting them. U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed, who visited Niger with Kyte, last week spelled out the links between climate change stresses and regional insecurity in remarks to the U.N. Security Council. In rural Niger, where only about 1 percent of people have access to electric power, supplying cheap and green energy - mainly from the sun - could make a difference, Kyte said. For example, solar pumps could drive simple, efficient irrigation systems, and installing small-scale local grids could power cold storage, enabling villagers to process their crops and earn more money, she noted. “It just became very, very clear that without energy, there’s no way to improve incomes - without energy, it’s going to be difficult to bring productivity into the rural economy,” Kyte said in an interview from New York after the visit, organised by the United Nations and the African Union. In addition, equipping hospitals and clinics with solar systems in both cities and rural areas could reduce patient infections and increase the number of operations for common problems like fistula by supplying reliable power, Kyte said. Solar energy could be a way to “beat back and build the resilience of a community to climate change, but also beat back violent extremism”, while “lifting up women and girls whose situation there is just dire”, she added. Kyte urged government donors and international development banks to think about how access to clean, modern energy enables people to get sufficient food and medical treatment, and earn a decent living. In a place like Niger, having electricity can be a decisive factor in whether people leave their homes and head north to Europe seeking a better life, she added. It can also reduce the financial need for poor families to marry their daughters off early. “This is about using aid money and development finance... to start building a different value proposition for these people that is something that will allow them to stay where they come from, and would allow girls to be part of that economic future,” she said.

2018-07-17,"(Adds detail, background) TRIPOLI, July 17 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday it had declared force majeure on exports from Zawiya oil terminal as production at Sharara oilfield dropped to 125,000 barrels per day (bpd). Production at Sharara, where some staff were evacuated after two workers were abducted on Saturday, was enough to supply Zawiya refinery but left no excess for export, the NOC said in a statement. Force majeure, a legal waiver on contractual obligations, had commenced on Monday, NOC said. “Employee safety is always our first priority. This incident required us to shutdown and evacuate a number of stations,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in the statement. “We have to prioritize local demand for fuel. For the time being all, Sharara production will go to the refinery,” he said. Sharara, which was previously pumping around 300,000 bpd, has been key to a fragile recovery in Libya’s national production over the past two years. The OPEC member’s output rose to about 1 million bpd a little more than a year ago, but has continued to fluctuate due to blockades, security problems and political conflict. Tripoli-based NOC operates Sharara in partnership with Repsol, Total, OMV and Equinor , formerly known as Statoil. An unknown armed group abducted the workers, one Libyan and one Romanian, from a control station on the periphery of the field on Saturday.

2018-07-17,"* Talks to lay ground for new gas transit deal * Ukraine sees gas transit as guarantor of its independence * Countries agree further rounds of talks (Adds Ukraine’s comments) BERLIN, July 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Russia said they will hold further European Union-mediated talks on supplying Europe with Russian gas, in a key first step towards renewing Ukraine’s gas transit contract that expires at the end of next year. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, who chaired a three-way meeting in Berlin with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, said he hoped talks will continue with separate political and expert rounds every six to eight weeks. The talks have been complicated by a lengthy legal dispute between Russian and Ukraine’s energy companies, resulting in court rulings in February that both must compensate each other. Naftogaz emerged the net winner, however, gaining $2.56 billion from Gazprom. With Russia embroiled in conflict with Kiev over breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east and the European Union reliant on Russian gas to fuel its industries, the future of gas transit - seen by Kiev as a crucial guarantor of its independence from Moscow - is the object of intricate diplomacy. Ukraine has been a key route for carrying Russian gas to Europe where it supplies around a third of gas needs, but Moscow and Kiev have clashed frequently over energy, leading to growing concern about renewing the transit agreement. “The clock is ticking, and if we look at the calendar we see the end of 2019 is just round the corner,” Sefcovic told a news conference after the meeting, also attended by the heads of Russian gas giant Gazprom and Ukraine’s Naftogaz. German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, who had invited the parties to Berlin, said he was optimistic that the two sides would eventually agree on a way of continuing gas transit. Ukraine, a sovereign state that was once ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union, believes its role in transmitting Russian gas gives it leverage to help guarantee its security in the face of Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula and backing for separatists in the East. But the talks did not yield agreement on the volumes that Russia might transmit in future. Sefcovic said he wanted to see “substantial volumes which would guarantee commercially viable transit” from 2020 onwards. Last year, the transit amounted to more than 93 bcm, while Gazprom’s total exports to Europe and Turkey reached an all-time high of 194 bcm. Gazprom plans to raise gas exports to Europe to a new record of 200 bcm. Ukraine’s transit role is also imperiled by the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline which would directly link Russia with Germany via the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine. But Altmaier said rising gas demand meant Ukrainian transit would be needed regardless. Speaking at a separate Berlin news conference after the meeting, Novak was bullish on growing European demand. “We see that consumption in Europe is growing, it was around 6 percent in the first half of the year,” he said. “In the next 5 - 10 years the supply volumes to the European consumers will be higher than in 2017 and 2018. We can talk about additional growth of 10-15 percent.” Russian gas giant Gazprom and  Ukraine’s oil and gas firm Naftogaz have been involved in a lengthy legal battle over transit and supply deals. A Stockholm court found in Naftogaz’s favour in the final stage in February. Gazprom is challenging the ruling in the same court, while Novak said on Tuesday the possibility of an amicable solution has been “touched upon”, which irked Ukraine. “The Russian attempt to agree on an out-of-court settlement of the cases, on which the Stockholm tribunal had already made a ruling, shall not pass,” Klimkin said in his twitter feed.

2018-07-17,"BASRA/BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - Iraqi police wielded batons and rubber hoses to disperse about 250 protesters gathered at the main entrance to the Zubair oilfield near Basra on Tuesday as unrest across southern cities over poor basic services gathered pace. Since demonstrations began nine days ago, protesters have attacked government buildings, branches of political parties and powerful Shi’ite militias and stormed the international airport in the holy city of Najaf. Tensions focused attention on the performance of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who is seeking a second term after May 12 parliamentary elections tainted by allegations of fraud that prompted a recount. In his weekly news conference on Tuesday, Abadi promised to work with protesters to fight corruption and said the government would improve services. Officials and industry sources said the protests have not affected output at Zubair, run by Italy’s Eni, and the other major oilfields including Rumaila developed by BP and West Qurna 2 managed by Lukoil. There were no reports of employees evacuating oil fields. But some foreigners took precautions. “We asked the Japanese company to speed the building of the Basra major water project and to start test operations to pump water to Basra,” Abadi told the news conference.  “But the bad news is the Japanese experts left due to threats. They also feared violent actions and the acts of aggression and setting fire to institutions.” He did not specify what kind of threats. Many Iraqis believe their leaders do not share the country’s oil wealth. Some demonstrators said foreign labourers were robbing them of employment at oil companies.  Three protesters have been killed in clashes with police, including one at West Qurna 2, and dozens wounded. Dozens of policemen were also injured. “We the people of Basra hear about the Iraqi oil and its huge revenues, but we never enjoy its benefits,” said 24-year-old protester Esam Jabbar.   “Strangers have decent jobs at our oilfields and we don’t have the money to pay for a cigarette. That’s wrong and must be stopped.” Jabbar said he was unemployed. At the gate of Zubair field, police beat protesters on their backs and legs with batons and rubber hoses, witnesses said. Blood ran down one policeman’s face after protesters hurled stones. Policemen also threw sand to put out tyres that the protesters had set ablaze. Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia. Crude exports account for 95 percent of state revenue and any disruptions could badly damage its already limping economy at a time when Iraq needs tens of billions of dollars to rebuild after the three-year war with Islamic State. Prolonged instability in the south could drive up global oil prices. Production at the Zubair field was 475,000 bpd, an Iraqi oil official said in May. Iraq exported an average of 3.566 million barrels per day from its southern oilfields so far in July, said senior oil officials, levels confirming that the troubles have not disrupted crude shipments from the region. Demonstrators, who have endured sweltering heat to press their demands, show no sign of letting up. They have vented anger in Basra, the biggest city in the south, Samawa, Amara, Nassiriya, Najaf, Kerbala and Hilla. “We will not allow anyone to tamper with security and order by encroaching on public, private and government institutions and also economic institutions,” military spokesman Brigadier General Yahya Rasool told a news conference. Politicians are struggling to form a coalition government. Populist Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose political bloc won the majority in the poll, may now be in a stronger position to influence the choice of prime minister. He defeated Iranian-backed rivals by promising to generate jobs, help the poor and eradicate corruption. The Shi’ite heartland south has long been neglected despite its oil wealth, first by Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein and then Shi’ite-led governments after him, including Abadi’s. Fetid piles of garbage can be seen on many Basra streets. Stagnant water with sewage has caused health problems and tap water is sometime contaminated with mud and dust. Electricity is cut off for seven hours a day. Murtadha Rahman, 22, ran barefoot on the scorching pavement to try and escape a charge by police outside the Zubair field. “I live in a place which is rich with oil that brings billions of dollars while I work in collecting garbage to desperately feed my two kids. I want a simple job, that’s my only demand,” said Rahman, who said he was beaten by police. “I won’t go even if you kill me I will stay her. I want a job.” Reporting by Aref Mohammed, additional reporting by Ahmed Rasheed, writing by Michael Georgy, editing by Angus MacSwan and Richard Balmforth",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iraq-protests/update-6-iraqi-police-disperse-protesters-outside-zubair-oilfield-as-unrest-grows-idUKL8N1UD17I,17 Jul 2018,"* Officials say output not affected

2018-07-17,"(Reuters) - Private equity firm Carlyle Group LP (CG.O) is looking to raise a $4 billion fund for investing in oil and gas assets outside North America, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. The fund will be used to buy companies in the energy supply chain and through these companies, assets in exploration and production, refining, marketing and oilfield services will be bought, the FT reported. Carlyle was not immediately available for comment. “Not so many investors are deploying money in Africa, the North Sea and Russia, so there is an opportunity,” an institutional investor, with direct knowledge of the new fund, told the newspaper. Carlyle’s London-based team is exploring investments in Europe, Africa, Latin America and Asia, according to the FT report. Two of the company’s top executives met investors on Tuesday, the report said, citing two people at the gathering.

2018-07-17,"(Adds quotes from traders, analysts, recasts lead paragraph, changes headline) July 17 (Reuters) - Intercontinental Exchange on Tuesday said it would launch a crude oil futures contract deliverable in Houston later this quarter, capitalizing on the growth in U.S. exports of crude oil that have risen to about 2 million barrels a day. Houston has become the pricing center for U.S. crude oil production and exports, and the new contract is designed to serve hedging and trading opportunities in that market, ICE said in a statement. ICE said the Permian WTI futures contract will provide price discovery, settlement and delivery at Magellan Midstream Partners terminal in East Houston. Brokers and market participants said the Houston crude market has ample liquidity as Gulf Coast grades are regularly traded by exporters and foreign buyers of U.S. crude. ICE’s move is expected to boost liquidity further and make hedging for export cargos more flexible. Companies are currently spending millions of dollars building infrastructure to facilitate trading and storage up and down the Gulf Coast, and producers are increasingly shipping crude directly to seaports such as Houston. A new futures contract in Houston “should only help the Permian assets develop more quickly,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York. “It’ll enable banks and other lenders to know where they stand on the value of Permian crude.” Banks could use the forward curve of the futures contract to assess the value of proposed infrastructure projects in the Permian, he said. The primary U.S. futures contract takes delivery at the storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, and has been doing so since the contract was started in the early 1980s. Storage there has been declining of late in a sign of the hub’s waning influence as the primary measuring stick for the U.S. oil market. “Although Cushing is a marker for local crude fundamentals in the mid-continent, it diverges for pricing waterborne U.S. crude,” said Jeff Barbuto, vice president of oil markets at ICE. Speculative trading could increase sharply in the Houston market if traders decide it is “a viable product,” said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. “We’re in a wait-and-see mode,” Zahir said. “Are banks really going to be behind it? Are there going to be large market makers in it? We’ll watch it.” (Reporting by Nallur Sethuraman in Bengaluru, Collin Eaton in Houston and Devika Krishna Kumar in New York Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Chris Reese)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-oil-houston/update-1-ice-to-launch-houston-oil-contract-building-on-export-growth-idUKL1N1UD0W0,17 Jul 2018,"Intercontinental Exchange on

In written testimony for the Senate Banking Committee, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy was on the cusp of “several years” of the job market remaining strong and inflation remaining around the Fed’s 2 percent target. Asset moves were generally modest following Powell’s prepared remarks, in which he signalled he believed the economy was doing well and that an era of stable growth may continue, provided the Fed gets its policy decisions right. The U.S. dollar pared gains against a basket of currencies immediately following the release of the testimony, but then bounced back. “I suspect the market was pricing itself for a potential hawkish surprise, which it didn’t get,” said Richard Franulovich, head of FX strategy at Westpac Banking Corporation in New York. “But I mean when you parse the comments there’s nothing dovish in there.

2018-07-17,"* Talks to lay ground for new gas transit deal * Ukraine sees gas transit as guarantor of its independence * Very little concrete emerged from initial talks BERLIN, July 17 (Reuters) - German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said he was optimistic that Russian gas would continue to reach Europe via Ukraine in future after he hosted talks between top officials from the two countries aimed at laying the ground for a new transit contract. With Russia embroiled in conflict over breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east and the European Union reliant on Russian gas to fuel its industries, the future of gas transit - seen by Kiev as a crucial guarantor of its independence from Moscow - is the object of intricate diplomacy. “We expect there to be difficult discussions, but it is possible to find solutions that the security interests of Ukraine can be justified long after 2020 and substantial gas transit via Ukraine to Europe will continue,” Altmaier said. He and European Union energy commissioner Maros Sefcovic hosted the meeting between Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin that was intended to lead to further meetings. But, highlighting the gulf dividing the parties, very little emerged from the first round of meetings on Tuesday afternoon, with Altmaier and Sefcovic only hoping that they could obtain the two countries’ agreement to further discussions. Ukraine, a sovereign state that was once ruled from Moscow as part of the Soviet Union, believes its role in transmitting Russian gas gives it crucial leverage, helping it guarantee its sovereignty in the face of Russia’s annexation of the Crimean peninsula and backing for separatists in the East. But Sefkovic said parties were far from agreeing on how much gas Russia would continue to send via Ukraine. “We will not go into concrete figures today because we want to set the parameters of the discussions, their sequencing and the frequency of these meetings,” he said, adding that he wanted to see “substantial volumes which would guarantee commercially viable transit” from 2020 onwards. He was optimistic that further meetings could be scheduled from September. Ukraine’s transit role is also imperiled by the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline which would directly link Russia with Germany via the Baltic Sea, bypassing Ukraine - but Altmaier said this topic had not been raised, and that rising gas demand meant Ukrainian transit would be needed regardless. Falling gas production in the Netherlands and depleted reserves, as well as the need to switch from coal to lower-carbon fuels meant that Europe’s consumption would continue rising, he said.

2018-07-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy exploration group Cuadrilla expects to start “fracking” Britain’s first horizontal shale well shortly following years of protests and government reviews into this unconventional way of extracting oil and gas. The unlisted company said on Tuesday it was awaiting government approval to frack the first well at its Lancashire site in northern England before starting work around September. The company has finished drilling a second well at the site. Fracking to extract gas from shale rock is contentious in Britain because of concerns it could contaminate underground water reservoirs and harm the environment above ground. The process involves perforating wells and fracturing rocks by injecting liquids, sands and chemicals to suck in oil and gas. It has transformed the U.S. energy industry but has not taken off across Europe, where some countries have banned it. Cuadrilla said it would run flow tests along the two wells, once fracked, for about six months and the wells would be connected to the local gas grid. “Our objective is to demonstrate that natural gas will flow from the shale in commercially viable quantities,” CEO Francis Egan said in a statement. “We look forward to demonstrating that the UK’s huge shale gas resources can be safely.” The fracking will also help Cuadrilla to assess gas reserves in the Lancashire licence. The British Geological Survey estimates the much broader Bowland Shale region across northern England to hold some 1,329 trillion cubic feet of gas. But estimates get much smaller after companies drill and appraise the rocks and apply commercial considerations such as the cost of extraction.  Other companies are vying to start fracking onshore in Britain. Third Energy, 95-percent-owned by Barclays (BARC.L), is waiting for approval from the government to begin test fracking at its Kirby Misperton site in Yorkshire, northern England. And UKOG (UKOGa.L), through Horse Hills Development Ltd, is getting ready to appraise wells at its Horse Hill site, near London’s Gatwick Airport. For Cuadrilla, fracking the first horizontal shale well would mark a significant turnaround. After Cuadrilla’s first attempt at fracking in 2011 in Blackpool in north-west England there were earth tremors which led to extensive reviews, protests and regulatory change. Cuadrilla said at the time the tremors were caused by an unusual combination of geological features at the site. The debate over fracking is very much alive. Protestors have tried to block Cuadrilla’s drilling as recently as last month despite a court injunction preventing trespass on the site area. Proponents of fracking say Britain could bolster its energy security by developing the shale industry just as oil and gas reserves in the North Sea dwindle.  In Scotland, there has been an effective moratorium on shale drilling although a Scottish court recently ruled the devolved government’s policies did not amount to an outright ban Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Adrian Croft and Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-shale-cuadrilla/update-1-cuadrilla-poised-to-frack-britains-first-horizontal-shale-well-idUKL8N1UD2EV,17 Jul 2018,"Energy exploration group

Brent futures fell to a three-month low as Libyan ports reopened and Russia and other producers said they would increase output. The contracts were trading at $71.95 per barrel at 1207 GMT, after falling as low as $71.35 during the day. Apart from exchanges in Bahrain and Qatar, all the Gulf markets closed in negative territory. In Bahrain, the index was up 0.5 percent as Ahli United Bank climbed 2.3 percent, after Kuwait’s largest Islamic bank, Kuwait Finance House, said it was interested in a  merger with Ahli United. KFH’s shares dropped 1.9 percent. The Qatari index closed 0.1 percent up, lifted by gains in some banks such as Masraf Al Rayan, which added 1.3 percent. The bank announced a profit of 1.07 billion riyals ($293.96 million) on Monday, up 4.5 percent year on year. In Saudi Arabia, the index shed 0.3 percent. Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co fell 1.2 percent and Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) lost 0.5 percent. Riyad Bank, Saudi Arabia’s fourth-largest lender by assets, shed 0.8 percent despite reporting earlier a 25.2 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, in line with analysts’ forecasts. The bank made 1.06 billion riyals ($282.64 million) in the three months to June 30, up from 848 million a year earlier, it said in an exchange filing. Three analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a profit of 1.03 billion riyals. Deposits dipped 2.3 percent to 153.4 billion riyals. In Dubai, where the index shed 0.2 percent, Drake and Scull International (DSI) jumped 2.9 percent after it said on Monday that Tabarak Investment, which has a 13.3 percent stake in the company, will continue to be a strategic investor. DSI has been lagging because of concerns about its financial position, business outlook and the outcome of an investigation by United Arab Emirates authorities into financial violations by previous management. Emaar Properties lost 1 percent after it said it is exploring various financing options to streamline its business. That came in response to a Financial Times article, which said the Dubai developer has put $1.4 billion in assets on sale amid a slump in the real estate market. * The index shed 0.3 percent to 8,463 points. * The index lost 0.2 percent to 2,913 points. * The index slipped 0.2 percent to 4,739 points. * The index gained 0.1 percent to 9,450 points. * The index dropped 0.8 percent to 5,346 points. * The index rose 0.5 percent to 1,358 points. * The index shed 0.1 percent to 4,442 points. * The index dropped 1.5 percent to 15,421 points. $1 = 3.6400 Qatar riyals

2018-07-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - No one likes to predict recession, but the global economy is likely to experience a significant slowdown before the end of 2019, and the slowdown may be necessary to relieve upward pressure on oil prices. In its latest World Economic Outlook, the International Monetary Fund forecasts the global economy will expand at 3.9 percent in both 2018 and 2019, slightly faster than the 3.7 percent achieved in 2017. But beneath the sanguine headline numbers, the outlook provides a long list of downside risk factors, including mounting trade tensions, rising interest rates, political uncertainty and complacent financial markets. “Growth generally remains strong in advanced economies, but it has slowed in many of them, including countries in the euro area, Japan, and the United Kingdom,” the IMF admits. “Even U.S. growth is projected to decelerate over the next few years, however, as the long cyclical recovery runs its course and the effects of temporary fiscal stimulus wane”. The broad global expansion that began roughly two years ago has plateaued and become less balanced, according to the Fund (“Global expansion: still strong but less even, more fragile, under threat”, IMF, July 16). The principal economies are still growingly rapidly, with high levels of business and consumer confidence, and contributing to optimism among investors, but there are signs of a potential future slowdown. Global trade volumes are still increasing but the growth rate has slowed significantly since the second half of 2017, according to the Netherlands Bureau of Economic Policy Analysis (“World Trade Monitor”, CPB, July 2018). Leading economic indicators monitored by the OECD have weakened since the start of the year and point to slower expansion over the next six to nine months (“Composite leading indicators”, OECD, July 2018). The OECD says that growth momentum is stable in the United States and Japan but is easing in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy and Canada. At global level, the expansion is exhibiting increasing signs of maturity, with commodity prices and interest rates rising and capacity constraints emerging in some sectors. For example, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus are struggling to deliver orders on time as they strive to expand production and their supply chain (“Boeing and Airbus land $43 billion worth of airliner orders”, WSJ, July 16). U.S. trucking firms are complaining about the lack of qualified drivers, and U.S. airlines are preparing to cut their schedules in response to rising fuel costs. In the United States, where growth remains strong, the expansion now shows unmistakeable signs of being at a late stage. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2L4BeiI) The U.S. economy has been expanding for over nine years, according to the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research. The current expansion is already the second-longest on record and will overtake the long boom of the 1990s if the economy is still growing in July 2019. Unemployment is close to its lowest level for 50 years and at or below the levels seen at the height of previous booms. Industrial production is growing at some of the fastest rates for 20 years. The Institute for Supply Management’s composite index shows one of the broadest increases in manufacturing activity in the last 70 years. And the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index shows household confidence close to multi-decade highs. But consumer prices are rising at the fastest rate since early 2012, cancelling out hourly wage growth, despite a strong economy. And the yield curve for U.S. government securities shows signs of inverting, which has often been a harbinger of previous economic slowdowns. All these indicators show strong cyclical behaviour; in every case, they point to an expansion fast-approaching the top of the cycle. The global economy is rapidly running out of spare capacity and nowhere is that more obvious than in the oil market. The oil market’s unused production capacity has fallen to multi-decade lows as a result of strong consumption growth and a series of output disruptions in Venezuela, Libya and elsewhere. Iran sanctions threaten to reduce spare capacity even further from the start of November, pushing it down to the lowest level since the oil shocks of 1973/74 and 1979/80. Global oil consumption has surged by an average of 1.7 million barrels per day in each of the last three years, and is forecast to rise by a similar amount in 2018 and 2019. The result is that the global oil industry is being “stretched to the limit”, according to the International Energy Agency (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, July 2018). Oil prices have already climbed by more than 75 percent over the last year, putting upward pressure on global inflation, though they have subsequently eased back slightly in recent days. In the past, the final stages of an economic expansion have usually coincided with a sharp escalation in oil prices, with prices dropping back during the subsequent economic contraction. The causality between economic growth and oil prices runs in both directions, with economic growth as a key driver of oil consumption and prices, and oil prices acting as a check on expansion. U.S. recessions in 1973/74, 1981/82, 1990/91, 2001 and 2007-2009 all helped cool previous rapid increases in oil prices by cutting consumption growth. With the oil market running out of capacity, commodity prices rising and interest rates turning higher, it seems increasingly likely the global economy will experience a slowdown within the next 18 months. The coming slowdown need not be as wrenching as the recession which accompanied the financial crisis in 2008/09. In fact, it probably won’t be. The last downturn was exceptional in terms of its length and severity. Most of the business cycle contractions since 1945 have been much shorter and shallower. Like several previous slowdowns, the next one might be marked by a “pause” in growth rather than an actual decline in economic activity. And it need not be global in scale. Some slowdowns were confined to a subset to economies, such as the East Asian financial crisis of 1997/98, while others continue expanding. But the global economy and the oil market appear to be on an unsustainable trajectory, and the only way to resolve the growing contradictions is likely to be a slowdown in the next 18 months.

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.1 percent, with energy companies in Europe and Asia among the biggest losers. European energy stocks were down 0.6 percent. Brent crude hit a three month low on Tuesday after slumping 4 percent on Monday, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers.. The number of fund managers believing oil to be overvalued is now at its highest level since April 2012, according to a survey by Bank of America Merrill Lynch released on Tuesday. Europe’s Stoxx 600 fell 0.3 percent, with futures also pointing to a lower open for the U.S. S&P 500, last seen down 0.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent, snapping two days of gains amid concern over growth in China. In Europe, technology stocks fell 0.4 percent after U.S. tech giant Netflix missed estimates for growth in subscribers. The company’s shares are expected to open as much as 14 percent lower on Tuesday, traders said, hitting the Nasdaq that is trading 0.1 percent lower pre-market. Elsewhere, many asset classes were flat as investors waited for Powell’s testimony, expected to begin at 1400 GMT. In currencies, the dollar index was broadly flat against a basket of six major currencies at 94.549. The index shed 0.25 percent on Monday, nudging away from a two-week high of 95.241 on Friday. “It’s been a fairly sluggish and unexciting start to the week for markets. Whether things get more interesting or not probably depends on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell has to say when he testifies today in front of the Senate Banking Committee,” said Craig Nichol, a macro strategist at Deutsche Bank. Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. He is likely to reiterate the Fed’s stance towards gradual monetary policy tightening. Markets will focus on his views on recent trade tensions. “In short, we expect the chairman to signal optimism on growth and inflation, consistent with continued ‘gradual’ tightening,” wrote Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “He will undoubtedly acknowledge some downside risks associated with the administration’s trade warmongering, but he will likely try to avoid sounding critical of the administration.” Even before Powell’s testimony, traders said the Sino-U.S. trade conflict was keeping a keeping a lid on equity prices and currencies in both countries. The Chinese government said on Tuesday it would hit its 2018 growth target, a day after it reported slower growth in the second quarter and the weakest expansion in factory activity in June in two years. Economists at UBS lowered their estimates for Chinese gross domestic product to take into account trade war escalation, warning clients the country’s currency was likely to weaken. Chinese stocks were among the biggest losers in Asia on Tuesday, falling 1.7 percent. Trading in government bonds was largely subdued ahead of Powell’s testimony. Euro zone government bond yields across the currency bloc inched lower by 0.5 to 2 basis points, with investors unwilling to push yields any higher before Powell testifies.

2018-07-17,"July 17 (Reuters) - Investment bank Goldman Sachs expects volatile oil prices in the short-term on the back of uncertainty over possible disruptions to supply, with benchmark Brent crude in a $70-80 per barrel range. Oil prices have declined sharply the past week as the Sino-U.S. trade war intensifies and were hovering below $72 per barrel on Tuesday, not far from their lowest since mid-April. “Production disruptions and large supply shifts driven by U.S. political decisions are the drivers of this new fundamental volatility, with demand remaining robust so far,” the bank said in a note dated Monday. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November as it reimposes sanctions over Tehran’s nuclear programme. But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that in certain cases, there could be waivers for countries that need more time to wind down imports of oil from Iran. “The uncertainty on the magnitude and timing of the supply shifts has muddied the near-term outlook for oil fundamentals,” Goldman said, adding that it continued to expect high supply volatility with potential for further disruptions. “These supply shifts, alongside the ongoing surge in Saudi production, create the risk that the oil market moves into surplus in third-quarter 2018,” the bank said. However, prices are expected to get some support longer term as global oil inventories are weak, according to the bank. “Ultimately, global inventories are low, oil demand remains robust and we still expect a deficit once U.S secondary sanctions are reintroduced.” Goldman said it still expects Brent to retest $80 per barrel, although this may occur only late this year depending on U.S. oil policies, rather than this summer as it previously expected. The bank added that the recent escalation in trade tensions was unlikely to have much impact on its 2018 oil demand growth view, but would likely create downside risks to its 2019 oil demand growth forecast of 1.6 million barrels per day.

2018-07-17,"(Reuters) - Reviving supersonic passenger flights will harm the environment as the jets will not likely be able to comply with existing fuel efficiency, pollution and noise standards for subsonic aircraft, according to a study released on Tuesday. U.S. based startups Aerion Supersonic, Boom Supersonic and Spike Aerospace are all aiming to revive ultra-fast flights by the mid-2020s by modifying existing engines rather than spending billions of dollars to make a new one to serve a market that has been dormant since Concorde stopped flying in 2003. Modified engines will burn five-to-seven times more fuel per passenger than subsonic jets, exceed global limits for new subsonic jets by 40 percent for nitrogen oxide and 70 percent for carbon dioxide, the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said. The ICCT said, based on its study, supersonic jet makers would be unlikely to meet environmental standards unless they used a new engine design with technology like a variable cycle that would operate differently at take-off than in cruise mode. The alternative is for policymakers to ease standards for supersonic jets, the ICCT adds.  The United States is already pushing for different standards for ultra-fast planes but facing resistance from European nations that want tough rules on noise. “There are reasons to be worried about the environmental impact of reintroducing supersonic aircraft,” said Daniel Rutherford, aviation director at the U.S.-based independent non-profit research organization.  “A modest first step is for manufacturers to commit to meeting existing standards for new aircraft,” added Rutherford, a co-author of the ICCT study. But finding an efficient engine for supersonic jets is tough in an industry that has for decades been catering to subsonic planes by improving fuel efficiency, expanding range and reducing noise through the use of larger fans. Supersonic jets are most efficient at cruising altitude with smaller engines that are far noisier on takeoff, like those on fighter jets or old 727s that do not meet modern airport noise standards. Smaller engines help reduce aerodynamic drag when flying above mach speed - the speed of sound.  Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N)-backed Aerion has selected a GE (GE.N) engine core used in F-16 fighter jets and Boeing Co (BA.N) 737s as the basis for the engine on its planned jet, which will have a top speed of Mach 1.4. Boom and Spike, which plan top speeds of Mach 2.2 and Mach 1.6 respectively, have yet to select engines. “Even if you built something new, I think you are going to be struggling,” said Daniel Edgington-Mitchell, an aerospace engineering lecturer at Melbourne’s Monash University.  “I think that is why there is such a push in the United States to reconsider the standards particularly for supersonic aircraft because it is just going to be really difficult.” Reporting by Jamie Freed in Singapore, additional reporting by Allison Lampert in Montreal; Editing by Himani Sarkar",https://uk.reuters.com/article/airplane-supersonic-environment/reviving-supersonic-passenger-flights-to-harm-environment-study-idUKL8N1U9066,17 Jul 2018,"Reviving supersonic passenger flights

2018-07-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global electricity investments exceeded those in oil and gas for the second year running in 2017 due to more spending on grids but renewable energy investment fell after years of growth, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. Global energy investment totaled $1.8 trillion last year, down 2 percent from 2016. More than $750 billion was spent on the electricity sector, while $716 billion was invested in oil and gas supply. Spending on the power sector was driven by grid investments as it moves towards more electrification, the IEA’s annual World Energy Investment report said. Many countries are having to invest more in upgrading or building new power networks to balance out demand and supply swings due to the rise of solar and wind power and electric vehicles. Despite rising renewable energy production, investment in energy efficiency and renewables went down by 3 percent last year after several years of growth and could decline further this year, the IEA said. China has decided to cut subsidies for new solar plants and restrict the number of new projects which raises the risk of a slowdown in investment this year. “Such a decline in global investment for renewables and energy efficiency combined is worrying,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director. “This could threaten the expansion of clean energy needed to meet energy security, climate and clean air goals. While we would need this investment to go up rapidly, it is disappointing to find that it might be falling this year,” he added.  At the same time, investment in fossil fuels increased last year for the first time since 2014 as the spending power of the oil and gas industry increased. The share of national oil companies in total oil and gas upstream investment remained near record highs, a trend expected to continue this year, the IEA said. The United States’ shale industry is also at a turning point after a long period of operating in a weak financial environment. “The industry appears on track to achieve positive free cash flow for the first time ever this year, turning into a more mature and financially solid industry while production is growing at its fastest pace ever,” Birol said. The report also said that investment in the nuclear sector sank to its lowest level in five years last year as more plants were retired than newly built. Final investment decisions for new coal-fired plants declined for a second year running, but the global coal fleet continued to expand in 2017, mostly due to markets in Asia.

2018-07-17,"FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Qatar Airways’ chief executive said the airline was adapting to a regional political dispute that has prevented it flying some routes, and that those restrictions would not necessarily push it into the red for the current financial year. “There is a possibility that we will post also a loss in our current financial year, but it’s only a possibility,” Akbar al-Baker told reporters at the Farnborough Airshow on Monday.  The airline lost access to 18 cities in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, and Bahrain in mid-2017, when those four countries cut ties with Qatar after accusing it of supporting terrorism. Qatar denies the allegation. The restrictions mean the company is set to post what al-Baker has said will be “a very large loss” for the financial year ended March 2018, but it has not been published yet. Al-Baker said this would be made public in the coming weeks.  But for the current year, he said the airline might be able to mitigate the impact of the boycott, which includes a ban on using airspace over the four countries, meaning some of its flights have to take much longer routes.  Qatar Airways is starting up to 18 new routes to offset the impact of the dispute, and said it could also make investments to help boost its results. “We will try to do investments which will give us returns to mitigate the negative impact on the bottom line of our company,” al-Baker said, without giving details.  Qatar Airways is already an investor in British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L), for example, owning about a 20 percent stake, and last year bought a stake in Italian carrier Meridiana. The CEO said he did not see the situation with the regional political dispute improving any time soon.  Despite that, al-Baker said his airline was sticking to its orders for new plane deliveries and was confident that Boeing would deliver its new 777-X jet, for which Qatar has made a big order, on schedule despite reported delays. “I think they will be on time,” he said.  Qatar Airways was only moderately hedged on fuel and might need to hedge more in future as the price of oil rises, al-Baker said.  “I am concerned about the oil prices. For the time being Qatar Airways is moderately hedged ... well if it comes I may have to (hedge),” he told Reuters, referring to a potential rise in oil prices.

2018-07-17,"TEPIC, Mexico, July 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Vast quantities of raw satellite imagery and data will be distilled into an online platform showing how water ecosystems have changed, and how countries can manage them to prevent further loss, said Google and the United Nations. Focussing initially on fresh water ecosystems such as rivers and forests, Google will produce geospatial maps and data for a publicly available platform to be launched in October in partnership with the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP). “It’s basically a time slide... you can go back in time, and what is does is show you where water has disappeared,” said Elisabeth Mullin Bernhardt, a programme manager at UNEP, on Monday. “It can show you where water never was and now is there. It can show you where water is seasonal.” For Africa’s Lake Chad, for example, access to comprehensive data and images showing surrounding land and rivers could help explain why the lake, on which so many depend, is drying up so quickly, said Kenya-based Bernhardt. Given that most countries share water sources, the information could also be used to encourage neighbouring nations to work together on strategies to manage rivers or lakes, she said. Google is using artificial intelligence and cloud computing to process a massive amount of satellite imagery and data, stretching back over three decades, before it can be analysed, said Rebecca Moore, director of Google Earth and Earth Engine. “Much of the world does not have access to good data about the state of their forests, their rivers and lakes and coastal eco-systems and how they’ve been changing over time,” Moore told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. “It’s a critically important time because there are dramatic changes going on, due to climate change and urbanisation and a number of factors that are in some cases significantly depleting fresh water supply.” Improved information could lead to better investment in environmental services as countries try to meet their Sustainable Development Goals, said UNEP. Agreed at the U.N. in 2015, the 17 global goals include targets to end poverty and hunger, combat climate change, and provide universal access to water and sanitation by 2030. Governments are currently reviewing progress on the goals at U.N. headquarters in New York, where UNEP and Google announced the satellite initiative. While researchers will focus on water ecosystems, the platform could be expanded to include issues such as desertification or plastics in the world’s oceans, said Bernhardt.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly higher, with Britain’s FTSE, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC each gaining about 0.1 percent. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent but the S&P 500 lost 0.1 percent as energy shares were hit by the drop in oil that offset a jump in financials. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.3 percent lower following two sessions of gains. Chinese shares extended losses after dropping the previous day on soft economic data. The Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.1 percent, as did Hong Kong’s Hang Seng. Australian stocks fell 0.5 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI was flat. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.8 percent, supported by exporters’ gains. “Crude has been rising steadily so some kind of adjustment was due. From this context the impact on the broader economy, inflation and therefore the stock markets should be limited,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Crude prices slumped more than 4 percent on Monday, with Brent futures reaching a three-month low of $71.52 a barrel, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers. Concerns over China’s second-quarter economic growth also weighed on oil prices. The country’s economy expanded at a slower pace as Beijing’s efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low. But Brent has gained about 7.5 percent in 2018, during which it poked above $80 a barrel in May to a 3-1/2-year high, as supply has been kept in check while a relatively strong global economy has supported demand. “The stock markets have been quite steady recently, and this shows that investors are starting to look beyond the U.S. midterm elections, which by then President (Donald) Trump’s posturing is expected to have peaked out,” said Monji of Daiwa SB Investments. In currencies, the dollar index inched down 0.05 percent against a basket of six major currencies to 94.474. The index shed 0.25 percent on Monday, nudging away from a two-week high of 95.241 scaled on Friday ahead of Fed Chairman Powell’s testimony. Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, followed by an appearance on Wednesday at the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. He is likely to reiterate the Fed’s stance towards gradual monetary policy tightening, and market focus will be on his views on recent trade tensions. “In short, we expect the chairman to signal optimism on growth and inflation, consistent with continued ‘gradual’ tightening,” wrote Jim O’Sullivan, chief economist at High Frequency Economics. “He will undoubtedly acknowledge some downside risks associated with the administration’s trade warmongering, but he will likely try to avoid sounding critical of the administration.” The euro rose 0.05 percent to $1.1719 after adding 0.25 percent overnight. The dollar pared the previous day’s losses and gained 0.1 percent to 112.39 yen, crawling back towards a six-month peak of 112.80 touched last week. The Australian dollar dipped 0.2 percent to $0.7405 . Treasury yields remained buoyant after rising overnight when strong U.S. domestic retail sales supported the view of solid economic growth in the second quarter. The two-year Treasury yield was at 2.602 percent and in reach of a decade-high of 2.611 percent scaled on Monday. Brent crude was last up 0.5 percent at $72.20 and U.S. crude futures stood little changed at $68.07 a barrel after sliding more than 4 percent on Monday.

2018-07-17,"TOKYO (Reuters) - An intense heatwave killed at least 14 people over a three-day long weekend in Japan, media reported on Tuesday, and high temperatures hampered the recovery in flood-hit areas where more than 200 people died last week. Temperatures on Monday, a national holiday, surged above 39 degrees Celsius (102.2 Fahrenheit) in some inland areas and combined with high humidity to produce dangerous conditions, the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said. At least 14 people died from the heat over the long weekend, media reports said, including a woman in her 90s who was found unconscious in a field. Thousands more were treated in hospitals for heat-related conditions. The heat was most intense in landlocked areas such as Gifu prefecture, where it soared to 39.3 Celsius (102.7 F) in the town of Ibigawa on Monday - the hottest in the nation. The capital Tokyo recorded a high of 34 Celsius on Monday.  Temperatures in parts of western Japan hit by deadly floods reached a high of 34.3 Celsius by midday on Tuesday, creating dangerous conditions for military personnel and volunteers clearing mud and debris.  “It’s really hot. All we can do is keep drinking water,” one man in Okayama told NHK television.  Temperatures of 35 or above - known in Japanese as “intensely hot days” - were recorded at 200 locations around Japan on Sunday, the JMA said, which is unusual for July but not unprecedented. Similar scorching temperatures were reported from 213 locations on a July day in 2014. Last year, 48 people died from heat between May and September, with 31 deaths in July, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.  The current heatwave was due to the layering of two high pressure systems over much of Japan and is expected to continue for the rest of the week if not longer, the JMA said.

2018-07-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s oil exports could fall by as much as two-thirds by the end of the year because of new U.S. sanctions, putting oil markets under huge strain amid supply outages elsewhere in the world. Washington initially planned to totally shut Iran out of global oil markets after President Donald Trump abandoned a deal that limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions, demanding all other countries to stop buying its crude by November. The United States has since somewhat eased its stance, saying that it may grant sanction waivers to some allies that are particularly reliant on Iranian supplies.   But most analysts still think the sanctions will significantly reduce Iran’s crude oil exports with some of the worst case scenarios forecasting a two-thirds drop to only 700,000 barrels per day (bpd). Energy consultancy Facts Global Energy (FGE) thinks Iran’s crude exports could fall to only 700,000 bpd because of sanctions. Those exports would mainly go to China, with smaller shares going to India, Turkey and to other buyers with waivers.  Another 100,000 bpd of condensates could find their way to China, buyers with waivers and possibly to the United Arab Emirates and Korea, FGE says.    For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2JqzxXb China, the biggest single importer of Iranian oil at 650,000 bpd according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon, may ignore U.S. sanctions and keep importing.  for a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2zNfIK4 India, which imported an average of 550,000 bpd of Iranian oil in the first half, has yet to make an official announcement. However, its state-owned refineries have been told to prepare to find alternative supplies should Washington grant it no waivers to sanctions. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2Js63Iw South Korea and Japan, which together imported around 370,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the first half of 2018, have said they would stop imports unless they get a U.S. waiver. South Korea’s imports of Iranian crude were down 40 percent in June from the same month a year ago, customs data shows. Japan’s biggest bank, MUFG Bank Ltd, will halt all Iran-related transactions to comply with the imposition of U.S. sanctions, according to a document seen by Reuters on Thursday. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2Ju0p8C Europe accounted for the biggest chunk of Iran’s oil exports in the first half of the year, with Italy and Turkey the top importers.  Several refiners already stopped their purchases of Iranian crude after Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) said it would stop financing Iranian cargoes by June 30. Refiners in Greece and Spain have already started slashing their imports of Iranian crude.  But key buyer Turkey said it would not cut off trade ties with Iran.

2018-07-17,"(Adds background on other energy companies) By Liz Hampton July 16 (Reuters) - A $1.1 billion U.S. shale pipeline on Monday was denied an exclusion to the Trump administration’s tariff on imported steel, the first such ruling on a major energy project since the tariff went into effect. Pipeline operator Plains All American Pipeline LP’s request was denied because suitable product is available from domestic producers, the Commerce Department ruling said. The Trump administration this spring slapped a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on imported aluminum to safeguard U.S. jobs. It allowed companies to seek exemptions if metals were not available in sufficient quality, quantity or in a reasonable time. Several major energy companies, including Kinder Morgan Inc are awaiting rulings. Shell and Chevron Corp so far have had mixed results on decisions related to their exclusion requests. Plains said it will build its 550 mile (885 kilometres) Cactus II line with steel from Greece, but called the rejection “unjust” because it had ordered steel last year, prior to the tariff decision. Plains did not say how much the tariffs would increase the project’s cost. “The steel tariff exclusion request review process is flawed and does not allow for an applicant to effectively engage,” said Karen Rugaard, a Plains spokeswoman. “We are reviewing our options to challenge this decision.” Reviews appear “to rely on comments that are not required to be substantiated, and on a review of undisclosed data by staff without meaningful interaction with the applicants,” Rugaard added. On Monday, a Commerce spokesman reported 267 exclusion requests had been approved and 452 denied. Another 3,385 of the 26,400 submitted to date were rejected as improperly completed. Plains is among major pipeline operators trying to address surging oil and gas production in West Texas and New Mexico that have filled existing lines. Small producers in the region have said they may be forced to slow or shut-in new production over the lack of space. Plains sought to use steel from a unit of Corinth Pipeworks Pipe Industry SA in Greece for its Cactus II. The pipeline will have expanded capacity to transport 670,000 barrels of oil per day from oilfields in West Texas to export hubs along the U.S. Gulf Coast beginning next year. Plains said in its application that only three steel mills in the world could produce the material required, and none of those are in the United States. Berg Steel Pipe Corp in Florida opposed the exclusion request, saying it could supply product made with a different process than sought by Plains. Reporting by Liz Hampton;

2018-07-17,"TOKYO, July 17 (Reuters) - Brent crude prices rose from a three-month low on Tuesday after more oil workers went on strike in Norway, supporting a market that has been dominated by oversupply issues in recent days. Brent crude futures had climbed 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $72.20 a barrel by 0106 GMT. They fell 4.6 percent on Monday, at one point touching their lowest since mid-April. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were up 3 cents at $68.09. They fell 4.2 percent on Monday. An oil worker strike in Norway intensified on Monday when hundreds more walked out in a dispute over pay and pensions after employers failed to respond to union demands for a new offer. The strike, which began last Tuesday, has had a limited impact on Norway’s oil production so far, but some drillers warned of possible contract cancellations if the dispute goes on for a month or more. “The threat of further supply disruptions hasn’t totally evaporated,” ANZ said in a morning note. ANZ also said that “production from Libya remains susceptible to further declines, despite its ports reopening”. While Libyan ports are reopening, output at the Sharara oilfield was expected to fall by at least 160,000 barrels per day (bpd) after two workers were abducted by an unknown group, the National Oil Corporation said on Saturday. On July 11, the NOC said four export terminals were being reopened after eastern factions handed over the ports, while a lengthy shutdown at El Feel oilfield in the southwest also ended. Two days later, output at the nearby 300,000 bpd Sharara was slashed. U.S. oil output from seven major shale formations is expected to rise by 143,000 bpd to a record 7.47 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. Production is expected to climb in all seven formations, with the largest gain of 73,000 bpd seen in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. All shale regions except for Appalachia are at a high, according to the data.

2018-07-17,"KABUL (Reuters) - Rafiqullah Dawoodzai says his fields were too dry to sow crops this year, the first time he has skipped a growing season in more than 40 years. The 60 acres he farms lie along the banks of Afghanistan’s Helmand River, but the country lacks the infrastructure to use its waters for large-scale irrigation. Severe drought across much of Afghanistan is spurring plans to build new dams to help farmers such as Dawoodzai. It is also aggravating tensions with Iran over supplies from the Helmand - a decades-old dispute that has fed accusations that Tehran is helping the Taliban insurgency. “We can see the Helmand River water, we can even go touch it, but we can’t bring it’s water to our farmlands,” said Dawoodzai, who grows wheat and lentils in the southern province of Helmand. “It is frustrating for every farmer to see large amounts of Helmand River water flowing into Iran.” Afghan officials say their country, which has one of the lowest levels of water storage capacity in the world, needs the extra dams to feed its agriculture sector, the mainstay of the $20 billion economy, which has been brutally hit by drought. With drought prevailing across the region and protests against water shortages rocking Iran, Afghanistan’s announcement in April that it would press ahead with plans for new dams and reservoirs prompted objections from the Tehran government, which fears its supplies will be cut. The row underscores the growing strategic importance of water across the world. Water disputes have become common in South and Central Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the Taliban threatened to overrun Afghanistan’s western province of Farah, on the border with Iran, drawing angry warnings from local politicians that Tehran was using the insurgents to fight a proxy war over water. “Iran is supporting the Taliban to disrupt developmental projects in Afghanistan, including water dams,” said Gul Nabi Ahmadzai, the former Afghan border police chief. “They benefit from keeping Afghanistan unstable and want to control our resources,” he said. Iranian diplomats in Kabul declined to comment. Tehran has repeatedly denied helping the Taliban. “The dialogue between the two governments for resolving water issues is being pursued through diplomatic channels and linking this issue with Afghanistan’s internal issues has no logical, accurate or rational basis,” Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qassemi said in May, after the Farah attacks, according to a report from the Iranian Students’ News Agency. Afghanistan, a country where nearly 20 million people rely on farming, has seen a 45 per cent fall in agricultural output this year as the drought has bitten, officials at the ministry of agriculture said.  “We have to protect the national interest,” said Fahimullah Ziaee, who until June served as the country’s junior minister for irrigation and natural resources, and who participated in talks with Iran earlier this year. “We cannot be dictated to by any country on how to protect our natural resources.” Tehran had already voiced concern that the huge Indian-financed Salma Dam in western Herat province, inaugurated in 2016, would see its water supplies reduced. Recent meetings with Afghan officials over plans for additional dams have re-ignited the issue, according to two senior Iranian officials, one based in Tehran and the second in Kabul. Plans to improve Afghanistan’s water storage capacity have been on the drawing board for decades but now the government is actively seeking aid from international donors to build two dams and increase the height of existing dams.  At the center of the dispute is the Helmand river, which runs through much of Afghanistan from its source in the mountains north of Kabul, feeding the Sistan wetlands in the border regions of the two countries. Water from the Helmand River is in principle shared under a 1973 treaty, which assigned Iran 820 million cubic meters of water a year. But with Afghanistan at war for the past 40 years the supply has been erratic. “It is not like we are forcing Afghanistan to give us water,” said a senior official in Tehran working in the irrigation department. “They have to honor the water sharing agreement and seek our consent to prevent environmental damage caused by their dams.” Donors such as India, which has expressed interest in investing on two dams in central Afghanistan, must consult Iran before supporting large dam building projects, which critics say cause severe environmental damage both down and upstream, the official said. A senior Indian diplomat in Kabul said it planned to construct dams in Afghanistan, but would not intervene in a bilateral water dispute between Tehran and Kabul. “Afghanistan’s government wants us to help them build dams, we will go ahead with the plans. We don’t see the need to secure Iran’s permission for such projects,” said the Indian official.    Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan declined to comment on the water dispute. Afghan officials say a lack of dams on their side of the border has made it impossible to control the run-off into Iran, which they say has received well above its allotted share of water. Irrigation ministry officials in Kabul said that last year Iran received more than 3 billion cubic meters, at a time when the effects of drought, which now afflicts 20 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces, were already starting to be felt. However reaching agreement is made more difficult by the fact that the Dehravud gauging station on the Kajaki dam, the point agreed in the 1973 treaty for measuring the annual flow, is currently under Taliban control and no official has been able to visit since 2015. “We want to resolve a dispute with Iran but there are some security issues, our country is under tremendous stress and Iran must understand,” said Naseer Ahmad Durrani, deputy minister for agriculture, irrigation and livestock.

Revenue dropped to $557.8 million in the six months to June from $676.2 million a year earlier, the company said. Half-year sales volumes declined 31 percent to 9.77 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) from the first half of last year. Oil Search’s managing director, Peter Botten, said in a statement the company was in discussions over further LNG developments in Papua New Guinea. The oil and gas explorer said production at the Papua site, known as PNG LNG, was heading towards the upper end of downgraded guidance of 23-26 mmboe for 2018. Oil Search had revised 2018 unit production costs and production guidance earlier this year after a devastating earthquake in Papua New Guinea energy-rich interior, forced ExxonMobil to shut down operations. Production resumed in the second week of April, a fortnight ahead of schedule.

2018-07-17,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.1 pct, Nikkei adds 0.3 pct * Crude slumps 4 pct, market braces for supply increase * Currencies await Fed Powell’s first congressional testimony By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, July 17 (Reuters) - Asian stocks sagged on Tuesday, weighed by a sharp decline in crude oil prices as Libyan ports reopened, while the dollar was on the defensive ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell’s first congressional testimony. Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow edged up 0.2 percent but the S&P 500 lost 0.1 percent as energy shares were hit by the drop in oil that offset a jump in financials. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.1 pct lower following two sessions of gains. “Crude has been rising steadily so some kind of adjustment was due. From this context the impact on the broader economy, inflation and therefore the stock markets should be limited,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. Crude prices slumped more than 4 percent on Monday, with Brent futures reaching a three-month low of $71.52 a barrel, as Libyan ports reopened and traders eyed potential supply increases by Russia and other producers. Concerns over China’s second-quarter economic growth also weighed on oil prices. The country’s economy expanded at a slower pace as Beijing’s efforts to contain debt hurt activity, while June factory output growth weakened to a two-year low. Australian stocks fell 0.3 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.35 percent and Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.3 percent. But Brent has gained about 7.5 percent in 2018, during which it poked above $80.00 a barrel in May to a 3-1/2-year high. “The stock markets have been quite steady recently, and this shows that investors are starting to look beyond the U.S. midterm elections, by then which President (Donald) Trump’s posturing is expected to have peaked out,” Monji at Daiwa SB Investments said. In currencies, the dollar index against at basket of six major currencies was nearly flat at 94.535. The index shed 0.25 percent on Monday, pushed back from a two-week high of 95.241 scaled on Friday ahead of Fed Chairman Powell’s first congressional testimony. Powell will testify on the economy and monetary policy before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, followed by testimony on Wednesday to the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. He is likely to reiterate the Fed’s stance towards gradual monetary policy tightening, although any suggestion of caution on recent trade tensions could unnerve the markets. The euro was steady at $1.1710 after adding 0.25 percent overnight. The dollar inched up 0.1 percent to 112.37 yen. The Australian dollar dipped 0.1 percent to $0.7413 . Brent crude futures were 0.3 percent higher at $72.11 a barrel after the previous day’s steep fall. U.S. crude bounced 0.05 percent to $68.09 a barrel after shedding 4.1 percent on Monday.
