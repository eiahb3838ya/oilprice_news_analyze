2018-07-04,"(Adds background, details on CEO of petrol business, Group CEO’s quote) July 5 (Reuters) - Woolworths Group Ltd, Australia’s largest supermarket operator, said on Thursday it entered a 15-year fuel supply deal with Caltex Australia Ltd , even as it continues to pursue an IPO or sale of its petrol business. The firm will also start a wholesale food supply to over 700 existing Caltex convenience sites as part of the deal. Thursday’s deal comes two weeks after Woolworths cancelled a A$1.8 billion ($1.33 billion) sale of its petrol stations to BP Plc, after it was blocked by Australia’s antitrust regulator. The grocer wants to exit the business to focus on supermarkets and said at the time of the deal being called off that it would pursue “alternative options” for the 527 petrol stations and 16 development sites, without giving details. Woolworths on Thursday said it appointed James Goth, its director, corporate development, as the petrol business’s chief executive. Woolworths Group CEO Brad Banducci said in a statement that while he was disappointed with the BP deal’s termination he felt the customer benefits of the Caltex alliance and the new fuel supply deal would help deliver a “compelling outcome” for customers and shareholders. The regulator’s refusal in December to greenlight the proposed deal boosted BP rival Caltex, which stood to lose a major fuel supply contract with Woolworths. $1 = 1.3545 Australian dollars

2018-07-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran could reduce its co-operation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, President Hassan Rouhani told the body’s head on Wednesday, after he warned U.S. President Donald Trump of “consequences” of fresh sanctions against Iranian oil sales. In May, Trump pulled out of a multinational deal under which sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Washington has since told countries they must stop buying Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or face financial measures. “Iran’s nuclear activities have always been for peaceful purposes, but it is Iran that would decide on its level of cooperation with the IAEA,” Iranian state news agency IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying after meeting IAEA head Yukiya Amano in Vienna. “The responsibility for the change of Iran’s cooperation level with the IAEA falls on those who have created this new situation,” he added. Rouhani said earlier in the day Tehran would stand firm against U.S. threats to cut Iranian oil sales. “The Americans say they want to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero ... It shows they have not thought about its consequences,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by IRNA. On Tuesday, Rouhani hinted at a threat to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring countries if Washington tries to cut its exports. He did not elaborate, but an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander explicitly said on Wednesday Iran would block any exports of crude for the Gulf in retaliation for hostile U.S. action. “If they want to stop Iranian oil exports, we will not allow any oil shipment to pass through the Strait of Hormuz,” Ismail Kowsari was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club (YJC) website. Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of the Quds force, in charge of foreign operations for the Revolutionary Guards, said in a letter published on IRNA: “I kiss your (Rouhani’s) hand for expressing such wise and timely comments, and I am at your service to implement any policy that serves the Islamic Republic.”  Rouhani, in Vienna trying to salvage the nuclear deal, said U.S. sanctions were a “crime and aggression”, and called on European and other governments to stand up to Trump. “Iran will survive this round of U.S. sanctions as it has survived them before. This U.S. government will not stay in office forever ... But history will judge other nations based on what they do today,” he said. Rouhani told reporters that if the remaining signatories - the Europeans Britain, France and Germany as well as China and  Russia - can guarantee Iran’s benefits: “Iran will remain in the nuclear deal without the United States.” Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said on the Iranian oil ministry news agency SHANA: “Trump’s demand that Iranian oil should not be bought, and (his) pressures on European firms at a time when Nigeria and Libya are in crisis, when Venezuela’s oil exports have fallen due to U.S. sanctions, when Saudi’s domestic consumption has increased in summer, is nothing but self harm. “It will increase the prices of oil in the global markets,” he said. “At the end it is the American consumer who will pay the price for Mr. Trump’s policy.” The European Union, once Iran’s biggest oil importer, has vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing. But European officials acknowledge that U.S. sanctions make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees. Foreign ministers from the five remaining signatories will meet Iranian officials in Vienna on Friday to discuss how to keep the accord alive.

2018-07-04,"(Adds details on economy, budget and airport) MEXICO CITY, July 4 (Reuters) - Oil and gas contracts awarded under the Mexican government’s energy reform will be respected by the incoming administration provided no problems emerge in a review of the tender process, the likely future finance minister said on Wednesday. Leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won Sunday’s presidential election by a landslide. Carlos Urzua, his choice for finance minister when he takes office in December, said energy contracts would be honored if everything was in order. “If it looks good, on we go. It’s a contract we have to respect,” Urzua told Mexican television. A former Mexico City mayor, Lopez Obrador has promised to root out corruption, and wants the contracts analyzed to ensure the process was not tainted. Urzua and other members of the Lopez Obrador team, including his pick for chief of staff, Alfonso Romo, have said they do not expect the review to reveal acts of corruption. Opening exploration and production of oil and gas to private capital was the centerpiece of outgoing President Enrique Pena Nieto’s economic agenda. The government says contracts worth billions of dollars in investment have been awarded. Lopez Obrador was an opponent of the 2013-14 energy reform, and has threatened to reverse it. However, his business advisers say they have persuaded him to keep an open mind. Romo said last week more contracts could be awarded. Before taking office, the new government will negotiate the federal budget for 2019 with the outgoing administration. When asked to sum up the economic outlook for 2019, Urzua said he expected growth of about 2.5 percent and that inflation would be about “4, between 4 and 5 percent.” He saw the peso trading around 19 pesos per dollar and the price of Mexican crude at about $70 per barrel. The peso, which was under pressure before the election, strengthened on Tuesday after Lopez Obrador vowed to work closely with Pena Nieto for an orderly transition. Urzua said the currency could appreciate if Mexico concluded the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada this year. That could see the peso trade below 19 per dollar, he forecast. Lopez Obrador has also criticized the new $13 billion Mexico City airport, which is already under construction. He had threatened to scrap it, but has since held out the possibility of turning into a concession. Urzua, who was Lopez Obrador’s finance minister for part of his 2000-2005 term as mayor, said it was too early to predict what would happen with the airport, but noted a concession might prove the “easiest” option. Gasoline prices would rise in future in accordance with inflation, he added.

2018-07-04,"CALGARY/LONDON (Reuters) - Brent oil rose on Wednesday, driven higher by a threat from an Iranian commander and a drop in U.S. crude inventories for the second week in a row. The price rose above $78 a barrel after an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander said he was ready to prevent regional crude exports if Iranian oil sales were banned by the United States. The most-active Brent LCOc1 futures contract for September delivery settled up 48 cents at $78.24 per barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 19 cents at $74.33 a barrel, within sight of Tuesday’s 3-1/2-year high above $75 a barrel. The U.S. market will not have a settlement price due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani appeared on Tuesday to threaten to disrupt oil shipments from neighbouring states if Washington continued to press all countries to stop buying Iranian oil. Looming U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude exports, force majeure in Libya and unplanned pipeline outages in Nigeria have been clouding the supply outlook despite rising output by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. “In an ideal world an increase in global or regional oil production would have downward pressure on prices. These are, however, no normal times as supply outages are almost weekly occurrences,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. “Under these circumstances it is justified to argue for higher prices when production increases are announced,” he said. Crude inventories fell by 4.5 million barrels in the week to June 29 to 416.9 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.5 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 2.6 million barrels, API said. Crude stockpiles at oil storage facilities in Cushing have dropped after an outage at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil sands facility near Fort McMurray, Alberta. Trading had been expected to be limited on Wednesday by the U.S. national holiday, although the market has been more volatile. Implied options volatility, a way of measuring uncertainty among crude oil traders and investors, is at its highest since the run-up to last month’s OPEC meeting where an agreement was reached to ease output curbs in place since January 2017. With the outlook unclear, investors were turning to options to protect themselves against any sudden move, said Harry Tchilinguirian, head of commodities strategy at BNP Paribas. “When there is consolidation in the market, there is also the expectation of an eventual price breakout in either direction. So in the options market, the volatility gets bid up,” he told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.     Investors can bet on various aspects of an option, from the premium to the price to how much that option might move.

2018-07-04,"OSLO, July 4 (Reuters) - Norway has become a net power importer from Denmark and Sweden this summer, after a warm and dry spring reduced the nation’s hydropower reserves and drove up Norwegian power prices, the grid operator said on Wednesday. Norway’s reservoirs have received rainfall in 2018 that is equivalent to 22 terrawatt hours (TWh) less than a normal year, a shortfall equivalent to the energy needs of 1.1 million households, or half of Norway’s population. “Most of the imported power comes from Denmark and Sweden, which had a surplus of wind power,” Norway’s state-owned grid Statnett said in a statement, adding that it was the first summer in several years that Norway was a net power importer. “Given the snowy winter we had, it may seem strange that we are in such a situation,” it said. Although Norway’s reservoirs, at 61.7 percent full last week, are at a marginally higher level than the same period last year, most of the snow has already melted due to the unusually warm spring so there is less water being added. Warm, dry conditions have also led to more evaporation. “Dry weather is still expected and the hydrological balance ... is expected to deteriorate further in the short term,” it said. Last year Norway’s reservoirs peaked at 86.6 percent full. Experts say the peak this year is likely to be far lower. Lower water levels mean electricity will cost much more for consumers, making it cheaper to import power. The price of Norwegian power this summer exceeded 45 euros per megawatt hour, nearly double last year’s level. “The fact that we have the opportunity to import surplus power from our neighbouring countries means that we can exploit each other’s energy systems and save on Norwegian water resources when needed,” Statnett said.

2018-07-04,"MONTREAL/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China has cooled to a landmark deal to curb emissions from international flights, with the country no longer listed as a participant in the agreement’s first phase, according to the United Nations aviation agency’s website. China does not appear on a June 29 list of participants in the voluntary phase of the deal brokered by the International Civil Aviation Organization in 2016, according to ICAO’s website.  Aviation powerhouse China was included in previous lists seen by Reuters. It is not clear why China now objects to the deal. The first or pilot phase begins in 2021.  Environmentalists say China’s participation is vital for the 2016 Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) deal, which requires airlines to limit their emissions or offset them by buying carbon credits from designated environmental projects around the world. Europe will press China to remain, after the country recently argued it never agreed to join the first phase, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity about the private talks. “In the months to come, Europe together with its ICAO partners, will work with China to find ways to address China’s concerns without undermining (the deal’s) environmental integrity in order to keep this important aviation country on board,” a European Union source said on Tuesday. The Civil Aviation Administration of China and ICAO did not respond to requests for comment. In 2016, China and the United States pledged support for the deal, with both countries saying they expect “to be early participants.” A second source said China is likely distancing itself as a negotiating tactic. Talks are expected this fall over which environmental projects will be available to airlines for purchase as offset credits. China wants its domestic projects to be eligible, the source said. The United States, which last year announced plans to withdraw from the Paris climate pact, is still in the aviation deal and the Federal Aviation Administration said it would continue to work “on the implementation of CORSIA.”  Airlines support the agreement as a cheaper alternative to a patchwork of regional deals. Citing ICAO figures, the Air Transport Action Group estimates CORSIA will cost airlines between $1.5 billion and $6.2 billion in 2025, depending on future carbon prices. “We are disappointed that the Chinese government has decided not to participate in the pilot phase of CORSIA,” said ATAG executive director Michael Gill in a statement.

2018-07-04,"* Formula to be based on 50:50 DME Oman, Platts Dubai - sources * Change to take place from October - sources * Saudi move to boost Oman futures trading on DME - sources (Adds S&P Global Platts comment) By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco plans to change the formula used to price its long-term crude oil sales to Asia starting from October, marking the first change in benchmarks for its official selling prices (OSP) since the mid-1980s, the company said on Wednesday. Trade sources had earlier told Reuters of the planned change. The new formula will be based on the average monthly prices of Oman crude futures traded on the Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) and the average cash price for Dubai assessed by pricing agency S&P Global Platts, instead of the average of Oman and Dubai prices assessed by Platts, Aramco said. Saudi Aramco’s OSPs for October will be based on the average settlement prices for the DME December Oman contract and the December Dubai cash price assessed by Platts, both of which are set in October. S&P Global Platts said in a statement that it respected each market participant’s right to decide its preferred way of pricing term contracts, but that the market decides which price references are ultimately adopted as benchmarks. “We are closely engaged with a wide variety of market participants in this ongoing discussion, including in Saudi Arabia, and we believe Platts’ benchmarks remain robust and relevant to all market participants,” it said. DME did not respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters. While Saudi Aramco’s decision surprised the market, a proposal to switch benchmarks has been discussed internally for years, the sources said. The DME launched the Oman contract in 2007 and it is the most liquid physically deliverable futures contract for Middle East crude oil. In comparison, there are rarely bids or offers for Oman cargoes during the Platts market-on-close price assessment. “It is obvious - look at the trading volumes of DME versus Platts for Oman,” said Adi Imsirovic, a teaching fellow at the University of Surrey’s Energy Economics Centre who wrote a paper on Middle East oil benchmarks published in 2014. Last year, Iraq’s Oil Marketing Organization (SOMO) proposed pricing its Basra crude sales to Asia on DME Oman futures starting with January-loading cargoes, but the plan was shelved. “SOMO was the first on the case but they did not think it through nominations. SOMO went back to the drawing board. Aramco could not be left behind!” Imsirovic said. here Saudi Aramco’s decision could improve the liquidity for Oman futures trading on the DME and also for derivative instruments based off the Oman contract for hedging or price conversion purposes, a Singapore-based trader said. “This is a good change as Platts Oman cannot be hedged,” he said. Saudi Aramco usually sets its monthly OSPs around the fifth of each month, and those set the trend for Iranian, Kuwaiti and Iraqi prices, affecting more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude bound for Asia. It was not immediately clear if the other Middle East producers will also change their benchmarks. Reporting by Florence Tan in Singapore; Additional reporting

2018-07-04,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Trying to create the shortest supply chain possible, a supermarket in Brussels is selling produce grown on its own roof only hours after being harvested.  Delhaize, a Belgian supermarket chain part of Ahold Delhaize, said it launched the “Urban Farm” project to satisfy the growing number of consumers who are concerned about where their food is sourced and eating healthy.  “The products are harvested in the morning at 8 o’clock and an hour later they’re in the store,” store employee Marie Delvaulx said. The garden on the 360-square-metre roof also generates its energy sustainably with solar panels and by recuperating heat from the store building.  The farm - which this year produced tomatoes, lettuces and strawberries - operates year round and can withstand the cold months thanks to a greenhouse.  Creating a farm in a roof on city comes with some challenges. The produce can easily be destroyed because the farm lacks biodiversity to mitigate the damage from insects, and there also is the question of the weight constraints. While the farm, the first of its kind in Delhaize stores,  currently only produces a fraction of the supply needs, it will serve as a test for expanding the program to other stores.

2018-07-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - World stocks were flat on Wednesday amid growing anxiety ahead of Washington’s end of week deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, while the yuan steadied after China’s central bank acted to calm investors. The MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was lower by less than 0.1 percent on the day, recovering slightly from a 0.2 percent fall earlier. Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has promised to retaliate in kind on the same day. However, China’s finance ministry said it will “absolutely not” fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs. Concerns about the outbreak of a global trade war have, among other factors, prevented a sustained recovery in global stock markets since a violent sell-off knocked them off records highs in February. The United States has listed another 284 product lines valued at $16 billion that it will target with tariffs, including semiconductors and a broad range of electronics. U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened tariffs on as much as $400 billion worth of Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs due to go into force on Friday. Washington has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports, with Trump threatening Europe with a 20 percent tariff on car imports while various countries have also already taken retaliatory steps against U.S. tariffs on steels and aluminium products.  Over 40 countries have voiced deep concern at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about possible U.S. measures. “There is a lot of concern I think about the effect a long term trade war might have but actually if you look at the data we’re seeing, the economic data is not that bad,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He noted that most equity markets were well above lows hit earlier this year. “So it could have a drag, and it will have a drag. But will it push the global economy into recession? Not yet.” The pan-European STOXX 600  index was last down 0.1 percent, see-sawing from positive to negative territory during the day.

2018-07-04,"(Adds details of partnership, oil field, refinery) SAO PAULO, July 4 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) took another step on Wednesday in negotiations that could give the Chinese their first refining capacity in the Americas. The companies announced in a Brazilian securities filing that they had signed a letter of intent advancing talks for a partnership to finish the Comperj refinery near Rio de Janeiro and a “participation” of CNPC in the offshore Marlim oil field. The joint announcement confirms an April report by Reuters that said the companies were working out a deal involving a CNPC investment at Comperj in exchange for a stake in the offshore Campos Basin and rights to use the refinery. The talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocks as the government lowers barriers to foreigners. The companies did not offer further details and said the implementation of the partnership will depend on the success of final negotiations. “This strategic partnership will strengthen ties between the companies and will contribute to deepen the global strategic partnership between Brazil and China,” the filing said. In November, Pedro Parente, then chief executive of the Brazilian oil firm known as Petrobras, touted a 196 meter oil column discovered in the Marlim field, which he described as the best in the Campos basin. Petrobras and CNPC have already partnered in the giant Libra oil field off the Brazilian coast since 2013. Last year, they also partnered to win exploration rights for the Peroba field, another promising deposit in the area known as the pre-salt, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Petrobras has already invested some $13 billion in the Comperj complex, which needs about $3 billion in additional investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in April.

The truck scheme aims to transport about 2,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from northern oil fields to the coast to test oil flow rates and other technical issues before the start of full production and exports via a pipeline to be built by 2022. The pilot truck scheme was launched in June. “Tullow confirms that there have been interruptions to the trucking of crude oil in Turkana County. Tullow is working with the respective national government agencies, the county government, local leadership and the communities to ensure that the matter is resolved amicably,” the firm told Reuters.   “Tullow has provisionally reduced the number of personnel in the field while operations are paused,” it said. Government officials were not immediately available to comment. Kenyan media said the protests that began last week were to demand the deployment of more security forces in the area, which has long been plagued by banditry and cattle rustling.

2018-07-04,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania will ask the European Commission to put pressure on Belarus to modify a nearly completed nuclear power plant which the Baltic country sees as a threat to its safety and national security, Lithuania’s prime minister said on Wednesday. Belarus, which borders European Union member Lithuania but is not part of the 28-country bloc, denies the Astravets plant has any safety problems. The plant, near the border with Lithuania, was built by Russia’s Atomstroyexport and financed by Moscow with a $10 billion (7.57 billion pounds) loan In findings published on Wednesday, the European Union Safety Regulators Group (ENSREG), a department of the European Commission, said Astravets needed to upgrade its safety measures to better resist earthquakes, ensure the power plant is protected from ground water or extreme weather and review its procedures for operation during large-scale emergencies. The safety review was begun after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster in Japan. Asked whether Lithuania would request the Commission to put pressure on Belarus to change its project in line with the report’s recommendations, Lithuania’s prime minister Saulius Skvernelis said he would. He said he doubted Belarus would modify the project without the pressure. “Our experience during construction of the power plant indicates that that is not necessary what will happen,” he said. In a press release published on Tuesday, the Commission called on Belarus to develop an action plan “to ensure timely implementation of all safety improvement measures in accordance with their safety significance”. Lithuania has been opposed to the building of the Astravets  plant from the beginning, and is seeking regional action to tax or block all electricity imports from Belarus. Lithuania says Astravets, called Ostrovets in Belarus, does not meet safety standards, and points to a number of accidents at the site and a lack of independent oversight. Modifications to the power plant to implement the measures  would be complicated, costly and time-consuming, Lithuania’s foreign affairs minister Linas Linkevicius told BNS wire. “We can’t imagine how the plant could get licensed without implementing the recommended measures,” said the minister. Belarus expects to have the two 1.2 gigawatt VVER 1200 reactors online in 2020, according to the Astravets website.

2018-07-04,"LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - A major European development bank has approved a loan for construction of the Trans-Adriatic Pipeline (TAP) on Wednesday, in a boost for the developers of the 4.5 billion euro (3.97 billion pounds) gas project.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) said its board of directors has approved a direct loan of up to 500 million euros ($583 million) for TAP. TAP, the final leg of a $40 billion (30.28 billion pounds) project called the Southern Gas Corridor to transport gas from central Asia to western Europe, is a cornerstone of the European Union’s energy security policy to wean the bloc off Russian gas supplies. The European Investment Bank approved a 1.5 billion euro  loan earlier this year for TAP and further contributions from the export credit agencies of France, Germany and Italy are currently under consideration, the EBRD said in a statement after the board meeting. EBRD directors were asked to approve a total loan amount of up to 1.2 billion euros, sources familiar with the matter said. Apart from the direct loan, the rest would be a syndicated loan. However, the exact amount of that will depend on the success of syndication. The EBRD said the pipeline will make a “significant contribution” to the diversification of Europe’s energy supply. “It will also help make energy supply for consumers more reliable, as well as achieve significant carbon dioxide reductions by providing a cleaner fuel, as compared to coal,” it added. With the first delivery of gas expected by 2020, it will be the first non-Russian gas pipeline to supply Europe since the Medgaz link which started to deliver gas from Algeria to Spain in 2011. TAP will transport up to 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas per year from the Azeri Shah Deniz II field in Azerbaijan to Italy by 2020. Italy’s environment minister, however, said last month the project was under review, raising fears among TAP’s developers that Rome would demand major changes to the pipeline’s route, which is set to land at a seaside resort in southern Italy.    Italy’s new government, a ruling coalition of anti-establishment parties, has said the pipeline is an environmental danger and unnecessary given Italy’s excess gas capacity. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that despite the comments made recently, Italy supported the project at the board meeting. TAP shareholders include oil group BP (BP.L), Italy’s Snam (SRG.MI), Belgium’s Fluxys (FLUX.BR) and Spain’s Enagás (ENAG.MC). The European Union’s energy chief said the EU has been arguing the case for TAP with the new Italian government.     “We are ready to engage and provide all the good arguments that this project is good for Italy and good for the European Energy Union,” European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic told Reuters.    The United States also supports the Southern Gas Corridor as it reduces Europe’s reliance on Russian gas. Some environmental groups have criticised both the EBRD and EIB’s funding of TAP due to the environmental impact of the pipeline and human rights issues in Azerbaijan.

The San Ramon, California-based company is the latest veteran North Sea producer seeking to scale back its presence in the 50-year-old North Sea basin, where production has been on a steady decline since the late 1990s.  BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips  have all sold assets in the North Sea in recent years.  “Chevron Upstream Europe is undertaking a review of its portfolio...a decision has been taken to initiate the process of marketing all our UK Central North Sea assets,” a company spokeswoman said in a statement. The assets include the Alba, Alder, Captain, Elgin/Franklin, Erskine, and Jade fields as well as the Britannia platform and its satellites. Chevron has in recent years focused its efforts on rapidly growing its shale production in the Permian basin in Texas as well as the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. While seeking to exit some of its North Sea assets, Chevron is also weighing the development of the Rosebank field west of the Shetland islands. The company, along with its partners Suncor , Siccar Point and Ineos [INEOSH.UL], is trying to reduce the costs of the project. Chevron’s net daily production in the North Sea in 2017 averaged 50,000 barrels of oil and 155 million cubic feet of natural gas, according to its website.

Concerns about the outbreak of a global trade war have, among other factors, prevented a sustained recovery in global stock markets since a violent sell-off in February. The United States has listed another 284 product lines valued at $16 billion that it will target with tariffs, including semiconductors and a broad range of electronics. U.S. President Donald Trump also threatened tariffs on as much as $400 billion worth of Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs due to go into force on Friday. Washington has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports, with Trump threatening Europe with a 20 percent tariff on car imports while various countries have also already taken retaliatory steps against U.S. tariffs on steels and aluminium products. Over 40 countries have voiced deep concern at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about possible U.S. measures. “There is a lot of concern I think about the effect a long term trade war might have but actually if you look at the data we’re seeing, the economic data is not that bad,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He noted that most equity markets were well above lows hit earlier this year. “So it could have a drag, and it will have a drag. But will it push the global economy into recession? Not yet.” After dipping at the European open, the pan-European STOXX 600 index moved into positive territory by afternoon, up nearly 0.2 percent.

2018-07-04,"* Southern Grid, Allianz, DIF in 2nd round of auction -sources * Encevo stake seen fetching around 400 mln eur -sources * Final bids due in early August -sources * Growing criticism of Chinese energy infrastructure investment By Arno Schuetze FRANKFURT, July 4 (Reuters) - Southern Power Grid, one of two Chinese state grid firms, has been short-listed in an auction expected to fetch around 400 million euros ($467 mln) for a stake in Luxembourg utility Encevo, people close to the matter said. A stake in Encevo would give the Chinese state a foothold in a power company in the heart of Western Europe following several other state-owned Chinese utilities which have already made major investments in southern Europe. Southern Grid is vying with insurer Allianz, Dutch infrastructure investor DIF and a second Asian bidder for the 25.5 percent stake, sources said, adding that final offers are due by early August. Ardian, Southern Grid, Allianz and DIF declined to comment. Encevo comprises grid operator Creos and energy provider Enovos and was formerly known as Enovos. French buyout group Ardian had bought a 23.5 percent stake for 330 million euros in 2012 and in 2016 increased it to 25.5 percent, which it now plans to divest. The private equity firm had bought the stake with a view to using Encevo as a platform for additional investments in grids, which account for the bulk of the company’s business. Luxembourg’s main energy supplier has invested more than 1 billion euros in grids and renewables since 2012. The employer of 1,500 staff in 2017 saw earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation decrease 26 percent to 194 million euros as margins slid and impairments on renewable energy investments bit. Any buyer of the Ardian stake, which comes with three board seats, will not have a blocking minority, which stands at 33 percent in Luxembourg. The Luxembourg State owns 28 percent of Encevo directly, while state banks SNCI and BCEE hold a combined 26.2 percent and the City of Luxembourgas 15.6 percent. Luxembourg has a right of first refusal. There has been growing concern in Europe over Chinese investment in key infrastructure. China Three Gorges in May launched a bid to take full control of Portugal’s main utility EDP, in which it bought a minority stake in 2011. State Grid Corporation of China bought minority stakes in Portuguese power grid operator REN in 2012, in Italian gas transport group Snam and power grid firm Terna in 2014 and in Greek power grid ADMIE in 2016. It is also trying to buy a minority stake in German grid operator 50Hertz. In Germany, policymakers have begun considering options to prevent Chinese utility State Grid from buying a 20 percent stake in 50Hertz. $1 = 0.8566 euros

Chinese buyers plan to scale back their U.S. high-sulphur, or sour, crude purchases after Beijing said last month it will impose tariffs on U.S. energy products without specifying when they would begin. The tariff decision is part of an escalating trade dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. U.S. oil sellers “are worried about the trade war and they panicked. China’s buying has slowed as most of the refineries are pending (purchases),” said one of the sources, a buyer with a North Asian refiner. The price cut also follows Saudi Arabia’s plan to raise its sour crude output by 1 million barrels per day from May to July to comply with the latest decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on June 22 to increase production. An influx of cheaper U.S. sour crude may depress Asia’s demand for spot Middle East oil for a second month in July, when September-loading cargoes trade, the sources said. Sellers are currently offering the U.S. sour crude grade Mars to Asian buyers for delivery in October at $1 to $1.50 a barrel above Dubai quotes on a cost-and-freight basis, on par with Middle East sour crude Oman, the sources said. That is down at least 50 cents a barrel from the Mars sale prices for September delivery, they said. “Many traders are keen to offer U.S. crude to us. We plan to buy if the price goes lower,” said the North Asian refinery source. Traders last month booked record volumes of U.S. crude for loading in the third quarter when the arbitrage was open and the influx is expected to replace supplies from the Middle East, Russia and Africa. At least 10 million barrels of U.S. Mars crude have been sold to refiners in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and India for third quarter delivery, trade sources have estimated. South Korea’s second largest refiner GS Caltex has bought 4 million barrels of Mars crude in recent months, the sources said. Japan’s top refiner JXTG Nippon Corp and India’s Bharat Petroleum Corp have also purchased U.S. sour crude.

The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent on the day. Washington has said it would implement tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6, and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day. Concerns about the outbreak of a global trade war have, among other factors, prevented a sustained recovery in global stock markets since a violent selloff in February. The U.S. has listed another 284 product lines valued at $16 billion that it will target with tariffs, including semiconductors and a broad range of electronics. It also threatened another 10 percent tariffs on up to $400 billion of Chinese goods. Washington has also launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports, with Trump threatening Europe with a 20 percent tariff on car imports while various countries have also already taken retaliatory steps against U.S. tariffs on steels and aluminium products. Over 40 countries have voiced deep concern at the World Trade Organization (WTO) about possible U.S. measures. “There is a lot of concern I think about the effect a long term trade war might have but actually if you look at the data we’re seeing, the economic data is not that bad,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London, noting that most equity markets were well above lows hit earlier this year. “So it could have a drag, and it will have a drag. But will it push the global economy into recession? Not yet.” The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.2 percent in morning trade in London, while Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX also declined 0.3 percent and the FTSE 100 fell 0.2 percent. A Chinese court temporarily banned Micron Technology from selling chips in China, the world’s biggest memory chip market, hitting shares in U.S. and Asian semiconductor stocks. Europe’s tech sector was led 0.5 percent lower by falls in chipmakers STMicro and Infineon, which were both down around 2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.25 percent, a day after it hit a nine-month low. Japan’s Nikkei erased earlier losses to stand flat by late afternoon. Mainland Chinese shares dropped, with CSI300 Index off 0.7 percent. In the currency market, the yuan bounced back from an 11-month low following moves by China’s central bank on Tuesday to calm jittery financial markets. The Chinese currency fetched 6.6177 per dollar in onshore trade, off Tuesday’s low of 6.7204. Major currencies were treading water as traders fretted about the fallout of the intensifying trade frictions between Washington and the rest of the world. The euro was off by 0.2 percent at $1.16380 while the dollar fetched 110.51 yen, down 0.1 percent. Oil prices edged up following a report of tightening U.S. fuel inventories amid an outage at Syncrude Canada oil sands facility in Alberta, which usually supplies the United States. International benchmark Brent futures rose 0.3 percent to $77.98 a barrel. U.S. light crude futures traded down 0.4 percent at $73.86 per barrel, after rising above $75 for the first time in more than three years on Tuesday.

2018-07-04,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Inpex Corp (1605.T) has delayed gas production from its giant Ichthys field off the coast of Australia just weeks after giving assurances that output would start imminently. Inpex’s new chief executive officer told Reuters the company was yet to start churning out gas from the $40 billion (£30.29 billion) project and did not give a timetable for when that would happen. Japan’s biggest oil and gas producer had said on June 1 that commissioning of all onshore and offshore facilities at the much-delayed project was complete and that gas would start flowing within a week or two. “There are various minor issues to address in the final safety checks ... but there are no major problems with the facilities,” Ueda, 61, said on Tuesday in his first interview with overseas media since taking the helm at Inpex last month. The liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, already hit by multiple delays, is a major test for Inpex as it marks the first time it has operated a major energy development on its own. “We can start production in the not too distant future,” Ueda said, without giving details. He added that the company is keeping its target to ship its first LNG cargo by the end of September. Ichthys will send gas from an offshore central processing facility through an 890-km (550-mile) pipeline to the mainland near the city of Darwin, where it will be processed into LNG for export. Delays are common with large projects like Ichthys, but the development has been plagued by a wide range of issues, including contractor disputes, technical difficulties and bad weather.  Inpex aims to start the project’s second liquefaction train by year-end, a few months after the first unit starts operating. At full operation, Ichthys is expected to produce 8.9 million tonnes of LNG a year, along with about 1.7 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas and around 100,000 barrels per day of condensate, an ultra-light form of crude oil. Ichthys will likely take two or three years to reach full production, Ueda said. After that, Inpex will assess market demand for a possible doubling of the project’s capacity using known gas reserves in the area, he said. Should it expand the project, further major pipelines will likely be unnecessary, Ueda added.  Getting Ichthys up and running will be a significant boost for Inpex, as the project is expected to account for half of its 48 billion yen ($435 million) profit forecast for this business year. Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys, France’s Total (TOTF.PA) 30 percent, with the rest spread amongst Taiwan’s CPC Corp CHIP.UL and Japanese utilities. Ueda said Inpex has accumulated “valuable experience” from Ichthys that it would apply to its Abadi LNG project in Indonesia, where it hopes to start production in the late 2020s.

European shares are expected to follow suit, with spread-betters expecting a fall of 0.2 percent in Germany’s DAX and 0.1 percent in Britain’s FTSE and France’s CAC. “Global tensions are ratcheting higher by the day, fuelled by the foolish policies of foolish leaders,” warned Saxo Bank chief economist Steen Jakobsen in a quarterly outlook. “Tit-for-tat trade wars and agendas that pander only to self-interest are jeopardising the global economy.” In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.25 percent, a day after it hit a nine-month low. Japan’s Nikkei erased earlier losses to stand flat by late afternoon. Mainland Chinese shares dropped, with CSI300 Index off 0.7 percent. Wall Street shares declined on Tuesday, giving up early gains in a truncated session ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, as technology shares came under pressure just a day after their solid start for the quarter on Monday.

Facebook lost 2.3 percent after the Washington Post reported a federal probe on the data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica was broadened while Tesla fell 7.2 percent on questions over whether it could sustain the pace of making its Model 3 sedans. Micron Technology Inc fell 5.5 percent after a Chinese court temporarily barred the firm from selling 26 chip products in the mainland in a ruling over a patent infringement case with Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp (UMC). Coming on the heels of escalating tensions between the United States and China over tariffs and investment restrictions, the injunction sparked selling in other U.S. chipmakers. “We have the issue of Micron just when technology shares started to lose momentum after their stellar performance so far this year. If we see further profit-taking in the sector, that would be worrying given their heavy weighting in major indexes,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. Many investors fear Washington will go ahead with its plan to levy a 25 percent tariff on 818 product categories from China including cars on Friday, which Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products. They worry the move could spark a full-scale international trade war and harm the global economy, especially as the Trump administration has threatened tariffs on imports from many other major economies. The U.S. has listed another 284 product lines, valued at $16 billion, targeting semiconductors and a broad range of electronics, which it has said will go into effect after a public comment period, and threatened another 10 percent tariffs on up to $400 billion of Chinese goods.

That ratio is now at a 3-1/2 year low. “The latest divergence appears to be driven in part by oil-long, copper-short trading by CTAs (commodity trading advisors).

2018-07-04,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will cut coal consumption, boost electric vehicle sales and shut more outdated steel and coke capacity in the coming three years, the State Council said in a long-awaited 2018 to 2020 pollution action plan published on Tuesday. China is in the fifth year of a “war on pollution” aimed at reversing the damage done to the country’s environment since the economy was opened up in 1978, with President Xi Jinping promising to use the full might of the Chinese Communist Party to meet the country’s goals.    The new 2018 to 2020 action plan, released on the country’s official government website, will expand the fight to 82 cities across China, and confirmed that the major coal-producing provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi have been added to the list of “key” pollution control regions.   The new plan will also cover the heavily industrialized province of Henan in central China, as well as the Yangtze river delta, which includes the provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and the region around Shanghai. The document said the regions of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong and Henan will be required to cut coal consumption by 10 percent over the 2016 to 2020 period, while the Yangtze delta region will have to cut coal use by 5 percent over the period.   It also said no new capacity for steel, coke and primary aluminum production will be allowed in the regions through to 2020, the State Council, or China’s cabinet, said. It will cap steel capacity in Hebei, the country’s largest steelmaking province, at 200 million tonnes by 2020, down from 286 million tonnes in 2013. China will also take more action to tackle small-scale “scattered” pollution sources, and will work to cut off water, electricity and raw material supplies to firms that violate rules. To meet its politically important smog targets in northern China last year, the government curbed traffic and coal use, and also imposed “one size fits all” restrictions on industries like steel, aluminum and cement throughout 28 northern cities from October 2017 to March this year. The cabinet said special anti-smog measures would still be introduced over autumn and winter, but each of the 82 cities would now draw up its own bespoke plan. It also said it would raise gas storage capacity to ensure supplies were sufficient during winter.    The cabinet also set an annual production and sales target for new energy vehicles at around 2 million vehicles a year by 2020 in order to reduce road emissions.

2018-07-04,"* Asian shares near 9-month low, Nikkei down 0.5 pct * Falls in U.S. tech shares heighten worries * Yuan steady for now after PBOC’s moves By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, July 4 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were on shaky ground on Wednesday while the Chinese yuan stood near 11-month lows as the spectre of a Sino-U.S. trade war haunted investors ahead of an end-of-week deadline for U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars worth of Chinese imports. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.1 percent in early trade, a day after it hit a nine-month low. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.5 percent. Wall Street dropped on Tuesday, giving up early gains in a truncated session ahead of the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, while technology shares came under pressure just a day after their solid start for the quarter on Monday. The S&P 500 lost 0.49 percent while the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.86 percent. Facebook lost 2.3 percent after the Washington Post reported a federal probe on the data breach linked to Cambridge Analytica was broadened while Tesla fell 7.2 percent on questions over whether it could sustain the pace of making its Model 3 sedans. Micron Technology Inc fell 5.5 percent after its rival firm, Taiwan-based competitor United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW, said it received a temporary injunction banning chip sales in mainland China. Coming on the heels of escalating tensions between the United States and China over tariffs and investment restrictions, the injunction sparked selling in other U.S. chipmakers. “We have the issue of Micron just when technology shares started to lose momentum after their stellar performance so far this year. If we see further profit-taking in the sector, that would be worrying given their heavy weighting in major indexes,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. The news hit chip-related shares in Japan. SMC Corp , manufacturer of machines used for chip-making, fell 6.5 percent while Advantest, maker of chip inspection machines, fell 5.6 percent. Many investors fear Washington will go ahead with its plan to impose tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6, which Beijing has vowed to match with tariffs on U.S. products, raising the risk of a full-blown trade war. In the currency market, the yuan remained under pressure. The Chinese currency fetched 6.6715 per dollar in early Asian trade, off Tuesday’s 11-month low of 6.7344 after China’s central bank moved to calm jittery financial markets. The People’s Bank of China Governor Yi Gang said in a statement on Tuesday that the central bank was closely watching fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and would seek to keep the yuan at a stable and reasonable level. The Thomson Reuters/HKEX Global CNH index, which tracks the offshore yuan against a basket of currencies on a daily basis, has lost more than 3 percent in the past two weeks. On the other hand, the Mexican peso surged 2.6 percent, its biggest one-day gain in more than two years, on soothing comments from the country’s newly elected leftist president that he will not ramp up spending. Major currencies were treading water as traders fretted about the fallout of the intensifying trade frictions between Washington and the rest of the world. The euro stood little changed at $1.1658, keeping gains after Germany’s coalition settled a row over migration that had threatened to topple Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. The dollar changed hands at 110.56 yen. Oil prices were supported as larger-than-expected fall in U.S. stockpiles data from the American Petroleum Institute confounded worries about supply shortage. U.S. light crude futures traded up 0.6 percent at $74.62 per barrel, after rising above $75 for the first time in more than three years on Tuesday. International benchmark Brent futures stood flat at $77.77. Copper, on the other hand, hit nine-month lows on Tuesday on worries trade frictions could slow down global growth. It last traded at $6,521, up 0.5 percent on the day but still near Tuesday’s low of $6,490.

2018-07-04,"(Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd said in a filing on Tuesday it is restarting construction in August on the Trans Mountain pipeline’s expansion after halting work in the spring due to opposition from environmentalists and other groups as Canada prepares to buy the project in a bid to boost country’s oil exports. The expansion work will begin in Alberta in August and the North Thompson region of British Columbia in late September, according to a construction schedule for the next six months filed with the National Energy Board. Calgary-based Kinder Morgan Canada said additional construction was also planned in Lower Mainland of British Columbia. Kinder Morgan had halted all non-essential work on the C$7.9 billion project in May, citing regulatory uncertainty and opposition from the province of British Columbia. The Trans Mountain pipeline runs from Edmonton, Alberta to a deepwater port in the Vancouver area. The expansion would nearly triple its capacity, giving Canadian producers greater access to Asia and other world markets. Canada in late May agreed to buy the pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.4 billion) to save the project that faces formidable opposition from environmentalists and British Columbia officials, who are worried the pipeline could spill its tar-like heavy oil. The deal is expected to close “mid to late summer.” “We’re excited to be moving forward in Alberta and the North Thompson, bringing and delivering on our commitments to local, regional and Aboriginal jobs and benefits,” Ian Anderson, president of Kinder Morgan Canada, said in a statement.

2018-07-04,"(Repeats July 3 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2tS9i6S By John Kemp LONDON, July 3 (Reuters) - U.S. traffic volumes are levelling off in a sign the previous stimulus from cheap gasoline prices is fading as pump prices rise. The volume of traffic on U.S. roads was down by almost 0.6 percent in April compared with the same month a year earlier, after seasonal adjustments, according to statistics released on Monday. Traffic volumes declined year-on-year for the first time since the first quarter of 2014, according to the Federal Highway Administration (“Traffic volume trends”, FHWA, July 2018). Volumes in any one month can be distorted by the timing of public holidays, the distribution of working days and weekends, and unusual weather patterns. But the rate of growth in traffic volumes has been slowing consistently since early 2016, coinciding with the rise in gasoline prices, after accelerating during 2014/15, coinciding with the previous oil price slump. Traffic volume growth has been correlated with the rise and fall in retail gasoline prices over at least the past 25 years, among other factors (tmsnrt.rs/2tS9i6S). Cheap gasoline provided a significant stimulus to driving during the latter part of 2014 and throughout 2015 but the impact has faded as average pump prices have climbed back towards $3 per gallon. The slowdown in traffic volume growth is consistent with separate data showing a levelling off in the quantity of gasoline consumed in 2017/18 after rapid growth in 2015/16. The quantity of gasoline supplied to domestic consumers during the first four months of 2018 rose by just 4 million barrels or 0.4 percent compared with the same month a year earlier(“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, June 2018). EIA forecasts U.S. gasoline consumption will grow by just 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 and 40,000 bpd in 2019, after rising by just 2,000 bpd in 2017 but 139,000 bpd in 2016 and 257,000 bpd in 2015. By contrast, U.S. distillate consumption is predicted to rise by 130,000 bpd in 2018 and another 60,000 bpd in 2019 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018). Besides the impact on miles driven, oil prices influence gasoline consumption through motorists’ choices about new vehicles purchased and the retirement of older vehicles from the fleet. During the price slump, consumers switched to purchasing larger vehicles with lower fuel economy, reversing the earlier trend towards smaller cars and more efficient engines, in the process boosting gasoline consumption. Now prices are climbing, fuel economy is set to become more important for vehicle buyers again, and there is likely to be a shift back towards smaller, more fuel-efficient engines, restraining further consumption growth. Over the last seven decades, there has been a clear link between oil prices and fuel consumption growth rates, which has been confirmed during the most recent oil-price cycle. Oil consumption is normally led by gasoline during the first phase of each cyclical upswing until distillates become the primary driver in the second phase. During the first phase of the current cyclical recovery, the rise in oil consumption was led by gasoline consumption by private motorists, but that impact is now fading as gasoline prices climb. Further consumption growth increasingly relies on the distillate fuels used in freight transport, as well as the industrial sector and on oil and gas drilling sites. Notwithstanding strong demand for distillates, rising oil prices are already starting to restrict overall consumption growth, principally through their impact on gasoline sales. As a result, EIA forecasts U.S. petroleum consumption will increase by just 53,000 bpd in 2018 and 26,000 bpd in 2019 after rising by 190,000 bpd in 2017, 153,000 bpd in 2016 and 434,000 bpd in 2015. Rising oil prices are already helping to restrain consumption growth and rebalance the oil market and any further escalation will accelerate the effect.

2018-07-04,"* U.S. fuel inventories drop amid Syncrude Canada outage * Outside N.America, markets eye looming sanctions against Iran By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, July 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Wednesday, lifted by a report of declining U.S. fuel inventories amid the ongoing crude supply outage at Syncrude Canada in Alberta, which usually supplies the United States. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $74.60 a barrel at 0044 GMT, up 46 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. WTI the previous day hit its highest since November 2014 at $75.27 a barrel. Brent crude futures were at $77.82 per barrel, up 6 cents from their last close. Trading activity is expected to by limited on Wednesday due to the U.S. Independence Day holiday. U.S. crude inventories fell by 4.5 million barrels in the week to June 29 to 416.9 million barrels, according to the American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday. Gasoline and distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, were also down, the API said. Traders said the decline in fuel inventories was largely down to the outage at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) oil sands facility near Fort McMurray, Alberta, which is expected to last through July. Outside North America, looming U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran were the focus of attention. The U.S. government plans to shut Iran’s oil exports out of the market from November, demanding that all countries stop buying its oil. To make up for potential shortfalls in supply from Iran sanctions as well as other disruptions including Libya and Venezuela, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has agreed with Russia and other oil-producing non-OPEC members to raise output from July. OPEC-member Iran, however, has warned it would not accept other producers reaping the benefits by taking its market share. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday said it was “unwise to imagine that some day all producer countries will be able to export their surplus oil and Iran will not be able to export its oil.” (Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Joseph Radford)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-climb-on-tightening-u-s-market-idUKL4N1U0060,04 Jul 2018,"* Outside N.America, markets eye looming sanctions against
