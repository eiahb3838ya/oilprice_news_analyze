2018-09-13,"SAO PAULO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Brazil leftist presidential candidate Fernando Haddad said on Thursday that state oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA should be allowed to set prices above cost, breaking from former party policy. Between 2010 and 2014, former administrations of Haddad’s Workers Party (PT) forced Petrobras, as the firm is commonly known, to keep its fuel prices down as part of a bid to control inflation, which drained the world’s most indebted oil company of billions of dollars as oil prices climbed. But Haddad said on Thursday that Petrobras should not be used as a tool to combat inflation, although it should also not be given complete autonomy. “I’m against using Petrobras to combat inflation. Petrobras is a company, it has shareholders,” said Haddad, speaking to a group of foreign correspondents. Haddad recently replaced former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who cannot legally run due to a corruption conviction, as the PT’s official candidate. Although his support is likely to rise with Lula’s backing, Haddad was in fifth place in a major opinion poll released on Tuesday, with 8 percent of the vote. If no candidate wins a majority in an Oct. 7 first-round vote, as is likely, the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff. Right-wing Congressman Jair Bolsonaro is currently leading in the first-round, and will likely face a centrist or leftist opponent in the second round.

2018-09-13,"SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More than two dozen of the world’s largest cities are no longer increasing their planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions, they announced at a global climate summit in San Francisco. The 27 cities, from New York to London, said they had reached the milestone even as their populations and economies grew. They did so by cutting their usage of fossil-fuel-generated energy, growing their public transportation systems and reducing waste, according to C40 Cities, a network of large cities acting as leaders in combatting climate change. Paris’ Mayor Anne Hidalgo said it was a relief to “finally share good news on climate change.” With economies continuing to grow even as emissions stagnate or fall, “we can prove that we can also create jobs, create opportunities with the ecological transition,” she told reporters. Global warming is currently set to exceed the more ambitious limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7-degree Fahrenheit) called for in the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change, according to a draft U.N. report due for publication in October. Under President Donald Trump, the United States - the world’s second largest greenhouse gas emitter - has weakened the Paris pact by announcing last year it intended to pull out of the deal. So far, cities that have “peaked” their emissions are in industrialized nations in North America, Europe and Australia, research by C40 found. Those cities are home to 54 million people, the group said. The absence of developing world cities from the list suggests they may need more funding to make needed changes, Hidalgo told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We must strive toward funds going toward the ecological and energy transition where it is most urgent, including in developing cities,” she said. Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at New York’s Columbia University, said it was expected that poorer countries, many of them still growing, might still see emissions increases. “It is a fact that countries are on different development pathways and so different cities are going to peak emissions ... at different times,” he said. Demonstrations and stunts by activists also marked the summit, which aims to deepen the leadership of authorities other than national governments in curbing global warming. Outside the gathering, about 300 protestors chanted slogans and brandished signs and banners reading “fossil free” and “don’t drill”. Law enforcement officers made two arrests, said a San Francisco police spokeswoman. Activists said in a statement they were targeting California Governor Jerry Brown - the summit’s main organizer - for “his failure to rein in the state’s oil extraction”. A handful of protesters also stormed the event’s main stage as Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and U.N. Special Envoy for Climate Action, delivered a speech. “Climate capitalism is killing our communities,” read a banner they unfurled before they were escorted out by security officials. “Only in America could you have environmentalists protesting an environmental conference,” Bloomberg quipped. The three-day gathering, which ends Friday, has drawn about 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments worldwide as well as industries and research institutions. It has also attracted celebrities, from actor Harrison Ford to primatologist Jane Goodall and musician Dave Matthew.

2018-09-13,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - United Airlines said on Thursday it has set a goal to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent over the next few decades to help reduce its carbon footprint and its dependence on fossil fuels. The third-largest U.S. air carrier will invest more than $2 billion a year in more fuel-efficient aircraft, expanding its use of low-carbon biofuels in daily flights and implementing ways to better conserve fuel.  “This is not only good for the environment but guards against oil price instability,” Aaron Stash, a United manager of environmental strategy and sustainability, told reporters. Fuel costs account for a major portion of airlines’ expenses, and rising oil prices over the past year have eaten in to industry profits, sending carriers scrambling to mitigate the impact. While rivals Delta Air Lines Inc and American Airlines Group Inc cut their 2018 earnings forecasts due to an oil price spike, United raised its full-year target in July as capacity and fare increases helped it recapture about 75 percent of higher fuel costs. Speaking at a separate conference on Thursday, United President Scott Kirby said the airline was “marching toward” recapturing 100 percent of higher fuel expenditures in a year when those costs are already surpassing $2 billion.  Still, Chicago-based United said it wants to be “the world’s most environmentally conscious airline.” In 2015, it invested $30 million in California-based Fulcrum BioEnergy with an agreement to help the household trash-to-biofuel maker install refineries near its hub airports and purchase roughly 1 billion gallons of biofuel. On Friday, United will use 16,000 gallons of biofuel at a 30/70 blend with conventional jet fuel on Flight 44 from San Francisco to Zurich, which it said will be the longest flight to date by a U.S. airline powered by that much biofuel. United said that halving its emissions by 2050 from 2005 levels as projected would be the equivalent of removing 4.5 million vehicles from the road each year, or the total number of cars in New York City and Los Angeles combined.  Overall, the airline industry is still lagging its own climate targets on transatlantic routes despite steps to improve fuel efficiency, according to a study by the International Council on Clean Transportation released on Wednesday.  According to the study, budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which operates new Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 737 MAX aircraft, was ranked first of the 20 transatlantic carriers for fuel efficiency.

2018-09-13,"PRADÓPOLIS, Brazil (Reuters) - The world’s largest sugarcane processing plant, a Brazilian mill able to process 10 million tonnes per year, has recorded a drop in cane crushing for the second consecutive season because of excessive dryness in Sao Paulo state, an executive said on Thursday. Brazil’s center-south, the world’s largest cane growing region, will likely have a smaller crop this year for the fourth consecutive year. Besides the weather, analysts blame factors including financially-troubled companies reducing investment.  But the owner of the mill, Sao Paulo-listed Sao Martinho SA , is one of the few companies in the Brazilian sugar industry that has stayed in the black, having reported profits for almost every quarter in the last four years, while maintaining normal levels of cane field renovation and crop care. The mill’s cane crushing capacity will fall primarily because of drier soil caused by less rain, and contributing to a smaller crop, the executive said. “It has been like that for the last four years or so -  drier,” said Mário Ortiz Gandini, the head of Agriculture and Technology at Sao Martinho SA, which owns the mill in the municipality of Pradópolis, Ribeirão Preto region. Gandini hopes the dryness is not a permanent trend, he told Reuters on the sidelines of an event organized by machine maker CASE IH [CNHCN.UL] to present a new cane harvester. “I prefer to believe that this is temporary. I don’t think it is a new pattern,” Gandini said. The Sao Martinho executive said that temperature fluctuations in the Pacific Ocean, which drive the climate phenomenon known as El Niño and La Niña, are impacting rain levels and are likely to blame for the dryness. The company uses data measuring Pacific Ocean temperatures to plan forward operations, he said. The average cane production in the 135,000 hectares around the Usina Sao Martinho in Pradópolis is likely to reach 85 tonnes per hectare in the current season, Gandini said - down from 90 tonnes per hectare in the previous crop and a historic average of 95 tonnes per hectare. Gandini said the center-south region’s fields were experiencing below-average rains and next year’s production will depend on rains from October to February.

2018-09-13,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, other members of OPEC and Russia are to be admired for trying to prevent a spike in global oil prices, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said after meeting Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak in Moscow. U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports, which come into force in November, have already cut supply back to two-year lows, while falling Venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere will also keep the supply-demand balance tight, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. “The kingdom (Saudi Arabia), the members of OPEC that are opting their production to be able to make sure that the citizenry of the world does not see a spike in oil price ... are to be admired and appreciated, and Russia is one of them,” Perry told reporters. The United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia are also working together to make sure the world has access to affordable energy, he added. Oil prices fell on Thursday, slipping back from four-month highs as investors focussed on the risk that emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent demand even as supply tightens. Russia’s Novak said earlier this week that his country could raise output if needed and warned of uncertainty on the market due to the upcoming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports. In September, the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and a group of non-OPEC producers, including Russia, will meet in Algeria to discuss the market situation. During the meeting with Perry, Novak said he proposed creating a joint investment fund to develop new projects, adding the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) could be part of such a fund. The RDIF supports this idea and will propose possible parameters for such an arrangement soon, it said in a statement. Perry and Novak also touched on the topic of gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2, that would double Russia’s export capacity via the Baltic Sea. In July, Washington repeated a warning to Western firms invested in the pipeline that they were at risk of sanctions, saying Moscow was using the project to divide Europe. Perry, who also met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov, told the officials that the Trump administration opposes Nord Stream 2 because it would concentrate a single route of Russian gas into Europe, “one vulnerable to disruption and risks of over reliance for European customers,” his spokeswoman, Shaylyn Hynes said.  The United States is boosting its own gas exports to Europe, including to Poland and Lithuania, through liquefied natural gas, or LNG shipments. LNG is more expensive for Europe than gas pipelined from Russia, but Washington is emphasizing the reliability of U.S. LNG.  Russian state energy company Gazprom has in the past cut off gas to Ukraine, and onward to Western Europe, during price disputes in deep winter, and imposed bans on customers reselling gas to other countries. Perry told the Russian officials that the Trump administration welcomes competition on energy from Russia, but  “Moscow can no longer use energy as an economic weapon,” Hynes said. Novak said Nord Stream 2 was a “commercial project”, which Russia hoped would continue to be developed and that the United States would approach rationally. Perry did not rule out the introduction of sanctions against Nord Stream 2, but said neither leaders of the two countries, nor their energy ministers, wanted to get to the point where sanctions against the project would be engaged.

2018-09-13,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Consorcio Petrolero 5M del Golfo, a small energy firm operating in Mexico, has returned one-third of an onshore area won in a 2015 auction, the country’s oil regulator said on Thursday, citing studies showing limited potential for production. Companies operating in Mexico have so far returned all or part of three oil and gas areas mostly awarded during early auctions of the country’s flagship energy reform because of similar reasons, as well as high taxes and development program demands. This has cast doubt on the sustainability of some projects in the reform intended to open the industry to foreign investors. The partial return of the 172-square-kilometer area, which includes the Benavides and Primavera fields in the Burgos basin in Northern Mexico, was approved this week by the National Hydrocarbon Commision (CNH), the regulator said in a statement. The consortium, based in the state of Tamaulipas, notified regulators of its decision earlier this year. “Technical studies showed no potential to produce hydrocarbons,” the regulator cited the consortium as saying. The firm still has to complete the minimum development plan and other commitments approved by the commission. Canamex Energy Holdings, a consortium of Dutch and Mexican firms, received government approval to terminate a 2015 license to produce crude and gas at the Moloacan field due to difficulties in paying taxes and other fees. Canamex had offered a 85.7 percent royalty, the highest in that bidding round. In August, a consortium led by UK-based Capricorn Energy and Mexico’s Citla Energy requested to return a portion of a shallow-water area won earlier this year. It told the regulator its block was near an environmentally protected zone. “Very high royalties jeopardize the projects’ economic viability. Many relatively new operators did this,” said Pablo Medina, research vice president of consultancy Welligence in Houston. “It would make sense offering these areas again. Questions are under which terms and who would be interested as the country’s political context has changed,” he added. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who will take office in December, said in August that auctions for oil and gas areas are suspended until existing contracts are reviewed by his government. It is still unclear if February tenders and a state-run Pemex’s search for a partner will be halted. Reporting by Adriana Barrera and Marianna Parraga; Editing by

Trump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on practically all imports from China unless the country offered concessions. The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade disputes, fell 0.26 percent against a basket of other major currencies. .DXY U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August as increases in gasoline and rents were offset by declines in healthcare and apparel costs, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, data showed on Thursday. A slackening of inflation could slow the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes.  The 2-year US2YT=RR Treasury note, heavily influenced by Fed policy expectations, fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.7606 percent, from 2.748 percent late on Wednesday. The euro EUR= rose 0.57 percent to $1.169. The European Central Bank kept its rates deep in negative territory as expected, but it continues to move closer to normalizing policy. The day’s big move in currency markets occurred in Turkey’s lira. It fell 3 percent after Erdogan called for rate cuts, and then surged, rising 4.71 percent on the day when those calls were ignored. The lira's rally TRY= comes after a more than 40 percent slump against the dollar this year, caused in part by a diplomatic disagreement between Ankara and Washington. Inflation in Turkey is now almost 20 percent and the crisis there has spread to some other emerging market countries with sizable current account deficits. “If they hadn’t hiked today then the real risk was that the lira would sell off sharply again and the country would swiftly head towards a balance of payments and even a banking crisis,” said Aberdeen Standard Investments head of emerging market debt Brett Diment. The lira traded at 6.0723 per dollar, well off its record low of 7.24 reached a month ago. In Latin America, Brazil's real BRL= and Argentina's peso ARS=RASL sank under further pressure even as other currencies in the region gained. In Brazil, there is concern that far-right presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro may be unable to campaign even in a likely second-round vote after he was stabbed in a campaign event last week.

2018-09-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Thursday, with Brent slipping back from four-month highs as investors focused on the risk that emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent demand even as supply tightens. The International Energy Agency warned that although the oil market was tightening at the moment and world oil demand would reach 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the next three months, global economic risks were mounting. “As we move into 2019, a possible risk to our forecast lies in some key emerging economies, partly due to currency depreciations versus the U.S. dollar, raising the cost of imported energy,” the agency said. “In addition, there is a risk to growth from an escalation of trade disputes,” the Paris-based agency said. Brent crude oil LCOc1 fell $1.56, or 2 percent, to settle at $78.18 per barrel. The global benchmark on Wednesday hit $80.13, its highest level since May 22. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled down $1.78, or 2.5 percent, at $68.59 a barrel.  Both benchmarks marked their biggest single day percentage drop in almost one month.  The market tumbled early in the session as investors focused on the bearish elements of the IEA report, said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. Prices slipped again after U.S. President Donald Trump said in a tweet that the United States was under no pressure to make a trade deal with China, Yawger said. U.S. companies in China are being hurt by mounting trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, according to a survey, prompting U.S. business lobbies to urge the Trump administration to reconsider its approach. The White House has invited Chinese officials to restart trade talks as it prepares to escalate a trade war with China with tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods.

2018-09-13,"* Mining giant looks to build power plant for Oyu Tolgoi * Domestic electricity has to be secured by 2022 * Political instability a key issue - former govt official By Barbara Lewis and Munkhchimeg Davaasharav LONDON/ULAANBAATAR, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Nearly 10 years on from the launch of a giant copper and gold project in Mongolia, Rio Tinto is still looking to secure a domestic power source it needs for the mine under an agreement with the government. Oyu Tolgoi, located in the South Gobi region near landlocked Mongolia’s southern border with China, is scheduled to complete a $5.3 billion underground expansion for first production by 2020, creating one of the world’s biggest copper suppliers. The project, launched in 2009 and 34 percent-controlled by Mongolia, is set to transform the country’s tiny economy, and is also key for Rio as the biggest potential growth area for its copper business. But it has been beset by squabbles over cost overruns and claims of unpaid taxes. Under an agreement with the government, by 2022 a domestic power source must be found for the project, currently running on power imported from China. But while Rio has invited three state-owned Chinese firms to submit bids to build a power station at a cost of up to $1.5 billion, it has yet to make a final decision on a go-ahead. Rio also has yet to have its permits for the plant renewed by the Mongolian government, according to a government source. “The main challenge remains the same: political instability and unpredictability,” said Otgochuluu Chuluuntseren, a former government official who also served as an Oyu Tolgoi board member. Oyu Tolgoi has suffered repeated delays amid government wrangling, the reshuffling of officials, disputes over Mongolia’s share of the returns and opposition to foreign participation among nationalist politicians. Complicating the power project has been the Mongolian government’s desire to kickstart the nearby Tavan Tolgoi coal project, one of the world’s biggest deposits with an estimated reserve of more than 6 billion tonnes, which lies just 150 km (93 miles) from Oyu Tolgoi. Rio had originally planned to build its own power plant, but it suspended construction plans in 2012 after it was encouraged by the government to switch to a proposed plant at Tavan Tolgoi, where it would be an off-taker rather than investor. However, in February this year, the government cancelled a 2014 agreement setting up a framework for co-operation on a shared power plant, with Rio saying the project still lacked a credible lead investor and could not be completed on time. Oyu Tolgoi currently pays about $100 million a year to buy electricity from China, according to an industry source with knowledge of the matter. The project is now looking at options for a domestic power source, said Luke Colton, chief financial officer at Turquoise Hill Resources, the Rio-controlled unit that owns 66 percent of the project. “An Oyu Tolgoi-based plant is currently the most feasible option that could deliver a domestic power source within the shortest timeframe,” Colton said in a call on second quarter earnings at the end of July. Rio Tinto said it was working with the government and other stakeholders to progress the building of a new power station. “Rio Tinto and its partners are committed to securing a domestic power supply within the agreed timeframe,” a spokesman said. Some government officials have expressed impatience about the power plant delays, underscoring the political challenges facing the project. “Oyu Tolgoi should stop playing with the Mongolian state!” Mongolia’s energy minister Davaasuren Tserenpil said on the ministry’s official Twitter account last month, in extracts from an interview to local media. “Oyu Tolgoi got permission from the ministry in 2012 to build the power plant on its site but it has done nothing.” Otgochuluu said transporting power from a Tavan Tolgoi plant to Oyu Tolgoi would be more efficient than transporting coal to a likely coal-fired plant at the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Of the three contractors invited by Rio to tender for the project, Power Construction Corp of China spokesman Sun Jianli told Reuters the bid was “preliminary” and the project was still “very far away”. The others, China Machinery Engineering Corp and Harbin Electric International, declined to comment.

2018-09-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are locking in prices for their production as much as three years into the future in a sign that strong domestic crude pricing is nearing a peak, according to market sources familiar with money flows. U.S. crude prices for 2019 and 2020 CLYstc1 CLYstc2, based on an average of each year’s monthly contracts, have climbed this week above $68 and $64 a barrel, respectively, the highest levels in over three years. The rally comes even as front-month prices CLc1 have dropped from the 3-1/2-year highs touched during the summer. “Hedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets.  Hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices, acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans. Such longer-term bets signal U.S. producers will continue to expand output, keeping a lid on prices, according to crude traders and brokers. The nation’s output this year has climbed above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That output is forecast to grow next year by 840,000 bpd to average 11.5 million bpd. There was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week, with just shy of 8 million barrels changing hands in a day, an energy derivatives broker said, signalling strong hedging interest. Swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production.  Almost 80 percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars 2020 and 2019, and the remaining 20 percent for this year, the broker said, adding that there was a small amount of calendar 2021 activity during the week. For a graphic on U.S. oil prices, click reut.rs/2p0pL66 The market sources declined to say which oil companies were actively hedging in recent weeks. The move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries. Many U.S. shale producers hedged second-quarter production at about $55 a barrel, which backfired as U.S. crude climbed to more than $70 a barrel last quarter, the highest level since 2014.    As a result, producers are using more “collars,” a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally.  “We’ve been building a lot of collar structures,” Christian Kendall, chief executive of Denbury Resources Inc (DNR.N) said last week, noting that the instruments will protect its production at about $60 a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high $70s per barrel. Denbury is nearly 50 percent hedged for 2019 and will add hedges to get to 60 percent to 70 percent of production, Kendall said. Meanwhile, oil companies that drill in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where local prices are $14 below futures WTC-WTM because of full pipelines, are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses. “We have done an extensive amount of basis hedging,” said Javan Ottoson, chief executive of SM Energy Co (SM.N), which reported 11.2 million barrels of 2019 Permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with 6.9 million barrels of 2018 production similarly covered at this time last year. Permian producers increased their 2020 oil-basis hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with Concho Resources Inc (CXO.N) and Energen Corp EGN.N leading the surge, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  For 2019, Midland-Cushing basis hedging rose by 52 percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in 2019. Open interest in U.S. crude futures for delivery in 13 months to 36 months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in 2018, CME Group Inc (CME.O) said.  Oil producers are “saying ‘we’re comfortable with our hedging in the front; we have appropriate hedges in place but what’s going to happen next,’” said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research and product development at CME Group.

2018-09-13,"(Reuters) - Procurement of solar energy by U.S. utilities “exploded” in the first half of 2018, prompting a prominent research group to boost its five-year installation forecast on Thursday despite the Trump administration’s steep tariffs on imported panels. A record 8.5 gigawatts (GW) of utility solar projects were procured in the first six months of this year after President Donald Trump in January announced a 30 percent tariff on panels produced overseas, according to the report by Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and industry trade group the Solar Energy Industries Association. As a result, the research firm raised its utility-scale solar forecast for 2018 through 2023 by 1.9 GW. The forecast is still 8 percent lower than before the tariffs were announced. A gigawatt of solar energy can power about 164,000 homes. Procurement soared in part because the 30 percent tariff was lower than many in the industry had feared, the report said. SEIA strongly lobbied against a tariff, saying it would drive up the cost of solar and hurt the industry’s robust job growth. In addition, panel prices have fallen faster than expected because China pulled back its subsidies for the renewable power source in June, creating an oversupply of modules in the global market that has eroded the impact of the tariff. Module prices averaged 42 cents a watt in the second quarter, the report said, 2 cents higher than the same period in 2017 but far below the 48 cents a watt they hit late last year as the industry fretted about a looming duty on imports. In every segment of the market except residential, system pricing is at its lowest level ever, the report said. Utility projects make up more than half the solar market. Utilities are eager to get projects going because of a federal solar tax credit that will begin phasing out in 2020. Next year will be the most impacted by the tariffs, Wood Mackenzie said. Developers will begin projects next year to claim the highest level of tax credit but delay buying modules until 2020 because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year. In the first half of the year, the U.S. installed 4.7 GW of solar, accounting for nearly a third of new electricity generating capacity additions. In the second quarter, residential installations were roughly flat with last year at 577 MW, while commercial and industrial installations slid 8 percent to 453 MW.

2018-09-13,"* Asian stocks bounce back from previous day’s 14-month low * Shanghai shares surge on trade hopes, then gains erased * Trump might seek China deal before elections - Tokyo analyst * Turkish lira in focus as central bank seen raising rates By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares won a reprieve on Thursday as news the Trump administration has reached out to China for a new round of trade talks raised hopes a deal could be struck in the bitter tariff dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, a day after it hit 14-month lows. China’s A-shares shot up 1.2 percent on hopes for reduced trade tensions, but the excitement did not last long, and the index’s gain was almost erased, leaving it up only 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.9 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was up 0.04 percent on Wednesday. Senior U.S. officials led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently sent an invitation to their Chinese counterparts, including Vice Premier Liu He, to hold another bilateral trade meeting. The development comes as more than 85 U.S. industry groups launched a coalition on Wednesday to take public its fight against President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined as the administration prepares to activate duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, hitting a broad array of internet technology products and consumer goods from handbags to bicycles to furniture. “Public support for Trump has fallen in recent weeks, with Democrats seen likely to capture the House of Representatives. He probably needs some sort of achievements on trade ahead of the mid-term elections,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. “So there could be a shift in his trade policy. He will surely keep his hard line rhetoric but his administration may seek to make some deals behind the scene,” he said. However, many market players remained cautious. “While we agree this should provide short-term relief, the road ahead can still be tricky,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong, noting concessions China made earlier this year did not satisfy Trump. “China may not be able to offer much more than that, especially if this involves adjusting its Made in China 2025 policy,” he said in a note. Still, any serious signs of easing in trade tensions should benefit shares in China and other Asian courtiers the most given they have borne the brunt of U.S. protectionist moves. The trade tensions have hammered global riskier assets over the past few months as policymakers and investors worried about the hit to the world economy. MSCI’s broad emerging markets index has fallen more than 20 percent from its peak in January, entering  bear market territory. In the currency market, the dollar eased a little on the trade talk hopes as well as on soft U.S. wholesale price data, which undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in August, recording their first drop in 1-1/2 years and denting talk of accelerating inflation following Friday’s strong wage data. The euro traded at $1.1636, extending its gain this week to 0.71 percent. The yen weakened slightly on Thursday to 111.40 per dollar on easing trade worries. Sterling held near a six-week high of $1.3087 as Brexit-supporting lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party publicly pledged support for her to stay in power. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold policy meetings on Thursday, but both are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Perhaps attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates to shore up its battered lira. The lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and by a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington. The lira crisis has spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals such as sizable current account deficits. The lira traded at 6.3450 per dollar, up about 1.1 percent on the week and well off its record low of 7.240 reached one month ago. Oil prices fell, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session, as economic concerns raised doubts about fuel demand growth. Brent futures hit $80 per barrel on Wednesday but eased in Asia to $79.25, down 0.6 percent on the day.

2018-09-13,"(Updates dateline, adds comments from Australia’s minister of trade) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian and Australian sugar industry groups are working together with their respective governments to prepare a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over any possible sugar export subsidy by India, a top Brazilian sugar official told Reuters. Brazil and Australia view any subsidy by India, set to take over as the world’s largest sugar producer this year, as a grave threat to a recent price recovery, Eduardo Leão, executive director at Brazil’s cane industry group Unica, said in an interview. The two countries reached a consensus regarding the need to act at the WTO level if India moves to provide an export subsidy to sugar producers, Leão told Reuters late Tuesday. Analysts and sugar traders are expecting such a move by India as the country would be willing to put in the market a large local surplus built after a record crop this year, and amid expectations for another big output in the coming season. “We have heard comments that India could launch a export subsidy,” Leão said. “It is not admissible, we would seek an action from the Brazilian government,” he added. Raw sugar prices in New York recovered slightly in the last days since slumping to a 10-year low of 9.91 cents on Aug. 22 as a two-year global supply surplus and massive fund short position pressured values. There was no immediate comment from the Indian trade ministry. Indian officials have earlier said the country’s sugar exports do not violate WTO rules as New Delhi does not give any subsidy for overseas sales. India rather gives production subsidy to its cane growers. The Unica director said there are talks going on with Australian sugar industry representatives for a joint strategy at the WTO if the need arises. Australia’s Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham on Thursday declined to confirm or deny plans for a formal complaint, though he confirmed Canberra’s frustration. “It is clear that export subsidies introduced recently by the India and Pakistan governments have contributed to a growing glut on global markets,” Birmingham said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “ has expressed its concerns to the India and Pakistan governments at the highest levels in the clearest possible terms.” Australia, one the world’s largest sugar exporters, is expected to produce a near record crop of 4.8 million tonnes this year, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated. “We know the market fell due to a coincidence of large productions in Europe, Thailand and India, but things are improving now, production is falling so we don’t see the need for a export subsidy from India,” Leão said. Market estimates put Indian sugar surplus at about 10 million tonnes. That sugar is priced above current market so to stimulate exports the government would need to help mills. Unica’s director said Indian mills will eventually be able to sell in the export market as prices continue to recover. He said the Brazilian government is willing to back their plans. “They are sensitive to this due to the difficult financial situation of many mills”. Brazil decided on Aug. 31 to open a consultation at the WTO regarding Chinese safeguards on sugar imports. Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Additional reporting by Manoj

2018-09-13,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has sacked 16 government officials and is investigating several more over the unauthorised construction of a reportedly 20 square kilometre private lake which has damaged the environment and caused flooding. A businessman created the lake in Hunan province, south-central China, by building barriers at Dongting Lake, the country’s second-biggest freshwater lake and a flood basin for the Yangtze River, state news agency Xinhua reported late on Wednesday without elaborating on the lake’s purpose. The Hunan government, in a statement, said the businessman - who had carried out contract work for local authorities since 2001 - began construction in 2008 and in 2014 came to the attention of officials who failed to rectify the situation. The case comes amid a central government campaign to eliminate hundreds of tiny and often substandard dams and turbines to bring order to China’s massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction. Xinhua first reported on the lake in June. The government said it dismantled the barriers the same month and has since questioned 65 officials over the matter. It said it dismissed two officials from the province’s animal husbandry and fisheries bureau as well as the deputy mayor of Yiyang, a city close to the lake. It said investigations into 11 others were ongoing.

2018-09-13,"(Repeats SEPT 12 story with no change to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2p0CTbx By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil production is running into capacity constraints, which are starting to have a material impact on the global availability of crude, causing the market to tighten and putting upward pressure on prices. The biggest problem is the lack of sufficient pipeline capacity to move oil from shale wells in western Texas and eastern New Mexico to refineries in the Midwest and export terminals on the Gulf Coast. But production in the Permian Basin has also been constrained by shortages of labour, equipment and materials, which have pushed drilling, pressure pumping and completion costs sharply higher. The most obvious impact has been a sharp drop in the price that Permian producers receive for their oil compared with other benchmarks, especially Brent (tmsnrt.rs/2p0CTbx). West Texas producers are currently receiving just $55 per barrel for oil delivered to Midland, in the heart of the Permian, compared with $79 for North Sea Brent. The massive discount reflects the twin difficulties of moving the crude out of the Permian to the main inland trading hub at Cushing in Oklahoma or down to the refineries and export terminals on the coast. Midland crude is currently trading at discount of $14 per barrel compared with Cushing, while Cushing is itself priced at a further discount of $10 to Brent. Midland has traded at an average discount to Brent of more than $12 per barrel this year, up from $4 in 2017 and less than $1 in 2016, and the price differential is steadily worsening. Midland prices have mostly been falling this year while Brent has climbed, leaving Midland up by just $10 per barrel (22 percent) since the end of June 2017 while Brent has risen by $32 (68 percent). Softening Midland prices have already eased the region’s drilling frenzy, with the number of rigs drilling in the Permian flat over the last three months, after rising by more than 110 in the previous year. Well completions, which are more relevant for production, also show signs of stabilising in recent months, after increasing fairly consistently over the two previous years (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, August 2018). Since the Permian Basin has been the biggest contributor to U.S. oil output growth in the last two years, the slowdown is starting to temper expectations for further increases in the rest of 2018 and through 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now expects U.S. crude production in 2018 to average 10.66 million barrels per day (bpd), down from 10.79 million bpd at the time of its July forecast. The agency has cut its prediction for 2019 even more sharply to 11.50 million bpd, down from 11.86 million bpd at the time of its May forecast (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, September 2018). Slower growth in U.S. production, when combined with strong demand, production problems in Venezuela and other countries, and the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran, is enough to tighten the global market in late 2019.

2018-09-13,"(Reuters) - Ophir Energy (OPHR.L) wrote down the value of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Equatorial Guinea by $310 million (238 million pounds) as it struggles to finance it ahead of a December deadline. The oil and gas producer also announced job cuts and said it would shift its headquarters to Asia, where it recently acquired new assets and where a new chief executive would be based. Ophir’s shares were almost 4 percent lower at 0730 GMT at 36.39 pence. Its share price has fallen by more than 50 percent since the start of the year, due largely to its failure to progress with the LNG project. Ophir’s long-term CEO Nicholas Cooper was replaced in May as part of a shake up.  The Fortuna project would have been the first floating LNG facility in West Africa using the pioneering technology of an offshore LNG production plant. But Ophir has little experience in complex LNG projects and a small balance sheet. In the end, the Fortuna project was beaten by the Hilli floating LNG project, using the same technology, in neighbouring Cameroon. “On Fortuna, we are continuing to work to deliver value for our shareholders whilst we are in possession of the licence. Reflecting the uncertainty surrounding this however, we have impaired the value of the asset to $300 million,” it said. Ophir ran into problems trying to raise $1.2 billion for the project and was told by the government it may lose it if it did not come up with the cash by December. It then lost Schlumberger (SLB.N) as a partner, although veteran LNG vessel operator Golar (GLNG.O), which runs the Hilli FLNG project, remains on board. The company said last week it was “cautiously optimistic” about the project.  But in a nod to the troubles it has had with it, Ophir said it would “minimise” its exposure to “frontier exploration” and “focus on nearer field exploration opportunities that can drive production growth and/or extend field life”. It said revenue for the first half of the year rose 15.5 percent to $102 million, helped by higher prices, with production at 11,400 barrels of oil per day, slightly above  expectations.

Wall Street opened higher, following broad gains in Europe and Asia’s major markets, after news that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration had put out feelers to Beijing for a new round of trade talks. Turkey’s central bank also made a rare show of independence, ignoring a fresh bashing from President Tayyip Erdogan and jacking up its interest rates by more than one-third to 24 percent. MSCI’s 47-country world index rose for a fourth straight day of gains, gaining 0.72 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent, while MSCI’s broad emerging market stock index leapt 1.56 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 177.48 points, or 0.68 percent, to 26,176.4, the S&P 500 gained 16.18 points, or 0.56 percent, to 2,905.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 68.69 points, or 0.86 percent, to 8,022.92. “There have been a lot of obvious headwinds to risk appetite over the summer,” said State Street Global Markets’ head of global macro strategy, Michael Metcalfe. “I just get the sense this week we are beginning to see some light through the clouds.” Washington’s invitation for trade talks received a thumbs-up from Beijing. Trump had earlier threatened to impose tariffs on practically all imports from China unless the country offered concessions. The dollar, which has been a safe haven from trade disputes, fell 0.31 percent against a basket of other major currencies. U.S. consumer prices rose less than expected in August as increases in gasoline and rents were offset by declines in healthcare and apparel costs, and underlying inflation pressures also appeared to be slowing, data showed on Thursday. A slackening of inflation could slow the Federal Reserve’s pace of rate hikes, and U.S. bond yields fell to session lows after the release of the consumer price report, before rebounding. Benchmark 10-year notes dropped 1/32 in price to yield 2.9645 percent, compared with 2.963 percent late on Wednesday. The euro rose 0.54 percent to $1.1687. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the strength of the European economy continues to support confidence but added that inflation is likely to hover at current levels. The ECB kept its rates deep in negative territory as expected. The day’s big move in currency markets occurred in Turkey’s lira. It fell 3 percent after Erdogan called for rate cuts and then surged to be up 3 percent on the day when those calls were ignored. The lira’s rally comes after a more than 40 percent slump against the dollar this year, caused in part by a diplomatic disagreement between Ankara and Washington. Inflation in Turkey is now almost 20 percent and the crisis there has spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals, such as sizable current account deficits. “Hiking today does get Turkey on the slow road to recovering some monetary policy credibility, and that is critical,” said Aberdeen Standard Investments head of emerging market debt Brett Diment. “If they hadn’t hiked today then the real risk was that the lira would sell off sharply again and the country would swiftly head towards a balance of payments and even a banking crisis.” The lira traded at 6.16 per dollar, well off its record low of 7.24 reached a month ago. Among commodities, oil prices fell on doubts about growth of demand for fuel, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session. U.S. crude dropped 1.02 percent to $69.65 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.19, down 0.69 percent on the day. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Additional reporting by Marc

The Guards fired seven missiles at the headquarters of the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (PDKI), an armed opposition group that fights for greater autonomy for Iran’s Kurdish community.     Iranian media said at least 11 people were killed. “The attack against the terrorists in Iraq’s Kurdistan conveys a message to the enemies, particularly those superpowers who think they can impose their evil plots on Iran and bully us,” state TV quoted Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari as saying. Iran has repeatedly threatened to destroy U.S. military bases across the Middle East and target Israel within minutes if attacked by the United States and its regional allies.  “All those who have forces, bases and equipment within a 2,000 km (1,200 mile) radius should know that our missiles are highly precise.” Israel sees Iran’s regional influence and involvement in conflicts from Yemen to Syria as a threat to Israel’s own existence.   The tension between Tehran and Washington, foes for decades, has heightened since May, when President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran.  France’s Foreign Ministry “strongly condemned” the missile strikes and said it was worried by Iran’s activities, notably its missile development. In August, Washington reimposed sanctions on the acquisition of U.S. dollars by Iran, and its trade in gold and precious metals. The sanctions were among those lifted under the deal in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear program.  In November, heavier U.S. sanctions are expected on Iran’s oil sector, a lifeline of its economy. Washington has urged Iran’s oil buyers to cut their imports of Iranian crude to zero. Iran has denounced the call as “nonsense”.  The European Union, China and Russia, all parties to the nuclear pact, are working to maintain trade with Iran, which has threatened to stop complying with curbs on its nuclear work if it fails to see the economic benefits of relief from sanctions under the deal.

2018-09-13,"COLOMBO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan shares closed flat near a two-week closing low on Thursday in heavy trading led by Dunamis Capital Plc which nearly doubled in value, even as foreign investors continued to trim their equity exposure for a second straight day. The Colombo stock index edged 0.03 percent higher to 6,060.68, settling near its lowest close since August 29. It had risen 0.6 percent last week in its third straight weekly gain. Shares of investment company Dunamis Capital, up 90 percent, accounted for 85 percent of the day’s turnover of 1.69 billion rupees ($10.38 million), more than double this year’s daily average of 800 million rupees. The company, in a disclosure to the bourse said insurance firm Janashckthi Plc purchased a 31.14 percent stake or 38.3 million shares in it at 36.60 rupees apiece. “Investors are waiting for some kind of trigger. If the government can maintain policy consistency, we will be able to see positive sentiment,” said Prashan Fernando, CEO at Acuity Stockbrokers, adding that the day’s turnover got a boost from heavy activity in Dunamis Capital. Investors have been raising concerns over consistency in the government’s policy after it changed some budget policies announced last year. Analysts said foreign investors, who sold a net 41.9 million rupees worth of shares on Thursday, have been a worried lot after Nomura Holdings on Monday ranked Sri Lanka among seven emerging market economies that were at risk of an exchange rate crisis. “The increase in fuel prices also weighed on the market,” traders said. Sri Lankan fuel retailers raised gasoline and diesel prices for a third time in four months on Tuesday due to higher global oil prices and a weaker rupee. Meanwhile, investors are also awaiting cues from the national budget which the government is set to unveil in November.

2018-09-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices have risen back to levels that earlier this year prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to take to Twitter and demand OPEC do more to bring them down. Front-month Brent futures settled well above $79 per barrel on Wednesday, the highest for over three months, and above levels that have spurred the president to complain in the past. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2p5xq3j) “The OPEC monopoly must remember that gas prices are up and they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members,” the president wrote in July. “REDUCE PRICING NOW!” the president demanded in his trademark all-capitals style when Brent was trading at only $78 per barrel on July 4. The president had already grumbled on June 13, when Brent was over $76, writing “Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!”. And his first intervention came on April 20, when Brent was just $74, tweeting “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” The president has repeatedly blamed OPEC for not pumping enough, even as his administration has worked closely with Saudi Arabia to cut off oil exports from Iran. The renewed rise in prices must therefore be increasing the risk the president will complain again and press OPEC - in effect Saudi Arabia, which holds almost all spare capacity - to increase production further. There is some evidence that presidential tweets, as well as private conversations with Saudi policymakers, have influenced the kingdom’s production policy. The president’s tweets between late April and early July coincided with a sharp change in Saudi rhetoric about the state of the oil market and need for more supplies, followed quickly by a ramp up in the kingdom’s production. While some commentators have dismissed the tweets as empty political theatre, they have probably had a real impact on supplies. The president’s interventions, on twitter and behind-the-scenes, are therefore significant for prices, at least in the short and medium term. Oil prices are always politically sensitive in the United States, but especially now, with sanctions on Iran due to be re-imposed on Nov. 4 and congressional elections on Nov. 6. Neither the White House nor Saudi Arabia wants to be blamed for pursuing policies that push up costs for American motorists. The cost of living has already emerged as a minor electoral issue, with an argument about whether faster wage gains are being wiped out by inflation. Presidential tweets are therefore an attempt to shift blame as well as push allies to increase output faster and further than they might otherwise. So the renewed rise in benchmark oil prices is unlikely to be welcomed by the White House, but prices might have headroom to rise by another few dollars before drawing another intervention. As earlier tweets have made clear, the president worries about gasoline prices paid by U.S. motorists rather than the price of crude. Wholesale U.S. gasoline prices are still below levels that prompted tweets earlier this year, at around $85 per barrel, compared with $88 to $92 between late April and early July. The switch from summer grade gasoline, which is more expensive for refiners to produce, to winter grade has helped cut gasoline prices faced by motorists. Gasoline prices have also softened as refiners have processed record volumes of crude during the summer months and gasoline stocks have risen to a record for the time of year. Gasoline futures are currently trading just $6 per barrel above Brent compared with $12-14 at the time of the president’s tweets. While crude prices have already returned to the tweet zone, fuel prices are still a few dollars per barrel below, which may reduce sensitivity for the time being. The United States and Saudi Arabia are fully aligned on the issue of Iran sanctions and senior policymakers from both countries appear to be coordinating closely. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister has been on a high-profile visit to the United States this week including discussions with the U.S. energy secretary. Both countries have a strong interest in the successful introduction of sanctions without causing a politically damaging spike in oil prices. But gasoline prices are already fairly high and most hedge fund managers are now betting they will rise even further in the future. The policy pathway for reducing Iran’s oil exports without creating a spike in fuel prices is narrow and may be difficult to execute in practice. If crude and gasoline prices do continue to rise, the White House may be tempted to release more crude from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve or renew its pressure on Saudi Arabia to increase output even faster, either via public tweet or private conversations.

2018-09-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - Signs of movement in the U.S.-China trade stand-off and a bumper interest rate hike in emerging market trouble spot Turkey sent world shares higher on Thursday as risk appetite returned. News that U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration had put out feelers to Beijing for a new round of trade talks had rallied Asia after several torrid weeks that included the region’s longest losing streak since 2000. Shanghai, Tokyo, Jakarta stocks all gained around 1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng finished up 2.5 percent as China’s yuan also edged higher.

It all helped MSCI’s 47-country world index .MIWD00000PUS towards a fourth day of gains and futures markets pointed to Wall Street inching up again too when it reopens. [.N]  “There have been a lot of obvious headwinds to risk appetite over the summer,” said State Street Global Markets’ head of global macro strategy Michael Metcalfe.  “I just get the sense this week we are beginning to see some light through the clouds.”    Washington’s invitation for trade talks received a thumbs-up from Beijing and probably came as a relief after Trump had threatened to impose tariffs on practically all imports from China in the absence of significant concessions. In the currency market, the dollar had began to grind higher again having been dampened by Wednesday’s soft U.S. wholesale price data, which had undermined the case for a faster pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in August, recording their first drop in 1-1/2 years and denting talk of accelerating inflation following last week’s strong jobs and wage data. But the day’s big move was Turkey’s lira which swung almost 6 percent in a wild few hours. It had fallen 3 percent after President Erdogan had called for rate cuts rather than rate hikes and then surged to be 3 percent up on the day when those calls were spectacularly ignored.  The day’s other central bank meetings were far less eventful. While a drop in safe-haven demand sent the yen down 0.2 percent to 111.47 per dollar JPY=, the euro hovered around $1.1620 EUR= as the ECB kept its interest rates deep in negative territory as widely expected. Sterling GBP=D4 barely budged from near a six-week high of $1.3087 as the Bank of England keep Brexit-bound Britain's rates at 0.75 percent. The main thing left for traders to navigate was the ECB’s news conference, which this time will include a three-monthly update of its economic forecasts. The lira's rally TRYTOM=D3 comes after a more than 40  percent slump against the dollar so far this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan's hold over monetary policy and by a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington. Inflation in Turkey is now almost 20 percent and the crisis has also spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals such as sizable current account deficits. “Hiking today does get Turkey on the slow road to recovering some monetary policy credibility, and that is critical,” said Aberdeen Standard Investments Head of Emerging Market Debt Brett Diment. “If they hadn’t hiked today then the real risk was that the lira would sell off sharply again and the country would swiftly head towards a balance of payments and even a banking crisis.” The lira was up at 6.1 per dollar, well off its record low of 7.240 reached a month ago. Among commodities, oil prices fell, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session as economic concerns raised doubts about fuel demand growth. Brent futures LCOc1 hit $80 per barrel on Wednesday but eased in early London trading to $79.00, down 0.8 percent on the day. Most euro zone government bond yields were little changed meanwhile, with the market largely sidelined ahead of the European Central Bank meeting and news conference.  Italy’s debt market was the outlier, with yields rising there as traders absorbed almost 8 billion euros of new bonds as well as a fresh wave of noise on the 2019 budget.

2018-09-13,"(Repeats story from earlier Thursday with no change to text) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are locking in prices for their production as much as three years into the future in a sign that strong domestic crude pricing is nearing a peak, according to market sources familiar with money flows. U.S. crude prices for 2019 and 2020 , based on an average of each year’s monthly contracts, have climbed this week above $68 and $64 a barrel, respectively, the highest levels in over three years. The rally comes even as front-month prices have dropped from the 3-1/2-year highs touched during the summer. “Hedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets. Hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices, acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans. Such longer-term bets signal U.S. producers will continue to expand output, keeping a lid on prices, according to crude traders and brokers. The nation’s output this year has climbed above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That output is forecast to grow next year by 840,000 bpd to average 11.5 million bpd. There was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week, with just shy of 8 million barrels changing hands in a day, an energy derivatives broker said, signaling strong hedging interest. Swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production. Almost 80 percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars 2020 and 2019, and the remaining 20 percent for this year, the broker said, adding that there was a small amount of calendar 2021 activity during the week. The market sources declined to say which oil companies were actively hedging in recent weeks. The move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries. Many U.S. shale producers hedged second-quarter production at about $55 a barrel, which backfired as U.S. crude climbed to more than $70 a barrel last quarter, the highest level since 2014. As a result, producers are using more “collars,” a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally. “We’ve been building a lot of collar structures,” Christian Kendall, chief executive of Denbury Resources Inc said last week, noting that the instruments will protect its production at about $60 a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high $70s per barrel. Denbury is nearly 50 percent hedged for 2019 and will add hedges to get to 60 percent to 70 percent of production, Kendall said. Meanwhile, oil companies that drill in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where local prices are $14 below futures WTC-WTM because of full pipelines, are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses. “We have done an extensive amount of basis hedging,” said Javan Ottoson, chief executive of SM Energy Co, which reported 11.2 million barrels of 2019 Permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with 6.9 million barrels of 2018 production similarly covered at this time last year. Permian producers increased their 2020 oil-basis hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with Concho Resources Inc and Energen Corp leading the surge, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie. For 2019, Midland-Cushing basis hedging rose by 52 percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in 2019. Open interest in U.S. crude futures for delivery in 13 months to 36 months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in 2018, CME Group Inc said. Oil producers are “saying ‘we’re comfortable with our hedging in the front; we have appropriate hedges in place but what’s going to happen next,’” said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research and product development at CME Group.

Sterling held near a six-week high of $1.3087 as Brexit-supporting lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party publicly pledged support for her to stay in power. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold policy meetings on Thursday, but both are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged, though the ECB could confirm when exactly it will end its stimulus programme. Arguable attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank which is expected to raise its interest rates sharply at 1100 GMT to shore up its battered lira. The lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and by a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington. It took a 3 percent dive again as Erdogan called for a rate cut rather than a hike and blamed the central bank for the spike in inflation which is now almost 20 percent. The lira crisis has also spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals such as sizable current account deficits. “In theory, what the Turkish central bank does shouldn’t impact other markets. However, if it an example of an EM central bank reaffirming its credibility, then you could get some positive contagion from it,” State Street’s Metcalfe said. The lira was last down 2 percent at 6.48 per dollar, albeit still well off its record low of 7.240 reached a month ago. Among commodities, oil prices fell, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session, as economic concerns raised doubts about fuel demand growth.

2018-09-13,"* European heatwave hinders rapeseed sowing * Ground too dry for sowings * France, Germany, UK, Poland all hit HAMBURG, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Dry soil after record-breaking European summer heatwaves means farmers have been unable to plant all the rapeseed they wished, experts said on Thursday. The ground may have been too dry for sowings in parts of the top four producers Germany, France, Britain and Poland. High grain prices after the poor European Union crop this summer also made some farmers turn to cereals from rapeseed, Europe’s main oilseed for edible oil and biodiesel production. “We anticipate a fall in the rapeseed area, firstly because margins are less attractive than last year given the rise in prices of winter cereals, and also because weather conditions are dry all over the EU, from the south to the north,” said Hemeline Macret, of French analysts Strategie Grains. Drought caused serious difficulties for rapeseed sowing in Germany, and analysts estimate about 1 million hectares were sown, down by about 200,000 hectares on this summer’s crop. “The dryness created major problems for German sowings and I think a considerable number of farmers gave up and have decided to plant other grains,” one analyst said. “Seeds in a lot of areas, especially north Germany, also lack enough moisture to germinate.” Parched land hampered rapeseed sowing in France, raising the risk that farmers will abandon some drillings. France has experienced its second-hottest summer on record this year. A warm, dry end to summer increased the strain on cropland during rapeseed sowing. “We’re seeing an accumulation of problems,” said Fabien Lagarde of oilseed institute Terres Inovia. “Soil preparation was mostly done in dry conditions, not all intended sowings were able to be carried out, notably in the north, and now the lack of rain is hindering the emergence of plants.” Rapeseed crops in Britain are off to a poor start due to drought and the spread of cabbage stem flea beetles. “Because of the drought and the flea beetle issues we could see a reduced production of oilseed rape,” said Benjamin Bodart, director at CRM AgriCommodities. Bodart said rapeseed planting had just finished and the area was expected to be down on last season. Flea beetles have posed a significant threat to British rapeseed after the EU restricted use of insecticides known as neonicotinoids to protect bees.

2018-09-13,"(Clarifies aid spending throughout, adds quote from U.N. researcher in pargraph 8) By Kieran Guilbert LONDON, Sept 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Patchy, politicised and poorly coordinated aid spending by the world’s top economies to stop modern slavery could hinder a drive to end the multi-billion dollar crime by 2030 and erode public support for such funding, experts said on Thursday. United Nations research, revealed exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, found that annual anti-trafficking overseas development aid (ODA) by the 36-nation OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) at least tripled to $434 million from 2000 to 2013. The United States was the largest donor - accounting for 60 percent of $4 billion pledged in this period - followed by Canada and Norway, and Afghanistan, India and Colombia were the top recipients, according to the U.N. University (UNU) report. Yet many nations received small or inconsistent sums, raising fears about the effectiveness and sustainability of anti-slavery funding given the dearth of data on its impact. Modern slavery is increasingly seen as a major global issue, with an estimated 40 million people enslaved, but there is growing scrutiny on how much is spent - and how well - to meet a U.N. goal of ending the $150 billion a year crime by 2030. “If in 12 years countries can’t show taxpayers what bang has come from their buck, there is every reason to think that people will not want them to keep spending on the issue,” said James Cockayne, director of the centre for policy research at the UNU. While the research only captured a snapshot of global anti-slavery funding - excluding private sector, philanthropic and domestic state spending - it sets a benchmark for future data to spur countries to better measure their interventions, he said. “If we don’t know what is being spent, where, by who and how to achieve progress towards (the U.N. target) ... then we won’t understand what interventions are effective,” Cockayne added. “Governments will have to be able to demonstrate where they are preventing people falling into slavery - and how many.” Although aid is just one prong in the drive to end slavery, major countries from Australia to Britain should spend more if the 2030 goal is to be met, said Nick Grono of the Freedom Fund. “$430 million a year is significant, but nowhere near enough to make a measurable difference,” said the chief executive of the first private donor fund dedicated to ending modern slavery. “Yet meeting the U.N. goal is not all about increasing aid,” he added. “It is a question of the political will and priorities of donor countries, and those where slavery is most prevalent.” The data found that some of the countries receiving the most anti-slavery ODA were not the nations estimated to be the most affected by slavery, with aid and trafficking experts suggesting some cash is pledged for political as well as practical reasons. “Politicisation of this spending would not be surprising ... especially as migration is now such a major focus for many countries,” said Nicola Jones, principal research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a British think tank. Rich nations have been criticised by campaigners for funding aid projects that appear focused on preventing people in poorer countries migrating rather than falling into slavery. Some of the United States’ top anti-slavery ODA recipients were Colombia, Jordan and Mexico - all long-time U.S. allies - receiving millions of dollars annually, the data shows, yet none rank highly in the Global Slavery Index of hardest-hit nations. Yet the UNU researchers stressed the research did not cover all forms of anti-slavery aid spending and so did not give a full picture of U.S. funding - whether from the Agency for International Development (USAID) or State or Labor Departments. The State Department came under fire in 2015 after a Reuters investigation found that U.S. diplomats pressured the office set up to grade global anti-trafficking efforts into inflating the rankings of 14 strategically vital nations in its annual report. USAID said it would examine the UNU research before deciding whether to comment, while the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons said it considers a range of factors in determining where to allocate its funding. “In addition to political will, these include analyses of where and how other donors are programming; the capabilities and needs of organisations in the field; and the likelihood for sustainability of our efforts,” a senior official said by email. “Regarding global estimates, there is no exact or conclusive data that accurately reflects the total number of people exploited worldwide.” The report also found that most countries receiving anti-trafficking ODA, including nations estimated to be rife with slavery like Yemen and Malawi, were granted less than $1 million a year - which the researchers said were “notably small sums”. “$1 million a year is a drop in the ocean ... and would likely push countries to focus on a narrow, punitive approach rather than addressing broader social issues that can lead to slavery,” said Jones of the ODI. “A focus on prevention is key.” The UNU researchers said the study had limitations, such as the fact the data stops before the 2015 adoption of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) after which donors - like Britain - pledged large sums, and the omission of non-OECD aid. Cockayne said aid projects must be more precisely labelled, and called for a comprehensive database of all forms of global anti-slavery spending - not just foreign aid funding - in order to help the world achieve the U.N. 2030 eradication goal. Many aid projects tackle issues such as migrant labour, child marriage and poverty, all of which can fuel trafficking but may not be classed as anti-slavery initiatives, experts say. “Figuring out how you identify and define efforts to tackle modern-day slavery is really challenging,” said Ed Marcum, managing director of U.S.-based foundation Humanity United. “But (the SDGs) have created more transparency, attention and commitment to tackling slavery and forced labour,” he added. Yet increased anti-slavery spending - aid or otherwise - will have little impact unless governments and companies seek to change a global economy fuelled by exploitation, said Genevieve LeBaron, a politics professor at Britain’s Sheffield University. ""If you are looking at a few billion (aid) dollars to undo the damage of an economy that is fundamentally broken ... where corporate profits arise from low-paid, vulnerable and exploited workers - it is grossly insufficient,"" the slavery expert added.

2018-09-13,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is drawing up a plan to replace a million heavy duty diesel trucks, almost 20 percent of the national fleet, with ones that burn cleaner fuel, as Beijing ramps up its war on pollution, potentially dealing a heavy blow to oil refiners. The transport and environment ministries are considering proposals that include replacing vehicles with more modern trucks using a higher grade of diesel called National Five, and using electric trucks or ones that run on liquefied natural gas (LNG), an industry source, who is involved in the discussions, said. He declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. The policy would come into effect in 2020 and would be implemented in the smoggiest northern regions of the country. It was not clear when the two ministries would make their final decision. The Ministry of Transport (MoT) said in July it wanted to remove a million polluting trucks in northern China as part of a three-year plan, but no details of the proposal have been reported. There are an estimated 6 million heavy duty trucks on China’s roads currently. The MoT confirmed the two ministries are drafting a plan, but declined to reveal more details. The Ministry of Environment and Ecology was not immediately available for comment. The push is the latest by the government to improve air quality, curb exhaust emissions from road vehicles and boost railroad use. The vast majority of the 47.2 billion tonnes of freight transported across China last year was by highway. The two ministries have held several meetings with industrial experts in recent months to iron out details of the proposal, the source said. He said the government is also considering subsidies for electric and gas vehicles because they are more expensive than diesel trucks. The government may also set stricter emissions targets for heavy duty trucks and increase emissions checks on vehicles, the source said. The “National Five” standard allows a maximum sulphur content of 10 parts per millions (ppm). The final policy may end up including a combination of several or all three of the proposals. But if it pulled so many diesel trucks off the road en masse, it would remove as much as 20 million tonnes of annual demand, according to Reuters’ calculations based on trucks that use 20 litres of diesel per 100 miles. That’s 11 percent of China’s annual diesel output. If adopted, it could slow China’s outright crude oil demand growth, which has been a key global price driver and revenue safeguard for the petroleum industry. It would also have a major impact on oil refiners across Asia, including China’s state-owned majors Sinopec and CNPC. Refiners geared towards lower diesel grades will out as the world’s biggest diesel consumer moves towards cleaner fuel. The industry produced about 183 million tonnes of diesel last year, with retail prices recently surging after independent refiners ran low on stocks during the summer maintenance period.  “The measures might further dampen diesel demand from long-distance truck drivers, who have been struggling with high prices,” Han Cong, fuel analyst with consultancy JLC, said.

2018-09-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - World oil consumption will top 100 million barrels per day (bpd) in the next three months, putting upward pressure on prices, although emerging market crises and trade disputes could dent this demand, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday. The Paris-based IEA maintained its forecast of strong growth in global oil demand this year of 1.4 million bpd and another 1.5 million bpd in 2019, unchanged from its previous projection. “Things are tightening up,” the agency that advises Western governments on energy policy said in its monthly report. “The price range for Brent LCOc1 of $70-$80 per barrel in place since April could be tested.” U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy industry, which come into force in November, have already cut supply back to two-year lows, while falling Venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere will also keep the balance between supply and demand tight, the IEA said. But it said rising demand could also be checked. “As we move into 2019, a possible risk to our forecast lies in some key emerging economies, partly due to currency depreciations versus the U.S. dollar raising the cost of imported energy. In addition, there is a risk to growth from an escalation of trade disputes,” the agency said. The United States and China have imposed a series of tariffs on each other’s goods since May that have unnerved equity markets, while a rising U.S. dollar has put emerging market currencies under pressure, raising the energy bill for some of the world’s largest oil importers. Demand from nations not in the OECD group of industrialised countries, led by China and India, is expected to rise by 1.1 million bpd to 51.6 million bpd this year and by 1.2 million bpd to 52.8 million bpd next year, the IEA said. Global demand will hit a high of 100.3 million bpd in the final quarter of this year, before moderating to 99.3 mln bpd in the first quarter of next year, the agency said.     “We are entering a very crucial period for the oil market. The situation in Venezuela could deteriorate even faster, strife could return to Libya and the 53 days to Nov. 4 will reveal more decisions taken by countries and companies with respect to Iranian oil purchases,” the IEA said, referring to the day U.S. sanctions on Iran take effect. “It remains to be seen if other producers decide to increase their production,” it said Demand for crude from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will moderate in 2019 to 31.9 million bpd, from an estimated 32.3 million bpd this year, the IEA said. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest member, is feeling the effect of the sanctions. The IEA said crude output fell in August by 150,000 bpd from July to a 25-month low of 3.63 million bpd, while exports fell by 280,000 bpd to 1.9 million bpd, from a peak of around 2.5 million bpd in May.

2018-09-13,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Two tankers carrying Iranian condensate, a type of ultra-light oil, have been floating off the United Arab Emirates for about a month as demand for the oil fell ahead of U.S. sanctions. The tankers, carrying about 2.4 million barrels of South Pars condensate combined, have been floating off the UAE since August after South Korea halted imports from Iran while China’s demand dropped during summer, according to several industry sources and shipping data.  The build-up in Iranian oil supplies underscores the pressure that Iran is facing as Washington aims to bring Iranian oil exports down to zero to force Tehran to re-negotiate a nuclear deal.  For a related graphic, click reut.rs/2p69koR The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Felicity loaded condensate at Iran’s Assaluyeh port in early August and then set sail for Jebel Ali in the UAE, shipping and trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. It arrived at the ship-to-ship transfer area off Dubai on Aug. 7 and has been anchored there since. Similarly, the Suezmax tanker Salina also loaded oil at Assaluyeh and has been circling in the same area off Dubai since Aug. 17, according to the data.  Oil processors in South Korea, Iran’s top customer for South Pars condensate, halted Iranian oil liftings in July as banks, insurance and shipping companies wound down business related to Iran before U.S. sanctions the country’s petroleum sector kick in on Nov. 4. China typically cuts South Pars condensate imports sharply during the summer months between the second and third quarter because of its foul smell, the sources said. The condensate contains high levels of a sulphurous compound known as mercaptans that require additional processing by refiners to remove. “Taking a cargo to China now when China may not want its arrival dates means it may lose a cargo to India,” a U.S.-based trader said. “So the cargoes will stay in place until they need to leave on agreed delivery period.”  Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC), another buyer of Iranian condensate, has been asked by the UAE government replace Iranian supply with imports from other countries, one of the sources said.      The UAE authorities are cracking down on oil and financial activities linked to Iran before the sanctions take effect. The National Iranian Oil Co and ENOC did not respond to requests for comment. The number of ships loaded with Iranian oil and anchored off the loading port of Kharg Island and the Souroush oil field has also risen as Iran’s pool of buyers shrank, the data showed. Three supertankers capable of carrying 2 million barrels, the Happiness I, MT Hedy and Humanity, have floated for 10 days or more while another four have been there for less than a week.

2018-09-13,"* Asian stocks bounce back from previous day’s 14-month low * Shanghai shares up, thanks to hopes for less trade friction * Trump might seek China deal before elections - Tokyo analyst * Turkish lira in focus as central bank seen raising rates By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares advanced on Thursday on news the Trump administration has reached out to China for a new round of trade talks, which raised hopes for a deal easing the bitter tariff dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. Despite Asia’s gains, spreadbetters expected European stocks to dip, with Britain’s FTSE seen opening 0.1 percent lower, Germany’s DAX losing 0.24 percent and France’s CAC slipping 0.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, a day after it hit 14-month lows. Early in the day, China’s A-shares shot up 1.2 percent on hopes for reduced trade tensions, then most of that gain was erase, but in the afternoon the index rose again, leaving it up 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 1.0 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was up 0.04 percent on Wednesday. Senior U.S. officials led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently sent an invitation to their Chinese counterparts, including Vice Premier Liu He, to hold another bilateral trade meeting. The development comes as more than 85 U.S. industry groups launched a coalition on Wednesday to take public its fight against President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined as the administration prepares to activate duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, hitting a broad array of internet technology products and consumer goods from handbags to bicycles to furniture. “Public support for Trump has fallen in recent weeks, with Democrats seen likely to capture the House of Representatives. He probably needs some sort of achievements on trade ahead of the mid-term elections,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. “So there could be a shift in his trade policy. He will surely keep his hard line rhetoric but his administration may seek to make some deals behind the scene,” he said. However, many market players remained cautious. “While we agree this should provide short-term relief, the road ahead can still be tricky,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong, noting concessions China made earlier this year did not satisfy Trump. “China may not be able to offer much more than that, especially if this involves adjusting its Made in China 2025 policy,” he said in a note. Still, any serious signs of easing in trade tensions should benefit shares in China and other Asian courtiers the most given they have borne the brunt of U.S. protectionist moves. The trade tensions have hammered global riskier assets over the past few months as policymakers and investors worried about the hit to the world economy. MSCI’s broad emerging markets index has fallen more than 20 percent from its peak in January, entering  bear market territory. “This perception that growth in the US is strong and the rest is weak should reverse. I already see some signs of that in economic surprise indicators. The gap in economic expectations between the U.S. and Europe or Japan is too wide,” said Luca Paolini, London-based chief strategist of Pictet Asset Management, noting U.S. stocks now account for 62 percent of the developed market. That is the highest levels since the 1970s, according to Thomson Reuters Datastream. In the currency market, the dollar eased a little on the trade talk hopes as well as on soft U.S. wholesale price data, which undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in August, recording their first drop in 1-1/2 years and denting talk of accelerating inflation following Friday’s strong wage data. The euro traded at $1.1624, extending its gain this week to 0.6 percent. The yen weakened 0.2 percent on Thursday to 111.47 per dollar on easing trade worries. Sterling held near a six-week high of $1.3087 as Brexit-supporting lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party publicly pledged support for her to stay in power. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold policy meetings on Thursday, but both are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Perhaps attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates to shore up its battered lira. The lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and by a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington. The lira crisis has spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals such as sizable current account deficits. The lira traded at 6.3700 per dollar, up about 0.7 percent on the week and well off its record low of 7.240 reached one month ago. Oil prices fell, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session, as economic concerns raised doubts about fuel demand growth. Brent futures hit $80 per barrel on Wednesday but eased in Asia to $79.31, down 0.5 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Daniel Leussink; Editing by Shri

2018-09-13,"* Mining giant looks to build power plant for Oyu Tolgoi * Domestic electricity has to be secured by 2022 * Political instability a key issue - former govt official By Barbara Lewis and Munkhchimeg Davaasharav LONDON/ULAANBAATAR, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Nearly 10 years on from the launch of a giant copper and gold project in Mongolia, Rio Tinto is still looking to secure a domestic power source it needs for the mine under an agreement with the government. Oyu Tolgoi, located in the South Gobi region near landlocked Mongolia’s southern border with China, is scheduled to complete a $5.3 billion underground expansion for first production by 2020, creating one of the world’s biggest copper suppliers. The project, launched in 2009 and 34 percent-controlled by Mongolia, is set to transform the country’s tiny economy, and is also key for Rio as the biggest potential growth area for its copper business. But it has been beset by squabbles over cost overruns and claims of unpaid taxes. Under an agreement with the government, by 2022 a domestic power source must be found for the project, currently running on power imported from China. But while Rio has invited three state-owned Chinese firms to submit bids to build a power station at a cost of up to $1.5 billion, it has yet to make a final decision on a go-ahead. Rio also has yet to have its permits for the plant renewed by the Mongolian government, according to a government source. “The main challenge remains the same: political instability and unpredictability,” said Otgochuluu Chuluuntseren, a former government official who also served as an Oyu Tolgoi board member. Oyu Tolgoi has suffered repeated delays amid government wrangling, the reshuffling of officials, disputes over Mongolia’s share of the returns and opposition to foreign participation among nationalist politicians. Complicating the power project has been the Mongolian government’s desire to kickstart the nearby Tavan Tolgoi coal project, one of the world’s biggest deposits with an estimated reserve of more than 6 billion tonnes, which lies just 150 km (93 miles) from Oyu Tolgoi. Rio had originally planned to build its own power plant, but it suspended construction plans in 2012 after it was encouraged by the government to switch to a proposed plant at Tavan Tolgoi, where it would be an off-taker rather than investor. However, in February this year, the government cancelled a 2014 agreement setting up a framework for co-operation on a shared power plant, with Rio saying the project still lacked a credible lead investor and could not be completed on time. Oyu Tolgoi currently pays about $100 million a year to buy electricity from China, according to an industry source with knowledge of the matter. The project is now looking at options for a domestic power source, said Luke Colton, chief financial officer at Turquoise Hill Resources, the Rio-controlled unit that owns 66 percent of the project. “An Oyu Tolgoi-based plant is currently the most feasible option that could deliver a domestic power source within the shortest timeframe,” Colton said in a call on second quarter earnings at the end of July. Rio Tinto said it was working with the government and other stakeholders to progress the building of a new power station. “Rio Tinto and its partners are committed to securing a domestic power supply within the agreed timeframe,” a spokesman said. Some government officials have expressed impatience about the power plant delays, underscoring the political challenges facing the project. “Oyu Tolgoi should stop playing with the Mongolian state!” Mongolia’s energy minister Davaasuren Tserenpil said on the ministry’s official Twitter account last month, in extracts from an interview to local media. “Oyu Tolgoi got permission from the ministry in 2012 to build the power plant on its site but it has done nothing.” Otgochuluu said transporting power from a Tavan Tolgoi plant to Oyu Tolgoi would be more efficient than transporting coal to a likely coal-fired plant at the Oyu Tolgoi mine. Of the three contractors invited by Rio to tender for the project, Power Construction Corp of China spokesman Sun Jianli told Reuters the bid was “preliminary” and the project was still “very far away”.

2018-09-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are locking in prices for their production as much as three years into the future in a sign that strong domestic crude pricing is nearing a peak, according to market sources familiar with money flows. U.S. crude prices for 2019 and 2020 CLYstc1 CLYstc2, based on an average of each year’s monthly contracts, have climbed this week above $68 and $64 a barrel, respectively, the highest levels in over three years. The rally comes even as front-month prices CLc1 have dropped from the 3-1/2-year highs touched during the summer. “Hedging activity has picked up considerably over recent weeks and this will continue to be the case as producers begin to frame budgets for next year,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets, noting the rally in forward prices are encouraging the producer bets.  Hedging can reduce risks associated with volatility in oil prices, acting as an insurance contract to lock in a future selling price and fix spending plans. Such longer-term bets signal U.S. producers will continue to expand output, keeping a lid on prices, according to crude traders and brokers. The nation’s output this year has climbed above 10 million barrels per day (bpd), close to top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. That output is forecast to grow next year by 840,000 bpd to average 11.5 million bpd. There was a large uptick in crude swap activity last week, with just shy of 8 million barrels changing hands in a day, an energy derivatives broker said, signalling strong hedging interest. Swaps are a type of contract that allow producers to lock in or fix the price they receive for their oil production.  Almost 80 percent of the swap activity was split evenly between calendars 2020 and 2019, and the remaining 20 percent for this year, the broker said, adding that there was a small amount of calendar 2021 activity during the week. For a graphic on U.S. oil prices, click reut.rs/2p0pL66 The market sources declined to say which oil companies were actively hedging in recent weeks. The move to hedge at these levels could prove risky for producers in a market where the price of oil for immediate delivery is higher than for later deliveries. Many U.S. shale producers hedged second-quarter production at about $55 a barrel, which backfired as U.S. crude climbed to more than $70 a barrel last quarter, the highest level since 2014.    As a result, producers are using more “collars,” a financial instrument that provides price protection on the downside while allowing them to share in some of the upside if prices rally.  “We’ve been building a lot of collar structures,” Christian Kendall, chief executive of Denbury Resources Inc (DNR.N) said last week, noting that the instruments will protect its production at about $60 a barrel and provide upside if oil rises to the high $70s per barrel. Denbury is nearly 50 percent hedged for 2019 and will add hedges to get to 60 percent to 70 percent of production, Kendall said. Meanwhile, oil companies that drill in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, where local prices are $14 below futures WTC-WTM because of full pipelines, are turning to a type of hedge geared to protecting them against regional weaknesses. “We have done an extensive amount of basis hedging,” said Javan Ottoson, chief executive of SM Energy Co (SM.N), which reported 11.2 million barrels of 2019 Permian oil production covered by basis hedges compared with 6.9 million barrels of 2018 production similarly covered at this time last year. Permian producers increased their 2020 oil-basis hedge positions by more than fourfold last quarter over the prior quarter with Concho Resources Inc (CXO.N) and Energen Corp EGN.N leading the surge, said consultancy Wood Mackenzie.  For 2019, Midland-Cushing basis hedging rose by 52 percent and the consultancy attributed the sharp increases to worries that new pipelines may be delayed past their planned startups beginning in 2019. Open interest in U.S. crude futures for delivery in 13 months to 36 months and beyond has grown in almost every month so far in 2018, CME Group Inc (CME.O) said.  Oil producers are “saying ‘we’re comfortable with our hedging in the front; we have appropriate hedges in place but what’s going to happen next,’” said Owain Johnson, managing director of energy research and product development at CME Group.

2018-09-13,"(Reuters) - Procurement of solar energy by U.S. utilities “exploded” in the first half of 2018, prompting a prominent research group to boost its five-year installation forecast on Thursday despite the Trump administration’s steep tariffs on imported panels. A record 8.5 gigawatts (GW) of utility solar projects were procured in the first six months of this year after President Donald Trump in January announced a 30 percent tariff on panels produced overseas, according to the report by Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables and industry trade group the Solar Energy Industries Association. As a result, the research firm raised its utility-scale solar forecast for 2018 through 2023 by 1.9 GW. The forecast is still 8 percent lower than before the tariffs were announced. A gigawatt of solar energy can power about 164,000 homes. Procurement soared in part because the 30 percent tariff was lower than many in the industry had feared, the report said. SEIA strongly lobbied against a tariff, saying it would drive up the cost of solar and hurt the industry’s robust job growth. In addition, panel prices have fallen faster than expected because China pulled back its subsidies for the renewable power source in June, creating an oversupply of modules in the global market that has eroded the impact of the tariff. Module prices averaged 42 cents a watt in the second quarter, the report said, 2 cents higher than the same period in 2017 but far below the 48 cents a watt they hit late last year as the industry fretted about a looming duty on imports. In every segment of the market except residential, system pricing is at its lowest level ever, the report said. Utility projects make up more than half the solar market. Utilities are eager to get projects going because of a federal solar tax credit that will begin phasing out in 2020. Next year will be the most impacted by the tariffs, Wood Mackenzie said. Developers will begin projects next year to claim the highest level of tax credit but delay buying modules until 2020 because the tariff drops by 5 percent each year. In the first half of the year, the U.S. installed 4.7 GW of solar, accounting for nearly a third of new electricity generating capacity additions. In the second quarter, residential installations were roughly flat with last year at 577 MW, while commercial and industrial installations slid 8 percent to 453 MW.

2018-09-13,"* Asian stocks bounce back from previous day’s 14-month low * Shanghai shares surge on trade hopes, then gains erased * Trump might seek China deal before elections - Tokyo analyst * Turkish lira in focus as central bank seen raising rates By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Asian shares won a reprieve on Thursday as news the Trump administration has reached out to China for a new round of trade talks raised hopes a deal could be struck in the bitter tariff dispute between the world’s two biggest economies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, a day after it hit 14-month lows. China’s A-shares shot up 1.2 percent on hopes for reduced trade tensions, but the excitement did not last long, and the index’s gain was almost erased, leaving it up only 0.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.9 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was up 0.04 percent on Wednesday. Senior U.S. officials led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently sent an invitation to their Chinese counterparts, including Vice Premier Liu He, to hold another bilateral trade meeting. The development comes as more than 85 U.S. industry groups launched a coalition on Wednesday to take public its fight against President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs. Trump’s tariffs have escalated far beyond what business groups once imagined as the administration prepares to activate duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods, hitting a broad array of internet technology products and consumer goods from handbags to bicycles to furniture. “Public support for Trump has fallen in recent weeks, with Democrats seen likely to capture the House of Representatives. He probably needs some sort of achievements on trade ahead of the mid-term elections,” said Mutsumi Kagawa, chief global strategist at Rakuten Securities in Tokyo. “So there could be a shift in his trade policy. He will surely keep his hard line rhetoric but his administration may seek to make some deals behind the scene,” he said. However, many market players remained cautious. “While we agree this should provide short-term relief, the road ahead can still be tricky,” said Tai Hui, chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong, noting concessions China made earlier this year did not satisfy Trump. “China may not be able to offer much more than that, especially if this involves adjusting its Made in China 2025 policy,” he said in a note. Still, any serious signs of easing in trade tensions should benefit shares in China and other Asian courtiers the most given they have borne the brunt of U.S. protectionist moves. The trade tensions have hammered global riskier assets over the past few months as policymakers and investors worried about the hit to the world economy. MSCI’s broad emerging markets index has fallen more than 20 percent from its peak in January, entering  bear market territory. In the currency market, the dollar eased a little on the trade talk hopes as well as on soft U.S. wholesale price data, which undermined the case for a faster pace of policy tightening by the Federal Reserve. U.S. producer prices unexpectedly fell in August, recording their first drop in 1-1/2 years and denting talk of accelerating inflation following Friday’s strong wage data. The euro traded at $1.1636, extending its gain this week to 0.71 percent. The yen weakened slightly on Thursday to 111.40 per dollar on easing trade worries. Sterling held near a six-week high of $1.3087 as Brexit-supporting lawmakers in British Prime Minister Theresa May’s party publicly pledged support for her to stay in power. The European Central Bank and the Bank of England hold policy meetings on Thursday, but both are widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged. Perhaps attracting more attention is a policy meeting by the Turkish central bank, which is expected to raise interest rates to shore up its battered lira. The lira has lost more than 40 percent of its value against the dollar this year, hit by worries over President Tayyip Erdogan’s grip on monetary policy and by a diplomatic spat between Ankara and Washington. The lira crisis has spread to some other emerging market countries with weak economic fundamentals such as sizable current account deficits. The lira traded at 6.3450 per dollar, up about 1.1 percent on the week and well off its record low of 7.240 reached one month ago. Oil prices fell, reversing some of the strong gains from the previous session, as economic concerns raised doubts about fuel demand growth. Brent futures hit $80 per barrel on Wednesday but eased in Asia to $79.25, down 0.6 percent on the day.

2018-09-13,"(Updates dateline, adds comments from Australia’s minister of trade) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Sept 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian and Australian sugar industry groups are working together with their respective governments to prepare a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over any possible sugar export subsidy by India, a top Brazilian sugar official told Reuters. Brazil and Australia view any subsidy by India, set to take over as the world’s largest sugar producer this year, as a grave threat to a recent price recovery, Eduardo Leão, executive director at Brazil’s cane industry group Unica, said in an interview. The two countries reached a consensus regarding the need to act at the WTO level if India moves to provide an export subsidy to sugar producers, Leão told Reuters late Tuesday. Analysts and sugar traders are expecting such a move by India as the country would be willing to put in the market a large local surplus built after a record crop this year, and amid expectations for another big output in the coming season. “We have heard comments that India could launch a export subsidy,” Leão said. “It is not admissible, we would seek an action from the Brazilian government,” he added. Raw sugar prices in New York recovered slightly in the last days since slumping to a 10-year low of 9.91 cents on Aug. 22 as a two-year global supply surplus and massive fund short position pressured values. There was no immediate comment from the Indian trade ministry. Indian officials have earlier said the country’s sugar exports do not violate WTO rules as New Delhi does not give any subsidy for overseas sales. India rather gives production subsidy to its cane growers. The Unica director said there are talks going on with Australian sugar industry representatives for a joint strategy at the WTO if the need arises. Australia’s Minister for Trade, Simon Birmingham on Thursday declined to confirm or deny plans for a formal complaint, though he confirmed Canberra’s frustration. “It is clear that export subsidies introduced recently by the India and Pakistan governments have contributed to a growing glut on global markets,” Birmingham said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “ has expressed its concerns to the India and Pakistan governments at the highest levels in the clearest possible terms.” Australia, one the world’s largest sugar exporters, is expected to produce a near record crop of 4.8 million tonnes this year, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences estimated. “We know the market fell due to a coincidence of large productions in Europe, Thailand and India, but things are improving now, production is falling so we don’t see the need for a export subsidy from India,” Leão said. Market estimates put Indian sugar surplus at about 10 million tonnes. That sugar is priced above current market so to stimulate exports the government would need to help mills. Unica’s director said Indian mills will eventually be able to sell in the export market as prices continue to recover. He said the Brazilian government is willing to back their plans. “They are sensitive to this due to the difficult financial situation of many mills”. Brazil decided on Aug. 31 to open a consultation at the WTO regarding Chinese safeguards on sugar imports. Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Additional reporting by Manoj

2018-09-13,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China has sacked 16 government officials and is investigating several more over the unauthorised construction of a reportedly 20 square kilometre private lake which has damaged the environment and caused flooding. A businessman created the lake in Hunan province, south-central China, by building barriers at Dongting Lake, the country’s second-biggest freshwater lake and a flood basin for the Yangtze River, state news agency Xinhua reported late on Wednesday without elaborating on the lake’s purpose. The Hunan government, in a statement, said the businessman - who had carried out contract work for local authorities since 2001 - began construction in 2008 and in 2014 came to the attention of officials who failed to rectify the situation. The case comes amid a central government campaign to eliminate hundreds of tiny and often substandard dams and turbines to bring order to China’s massive hydropower sector after years of unconstrained construction. Xinhua first reported on the lake in June. The government said it dismantled the barriers the same month and has since questioned 65 officials over the matter. It said it dismissed two officials from the province’s animal husbandry and fisheries bureau as well as the deputy mayor of Yiyang, a city close to the lake.

2018-09-13,"(Repeats SEPT 12 story with no change to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2p0CTbx By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil production is running into capacity constraints, which are starting to have a material impact on the global availability of crude, causing the market to tighten and putting upward pressure on prices. The biggest problem is the lack of sufficient pipeline capacity to move oil from shale wells in western Texas and eastern New Mexico to refineries in the Midwest and export terminals on the Gulf Coast. But production in the Permian Basin has also been constrained by shortages of labour, equipment and materials, which have pushed drilling, pressure pumping and completion costs sharply higher. The most obvious impact has been a sharp drop in the price that Permian producers receive for their oil compared with other benchmarks, especially Brent (tmsnrt.rs/2p0CTbx). West Texas producers are currently receiving just $55 per barrel for oil delivered to Midland, in the heart of the Permian, compared with $79 for North Sea Brent. The massive discount reflects the twin difficulties of moving the crude out of the Permian to the main inland trading hub at Cushing in Oklahoma or down to the refineries and export terminals on the coast. Midland crude is currently trading at discount of $14 per barrel compared with Cushing, while Cushing is itself priced at a further discount of $10 to Brent. Midland has traded at an average discount to Brent of more than $12 per barrel this year, up from $4 in 2017 and less than $1 in 2016, and the price differential is steadily worsening. Midland prices have mostly been falling this year while Brent has climbed, leaving Midland up by just $10 per barrel (22 percent) since the end of June 2017 while Brent has risen by $32 (68 percent). Softening Midland prices have already eased the region’s drilling frenzy, with the number of rigs drilling in the Permian flat over the last three months, after rising by more than 110 in the previous year. Well completions, which are more relevant for production, also show signs of stabilising in recent months, after increasing fairly consistently over the two previous years (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, August 2018). Since the Permian Basin has been the biggest contributor to U.S. oil output growth in the last two years, the slowdown is starting to temper expectations for further increases in the rest of 2018 and through 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now expects U.S. crude production in 2018 to average 10.66 million barrels per day (bpd), down from 10.79 million bpd at the time of its July forecast. The agency has cut its prediction for 2019 even more sharply to 11.50 million bpd, down from 11.86 million bpd at the time of its May forecast (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, September 2018). Slower growth in U.S. production, when combined with strong demand, production problems in Venezuela and other countries, and the re-imposition of sanctions on Iran, is enough to tighten the global market in late 2019.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $70.19 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 18 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude futures dipped 11 cents to $79.63 a barrel. Brent rose above $80 per barrel the previous session for the first time since May, spurred by expectations that U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, which will start in November, will tighten global markets. U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell 5.3 million barrels in the week to Sept. 7 to 396.2 million barrels, the lowest since February 2015 and about 3 percent below the five-year average for this time of year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its weekly report on Wednesday. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, said crude inventory data for last week showed “a much deeper drop than analyst’s expectations ... propelling Brent briefly above the fundamental and psychological $80 a barrel for the first time since May, and was equally as supportive for the WTI contract.” U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA fell by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd), to 10.9 million bpd. Innes said the slight dips on Thursday came as rising refined product inventories, which the EIA also reported, “slightly dampened market overexuberance” as it indicated that U.S. fuel demand may be weakening. Gasoline stocks rose 1.3 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 6.2 million barrels, the EIA data showed. Overall, however, Innes said “the confluence of bullish near-term signals (of) Iran sanctions and sinking U.S. crude inventories should keep oil prices supported for the remainder of the week.” Reporting by Henning Gloystein

United Nations research, revealed exclusively by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, showed annual anti-trafficking aid funding by the 36-nation OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) at least tripled to $434 million from 2000 to 2013. The United States was the largest donor - accounting for 60 percent of $4 billion pledged in this period - followed by Canada and Norway, and Afghanistan, India and Colombia were the top recipients, according to the U.N. University (UNU) report. Yet many nations received small or inconsistent sums, raising fears about the effectiveness and sustainability of anti-slavery funding given the dearth of data on its impact. Modern slavery is increasingly seen as a major global issue, with an estimated 40 million people enslaved, but there is growing scrutiny on how much is spent - and how well - to meet a U.N. goal of ending the $150 billion a year crime by 2030. “If in 12 years countries can’t show taxpayers what bang has come from their buck, there is every reason to think that people will not want them to keep spending on the issue,” said James Cockayne, director of the centre for policy research at the UNU. While the research only captured a snapshot of global anti-slavery funding - excluding private sector, philanthropic and domestic state spending - it sets a benchmark for future data to spur countries to better measure their interventions, he added. “Governments will have to be able to demonstrate where they are preventing people falling into slavery - and how many.” Although aid is just one prong in the drive to end slavery, major countries from Australia to Britain should spend more if the 2030 goal is to be met, said Nick Grono of the Freedom Fund. “$430 million a year is significant, but nowhere near enough to make a measurable difference,” said the chief executive of the first private donor fund dedicated to ending modern slavery. “Yet meeting the U.N. goal is not all about increasing aid,” he added. “It is a question of the political will and priorities of donor countries, and those where slavery is most prevalent.” The data found that some of the countries receiving the most anti-slavery aid were not the nations estimated to be the most affected by modern slavery, with the researchers suggesting some funding is pledged for political rather than practical reasons. “Politicisation of this spending would not be surprising ... especially as migration is now such a major focus for many countries,” said Nicola Jones, principal research fellow at the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), a British think tank. Rich nations have been criticised by campaigners for funding aid projects that appear focused on preventing people in poorer countries migrating rather than falling into slavery. Some of the United States’ top anti-slavery aid recipients were Colombia, Jordan and Mexico - all long-time U.S. allies - receiving millions of dollars annually, the data shows, yet none rank highly in the Global Slavery Index of hardest-hit nations. However the UNU stressed that the research did not cover all forms of anti-slavery aid spending and so did not give a full picture of U.S. funding - whether from the Agency for International Development (USAID) or State or Labor Departments. The State Department came under fire in 2015 after a Reuters investigation found that U.S. diplomats pressured the office set up to grade global anti-trafficking efforts into inflating the rankings of 14 strategically vital nations in its annual report. USAID said it would examine the UNU research before deciding whether to comment, while the State Department’s Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons said it considers a range of factors in determining where to allocate its funding. “In addition to political will, these include analyses of where and how other donors are programming; the capabilities and needs of organisations in the field; and the likelihood for sustainability of our efforts,” a senior official said by email. “Regarding global estimates, there is no exact or conclusive data that accurately reflects the number of people exploited.” The report also found that most countries receiving anti-trafficking aid - including nations estimated to be rife with slavery such as Yemen and Malawi - were granted less than $1 million a year, which the UNU said were “notably small sums”. “$1 million a year is a drop in the ocean ... and would likely push countries to focus on a narrow, punitive approach rather than addressing broader social issues that can lead to slavery,” said Jones of the ODI. “A focus on prevention is key.” The UNU said its study had limitations, such as the fact the data stops before the 2015 adoption of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) after which donors - including Britain - pledged large sums, and the omission of non-OECD aid money. The UNU researchers said aid projects must be more precisely defined, and called for a comprehensive database of all forms of global anti-slavery spending - not just foreign aid funding - in order to help the world achieve the U.N. 2030 eradication goal. Many aid projects tackle issues such as migrant labour, child marriage and poverty, all of which can fuel trafficking but may not be classed as anti-slavery initiatives, experts say. “Figuring out how you identify and define efforts to tackle modern-day slavery is really challenging,” said Ed Marcum, managing director of U.S.-based foundation Humanity United. “But (the SDGs) have created more transparency, attention and commitment to tackling slavery and forced labour,” he added. Yet increased anti-slavery spending - aid or otherwise - will have little impact unless governments and companies seek to change a global economy fuelled by exploitation, said Genevieve LeBaron, a politics professor at Britain’s Sheffield University. ""If you are looking at a few billion (aid) dollars to undo the damage of an economy that is fundamentally broken ... where corporate profits arise from low-paid, vulnerable and exploited workers - it is grossly insufficient,"" the slavery expert added.
