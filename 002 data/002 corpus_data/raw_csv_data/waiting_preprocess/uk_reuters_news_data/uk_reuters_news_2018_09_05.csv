2018-09-05,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon weakened into a depression on Wednesday but was dumping heavy rains that threatened to cause floods across several southern U.S. states while Hurricane Florence strengthened to a Category 4 storm and could menace Bermuda.  Gordon made landfall on Tuesday night near the Alabama-Mississippi border with near hurricane-force winds, the National Hurricane Center said.  But by Wednesday afternoon its centre was well inland, dumping heavy rains and causing flooding in western Florida and coastal Alabama. Property damage was minimal, the NHC said. A 2-year-old girl died when a tree fell on a mobile home in Pensacola, Florida, the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office said.  Gordon continued to weaken over central Mississippi and by 4 p.m. CDT (2100 GMT) was about 45 miles (75 km) northwest of Jackson with maximum sustained winds of 30 miles per hour (45 km per hour), the Weather Prediction Center said.  The threat of heavy rains and flooding will continue for several days in the Mississippi Valley, forecasters said.  Energy companies and port operators along the Gulf Coast took steps to resume normal operations after Gordon shut 9 percent of the region’s oil and natural gas production. Oil prices fell about 1 percent on Wednesday, after fears about the storm eased. In the Atlantic Ocean, the NHC on Wednesday upgraded Hurricane Florence to a Category 4 storm on a five-step scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (210 kph).  The first major hurricane of the Atlantic season will affect Bermuda’s surf by Friday, but it was too early to say whether it would hit land. “Swells from Florence could also reach the U.S. East Coast by early next week,” the NHC said. Florence was 1,295 miles (2,080 km) east-southeast of Bermuda on Wednesday afternoon. Some weakening is forecast during the next couple of days, “but Florence is expected to remain a powerful hurricane through early next week,” the NHC said.

2018-09-05,"New York (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than one percent on Wednesday after a U.S. Gulf storm weakened and moved away from oil-producing areas and as concerns mounted about global trade disputes and Turkey’s currency crisis hurting demand. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.15 to settle at $68.72 a barrel, a 1.65 percent loss. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 90 cents to settle at $77.27 a barrel, a 1.15 percent loss. The global benchmark had climbed in the previous session to $79.72 a barrel, its highest since May. Both benchmarks fell further in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed a slightly smaller than expected draw in U.S. crude inventories. Data was published a day later than usual because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday on Monday. [API/S]     Crude prices had jumped on Tuesday as oil companies shut dozens of offshore platforms in anticipation of damage from Tropical Storm Gordon. The storm, however, never became a hurricane and by Wednesday energy companies and port operators along the U.S. Gulf Coast took steps to resume operations. “Prices yesterday rose in anticipation that the storm could inflict some damage on the production and refining sector, but after all was said and done we lost a little bit of production and the refineries in Mississippi and Louisiana continued to run as Gordon made landfall,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. In all, companies halted 156,907 barrels per day of oil production, according to estimates Tuesday by the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement. Oil also weakened as the United States-China trade dispute raised demand worries. Trump could impose levies on $200 billion more of Chinese imports after a public comment period on the new tariffs ends on Thursday. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said global trade disputes could hurt energy demand in the future. Also weighing on crude futures was a currency crisis in Turkey. The lira has fallen more than 40 percent this year TRY=. “Fears of Turkey’s currency crisis spreading to other emerging markets have prompted demand-side concerns,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy. U.S. sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector from November are already reducing exports from OPEC’s third-largest producer and counteracting the impact of an agreement by OPEC and its allies to pump more oil. “With the anticipation of up to 1.5 million barrels per day affected by the U.S. sanctions on Iran, one would expect prices to move higher in the weeks ahead,” said Stephen Innes, of futures brokerage OANDA. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he could not predict what would happen with Iran and it did not matter to him if Iran’s leaders wanted to talk to him or not.

2018-09-05,"BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Protesters blocked the entrance to Iraq’s Umm Qasr commodities port on Wednesday to demand better services, port employees and local government officials said, raising the stakes in some of the worst unrest in southern cities in months.  The move came hours after stone-throwing protesters set fire to the main provincial government building in the oil hub of Basra, Iraq’s second largest city. The highway from Basra to Baghdad was cut off by demonstrators. “Protesters have blocked the main entrance to the port. Trucks that carry supplies can’t enter or leave the facility,” said one of the officials. Any potential disruptions to oil production could severely impact Iraq’s limping economy as the OPEC member faces the overwhelming task of rebuilding after a war with Islamic State that cost tens of billions of dollars. Umm Qasr receives Iraq’s grain, vegetable oils and sugar shipments. So far it is not clear if the unrest will have a serious impact on the port’s operations. The troubles underline decades of neglect in the south, heartland of Iraq’s Shi’ite majority. The region suffers from electricity outages, unemployment and entrenched corruption. Earlier on Wednesday, security forces sprayed tear gas and fired into the air to try to disperse demonstrators.  The deaths of five protesters in clashes with security forces on Tuesday added to the fury. Security and health sources said 22 members of the security forces had been injured in Tuesday’s violence, some by a hand grenade. Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital. This is proof, they say, that infrastructure has been allowed to collapse in the part of Iraq that produces most of its oil wealth. Oil exports from Basra - a crumbling city once dubbed the “Venice of the Middle East” for its network of canals resembling the Italian city - account for more than 95 percent of state revenues. Basra is a stronghold of Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric and former leader of an anti-American sectarian militia who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner. Public anger has grown at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May.  Sadr’s bloc came in first place in the vote, which was tainted by allegations of corruption which forced a recount. Iraq’s top Shi’ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has expressed support for the protests.

2018-09-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks led declines in indexes across the globe on Wednesday as investors positioned themselves more defensively while a deadline in the U.S.-China trade conflict loomed and U.S.-Canada trade talks resumed. Weakness in emerging market currencies offered some support to the dollar, which retreated modestly, as the euro rose and Britain’s sterling regained some ground in volatile trading after a four-day losing streak. The United States and Canada resumed talks about revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Canada insisted there was room to salvage the pact despite few signs a deal was close. U.S. President Donald Trump said talks with Canada were coming along. A public comment period on the possibility of fresh U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that Trump will impose the additional levies.  The deadline weighed on MSCI's emerging markets equities index .MSCIEF, which fell 1.7 percent in line with a drop in the Shanghai SE Composite index .SSEC. “The linchpin will be China,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in St. Louis, adding that if China continues to grow, other emerging market countries could regain ground. “We’re actually kicking the tires to see where there’s value,” Samana said.  On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 22.51 points, or 0.09 percent, to 25,974.99, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.12 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,888.6 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 96.07 points, or 1.19 percent, to 7,995.17. [.N] Along with global concerns, U.S. politics were preying on investors minds with issues including upcoming mid-term elections and controversies around President Donald Trump, according to Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. “In the absence of an earnings season, politics will be a bigger factor in this market up until the midterms. In general people feel somewhat uneasy. There’s underlying nervousness about politics, interest rates and emerging markets.” The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.20 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.61 percent. Emerging market currencies showed a second day of declines, with a JPMorgan emerging market currency index .MIEM00000CUS falling 0.2 percent on fears export-oriented economies would be caught in the crossfire of any escalating trade conflict.

2018-09-05,"(Adds table, details) DUBAI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has raised the European price for its Arab Light crude grade for October, the state oil producer said on Wednesday, as Russian Urals prices rally and European refiners seek to replace Iranian oil supplies ahead of the November U.S. sanctions deadline. Aramco has raised the official selling price (OSP) to Northwest Europe by $1.45 a barrel from the previous month, putting it at a discount of $1.80 per barrel to ICE Brent. Russian Urals crude prices have rallied in recent weeks as European refineries’ appetite for crudes similar to Iran’s has pushed up prices. Urals prices in NorthWest Europe are currently at the strongest this year, and are not far off a five year high. Iran’s oil exports are already dropping fast as refiners scurry to find alternatives ahead of a reimposition of U.S. sanctions in early November. Aramco also cut its October OSP for Arab Light to Asia by $0.10 a barrel versus September, putting it a premium of $1.10 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average. Saudi Arabia was expected to keep prices for the light crude grades it sells to Asia largely unchanged in October from the previous month to keep its oil competitive against other suppliers, according to a Reuters survey. The Arab Light OSP to the United States was set at a premium of $1.00 a barrel to the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI) for October, up $0.10 a barrel from the previous month.

2018-09-05,"WIESBADEN, Germany, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A German judge is due to decide whether the city of Frankfurt, the country’s financial centre, should ban high-pollution diesel vehicles as a way to improve inner city air quality. The court in Wiesbaden is on Wednesday deliberating on a case brought by environmental group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) after a landmark ruling by Germany’ top administrative court in February opened the door to inner-city bans. The latest diesel vehicles manufactured in Germany will meet new emissions standards but the majority of diesel cars on German roads are older. DUH has argued that banning diesels is the only way for Frankfurt to meet European Union clean air rules which stipulate that nitrogen dioxide pollution should not exceed 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air on average. Presiding judge Rolf Hartmann did not rule out diesel bans in his opening remarks on Wednesday. “We need to understand that this is about a threat to our health,” Hartmann said, adding that this was not merely a niche matter for environmentalists to deal with. Pollution levels have regularly exceeded the limit since 2010, the court heard. The judge could say as soon as Wednesday whether bans are a viable and probable solution to clean up Frankfurt’s air. The city of Hamburg this year blocked diesel models that fail to meet the latest Euro-6 emissions standards from using selected trunk roads. Other cities including Aachen, Duesseldorf and Stuttgart, home to Daimler and Porsche are also considering bans. A ban on diesel vehicles would lead to higher sales of petrol engined cars, which are less fuel efficient and cause more carbon dioxide pollution. This in turn makes it harder for carmakers to cut emissions of greenhouse gases adding pressure on them to push electric or hybrid vehicles at a time when Mercedes, BMW and Audi are readying launches of electric cars.

Wall Street was set to open weaker. A public comment period on the possibility of fresh U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that the additional levies will be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The United States and Canada will also resume discussions on Wednesday on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Ottawa is not expected to back down on key issues despite Trump’s threats to retaliate. The dollar is benefiting from these uncertainties. But it has also drawn strength from upbeat U.S. indicators supporting the case for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve — data showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerating to more than a 14-year high in August. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar was flat on the day, though it retreated a touch to stand just off two-week highs hit on Tuesday. The greenback’s 8 percent surge since end-March has sent emerging markets reeling, with MSCI’s emerging equity benchmark falling for the sixth day in a row and down 1.5 percent on the day, while an index of emerging market currencies shed 0.3 percent to 15-month lows. European shares retreated 0.6 percent to two-month lows , following weak closes in Asia, where expectations of U.S. tariffs sent Chinese shares down almost 1 percent . “Until last month people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what’s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China,” said Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. “If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.” The growth outlook fears, particularly for the developing world, were encapsulated by South Africa where data on Tuesday showed the economy slipping into recession for the first time since 2009. The rand has subsequently joined the Turkish lira and Argentine peso in a relentless sell-off, falling 1 percent and adding to the previous day’s 3 percent slump. Argentina’s peso fell again on Tuesday, even though International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde confirmed the IMF was working to improve a $50 billion standby finance deal for the country. The peso has shed more than half its value to the dollar this year, with Turkish lira a close second, having fallen more than 40 percent. There were signs of distress also in Indonesia, where the rupiah is trading at its lowest since the 1998 financial crisis. The Mexican peso shed 1 percent to a two-month low against the greenback. “Rising U.S. rates, weak emerging market macro fundamentals and jittery geopolitics make for a poisonous concoction for EM assets,” analysts at Danske Bank said. They also highlighted a geopolitical element to the sell-off, noting that Russia and Turkey at least had “seen their crises aggravated by geopolitical confrontation with the U.S.”. The trade war fears are not sparing U.S. markets either, with equity futures for all three New York indexes down around 0.3 percent  . Along with the U.S. interest rate outlook, these concerns are keeping intact the dollar’s safe-haven appeal. The greenback was at a near one-week high versus the yen while the euro was flat, following a loss of 0.35 percent on Tuesday. The British pound retreated 0.2 percent to two-week lows . “In a context where U.S. growth is still resilient, it supports a Fed rate hike in September and likely also in December,” Barraud said. “There is focus on the growth differential (between the United States and the rest of the world).” One bright spot was Italy, where the mood has been lifted by signs the coalition government has abandoned plans for a spending binge that would have risked credit rating downgrades and put Rome on collision course with the European Union. Italian stocks rose 1 percent, contrasting with declines elsewhere and sovereign borrowing costs fell sharply — 10-year bond yields slipped under 3 percent for the first time in more than two weeks . On commodity markets, oil prices fell one percent, pressured by the dollar and signs a tropical storm had impacted U.S. Gulf coast production less than expected.

2018-09-05,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan began on Wednesday to clean up after a powerful typhoon killed 11 people, injured hundreds and stranded thousands at a flooded airport, though when the airport in an industrial and tourist hub might reopen was not clear. Typhoon Jebi, or “swallow” in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and was the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years. It came after months of heavy rain, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer. (For a graphic on 'Japan Typhoon' click tmsnrt.rs/2N6Eudz) About 3,000 tourists were stuck overnight at Kansai Airport in western Japan, an important hub for companies exporting semiconductors built on reclaimed land on a bay near Osaka and connected to the mainland by a bridge that was damaged when a tanker slammed into it during the storm. But by afternoon many people had been rescued by bus or ferried by ship from the airport, where puddles still stood on the main runway after it was inundated on Tuesday. “More than anything else, I really want to take a bath,” one woman told NHK public television.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday afternoon about 470 people were injured. It was uncertain when the airport would reopen and some roads and train lines in the affected areas were still closed, he said. But the number of households without power had been roughly halved to 530,000. “The government will continue to do everything possible to tackle these issues with utmost urgency,” Suga told a news conference earlier. Japan’s JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp (5020.T) shut at least one refining units at its 135,000 barrels-per-day Sakai refinery in Osaka due to typhoon damage to part of the cooling tower, the trade ministry said. Many chip plants operate in the Kansai region. Toshiba Memory, the world’s second-largest maker of flash memory chips, was monitoring developments closely and may need to ship products from other airports if Kansai remains closed, a spokeswoman said.  She said the company was not expecting a major impact because its plant in Yokkaichi in central Japan had not been affected by the typhoon. It could take several days to a week to reopen Kansai airport depending on the damage, the Yomiuri newspaper quoted an unidentified person in the airline industry as saying. Winds that in many places gusted to the highest ever recorded in Japan, according to the Japanese Meteorological Agency, left a swathe of damage, with fruit and vegetables, many about to be harvested, hit especially hard.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was criticised in July for an initially slow response to devastating floods that month, posted updates on the rescue efforts at Kansai. Jebi’s course brought it close to parts of western Japan hit by rains and flooding in July that killed more than 200 people, but most of the damage this time appeared to be from the wind.

2018-09-05,"PARIS (Reuters) - France, the world’s most nuclear-dependent country, will announce target dates for adjustments to the national energy mix in late October, the newly appointed environment minister said on Wednesday.  Francois de Rugy assumed the ministerial role on Tuesday after the departure of Nicolas Hulot, who quit in part over what he saw as the government’s slow progress in moving away from its dependence on nuclear power. De Rugy gave no signal of what changes to the mix he would want to see, saying only that the end of next month was the deadline for unveiling a multi-year energy production programme. A first draft of that programme was originally expected during the summer, with a fuller version to be completed by year-end. “There’ll be a multi-year programme for energy and we will be in a position to present that at the end of October,” he told France Inter radio. “The issue is obviously not a simple one.” President Emmanuel Macron campaigned on a promise to respect an energy law introduced by the previous Socialist government. That law calls on France to cut its reliance on nuclear energy to 50 percent by 2025 from 75 percent now, the highest level in the world. bit.ly/2LwOEiM Macron has already pushed back the target date to 2035, something to which Hulot had reluctantly agreed. De Rugy, who did not specify whether the end-October plan would be a first draft or definitive, would not be drawn on how targets may change further but said the government aimed to rebalance the production mix in line with the legislative commitment made in 2015. “That’s to say, how the law that we adopted will be applied - something that was not done before now, in terms of each type of energy and the transformation we want with development of renewable energy sources,” he said. Some commentators believe de Rugy will be more pliable than Hulot, who said France’s environmental commitments - including those under the global pact on climate change adopted under France’s chairmanship of the negotiations - were not given necessary priority under Macron.   De Rugy sidestepped questions about the influence that state-controlled power giant EDF has over policy given its huge presence in nuclear energy. It has 58 plants in France and plans to build more. “EDF is a big company which knows how to make itself heard,” he said.

2018-09-05,"SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Asian airlines may have to raise airfares to mitigate costs from high jet fuel prices, analysts said, a move that would likely cap booming growth in aviation demand and slash jet fuel margins that are seasonally at their strongest in five years. The profit margins refiners make from producing jet fuel are currently at their strongest for this time of year since 2013, thanks to an aviation sector that has surged with regional economic growth, cheap fares and increased route options. But aviation fuel prices, one of the main input costs for airlines, are also lingering close to their highest in about four years, weighing on airlines’ balance sheets. Asian jet cracks are currently around $16 a barrel over Dubai crude, while jet prices JET-SIN are close to their highest levels since December 2014. “If jet fuel prices get too high then airlines will have to start revising their air fares up,” said a Singapore-based middle distillates trader, adding that higher ticket prices could result in a fall in passenger miles. Data from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) released last week showed a slowdown in Asia-Pacific airlines’ traffic in July, up 7.5 percent over the same month last year, as against a growth of 9.6 percent in June. “Rising costs - particularly fuel - will likely limit the stimulus we would expect from lower airfares. Therefore, we do expect to see a continued slowing of growth compared to 2017,” said IATA Chief Executive Alexandre de Juniac in a statement. Airlines such as Air India and China Southern Airlines in major Asian travel hubs are struggling to remain profitable as higher fuel costs are partly offsetting the benefits of strong travel demand. Indian airlines alone are expected to post combined losses of up to $1.9 billion this financial year due to rising costs and low air fares, aviation consulting firm CAPA India said. While the likelihood of increased airfares casts a shadow on aviation demand growth, winter heating demand could help carry the strong jet/kerosene margins forward, trade sources said. During winter, typically starting in the fourth quarter, demand in the region picks up for kerosene as a heating fuel. Jet fuel and kerosene are closely related and belong to the same grade of oil products - middle distillates - with jet fuel margins determining the profitability of both. “Asian refiners have been steadily increasing their jet fuel yields over the recent times. Still, a tight middle distillate market is holding jet premiums high,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of the East of Suez, Oil, division at consultancy FGE. “Although some seasonal downturns are possible, overall premiums should stay strong in the coming months. Not to forget, we are also entering a seasonally strong middle distillate demand period soon,” she said, referring to the northern hemisphere winter.

2018-09-05,"* Imports of Iran oil up 56 pct in August year on year * Indian refiners were attracted by Iranian discounts * Washington wants Iran oil trade to stop from November By Nidhi Verma NEW DELHI, Sept 5 (Reuters) - India imported about 523,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil from Iran in August, down 32 percent on a month earlier, preliminary tanker arrival data showed, as the United States steps up pressure on buyers to halt Iranian energy imports from November. Some of the shipments were loaded in July and arrived in August, the data obtained by Reuters from trade sources showed. The August 2018 imports were still 56 percent higher than the same month last year, the data showed, as state refiners were attracted by discounts offered by Iran this year. Annual import plans by Indian state refiners for 2018/2019 were finalised before President Donald Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and to reimpose sanctions. A senior Indian government official said India, Iran’s top oil client after China, would not completely halt Iranian imports and would finalise its strategy on crude purchases after a meeting U.S. officials on Thursday. In April-August, the first five months of the 2018/2019 fiscal year, India’s oil imports from Iran rose 43 percent to 646,200 bpd compared to the same period a year earlier, the data showed. State-run Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, imported about 4 million barrels in August, equivalent to about 134,000 bpd, or half the amount it imported in July. State refiners have faced delays in securing permission to use Iranian tankers and insurance, as federal policy requires them to favour Indian shippers and insurers, industry experts said. Western and Indian shippers are winding down their exposure to Iran before sanctions take effect. Bharat Petroleum Corp’s received about 131,000 bpd Iranian oil in August, a third less than July, the data showed. Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex, and Hindustan Petroleum Corp NS> did not buy oil from Iran in August. Monthly imports by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals’ and Nayara Energy, part owned by Russian oil giant Rosneft, were little changed at about 120,000 bpd and 138,000 bpd, respectively, the data showed. In January-August 2018, India’s oil imports from Iran were up 21 percent at 600,400 bpd compared with the same period a year ago, the data showed. Reporting by Nidhi Verma

Exxon and U.S. partner Hess Corp (HES.N) have said that more than 4 billion barrels of oil equivalent could be recovered from the Stabroek block off Guyana, which is part of one of the world’s biggest oil discoveries in the past decade. Tullow owns 60 percent and Eco Atlantic Oil and Gas (EOG.V) 40 percent in Orinduik. Total (TOTF.PA) has an option to buy 25 percent from Eco. “Hammerhead-1 is located approximately 7 km from the Orinduik licence boundary ...

Weakness in emerging market currencies helped support the dollar, even as sterling rebounded off a two-week low on hopes of a breakthrough in Brexit talks. That optimism came after a Bloomberg report said Britain and Germany were prepared to drop a key sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. U.S Treasury prices gained slightly as emerging market stock weakness boosted demand for low risk U.S. government debt, though pressure from a heavy corporate debt supply calendar limited gains. A public comment period on the possibility of fresh U.S. tariffs on another $200 billion of Chinese goods ends on Thursday, with expectations that the additional levies will be imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. The United States and Canada will also resume discussions on Wednesday on revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Ottawa is not expected to back down on key issues despite Trump’s threats to retaliate. “There’s still a cloud hanging over the market about whether we are actually going to see these (Chinese) tariffs take effect by the end of this week and continued concerns about the NAFTA deal,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 9.67 points, or 0.04 percent, to 25,942.81, the S&P 500 lost 13.95 points, or 0.48 percent, to 2,882.77 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 109.57 points, or 1.35 percent, to 7,981.68. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.98 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.71 percent. In Asia, expectations of U.S. tariffs sent the Shanghai SE Composite index down 1.7 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 1.73 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.8 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.51 percent. Emerging market currencies showed a second day of declines, with a JPMorgan emerging market currency index falling 0.3 percent. Sterling was last trading at $1.2897, up 0.33 percent on the day. Measured against a basket of currencies, the dollar index fell 0.19 percent, with the euro up 0.26 percent to $1.1611. “Until last month, people were focusing on U.S. company earnings but now they are looking closely at what’s happening in emerging markets, at the trade war and the fact that the United States is likely to implement another wave of tariffs against China,” said Christoph Barraud, an economist at Paris-based brokerage Market Securities. “If you look at global growth, more and more signs are that it will slow in coming months.” Oil prices fell as a U.S. Gulf tropical storm weakened and moved away from oil-producing areas, and concern about weakening global demand added downward pressure. U.S. crude fell 1.2 percent to $69.03 per barrel and Brent was last at $77.43, down 0.95 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Shreyashi Sanyal in Bengaluru, Sujata

2018-09-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is still awaiting payment from Venezuela on a $2 billion arbitration settlement reached last month with the country’s state-run PDVSA, Chief Executive Ryan Lance said on Wednesday.  Conoco last month suspended legal attachments efforts that had cut Venezuela’s oil exports from several Caribbean facilities following a deal that allowed the country 90 days to make an initial $500 million payment.  “I’ll count the money when it shows up in the bank,” Lance said on Wednesday at a Barclays energy conference in New York, in response to a question on how the company plans to use the settlement.  Lance said he expects Venezuela will honor the agreement, noting the company still has another two arbitration decisions involving Venezuela ahead of it. But Conoco would resume its legal efforts if the payments were not forthcoming, he said.  The deal stems from the nationalization of Conoco assets dating back over a decade in Venezuela. An international court in April ruled in favor of Conoco and ordered PDVSA to pay the $2 billion. Conoco began seizing PDVSA’s Caribbean assets earlier this year to enforce its claim. Conoco’s seizures in Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao and St. Eustatius had prevented PDVSA from using several terminals and export operations. Under terms of the agreement, Venezuela must pay $500 million by late November and the remaining $1.5 billion over the next 4-1/2 years.

2018-09-05,"(Adds details) By Liz Hampton Sept 5 (Reuters) - Offshore driller Transocean Ltd expects rates to lease drilling rigs to improve and contracting activity to pick up in late 2019, an outlook that drove its recent decision to purchase rival Ocean Rig UDW Inc for $2.7 billion, Chief Executive Officer Jeremy Thigpen said on Wednesday. Transocean on Tuesday agreed to buy Ocean Rig, marking its second major acquisition this year. Earlier this year, it also closed on a $1.1 billion acquisition of Norwegian rig firm Songa Offshore. The acquisitions signal an improved outlook for the offshore drilling sector which has been slow to recover from the 2014 oil price crash. Offshore fields typically require higher oil prices because they are more costly to develop. “We are far more bullish than we have been historically,” Thigpen said at a Barclay’s conference in New York. The improved outlook for day rates and contracting activity underpinned the decision to acquire Ocean Rig, he said. Transocean’s stock fell more than 6 percent this week after it announced plans to buy Ocean Rig. The company expects the market for offshore drilling vessels to move back into balance in the coming years, as some 60 units are going to come off contracts and retire, Thigpen said. He estimated actual marketable supply of offshore drilling vessels is around 184, and will increase to about 218 in the coming years.

2018-09-05,"BASRA, Iraq, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces sprayed tear gas and fired into the air to try to disperse thousands of protesters on Wednesday in the  southern city of Basra, in some of the worst unrest in the region for months. The deaths of five protesters in clashes with security forces on Tuesday added to anger in the oil hub over poor government services. Like other cities in the long-neglected south, Basra is plagued by electricity outages, unemployment and entrenched corruption. Twenty-two members of the security forces were wounded in Tuesday’s unrest, some by a hand grenade, security and health sources said. On Wednesday frustrations were once again focused on the provincial governorate building, where thousands of people gathered, said a Reuters witness. The crowds were growing. Basra residents say salt seeping into the water supply has made it undrinkable and sent hundreds to hospital, proof, they say, that infrastructure has been allowed to collapse in the part of the country that produces most of its oil wealth. Iraq’s second biggest city, Basra is a stronghold of Moqtada al-Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric and former leader of an anti-American sectarian militia who has recast himself as an anti-corruption campaigner. Public anger has swelled at a time when politicians are struggling to form a new government after an inconclusive parliamentary election in May. Sadr’s bloc came in first place in the poll, which was tainted by allegations of corruption which forced a recount.

The PFR deal assumes that Solaris production remains in Poland. “With the participation of the Polish investment fund as a minority shareholder, CAF maintains the Polish roots of Solaris, while establishing an alliance with a strong financial partner to address the company’s ambitious growth plan,” CAF said. Poland’s government, which is run by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, says that the European Union’s largest former communist country is too dependant on foreign investors, who bought into Polish assets in the 1990s and 2000s. However, PFR head Pawel Borys said that the aim of the deal was to achieve the government’s strategy of cutting CO2 emissions in Poland, which is to host the COP24 meeting in December aimed at ensuring full implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement. “Poland wants to introduce in its cities a low-emission transport, so we wanted to have a say in the strategy of the firm, that is the biggest producer of such vehicles in Poland,” Borys told Reuters on the sidelines of an economic forum. Coal-reliant Poland is also struggling to improve air quality in its cities.  The European Union’s top court said in February that Poland had failed to uphold air quality standards, part of a wider EU battle to reduce deaths from airborne pollution which it estimates kills 400,000 people every year.

The pioneering liquefied natural gas project in Equatorial Guinea, bogged down by delayed financing, ran into further trouble in May when U.S. oil services company Schlumberger (SLB.N) pulled out of the venture. “We are continuing to pursue debt financing with Chinese banks and that’s with a view to reaching FID (final investment decision) by the end of 2018,” Oliver Quinn, director of exploration in Africa told Reuters.

Poland’s biggest oil refiner PKN Orlen said in February it planned to buy at least a 53 percent stake in Lotos, mostly from the state. London-based oil and gas group BP has not filed any official complaint with Polish or European Union authorities but will consider its options in the future, a company spokeswoman said. “If this merger were to go ahead, 95 percent of the (country’s supply and infrastructure) market would be controlled by two companies,” the BP statement said.  “We believe that a competitive market is in the best interest of Polish consumers and that this merger could restrict that competition unless there is a guaranteed competitive cost of supply and infrastructure access.” In the first half of 2018, PKN Orlen owned 1,771 petrol stations in Poland, BP had 537 stations and Lotos 484, according to data from POPiHN, a Polish organisation that provides research into local fuel market. “We are in a dialogue with the European Commission.

Investor sentiment was gloomy across emerging markets, with the MSCI emerging market index down 1.3 percent as a result of worries about a potential escalation in the U.S.-China trade conflict and the health of emerging markets such as Turkey and Argentina. Saudi Arabia’s stock index dropped 3.9 percent in late trade, falling below its 200-day average for the first time this year. The index closed 3.1 percent down. “With foreigners selling off on the back of the emerging markets worries, margin calls were triggered in Saudi,” said Marie Salem, director of capital markets at FFA Dubai. Blue chip names which have surged in recent months on expectations of foreign fund inflows were hard hit, with Saudi Basic Industries Corp closing 4.4 percent and Al Rajhi Bank falling 3.0 percent. The latest monthly Reuters poll of Middle East fund managers at the end of last month found many were becoming much less positive on Saudi Arabia because of rich valuations and broader emerging market concerns. Investors also fretted about a retreat in oil prices, with Brent crude, the global benchmark, falling 0.98 percent to $77.44 a barrel by 1252 GMT. Egypt’s main index slipped 1.1 percent, with real estate investment firm Talaat Mostafa Group Holding Co declining 2.3 percent. First Abu Dhabi Bank, the largest bank in the United Arab Emirates, acted as the biggest weight on Abu Dhabi’s index, dropping 2.8 percent. Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank dropped 4.6 percent. It said on Monday it was in early merger talks with Union National Bank and separately with unlisted Al Hilal Bank. UNB added to double-digit gains on Tuesday to rise a further 11.7 percent, reflecting analysts’ expectations that it will gain the most from a potential merger.

2018-09-05,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Mexico’s next government plans to build what could be the country’s largest oil refinery, with construction set to begin as soon as next year, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. The winner of July’s presidential election is seeking to end Mexico’s massive fuel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, while boosting domestic refining during the first half of his six-year term. While his aides have provided some details on the plans, Lopez Obrador himself has mostly spoken in general terms and had not previously provided numbers. “It will be a refinery that will produce 400,000 barrels per day of gasoline with an approximate cost of $8 billion that we want to build in three years,” Lopez Obrador told a group of business leaders in the northern city of Monterrey, in broadcast comments. Mexico’s largest refinery at present is the 330,000-barrel-per-day Salina Cruz, owned and operated by state-run oil company Pemex in the southern state of Oaxaca. It was not clear if Lopez Obrador was referring to the planned refinery’s crude processing capacity or its gasoline production. Two aides did not respond to requests for comment. Salina Cruz, like Pemex’s other five refineries, has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems, as well as Pemex’s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically. Mexico’s refining network can process up to 1.6 million bpd of crude. It has been working this year at around 40 percent. Rocio Nahle, Lopez Obrador’s pick to be the next energy minister, told Reuters in February that the next government wanted to add crude processing capacity of between 300,000 and 600,000 bpd. Lopez Obrador has previously said the new refinery will be built in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, along Mexico’s southern Gulf coast. “The commitment is to produce gasoline in Mexico,” Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. “We want to produce gasoline because we have the raw material, we have crude oil.” He added the project launch will happen “in the first days” of his government. He takes office in December. Mexico produces about 1.84 million bpd of crude, more than 60 percent of which is exported, while it imports over 1 million bpd of refined products, including gasoline and diesel, according to U.S. and Mexican government data. In July, Pemex’s six domestic refineries produced about 213,000 bpd of gasoline.

2018-09-05,"BEIJING/HONGKONG (Reuters) - A unit of China’s state defense giant Norinco and privately held Hengli Group are in discussions with the creditors of CEFC China Energy about taking over a stake in oilfields in Middle Eastern producer Abu Dhabi, sources with knowledge of the talks said.  CEFC’s creditors have over the past months been conducting sales of the debt-laden conglomerate’s global assets, including stakes in oil and gas fields in Abu Dhabi and Chad, and properties in Europe and Shanghai.  Zhenhua Oil, Norinco’s subsidiary in charge of oil and gas exploration, production and international trading, has been looking to expand its reserve base, with activities so far focused on Iraq.  Hengli Group, parent of Hengli Petrochemical, started looking at the stake in the oilfields “recently” after being approached by the China Development Bank, which is leading a team of creditors to repay CEFC’s heavy debts after the arrest of chairman Ye Jiemin in early 2018.  It’s not clear if state investment company CITIC Group remains interested in the stake. Reuters reported in April CITIC was then doing due diligence on the asset.  CEFC in February 2017 won a 4 percent stake in giant onshore oilfields majority-owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co [ADNOC.UL] for $900 million.  “(Hengli) is very cautious about venturing into a totally unfamiliar business, especially before the start-up of the (Dalian) petrochemical project,” said an executive with knowledge of the discussions.  A rush into a new business could worry capital markets already concerned about Hengli’s high spending on its petrochemical investment, the executive said.  Hengli’s listed entity Hengli Petrochemicals is slated to run tests on a new $11 billion refining and petrochemical complex in Dalian in October, one of China’s largest investments by a private firm in the sector.  The polyester group, started up by Jiangsu province entrepreneur Chen Jianhua, has no experience in oil and gas exploration.  The Abu Dhabi oilfields produce about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and CEFC’s share gives it the right to market about 2 million barrels a month of Murban crude, which is highly sought by Asian oil refiners.  Hengli and Zhenhua Oil declined to comment. CEFC and CITIC did not immediately respond to email requests for comment.

2018-09-05,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 1 pct, hits 2-week low * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open mixed * Dollar supported amid trade woes, emerging market weakness * Immediate focus on US-Canada trade talks resuming Wednesday * Crude prices slip as tropical storm concerns ebb a bit By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Stock markets fell in Asia on Wednesday and the safe-haven dollar hovered near a two-week high as heightened worries over international trade conflicts and emerging market weakness curbed investors’ appetite for riskier assets. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open mixed, with Britain’s FTSE slipping 0.25 percent, Germany’s DAX starting flat and France’s CAC edging up 0.1 percent. U.S. futures were little changed. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 1 percent, hitting a two-week trough. Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.25 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.9 percent, weighed down by expectations the United States will impose more tariffs on Chinese goods this month, adding to pressure on China’s cooling economy. Indonesian stocks slumped more than 3 percent as the rupiah currency wobbled around its lowest levels since the Asian financial crisis in 1998. The central bank said it had “decisively intervened” in FX and bond markets in morning trade. Australian shares lost 0.9 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dipped 0.2 percent. Sentiment in Asia was already weak after U.S. stocks slipped overnight, with a drop in heavyweights Facebook and Nike adding to worries over trade negotiations between the United States and other major economies. “The U.S.-Canada talks are due to resume today and this keeps trade issues at the forefront, with a wait-and-see mood prevailing in the equity markets,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Discussions between the United States and Canada were expected to resume on Wednesday after the last round ended on Friday with no deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), cooling investor confidence. Ottawa is not expected to back down on key issues despite threats from U.S. President Donald Trump to retaliate against the Canadian economy. “Then there is the U.S.-China trade issue, in addition to turbulence in the emerging market currencies that the markets have to worry about,” Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said. Keeping investors nervous is the threat of fresh U.S tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could take effect after a public comment period ends on Thursday. Wobbly emerging markets stocks and currencies, a key source of recent global market angst, faced their latest round of pressure with news that South Africa had slipped into recession and concerns brewing about inflation in Turkey. Argentina’s peso finished the day down over 2 percent on Tuesday. The peso fell even though U.S. President Trump voiced support for Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his efforts to win IMF financing in the wake of a deepening economic crisis. Argentine Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne met International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde in Washington on Tuesday and both said they were working to improve a $50 billion standby finance deal agreed with the IMF in June. “If a larger credit line from the IMF is not forthcoming, then in an environment of rising dollar and U.S. interest rates it is hard to see where the relief will come from for the Argentine peso -and indeed other emerging market currencies with twin deficits and high levels of USD-denominated debt,” wrote currency strategists at Rabobank. With investors avoiding emerging market currencies, the dollar was supported thanks to its safe-haven appeal. The greenback extended its overnight rise against the yen to touch a near one-week high of 111.71 yen. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was a touch lower at 95.359 but in close reach of a two-week high of 95.737 set on Tuesday. The euro inched up 0.1 percent to $1.1594 following a loss of 0.35 percent on Tuesday. The dollar had also drawn strength on Tuesday from upbeat U.S. indicators supporting the case for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to more than a 14-year high in August, boosted by a surge in new orders. The Australian dollar was up 0.2 percent at $0.7190 following stronger-than-expected domestic second quarter GDP data. The Aussie managed to pull away from $0.7157, its lowest since May 2016 plumbed on Tuesday. China’s yuan was a shade firmer in onshore trading at 6.8365 per dollar after losing 0.25 percent the previous day. Crude oil prices fell, weighed by a stronger dollar which tends to burden non-U.S. buyers of dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down 0.5 percent at $77.80 per barrel after brushing a three-month peak of $79.72 on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures slipped 0.75 percent to $69.36 per barrel. Oil prices partly reversed a strong jump from the previous day, as the impact of a tropical storm on U.S. Gulf coast production was not as strong as initially expected. Prices jumped the previous day as dozens of U.S. oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in anticipation of tropical storm Gordon hitting the region. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-09-05,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Gordon made landfall on Tuesday just west of the Alabama-Mississippi border, lashing the U.S. Gulf Coast with high winds and heavy rain, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.  Gordon was about 35 miles (55 km) south-southwest of Mobile, Alabama and was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 miles per hour (110 km/h) after making landfall, the Miami-based weather forecaster said. “Rapid weakening is forecast after Gordon moves inland, and is forecast to become a tropical depression on Wednesday,” the NHC added. As of Tuesday night, the storm had not reached 74 mph winds, the minimum to become a hurricane.  Hurricane and storm surge warnings and watches were in effect across the region, the NHC said.    Though the Louisiana coast remained calm as of early Tuesday evening, Governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency and companies cut 9 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil and gas production. “I’m asking all residents to do their part in getting ready for this storm,” New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said in a statement. “The city’s absolute No.1 priority is to ensure the safety of our residents.” Tropical-storm force winds were already lashing the Alabama and western Florida panhandle coastlines and some areas still recovering from last year’s storms could see 12 inches (30 cm) of rain. Beaches around Mobile, Alabama were washed by storm-driven waves, said Stephen Miller, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.  “We’re expecting an increase in winds,” Miller said in a telephone interview. “We could see flooding.” Sea levels could rise as much as 5 feet (1.5 m) from Shell Beach, Louisiana, to Dauphin Island, Alabama, forecasters said.  The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency told South Mississippi residents to be prepared to evacuate.  At LaFrance Marina near Ansley, Mississippi, a mile north of Heron Bay on the Gulf of Mexico, marina owner Sue Cates said that a tidal surge is sure to push water into the marina’s low-lying campgrounds, making evacuation “the only choice” people have to protect themselves.  Nevertheless, she said she and her husband will remain in their home, which sits on tall pilings, 24 feet above ground. Built after Hurricane Katrina, the home is made to withstand a 150 mile-an-hour wind, she said. “We’re way up here, and I think we’ll be OK,” Cates said. “People around here are well-trained for this sort of thing.” U.S. oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp evacuated workers and shut production at two offshore oil platforms on Monday, and other companies with production and refining operations along the Gulf Coast said they were securing facilities.  The Gulf of Mexico is home to 17 percent of U.S. crude oil and 5 percent of natural gas output daily, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The U.S. Coast Guard said the ports of New Orleans and   Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi, may have to close within 48 hours.     Last year, hurricanes hit Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, causing widespread destruction and thousands of deaths. The Inn at Ocean Springs and the Roost Hotel in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, had guests planning to ride out the storm, said Kristin Smith, general manager of both hotels.  “A lot of guests are real comfortable sticking it out in our rooms,” Smith said in a telephone interview. “Any of our guests who feel like they want to go home we encourage them to follow their instincts.” Reporting by Kathy Finn in NEW ORLEANS; Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus in NEW YORK, Brendan O'Brien in MILWAUKEE, Scott Malone in BOSTON and Dan Whitcomb in LOS ANGELES; Editing by Toni Reinhold, Lisa Shumaker and Darren Schuettler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/storm-gordon/update-7-tropical-storm-gordon-makes-landfall-near-alabama-mississippi-border-idUKL2N1VQ07I,05 Sep 2018,"Tropical Storm Gordon made

2018-09-05,"* JV partners to combine reception at APPEC this month * Part of better integration between both companies -sources * Total, Nigeria to launch new crude during APPEC By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s state-owned oil giant Aramco is teaming up with South Korean refiner S-Oil Corp for a joint reception at this year’s Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore, according to two industry sources. “Having two separate receptions is quite redundant, and considering that most of the guests overlap it makes more sense to co-host the party,” said one source with direct knowledge of the matter who declined to be named. Aramco became the single largest shareholder of S-Oil in January 2015, part of its drive to expand its footprint in the downstream petroleum sector and establish commercial offices in global oil trading hubs like Singapore. Neither company responded to requests for comment. Last year, S-Oil and Aramco hosted separate APPEC events. This year’s joint reception will be held at the Ritz Carlton hotel on Sept. 25, the second day of the conference. Aramco traditionally sells most its crude oil under long-term deals with fixed monthly volumes and prices, but the company is in a drive to become more commercially minded, and plans to gradually increase the amount of crude and refined products it freely trades. (Link: reut.rs/2PxeyoQ) Aramco’s trading office in Singapore, which opened in 2015 but only stepped up hiring in 2017, is its first overseas trading operation. The Singapore office’s responsibility includes handling physical and derivatives oil trading for its joint venture operations in Asia, which include S-Oil and also Japan’s Showa Shell, said a second source. S-Oil is South Korea’s third-biggest refiner, selling fuels like gasoline, diesel or jet fuel globally. Its main supplier of feedstock crude oil is Saudi Aramco. Singapore’s APPEC, which this year takes place from Sept. 24-26, is one of Asia’s biggest annual petroleum industry gatherings, during which producers, refiners and merchants sign and renew supply deals and exchange information. In one such event, APPEC will also host a reception by French oil major Total, Nigerian National Petroleum Corp and their project partners to launch Egina crude, according to a copy of an invitation seen by Reuters. The Egina field in Nigeria is expected to start production in December.

2018-09-05,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia wants oil to stay between $70 and $80 a barrel for now as the world’s biggest crude exporter strikes a balance between maximising revenue and keeping a lid on prices until U.S. congressional elections, OPEC and industry sources said. After announcing the flotation of Saudi Aramco in 2016, the kingdom began pushing for higher crude prices partly to help maximise the valuation of the state oil company ahead of an initial public offering (IPO), originally scheduled for 2018. That changed in April when U.S. President Donald Trump put public pressure on Riyadh to keep crude prices in check, wanting to stop U.S. fuel costs rising ahead of the U.S. midterm elections in November. Now, even though the IPO has been shelved, Saudi Arabia  still wants to keep oil prices as high as possible without offending Washington, the sources said. Saudi needs cash to finance a series of economic development projects. OPEC and Saudi Arabia do not have an official price target and are unlikely to adopt one formally.  “The Saudis need oil at about $80 and they don’t want prices to go below $70. They want to manage the market like this,” one of the sources told Reuters.  “They need cash. They have plans and reforms and now the IPO is delayed. But they don’t want anyone else talking about oil prices now. It’s all because of Trump,” the source said. An informal target of $70 to $80 raises the prospect of Saudi Arabia making regular tweaks to its output to influence the cost of crude as the market responds to other factors affecting global supply and demand. One industry source said it may have done precisely that last week. With Brent heading towards $80 a barrel, Saudi Arabia told the market about an increase in its production last month sooner than it would have usually released such information, the source, who follows Saudi output policy, said. “The Saudis will probably put a few more dampening signals out, given where prices have gone,” the industry source said.  OPEC U-TURN The aspiration for $70 to $80 is similar to that of other producers within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. Algeria, for example, says it sees $75 as fair.    “Everybody has been talking about these kinds of numbers,” said an OPEC delegate from outside the Gulf. Brent crude LCOc1 has fluctuated between $70 and $80 since April 10. After hitting $70.30 on Aug. 15 the oil price has climbed steadily to touch $79.72 on Tuesday.  Earlier this year, Riyadh hoped to see oil prices above $80 and was ready to continue with a supply cut pact until the end of 2018, only to make a U-turn after Trump called on OPEC in April to boost supplies. Riyadh has long been a close Washington ally. But ever since Trump became president in 2017, Saudi Arabia has become even more sensitive to U.S. requests and both countries have coordinated policy more closely than under Trump’s predecessor.  In June, for example, OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies last month to raise output from July - with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost. Saudi industry sources briefed the market about record oil production in which Aramco was planning to pump 10.6-10.8 million barrels per day (bpd) in June and as much as 11 million bpd in July, the highest in its history. In the end, Saudi Arabia’s production in June was 10.488 million bpd and in July it fell to 10.29 million. The plan to boost output to record highs had been driven mainly by worries of a sudden supply shock after U.S. officials said Washington aimed to reduce Iran’s oil revenue to zero, the sources said. But since then, Washington has said it would consider waivers on Iranian sanctions and worries about a trade war between Washington and Beijing have threatened to hit future demand for oil, the sources said. One industry source said the kingdom’s crude production plans were made according to its customers’ needs and that oil demand has not materialised as forecast. “We can raise production as high as 11 (mln bpd) or even 12 but then where will it go? We can’t push oil to the market,” that industry source said. In an August report, the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said Saudi Arabia was trying to manage the Brent price within a very narrow range of $70 to $80 - and it was not an easy task. It said the strategy was mainly to put a ceiling on crude amid concerns about the impact of high prices on demand as the trade war between Washington and Beijing escalates - and to keep a floor under prices to maintain revenues and market stability. This echoes Saudi price aspirations from a decade ago, when the kingdom identified $75 as a fair price. This held for a few years, only to be dropped as prices moved much higher. “Striking a balance between the various objectives, and doing it within a narrow price range, is an extremely difficult task given the wide uncertainties and the different shocks hitting the oil market,” the Oxford Institute’s note said. “Saudi Arabia is in need of flexibility in its output policy.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-saudi/saudi-arabia-aims-to-keep-crude-in-70-to-80-band-sources-idUKL8N1VQ1YB,05 Sep 2018,"Saudi Arabia wants oil to

2018-09-05,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index down 0.5 pct, Nikkei sheds 0.35 pct * Dollar supported amid trade woes, emerging market weakness * Immediate focus on US-Canada trade talks resuming Wednesday * Crude prices slip as tropical storm concerns ebb a bit By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - Stock markets in Asia tracked their global peers lower while the safe-haven dollar hovered near a two-week high on Wednesday as heightened worries over international trade conflicts curbed investor appetite for riskier assets. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.5 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.4 percent. Australian stocks lost 0.75 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI dropped 0.1 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.35 percent. U.S. stocks had slipped on Tuesday as a drop in heavyweights Facebook and Nike added to worries over trade negotiations between the United States and other major economies. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed about 0.5 percent the previous day. “The U.S.-Canada talks are due to resume today and this keeps trade issues at the forefront, with a wait-and-see mood prevailing in the equity markets,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Discussions between the United States and Canada were expected to resume on Wednesday after the last round ended on Friday with no deal to revamp the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), cooling investor confidence. “Then there is the U.S.-China trade issue, in addition to turbulence in the emerging market currencies that the markets have to worry about,” Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said. Keeping investors nervous is the threat of fresh U.S tariffs on another $200 billion worth of Chinese goods that could take effect after a public comment period ends on Thursday. Emerging markets stocks and currencies faced their latest round of pressure with news that South Africa had slipped into recession and concerns brewing about inflation in Turkey. Argentina’s peso finished the day down over 2 percent on Tuesday. The peso fell although U.S. President Donald Trump voiced support for Argentine President Mauricio Macri and his efforts to win IMF financing in the wake of a deepening economic crisis. Argentine Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne met International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Christine Lagarde in Washington on Tuesday and both said they were working together to improve a $50 billion standby finance deal agreed with the IMF’s executive board in June. “If a larger credit line from the IMF is not forthcoming, then in an environment of rising dollar and U.S. interest rates it is hard to see where the relief will come from for the Argentine peso -and indeed other emerging market currencies with twin deficits and high levels of USD-denominated debt,” wrote currency strategists at Rabobank. With investors avoiding emerging market currencies, the dollar was supported thanks to its safe-haven appeal. The greenback extended its overnight rise against the yen to touch a near one-week high of 111.71 yen. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six currencies, was a touch lower at 95.360 but in close reach of a two-week high of 95.737 set on Tuesday. The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.1599 following a loss of 0.35 percent on Tuesday. The dollar had also drawn strength on Tuesday from upbeat U.S. indicators supporting the case for further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Data on Tuesday showed U.S. manufacturing activity accelerated to more than a 14-year high in August, boosted by a surge in new orders. The Australian dollar was up 0.4 percent at $0.7204 following stronger-than-expected domestic second quarter GDP data. The Aussie managed to pull away from $0.7157, its lowest since May 2016 plumbed on Tuesday. China’s yuan was a shade firmer in onshore trading at 6.8469 per dollar after losing 0.25 percent the previous day. Crude oil prices dipped, weighed by a stronger dollar which tends to burden non-U.S. buyers of dollar-denominated commodities. Brent crude futures were down 0.2 percent at $78.03 per barrel after brushing a three-month peak of $79.72 on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures were down 0.6 percent at $69.46 per barrel. Oil prices partly reversed a strong jump from the previous day, as the impact of a tropical storm on U.S. Gulf coast production was not as strong as initially expected. Prices jumped the previous day as dozens of U.S. oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in anticipation of tropical storm Gordon hitting the region. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-09-05,"TOKYO, Sept 5 (Reuters) - A powerful typhoon killed at least nine people in western Japan and an airport company started to transfer some 3,000 stranded passengers by boats, public broadcaster NHK said on Wednesday, and more than a million homes were without power. Jebi, or “swallow” in Korean, was briefly a super typhoon and is the most powerful storm to hit Japan in 25 years. It follows heavy rains, landslides, floods and record-breaking heat that killed hundreds of people this summer. About 3,000 tourists stayed overnight at Kansai airport in the heavily populated south-central area of Japan’s main island, Honshu.

Airport officials began transferring the stranded passengers to nearby Kobe airport by high-speed boats on Wednesday morning, according to NHK. It could take several days to a week to reopen Kansai airport depending on the damage, the Yomiuri newspaper quoted an unidentified person in the airline industry as saying. More one million households were without power in Osaka and its surrounding areas at 7:30 a.m. on Wednesday (2230 GMT Tuesday) and a number of flights and some trains were cancelled, according to the trade ministry and public broadcaster NHK. Japan’s JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp shut at least one of the refining units at its 135,000 barrels-per-day Sakai refinery in Osaka in western Japan due to typhoon damage to a part of the cooling tower, the trade ministry said.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.34 per barrel at 0036 GMT, down 53 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures fell 34 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $77.83 a barrel. Prices jumped the previous day as dozens of U.S. oil and gas platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were shut in anticipation of tropical storm Gordon hitting the region. But the storm was shifting eastward late on Tuesday, reducing its threat to producers on the western side of the Gulf and most Gulf Coast refineries. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA, said many crude futures traders were “caught long and wrong over the past 24 hours due to tropical storm buying frenzy”, adding that “prices pulled back considerably as the magnitude of the storm suggests production losses will be limited.” There was also a typhoon hitting Japan’s east coast overnight, with some damage to oil refineries in the Osaka region, although operator JXTG said its operations were not significantly affected. Innes said the price outlook for crude was still bullish, in large part because of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector from November. “With the anticipation of up to 1.5 million barrels per day affected by the U.S. sanctions on Iran, one would expect prices to move higher in the weeks ahead.” Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-drop-as-storm-threat-eases-on-u-s-gulf-coast-idUKL3N1VR06W,05 Sep 2018,"* Tropical storm Gordon's impact weaker than expected, turns

2018-09-05,"MEXICO CITY, Sept 4 (Reuters) - Mexico’s next government plans to build what could be the country’s largest oil refinery, with construction set to begin as soon as next year, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. The winner of July’s presidential election is seeking to end Mexico’s massive fuel imports, nearly all of which come from the United States, while boosting domestic refining during the first half of his six-year term. While his aides have provided some details on the plans, Lopez Obrador himself has mostly spoken in general terms and had not previously provided numbers. “It will be a refinery that will produce 400,000 barrels per day of gasoline with an approximate cost of $8 billion that we want to build in three years,” Lopez Obrador told a group of business leaders in the northern city of Monterrey, in broadcast comments. Mexico’s largest refinery at present is the 330,000-barrel-per-day Salina Cruz, owned and operated by state-run oil company Pemex in the southern state of Oaxaca. It was not clear if Lopez Obrador was referring to the planned refinery’s crude processing capacity or its gasoline production. Two aides did not respond to requests for comment. Salina Cruz, like Pemex’s other five refineries, has recently been producing far below capacity due to accidents and operational problems, as well as Pemex’s focus on maximizing the value of its oil even if that means refining less domestically. Mexico’s refining network can process up to 1.6 million bpd of crude. It has been working this year at around 40 percent. Rocio Nahle, Lopez Obrador’s pick to be the next energy minister, told Reuters in February that the next government wanted to add crude processing capacity of between 300,000 and 600,000 bpd. Lopez Obrador has previously said the new refinery will be built in Dos Bocas, Tabasco, along Mexico’s southern Gulf coast. “The commitment is to produce gasoline in Mexico,” Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday. “We want to produce gasoline because we have the raw material, we have crude oil.” He added the project launch will happen “in the first days” of his government. He takes office in December. Mexico produces about 1.84 million bpd of crude, more than 60 percent of which is exported, while it imports over 1 million bpd of refined products, including gasoline and diesel, according to U.S. and Mexican government data. In July, Pemex’s six domestic refineries produced about 213,000 bpd of gasoline.
