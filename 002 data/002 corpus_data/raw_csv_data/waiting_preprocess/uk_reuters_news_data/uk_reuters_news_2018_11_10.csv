2018-11-10,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China National Aviation Fuel Group on Saturday launched the country’s first aviation fuel consumption index aimed at providing a fresh gauge for the regional and national economic health of the world’s second-largest economy. After stellar growth for decades, China, the world’s second largest consumer after the United States, is seeing its aviation fuel demand growth slipping in the last few years as the economy expands less rapidly and more people travel by high speed rail.  “The aviation fuel index will become a good reflection of the consumption trend and a precursor of major events like an economic crisis,” CNAF, the country’s near monopoly distributor of jet fuel, said in a release. China is estimated to consume a total of 35 million tonnes of jet fuel this year, Gong Feng, vice president of CNAF, told a seminar.  That’s about 7 percent higher than last year, but down from 9 percent growth the previous year, said a second company executive who declined to be named as not authorized to speak to media.  Wu Xiaohua, deputy director at the Chinese Academy of Macroeconomic Research, told the same seminar that China’s jet fuel expanded 5.8 percent in September from a year earlier, recording a year-on-year decline in growth for seven months in a row.  At 5.8 percent, it represents the slowest growth since January 2015, Wu said.  Passenger travel makes up 97 percent of China’s total jet fuel consumption, which makes up some 13 percent of the global market, CNAF executives said.  The new index, based on data CNAF accumulated over the years, covers 30 Chinese provinces and regions and more than 200 civil airports. It will be regularly published via the CNAF’s website.  Over the next decade, China’s aviation fuel demand is forecast to expand 5-7 percent per annum with consumption reaching 57 million to 68.8 million tonnes by 2028, CNAF’s vice president Gong said.

Talal al-Khaled al-Sabah, an oil sector spokesman, said in a company tweet that “the state of emergency was lifted at Kuwait Oil Company and all affiliated companies but emergency rooms will be activated to handle the bad weather conditions.” In a statement, the Interior Ministry dismissed rumours on social media of multiple deaths, noting that “only one case of death was reported.” The army and national guard were mobilised to help clear water from critical facilities and roads. Minister of Public Works Hussam Al-Roumi submitted his resignation to the prime minister in response to the flooding crisis on Friday.  Parliamentary speaker Marzouq al-Ghanim said a meeting would be held on Sunday to discuss the impact of the flooding, KUNA reported.

2018-11-10,"(Repeating Nov. 9 story with no changes) By Andrew Chung Nov 9 (Reuters) - A liberal-leaning California-based federal appeals court that has often ruled against President Donald Trump dealt him another setback this week in a major immigration case and soon could be asked to weigh in on a pipeline project he has championed. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, has been a thorn in Trump’s side since he took office last year and has drawn the Republican president’s ire for its decisions in high-profile cases. His latest setback before the 9th Circuit came on Thursday when a three-judge panel rejected his bid to rescind a program launched by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants brought into the country as children. The 9th Circuit has handed him defeats on his travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries and his bid to withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that limit cooperation on immigration enforcement. It also is set to rule on the administration’s appeal of a judge’s order blocking Trump’s move to put restrictions on transgender people serving in the U.S. military. The 9th Circuit would hear any appeal by Trump’s administration of the ruling late on Thursday by a federal judge in Montana blocking construction for environmental reasons of the Keystone XL pipeline project that is designed to carry heavy crude oil from Canada to the United States. The Justice Department said on Friday it is reviewing the Keystone XL ruling to decide its next step. TransCanada Corp said it remains committed to building the $8 billion, 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline. “The 9th Circuit is an easy punching bag for Trump because not only has it been traditionally liberal but California is its beating heart, and we all know how Trump fares in California,” said Barry McDonald, a law professor at Pepperdine University in Malibu. “He probably sees much of the West Coast as a nemesis for him.” California, the most populous U.S. state, is a liberal bastion that is unfriendly political territory for Trump. The president regularly belittles the 9th Circuit, as he did on Friday after the court’s ruling preserving the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. “The DACA will now hopefully go to the Supreme Court where it will be given a fair decision,” Trump told reporters. Trump already has appointed two justices to the nine-member Supreme Court, solidifying its 5-4 conservative majority. The 9th circuit has 16 judges who were appointed by Democratic presidents and seven who were named by Republican presidents. Democratic presidents tend to appoint more liberal jurists while Republican presidents favor more conservatives judges. It is one of the series of powerful regional federal appeals courts that are one step below the Supreme Court. These circuit courts often provide the last word in a legal dispute because the Supreme Court hears only a limited number of cases. The 9th Circuit hears appeals in federal cases spanning a huge region in terms of both geography and population, covering the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Trump already has named two judges to the 9th Circuit, with six other vacancies waiting to be filled. Trump will not be able to create a conservative majority on the 9th Circuit, however, without additional vacancies caused when actively presiding judges retire. Aided by fellow Republicans in the U.S. Senate, Trump has made it a top priority to rapidly appoint judges in a bid to make the federal judiciary more conservative. Trump has suggested his policies do not get a fair shake in the 9th Circuit and has touted the idea of breaking up that court. Trump last year decried the 9th Circuit’s “ridiculous” ruling on the travel ban, and said that court has “a terrible record of being overturned” by the Supreme Court - an often-made charge that the 9th Circuit’s chief judge took issue with in congressional testimony.

2018-11-10,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday that U.S. sanctions announced last week have had no effect on Iran’s economy because Washington had already practically reimposed them earlier. The restoration of sanctions is part of a wider effort by U.S. President Donald Trump to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its support for proxy forces in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East. “The sanctions have had no impact on our economy because America had already used all the weapons at its disposal and there was nothing new to use against us,” Rouhani said in remarks carried live on state television. “They just issued a long list of banks, their branches ... and airlines and their planes. And this shows that they are merely trying to affect the Iranian nation psychologically,” Rouhani said. The United States said it would temporarily allow eight importers to keep buying Iranian oil when it reimposed sanctions last Monday aimed at forcing Tehran to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities. “It has now become clear that America cannot cut Iran’s oil exports to zero,” Rouhani added, speaking after a weekly meeting with the heads of the parliament and the judiciary. In May, Trump exited Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and Washington reimposed a first round of sanctions on Iran in August.

2018-11-10,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from Iran for a period of 45 days, the United States has said, several days after reimposing sanctions on Tehran’s oil sector. “The United States has given Iraq a temporary relief from the sanctions for 45 days to continue purchasing natural gas and electricity from Iran,” the U.S. Embassy in Iraq said in a video published on its official Facebook page on Thursday. “This relief gives Iraq time to start taking steps towards energy independence,” the video said. Iraq central bank officials said in August that the country’s economy is so closely linked to Iran that Baghdad would ask Washington for exemptions from some of the sanctions. The current temporary waiver is conditional on Iraq not paying Iran for imports in U.S. dollars.  Sanctions, which had been lifted under a 2015 nuclear deal negotiated by President Barack Obama’s administration and five other world powers, were reimposed on Nov 5.  They cover 50 Iranian banks and subsidiaries and more than 200 persons and vessels in its shipping sector, as well as targeting Tehran’s national airline, Iran Air, and more than 65 of its aircraft.
