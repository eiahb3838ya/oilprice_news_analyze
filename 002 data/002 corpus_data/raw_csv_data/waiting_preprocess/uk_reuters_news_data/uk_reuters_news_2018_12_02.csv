Trade-exposed currencies led the early gains, with the Australian dollar notching a four-month peak, while the dollar slipped against the yuan. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 climbed 1.8 percent, while the Sydney market added 1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.27 percent though most bourses had yet to start. Nikkei futures pointed to opening gains of around 1.2 percent. “Markets are opening with a knee-jerk boost to risk appetite but time will tell how enduring the optimism proves to be,” said ANZ economist Jo Masters. “There are already very different official takes on what was achieved at the meeting.” “But for now, both sides can claim a win,” she added. “Perhaps not insignificantly, it provides a window to export the soybean crop from key Republican states, at least.” China and the United States agreed to halt additional tariffs in a deal that keeps their trade war from escalating as the two sides try again to bridge their differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. The White House said on Saturday that President Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping during high-stakes talks in Argentina that he would not boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Jan. 1 as previously announced. “Deeply contentious thornier structural issues such as forced technology transfer remain unresolved,” cautioned Westpac FX analyst Robert Rennie. “This US-China agreement is thus better characterised as a “mini-breakthrough” that puts a momentary pause on trade tensions rather than a comprehensive policy deal.” Investors chose to see the glass as half full and lifted the Aussie dollar 0.6 percent to $0.7355. It firmed 0.8 percent on the safe-haven yen to 83.70. The U.S. dollar eased on a basket of currencies to 97.136 , but also firmed on the yen to 113.79. The euro added 0.1 percent to $1.1330. The dollar had come under pressure last week when comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes. Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee. But the hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday at the age of 94. Treasuries rallied hard late on Friday to leave 10-year yields down at 2.99 percent. The progress on Sino-U.S. trade and an easier dollar could provide some support to commodity prices. Oil suffered its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand. Speculation is high the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia would agree some form of production cut at a meeting in Vienna on Thursday.

2018-12-02,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany must answer urgent, growing political concerns about the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project given Russia’s seizure of three Ukrainian ships and their crew off the coast of Crimea, a senior German conservative said on Sunday. Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, a top candidate to replace Chancellor Angela Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats, told public broadcaster ARD it would be “too radical” to withdraw political support for the project, but Berlin could reduce the amount of gas to flow through the pipeline. Russia is resisting international calls to release three Ukrainian ships seized last weekend in the Kerch Strait near the Crimea region that Moscow illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow has accused the 24 sailors of illegally crossing the Russian border, which Ukraine denies. After meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Merkel on Saturday called on Russia to release the sailors and allow free shipping access to the Sea of Azov, but stopped short of endorsing any additional sanctions against Moscow. Kramp-Karrenbauer is a close Merkel ally but has taken a firmer stance on Russia’s actions in recent days. On Friday, she told Reuters the European Union and the United States should consider banning from their ports Russian ships originating from the Sea of Azov in response to the incident. She told ARD on Sunday that it was time to draw a firmer line against Russian actions, including its annexation of Crimea and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. “We have to acknowledge that the hard point has not been reached, otherwise Putin would not have taken this path,” she said, although she noted that Russia had continued to provide Germany with gas supplies even during the Cold War.  Her suggestion of banning Russian ships from European ports triggered criticism from some Social Democrats, including former foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel, who urged calm and accused Ukraine of trying to drag Germany into a war with Russia. Justice Minister Katarina Barley, appearing on the same ARD programme on Sunday, said the incident still needed to be investigated, and cautioned against too-hasty conclusions. The $11-billion (£8.6 billion) Nord Stream 2 project, led by Russia’s Gazprom, aims to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline from next year, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine. Businessman Friedrich Merz, the other top contender for the CDU leadership role, on Friday said escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine had renewed debate over the pipeline. “The more the conflict escalates, the more it raises the question: Is it really the right thing that we build this pipeline?” he said. The United States, Ukraine and eastern European states oppose the pipeline, arguing that it will harm Ukraine and reduce the transit fees it now earns for piping gas. Washington also argues that the pipeline will leave Germany dependent on Russia for decades to come.

2018-12-02,"BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - A Slovak court ordered 12 Greenpeace activists, who were detained after protesting against a coal mining company, to remain in custody on Sunday until a trial. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, however, said the court’s decision was questionable.  Fifteen activists from the Czech Republic, Belgium and Finland were detained on Wednesday after hanging a banner reading “Stop the age of coal” from a tower at a coal mine that supplies one of Slovakia’s most polluting power plants. No one was harmed during the protest but the mining company, HBP, said 342 miners underground were put in danger as all operations at the premises were halted for several hours.  Three of the activists were released on Wednesday, while the rest were charged with a criminal offence of endangering a strategic utility. The regional court in Prievidza, central Slovakia, did not set a date for a trial. Lawyers for the activists filed an appeal against the decision to keep them in custody, Greenpeace told Reuters.  If the decision is upheld, they could stay in the pre-trial custody for up to 12 months. “The court’s decision is unprecedented. Activists are not criminals, they staged a non-violent protest against a company that has been polluting the region and Slovakia for decades,” Greepeace’s chief in Slovakia, Ivana Kohutkova, said in a statement. Prime Minister Pellegrini said only perpetrators who pose a risk to society should be held in pre-trial custody.      Slovakia’s economy minister announced last month that the state will phase out subsidies for coal mines supplying one of the country’s most polluting power plants from 2023. The government supports privately owned Hornonitrianske Bane Prievidza (HBP), Slovakia’s only coal miner, paying around 100 million euros (£88.8 million) a year, which helps maintain thousands of jobs. The company produced 1.8 million tonnes of brown coal last year, supplying the Novaky power plant in central Slovakia. The facility is operated by Slovenske Elektrarne, a utility co-owned by the state, Italy’s Enel and Czech energy group EPH. Closing the mines has long been contentious as they employ around 4,000 people directly and 11,000 indirectly, although there are potentially opportunities in Slovakia’s booming car industry for retrained workers to secure another job.

Belgian police said some 65,000 people participated in Sunday’s “Claim The Climate” demonstration, many of them on their bikes. Belgium’s liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel called the march “a formidable success” and promised to defend “ambitious targets” at the two week-long U.N. climate change summit which opened on Sunday in the Polish city of Katowice.  Demonstrators marched through the quarter of the Belgian capital that houses the headquarters of the European Union, with banners bearing slogans including “There is no planet B” and “Climate First, Politics Second”.

2018-12-02,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron ordered his prime minister on Sunday to hold talks with political leaders and demonstrators, as he sought a way out of nationwide protests after rioters turned central Paris into a battle zone. Riot police on Saturday were overwhelmed as protesters ran amok in Paris’s wealthiest neighbourhoods, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since 1968. The unrest began as a backlash against fuel tax hikes but has spread. It poses the most formidable challenge yet to Macron’s presidency, with the escalating violence and depth of public anger against his economic reforms catching the 40-year-old leader off-guard and battling to regain control. After a meeting with members of his government on Sunday, the French presidency said in a statement that the president had asked his interior minister to prepare security forces for future protests and his prime minister to hold talks with political party leaders and representatives of the protesters. A French presidential source said Macron would not speak to the nation on Sunday despite calls for him to offer immediate concessions to demonstrators, and said the idea of imposing a state of emergency had not been discussed.   Arriving back from the G20 summit in Argentina, Macron had earlier rushed to the Arc de Triomphe, a revered monument and epicentre of Saturday’s clashes, where protesters had scrawled “Macron resign” and “The yellow vests will triumph”. The “yellow vest” rebellion erupted out of nowhere on Nov. 17, with protesters blocking roads across France and impeding access to some shopping malls, fuel depots and airports. Violent groups from the far right and far left as well as youths from the suburbs infiltrated Saturday’s protests, the authorities said. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux had indicated the Macron administration was considering imposing a state of emergency. The president was open to dialogue, he said, but would not reverse policy reforms. “We won’t change course. We are certain of that,” he told Europe 1 radio. As he spoke, workmen in the upper-crust district of central Paris set about cleaning the defaced Arc, removing charred hulks of cars and replacing the shattered windows of banks, restaurants and glitzy boutiques. While the protests were initially against Macron’s fuel tax hikes - necessary he says to combat climate change - they have also mined a vein of deep dissatisfaction felt towards his liberal  reforms, which many voters feel favour the wealthy and big business. Police said they had arrested more than 400 people in Paris on Saturday and that 133 were injured. Some 10,000 tear gas canisters and stun grenades were fired as well as water canon as security forces fought for control. Macron’s plight illustrates a conundrum: How do political leaders’ introduce policies that will do long-term good for the environment without inflicting extra costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election? His unyielding response has exposed him to charges of being out of touch with common folk outside of France’s big cities who worry about the squeeze on household budgets and job security. The protests have driven Macron’s popularity to record lows and left him facing a lose-lose situation, said Gael Sliman, president of the Odoxa polling institute said. Either Macron caves in to the pressure and is derided by opponents as weak, or he puts down the dissent, Sliman said.   “In the second scenario, Macron will still come out loser, because what everyone will remember is that he wrestled with the popular classes. He would be victorious, but at the cost of having crushed them.” Before heading into Sunday’s meeting, Macron met under heavy security with police and firefighters near the Champs Elysees boulevard. Some bystanders cheered, others jeered and called on him to resign. So too did Jean-Luc Melenchon, head of hard-left party La France Insoumise (France Unbowed) and far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who both demanded the government unwind its fuel tax hikes. They called for parliament to be dissolved and snap elections held. Such an outcome is unlikely, however. Macron has 3 1/2 years left of his five-year mandate and a strong majority in parliament, albeit with signs of simmering unease on the backbenches over his response to the protests.  TV footage showed the interior of the Arc ransacked, a statue of Marianne, symbol of the French republic, smashed, and graffiti scrawled on the exterior ranging from anti-capitalist slogans to social demands and calls for Macron’s resignation. On nearby streets, some Parisians worried of a repeat of the violence next weekend. The yellow vests have already called another demonstration in Paris. “The violence is increasing at an exponential rate,” said Claude, a resident in the affluent 16th district. “The state is losing control, it is scary. They cannot let this happen. Maybe the army should intervene.”  Reporting by John Irish, Richard Lough, Emmanuel Jarry, Sudip Kar-Gupta, Matthias Blamont, Myriam Rivet, Simon Carraud and Luke Baker; Writing by John Irish and Richard Lough; Editing by Mark Heinrich and Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests/update-5-macron-tells-pm-to-hold-talks-after-worst-unrest-in-paris-for-decades-idUKL8N1Y704V,02 Dec 2018,"* Nationwide protests over fuel tax hike, high living costs

2018-12-02,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Delegates from nearly 200 nations on Sunday began two weeks of talks to tackle deep political divisions at the most important U.N. meeting on global warming since the landmark 2015 Paris deal to shift away from fossil fuels. Expectations are low that negotiations in Katowice, at the heart of Poland’s coal region, will fully resolve concerns laid out in reports over recent weeks on the severity of rising greenhouse gas emissions. The political climate has also been transformed since the Paris agreement and the fragile global unity that brought about that accord has shattered. “This is a very, very important conference,” U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa told reporters. “It also takes place in a scenario where we have clear signals about the urgency with which we need to address the issues of climate change.” Four former presidents of U.N. talks, including Laurent Fabius of France, who led negotiations for the Paris agreement, issued a statement urging “decisive action”. “The world is at a crossroads and decisive action in the next two years will be crucial to tackle these urgent threats,” they said in the joint statement. However, political divisions were clear from the outset, with Brazil having withdrawn its offer to host the 2019 talks. The United States, meanwhile, reiterated at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday its decision to withdraw from the Paris accord and a U.S. commitment to all energy sources. YEAR-END DEADLINE The other members of the group of industrialised nations - including the biggest polluter, China - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal, taking into account their national circumstances. The Katowice talks precede an end-of-year deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out the broad details that were agreed in Paris on limiting the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. Delegates said that one of the trickiest issues could be monitoring emissions as the United States, which cannot quit the pact until 2020, uses the talks to press for a level of detail it perceives as useful to its foreign policy dealings.    Poland is hosting U.N. climate negotiations for a third time, but the nation remains hooked on coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal provides about 80 percent of Poland’s power and has been a major source of employment and national pride. The younger generation is less emotionally attached to coal and is increasingly environmentally aware, though any phasing out of the fuel in Poland is likely to be slow. The energy ministry said only last week that Poland plans to invest in new coal capacity while its long-term energy strategy assumes it will still obtain about 60 percent of its power from coal in 2030.

2018-12-02,"BERLIN, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Germany will unveil an initiative at U.N. talks on climate change this week to attract more private investment in projects in Africa and elsewhere, Development Minister Gerd Mueller said. Mueller told the RND newspaper network that Germany would “send a strong signal” at the U.N. climate conference in Katowice, Poland with its Alliance for Development and Climate initiative and a pledge to spend an additional 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) on climate protection. Expectations are muted for this week’s meetings given divisions within Europe, and tension between the United States and China. Delegates from about 195 nations will seek to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the Paris Agreement of 2015, which the United States, at the behest of President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit. Mueller said it was imperative to help countries such as Brazil, India, China and many nations in Africa to develop their ability to provide electricity for their growing populations without relying on coal production. “We can help spark leaps in development,” he said. “We have the technology and the knowledge.” More than 70 companies had already signed up for the new German initiative, he said, which seeks to boost private funds for climate projects in developing countries and emerging economies. “Even without a concrete date for the end of coal production, Germany will send a strong signal in Katowice,” Mueller said. The African population was expected to double to 2.5 billion people by 2050, which would trigger construction of 1,000 more coal-burning power plants, unless countries like Germany helped bolster investment in alternative energy sources, he said. The European Union’s climate chief last week called for the bloc to aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The BDI Federation of German Industry warned Europe against adopting overly ambitious targets, noting that Europe accounted for only 10 percent of global CO2 emissions. Asked about the EU target, BDI President Dieter Kempf told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper, that moving toward net-zero emissions in Europe would require more investment. “A completely, or largely emission-free economy would carry an enormous price,” he said.

More than 400 people were arrested and more than 100 injured, shocking Parisians and tourists alike. At the base of the 19th-century Arc de Triomphe, police kept the public back as cleanup crews set about erasing graffiti, much of it targeting President Emmanuel Macron and some exuding anarchist sentiment such as, “Overthrow the bourgeoisie!” “I’ve worked on monuments around Paris for 20 years and I’ve never seen anything like this at the Arc de Triomphe. It was carnage,” a Paris City Hall official overseeing the cleanup said as his team worked on a graffito reading “Macron resign”. Lasting damage might be caused if crews are forced to erode the arch’s stonework to render it clean, he said. Authorities were caught off-guard by the escalation in violence after two weeks of nationwide unrest against fuel taxes and high living costs, known as the “yellow vest” movement after the fluorescent jackets worn by the protesters. On the Rue Royale in the heart of Paris, half a dozen labourers gingerly replaced glass panes on the front of a Dior store. Next door, a Chanel employee vacuumed shards of glass from the floor, while carpenters removed the plywood panels that had been protecting a Gucci shop. The government said it would consider a state of emergency in the face of unrest across the country. The violence in Paris was the worst in the elegant centre of the capital since the May 1968 student uprising that brought France to its knees. “We’re already afraid of what’s going to happen next week. The violence is escalating at an exponential rate,” said Claude, a well-heeled woman who lives next to the Belle Armee brasserie that was set ablaze. “The state is losing control. They cannot let this happen. Maybe the army should intervene.” Parisians and tourists surveyed the aftermath, capturing the moment on smartphones as the capital digested the chaos that now poses a serious challenge to Macron’s presidency. “Macron has a problem on his hands. Everyone’s fed up. He’s got to listen more,” said Amaya Fuster, eyeing graffiti daubed on a Printemps department store window that read: “There’s enough money in the coffers of businessmen. Share the riches!” Authorities said violent groups from the far right and far left as well as “thugs” from the suburbs had infiltrated the yellow vests movement in Paris on Saturday. There were signs that some of the hardcore troublemakers were part of the anarchist and anti-capitalist movement: banks, insurance companies, upmarket private homes and cafes and glitzy boutiques were among the properties smashed up and looted. The protests are taking a toll on the economy. On Saturday, boulevards that should have been packed with tourists and Christmas shoppers resembled battle zones, as smoke and tear gas hung in the air and debris littered the ground. Hotels and department stores in the capital stand to lose millions. “We thought, ‘Oh, that’s our holiday over’,” said Yao Lei, a Chinese tourist from Shanghai who arrived in Paris at dawn and had received video images of the chaos on his flight. “We’re here to shop but we wondered if we’d have to go straight to Milan instead.” (Reporting by Luke Baker, Matthias Blamont, Sudip Kar-Gupta; Writing by Richard Lough; editing by John Irish)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests-cleanup/stunned-parisians-clean-up-posh-central-district-after-worst-riots-since-1968-idUKL8N1Y70AN,02 Dec 2018,"* Clean-up at Arc de Triomphe may cause lasting damage

2018-12-02,"(Adds detail from Libyan shipping source) BENGHAZI, Libya/LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Four Libyan oil export ports that were closed last week because of bad weather have reopened, a Libyan shipping source and port engineers said on Sunday. Tankers were docking at the eastern Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Brega ports as well as the western Zawiya terminal linked to the El Sharara field, they said. On Friday state oil company NOC said bad weather had forced shutdowns at the Ras Lanuf, Es Sider, Zueitina and Zawiya terminals. Only the western Mellitah port remained closed because of bad weather, the shipping source said. NOC could not be reached for immediate comment. The company had said on Friday that production was down by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), with a a further drop of 50,000 bpd expected because of a lack of storage capacity. Storage tanks at Es Sider are expected to fill within two days. Production from the country’s Sharara oilfield, which exports crude from Zawia, is expected to fall by 150,000 bpd if the bad weather persists, NOC said on Friday. Libyan oil production recently hit a five-year high of about 1.3 million bpd.

2018-12-02,"PARIS (Reuters) - When Emmanuel Macron rose to power, he put the environment at the heart of his agenda. Eighteen months later, anger over those policies has stoked protests that are a huge challenge for the French president.   Rioters torched cars and buildings in central Paris on Saturday following two weeks of protests caused partly by higher fuel taxes which Macron says are needed to fight climate change. Some protesters called for him to resign. Macron’s plight illustrates a conundrum: How do political leaders’ introduce policies that will do long-term good for the environment without inflicting extra costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election?  It is a question facing leaders across the world as delegates hold talks in the Polish city of Katowice this week to try to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the 2015 Paris Agreement on fighting climate change.   “Clearly, countries where inequalities are the highest are the ones where these kinds of push-backs are mostly likely,” Francois Gemenne, a specialist in environmental geopolitics at SciencesPo university in Paris, said of the political risks. Naming Italy, the United States and Britain as countries where environmental moves could risk a voter backlash, he said: “I guess it’s one of the reasons why populist leaders tend to be very skeptical about climate change and environmental measures.” The protests in France have inspired a similar movement in neighboring Belgium, where protesters took to the streets on Friday. There have also been small-scale protests in Canada over Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s plan to impose a federal carbon tax on provinces unwilling to combat climate change. What was once widely seen by governments as a win-win transition to cleaner energies now looks more like causing short-term costs with huge social disruption, followed by possible long-run gains. Another challenge facing leaders is over how they use the proceeds from policies intended to help the environment: Should  money raised from carbon taxes be used directly to combat climate change, or to plug holes in national accounts? Macron said after the latest protests in Paris that he would convene ministers to discuss the crisis on his return from a G20 summit in Argentina. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe canceled plans to go to Katowice for the climate change summit. Macron introduced new carbon taxes to urge motorists to change behavior and protect the environment.  Macron has watered down some of his campaign pledges on the environment since he took office, and his popular environment minister quit in August over the sluggishness of progress. But he has shown little willingness to compromise in the face of the protests. The fuel tax is accompanied by other measures including incentives to encourage people to buy electric vehicles.  Unveiling a medium-term energy plan for France last week, he held out an olive branch by saying he would review fuel prices each quarter, but said the carbon taxes would stay.  His goal is for France to cut carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and boost the use of cleaner energies at the same time. Emissions are currently rising and 75 percent of energy use in France originates from fossil fuels.  “When we talk about the actions of the nation in response to the challenges of climate change, we have to say that we have done little,” he said. Macron has also said he will fight to try to save the Paris climate agreement, which aims to keep global temperature rises to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, a critical threshold.  Scientists are increasingly concerned that countries are falling short on their targets and must be more ambitious. Yet citizens are worried about their immediate lives. In Canada, addressing the question of how governments use the money raised from carbon taxes, Trudeau’s government has promised to return the money collected from the provinces directly to taxpayers.  But in France most of the revenue generated will be used to tackle the national budget deficit, increasing anger at Macron, who left-wing opponents call the “president of the rich”. Of the 34 billion euros ($38.71 billion) the French government will raise on fuel taxes in 2018, a sum of only 7.2 billion euros is earmarked for environmental measures.  Simon Dalby, a specialist in the political economy of climate change at Wilfrid Laurier University in Canada, says carbon taxes should be part of wider measures to alter how people live, including better, greener transport and buildings. “It is all about policies for transition to a post-fossil-fuel world, something that needs to be done quickly if the worst of the predicted climate disruptions are to be avoided in the coming decades,” he said. Gemenne said the protests in France were unlikely to go away soon, and may emerge in other countries as they take more determined action on emissions. The danger, he said, was inaction, or acting too late to prevent global warming. At the same time, politicians need to be able to show they were acting fairly and equitably.
