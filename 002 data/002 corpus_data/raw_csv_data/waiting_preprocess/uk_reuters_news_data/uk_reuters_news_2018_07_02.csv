2018-07-02,"(Adds analysts’ comments on low-sulfur fuels demand) By Collin Eaton HOUSTON, July 2 (Reuters) - Owners of an idled oil refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, that was once among the world’s largest, plan to invest $1.4 billion to refurbish and restart a portion of the plant, they said on Monday. ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm expects the former Hovensa refinery on St. Croix to be able to process 200,000 barrels per day of crude and deliver fuels to market by January 2020, officials said at a news conference on the island. The Boston-based company spent two years studying the market and developed “a refinery profile we see thriving in the current marketplace,” said John Erhard, an ArcLight partner. It aims to produce fuels that meet an International Maritime Organization mandate calling for large vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur from 3.5 percent, the company has said. If the renamed Limetree Bay refinery can be refurbished to produce the fuels in the next 18 months, it could benefit from expected lower prices for heavy crude and strong demand for its fuels, said analysts. “If you have the ability to make compliant bunker fuel, you can make a lot of money,” said John Auers, executive vice president at consultancy Turner, Mason & Co. Mark Broadbent, principal research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, also said demand for IMO 2020 fuels should favor Limetree Bay, but it is unclear whether ArcLight can restore operations within its budget and by 2020. “Getting an idled refinery up and running could be very expensive,” he said. In the 1970s, the refinery on St. Croix was able to process 650,000 bpd. It halted processing in 2012, filed for bankruptcy three years later and was sold to ArcLight and trading firm Freepoint Commodities. The two companies run Limetree Bay Terminals, a 25 million barrel oil storage and marine terminal on the site. As part of its agreement with the USVI government, Limetree has purchased 225 acres of land and more than 100 homes surrounding the refinery to facilitate the restart, U.S. Virgin Islands Governor Kenneth Mapp said in an interview. “They’ve already begun spending money,” Mapp said. “Assets and resources are already on their way.” Reopening the refinery will be a boon to the U.S. Virgin Islands, which has struggled economically since Hovensa closed in 2012. The government will collect $600 million in revenue from the refinery over its first 10 years in operation, Mapp said. Restarting the facility also will bring 1,000 construction jobs and 700 permanent jobs to the site, in addition to the 750 workers at Limetree’s nearby oil terminal site, he said. Officials did not discuss BP Plc’s potential involvement in the refinery restart, but two sources familiar with the matter said the British oil company is in negotiations to supply crude to the plant. The deal under discussion would be similar to a supply and marketing arrangement BP struck with NARL Refining for the 115,000-bpd Come by Chance refinery in Newfoundland, one of the sources said. That deal soured over two years ago. ArcLight and Freepoint officials were unavailable for comment. BP spokesman Mike Abendhoff declined to comment on its potential role.

2018-07-02,"July 2 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petrobras has been fined $622 million by an international tribunal for breaching a 2009 contract with a unit of Vantage Drilling, the U.S.-based rig contactor said on Monday. The tribunal found that Petrobras and its units, Petrobras America Inc (PAI) and Petrobras Venezuela Investments and Services (PVIS) breached a drilllship contract with Vantage Deepwater Co. In 2016 (reut.rs/2KKTLwo), Petrobras executive Jorge Zelada was sentenced to 12 years and two months in jail for corruption and money laundering after he was convicted for unduly awarding Vantage a contract in 2009. Petrobras had notified Vantage in 2015 that they had terminated the contract, claiming Vantage breached terms, following which Vantage had filed an arbitration claim against PAI, PVIS and Petrobras for “wrongful termination.” Petrobras was not immediately available for comment.

2018-07-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures fell Monday as supplies from Saudi Arabia and Russia rose while economic growth stumbled in Asia amid escalating trade disputes with the United States. A flurry of announcements over the weekend unsettled oil markets. Global benchmark Brent fell 2.4 percent in the session, changing direction from last week when it gained more than 5 percent.  Brent crude LCOc1 fell $1.93 to settle at $77.30. U.S. light crude CLc1 fell to settle down 21 cents at $73.94.  The premium for U.S. crude for the front month compared with the second month CLc1-CLc2 widened to as much as $2.38 a barrel, the most since Aug. 20, 2014. The move indicates the market expects supply shortages to be more severe in the short term.  Information provider Genscape said U.S. crude inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub had fallen in the week, traders said. Genscape said stockpiles at the hub were down 3.2 million barrels in the week to June 22, but rose slightly in the four following days to June 26. Cushing supplies are down partially due to an outage in Canada. Production at Syncrude Canada’s oil sands facility near Fort McMurray, Alberta, is likely to remain offline at least through July, a Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) spokeswoman reaffirmed on Tuesday. “There seems to be great uncertainty about how much oil will be added to the supply side of the market,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut, referring to how much Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity will be able to offset shortages around the world. “How this really is going to play out seems to be up in the air.” U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had agreed to pump more oil, “maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels.” The White House later walked back the comments. Saudi Arabia’s output is up by 700,000 barrels per day (bpd) from May, a Reuters survey showed, and close to its 10.72 million bpd record from November 2016. Production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased by 320,000 bpd in June, according to a Reuters survey published Monday. The 12 OPEC members with supply reduction targets increased output by 680,000 bpd compared to May. To view a graphic on Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production, click: reut.rs/2tMAd43 Russian output rose to 11.06 million bpd in June from 10.97 million bpd in May, the Energy Ministry said on Monday. U.S. production C-OUT-T-EIA has soared 30 percent in the past two years, to 10.9 million bpd, meaning the world’s three biggest oil producers now churn out almost 11 million bpd each, meeting a third of global oil demand. To view a graphic on Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production, click: reut.rs/2tMAd43 Also weighing on oil demand are trade disputes between the United States and other major economies including China, the European Union, India and Canada. China, Japan and South Korea all reported slowdowns in export orders in June amid escalating trade disputes with the United States. “Recurring salvos in the trade war and falling asset prices raise the question of how much tariffs could damage the global economy,” U.S. bank JPMorgan said. The bank said a “medium-intensity (trade) conflict would likely reduce global economic growth by at least 0.5 percent, “before accounting for tighter financial conditions and sentiment shocks.” Despite the relief from Saudi Arabia and Russia, oil markets remain tense because of unplanned outages from Canada to Venezuela and Libya. Looming U.S. sanctions against Iran further contribute to expected tightness. Trump threatened in an interview that aired on Sunday to put sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran.  “The Trump administration’s plan for Iran sanctions is now abundantly clear. They seek to push Iranian exports of crude, condensate, and oil products to zero,” energy consultancy FGE said in a note.

2018-07-02,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The world’s top cocoa producer Ivory Coast plans to build a 60 to 70 megawatt (MW) capacity biomass power generation plant running on waste from cocoa pods, part of its aim of developing 424 MW of biomass power generation capacity by 2030.   The plant, which will enable Ivory Coast to diversify its electricity generation sources, was among five projects to receive grants from the U.S. agency for trade and development (USTDA), the U.S. embassy in Abidjan said in statement on Monday. Others included a hydropower project in Kokumbo and two smart grid power projects.     The biomass power station, the first in Ivory Coast, would be based in the southern cocoa region of Divo. The USTDA has earmarked $996,238 for feasibility studies, the statement said. Although Ivory Coast produces around 2 million tonnes of cocoa annually, thousands of tonnes of pods are discarded after the beans are removed. They are left to rot or burned after the harvest.  Unlike many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Ivory Coast has a reliable power supply. It exports electricity to neighbors Ghana, Burkina Faso, Benin, Togo and Mali, and plans to extend its grid to Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone this year. But with domestic consumption rising by about 10 percent a year, the government is under pressure to boost supply at home and aims to increase installed capacity to 4,000 MW by 2020, from the current 2,275 MW.

2018-07-02,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States aims to reduce Tehran’s oil revenue to zero in an effort to force the Iranian leadership to change its behaviour in the region and believes there is enough spare global oil capacity to make up for lower supply from Iran, a senior U.S. State Department policy adviser said on Monday. Brian Hook, the State Department’s director of policy planning, told a news conference that the U.S. goal was to get as many countries as possible down to zero Iranian oil imports. The United States would work with allies on a case-by-case basis but Washington did not plan to offer exemptions from sanctions, Hook added. “Our goal is to increase pressure on the Iranian regime by reducing to zero its revenue on crude oil sales,” Hook said. “We are working to minimize disruptions to the global market but we are confident there is sufficient global spare oil capacity.” Saudi Arabia’s King Salman promised U.S. President Donald Trump at the weekend that he would raise oil production if needed and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity to boost output, the White House said. In a tweet on Saturday, Trump said the extra Saudi oil would help offset a decline in supply from Iran, after the United States pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May and moved to reimpose oil sanctions. Trump was not specific on whether the additional 2 million barrels was a per-day figure - but worldwide daily demand is nearing 100 million bpd. The Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November when the United States re-imposes sanctions against Tehran, after Trump withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six major powers, against the advice of allies in Europe and elsewhere. U.S. officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions once they are re-imposed, with the aim of pressuring Iran into negotiating a new agreement.  Hook said he planned to meet with European allies Britain, France and Germany at the end of the week to discuss Iran. He also said he and senior Treasury Department would visit Gulf states “in the coming days.” Some 50 international companies had announced their intention to leave the Iranian market, particularly in energy and financial sectors, as the United States moved to reimpose the sanctions against Iran, Hook said. “We have been clear with countries and companies around the world that we are bringing severe economic pressure on Iran until the regime changes its destabilizing policies,” Hook said.

2018-07-02,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions fell from 2014 to 2016 and might already have peaked, according to a study published on Monday, with structural economic changes allowing Beijing to meet targets earlier than expected. China vowed before the Paris climate talks in 2015 to bring CO2 emissions to a peak by “around 2030”, and the country’s top climate official, Xie Zhenhua, has already said it could meet the pledge ahead of time.  But the study, published by Nature Geoscience, said “in retrospect, the commitment may have been fulfilled even as it was being made”, with emissions hitting a record 9.53 gigatonnes in 2013 and declining in the following three years, dropping to 9.2 gigatonnes in 2016. While emissions rose by an average of 9.3 percent per year from 2000 to 2013, China’s economy underwent a “structural break” in 2014, and is shifting to less carbon-intensive high technology sectors, it said. “Unless there is a significant amount of change - a large government intervention like the stimulus package of 2008 - then China’s emissions will stabilize and gradually go down,” said Dabo Guan, a professor of climate change economics at the University of East Anglia (UEA), one of the authors of the study. In May, environment group Greenpeace estimated that China’s CO2 emissions rose 4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 after increasing 2 percent last year, adding that “backsliding” on earlier progress could result in China’s biggest annual rise in emissions since 2011 this year. “I would have genuinely wanted it to have peaked in 2013, but given the increase in 2017 and first few months in 2018, I am cautious,” said Wai-Shin Chan, head of the climate change department at HSBC, adding that coal consumption remained a major component of China’s energy mix.  But the UEA’s Guan said calculations for 2017 are incomplete and fail to take into account rising coal quality, efficiency improvements or land use changes that could have taken more CO2 out of the system.  An early Chinese peak in CO2 emissions would bolster arguments that the Paris agreement is too lenient on the country, an argument made by U.S. President Donald Trump when he vowed to withdraw from the deal last year.  Guan said it is clear the original target of “around 2030” was conservative, but the ultimate issue was not when China peaked, but at what level. “Even if we peak in 2019 and 2020, if it reaches 13 gigatonnes it would also be a disaster,” he said.

2018-07-02,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sold his private jet, according to a broker and aircraft registration data, after complaining that U.S. sanctions made it impossible for him to use the aircraft. The owner of the Gulfstream jet now is a subsidiary of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the registration records showed. RDIF did not reply to Reuters questions about the aircraft. A representative for Timchenko told Reuters that the businessman and his companies “have had no relation to the aircraft you mentioned already for several years”. Timchenko, who made a fortune in oil trading and has been described by Putin as one of his closest associates, bought the Gulfstream G650 jet in 2013, according to aircraft registration records. The model usually has a sale price when new of around $60 million. A year later, in 2014, the U.S. government, in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, put Timchenko on its sanctions list, describing him as a member of Putin’s inner circle. In an interview that year, Timchenko said U.S.-based Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation had annulled the contract to service the plane.  “My Gulfstream cannot be used because the company won’t supply it with spare parts, and the pilots don’t have the right to use the navigation, the built-in maps,” he was quoted as saying by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency. Since then the aircraft has been transferred twice to different countries’ aircraft registries, its registration number has been changed, and the offshore companies listed in documents as its owner have changed several times. The ultimate owners of those offshore companies has never been disclosed. Reuters was able to track the jet through these changes using its manufacturer’s serial number, a unique code that stays with an aircraft throughout its lifetime. In June 2018, a new owner for the aircraft appeared in the aircraft registry of Luxembourg: Cyprus-registered Amerivo Holdings Limited. That company is a 100 percent owned subsidiary of RDIF, according to the fund’s annual report. Mathieu Pezin, Executive Vice President of Monaco-based aircraft broker Boutsen Aviation, told Reuters his company had been hired to sell the aircraft last year. He said the owner at the time was not Timchenko, but a Russian businessman who had bought the aircraft from Timchenko some time in mid-2016.

2018-07-02,"MOSCOW, July 2 (Reuters) - Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sold his private jet, according to a broker and aircraft registration data, after complaining that U.S. sanctions made it impossible for him to use the aircraft. The owner of the Gulfstream jet now is a subsidiary of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the registration records showed. RDIF did not reply to Reuters questions about the aircraft. A representative for Timchenko told Reuters that the businessman and his companies “have had no relation to the aircraft you mentioned already for several years”. Timchenko, who made a fortune in oil trading and has been described by Putin as one of his closest associates, bought the Gulfstream G650 jet in 2013, according to aircraft registration records. The model usually has a sale price when new of around $60 million. A year later, in 2014, the U.S. government, in response to Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, put Timchenko on its sanctions list, describing him as a member of Putin’s inner circle. In an interview that year, Timchenko said U.S.-based Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation had annulled the contract to service the plane. “My Gulfstream cannot be used because the company won’t supply it with spare parts, and the pilots don’t have the right to use the navigation, the built-in maps,” he was quoted as saying by Russia’s state-owned TASS news agency. Since then the aircraft has been transferred twice to different countries’ aircraft registries, its registration number has been changed, and the offshore companies listed in documents as its owner have changed several times. The ultimate owners of those offshore companies has never been disclosed. Reuters was able to track the jet through these changes using its manufacturer’s serial number, a unique code that stays with an aircraft throughout its lifetime.

2018-07-02,"(Repeats July 1 item for additional readers with no changes to headline or text) By Luc Cohen BUENOS AIRES, July 1 (Reuters) - Argentina will allow fuel retailers to freely set pump prices starting in August, according to an Energy Ministry official familiar with the plan, a move that could encourage badly needed investment in the nation’s oil patch but risks worsening sky-high inflation and angering consumers. Separately, the ministry is looking to set up an auction process for the natural-gas market that it hopes will lower prices, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The actions signal that President Mauricio Macri is moving ahead with free-market reforms to attract private investment to develop the nation’s abundant shale oil reserves, even as rising global oil prices and a precipitous weakening of the nation’s currency have led to pressure for more interventionist government policies. The moves will also bring relief to the oil sector. Price controls have squeezed refiners’ margins, prompting one refinery to suspend operations. Macri’s pro-business government freed fuel prices last year, part of its efforts to unwind state controls on Argentina’s economy. But his administration reversed course in May due to a rapid decline in the peso. The sudden depreciation rattled markets and prompted Argentina to turn to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for emergency financing. In May, the government reached a deal for a two-month freeze on pump prices with the three largest oil companies operating in Argentina: state-owned YPF, Shell, and BP’s Pan American Energy. It later set the price of domestic crude at $68, about $10 below the global Brent crude price, to mitigate the impact of freezing fuel prices on refiners’ margins. By freeing pump prices, the government is betting that gas stations will limit price hikes to avoid losing customers, the official said, and that by freeing crude prices it would encourage more investment in domestic drilling, part of a long-term strategy to wean Argentina from petroleum imports. “Price controls do not help with anything,” the official said. The government and the oil companies agreed to loosen the freeze June 1, allowing for hikes of 5 percent in June and 3 percent in July. Macri’s administration had kept the industry guessing as to what it might do in August. Th earlier increases were unsatisfactory to oil industry players, three of whom complained privately to Reuters that the modest bumps did not come close to covering their increased costs. Last month, global trader Trafigura announced it was suspending activities at its 30,500 barrel-per-day refinery in the port city of Bahia Blanca due to the “mismatch between fuel prices and production and import costs.” An oil industry executive who spoke with Reuters recently expressed frustration with the bind. “The adjustment that needs to be done is not 3 percent, it is 45 percent,” said the person, who requested anonymity to speak freely. VACA MUERTA RAMP-UP An end to retail price caps would likely infuriate Argentine consumers, who are already incensed at the government for the drop in the peso and inflation that is running at a 26.3 percent annual clip. But Macri’s government has prioritized reviving the energy sector to shake Argentina’s dependence on imported oil and gas, and to put an end to market-distorting subsidies. Argentina possesses the world’s second-largest reserves of shale natural gas and ranks No. 4 in reserves of shale oil, mostly in the Vaca Muerta fields in Patagonia. But it faces stiff competition to attract the billions in private investment needed to develop these resources. Oil production is languishing at multi-decade lows. The picture is brighter with natural gas. Rising output in Vaca Muerta helped boost the country’s production by 3.4 percent in the first quarter of 2018 compared with the same period last year, according to government data. “We are beginning to have an abundance of gas in Argentina,” the Energy Ministry official said. As a result, the ministry will create an auction process for wholesale customers to bid on the open market for their natural gas supplies during the low-demand summer months, the official said. The plan is to phase out the current fixed-contract system in a move the government hopes will lower prices. The auctions could start in September or October, and could account for as much as 70 percent of wholesale supply by March or April of 2019, the official said. Argentina is also expected to begin gas exports to Chile in the fourth quarter of this year, another result of rising Vaca Muerta output. Argentina will still need to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet demand in winter months. Reporting by Luc Cohen; Additional reporting by Juliana

2018-07-02,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian oil major Eni (ENI.MI) will make a binding commitment to becoming carbon neutral, its chief executive Claudio Descalzi said on Monday. Descalzi said Eni’s “epochal” announcement on how it planned to reach its goal would be made by the end of the year, adding that no oil company as yet had laid out binding plans for a net zero carbon footprint. BP (BP.L) has said it will maintain total CO2 emissions in 2025 at 2015 levels and that it will reduce them by 3.5 million tonnes, thereby offsetting higher production, while Shell (RDSa.L) has “ambitions” to halve its emissions by 2050. Eni was assessing the costs and expected to release targets in terms of timing and volumes before the end of the year, Descalzi said on the sidelines of a conference. “A new and strategic cycle has begun for Eni; from being an oil company it has become an energy company and is now betting on the circular economy to become carbon neutral,” he said. Descalzi said the targets would include not only atmospheric emissions but the soil too. “The aim is to optimise the production of waste,” he said, without giving further details. Some global investors have started to raise ethical issues about the kind of companies they invest into. Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the biggest in the world, wants the companies it holds stakes in to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. On Monday Eni increased its Norwegian presence with a view to extracting more offshore oil by merging its subsidiary there with privately-owned Point Resources. The move is part of Eni’s aim of cutting its exposure to geographical risk. Eni is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer in Africa. Asked about media speculation the group was set to announce a new bumper discovery in Egypt following its recent Zohr find, Descalzi said there were prospects and new geological structures in Egypt “but we still haven’t discovered anything”.

2018-07-02,"OSLO (Reuters) - Sweden will have to import more electricity during winter as the country, a net power exporter to the rest of Europe, shifts from nuclear to wind, its grid operator said. Last winter, the first since the closure of its Oskarshamn 1 reactor, stretched Sweden’s resources as peak consumption rose by 800 megawatt (MW), triggering start-up procedures in its reserve energy plants. Sweden’s power balance will deteriorate further from next winter, the country will need imports and the situation will become worse with two more of its reactors closing by 2020, state-grid Svenska Kraftnat (SVK) said in a report on Monday. “For next winter (if it’s a normal winter) we expect Sweden to (need to) import 400 MW more than it exports during the hour with the highest consumption,” SVK’s electricity system analyst Erik Hellstrom, and the author of the report, told Reuters.        Hellstrom said that if the coming winter is a “10-year winter” (colder than a normal winter), Sweden’s imports will rise by as much as 1,500 MW more than it exports in the hour with the highest consumption. Of Sweden’s eight remaining nuclear reactors, two will close soon, Ringhals 2 in 2019 and Ringhals 1 the year after, cutting a combined production of 1,700 MW from its power system, 40 percent of which is nuclear output-dependent. “Wind power cannot contribute to the power balance during winter peak hours with the same availability as the nuclear power it replaces,” SVK said. The expansion of Sweden’s wind power capacity, with new farms coming into the system, may also be insufficient to cover the deficit the lost nuclear reactors leaves, said SVK, warning low profitability may even prohibit planned power projects. “The margins for the Swedish power balance and the ability to be self-sufficient with enough electricity under high-load situations are shrinking,” said the report. The highest electricity consumption Sweden recorded last winter was about 26,700 MW said the grid, nearly 40 percent of the whole Nordic region. Sweden will need to add a further 2.6 gigawatt (GW) in power generation capacity by 2040 to avoid power shortages, SVK said last year, as the country will risk electricity shortfalls of 400 hours per year on average.

It was the first trading day of the new month, quarter and half-year but there was no let up for bruised investors after the worst start to a year for world shares since 2010. Shanghai’s “bear” market lurch had continued overnight, with losses of up to 3 percent as firms await some $34 billion of U.S. tariffs this week and new business surveys showed some worrying signs of deterioration. Europe suffered a thud too, with the STOXX 600 share index dropping as much as 1 percent and the euro down 0.5 percent to $1.1630 as differences over immigration threatened Angela Merkel’s German coalition government. The trade strains meanwhile were compounded by an EU threat to hit the United States with almost $300 billion in retaliatory tariffs, lingering concerns over President Donald Trump’s dislike for the World Trade Organization and by data showing the weakest euro zone manufacturing sector growth in 18 months. “There are a lot of uncertainties out there,” said Rabobank’s Head of Macro Strategy Elwin de Groot. “It is pretty unclear what is going to happen in Germany and the trade concerns are really top of mind at the moment, so we are seeing quite a lot of weakness in emerging markets.” All the concerns meant more demand for safe-haven bonds. U.S. Treasuries and German Bund both saw buying, whereas Wall Street looked set to go lower when it reopens. Shanghai blue chips had resumed their slide overnight with a fall of 2.9 percent. That, alongside another flop by the yuan hot on the heels of its weakest month on record , soured sentiment across Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment there had also darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats. Tension is growing ahead of a July 6 deadline when Washington is due to impose US$34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports. A new report from Oxford Economics warned that tariff threats, if realised, would extend high tariffs to over 4 percent of world imports – a more than tenfold rise versus the 0.3 percent of imports hit by the new tariffs imposed so far. “The threat to world growth is significant” it said. “In a scenario of escalating tariffs, our modelling suggests world GDP could be cut by up to 0.4 percentage points in 2019.” Two surveys of Chinese manufacturing out in the last few days showed a softening in activity, partly due to softness in exports. A slew of U.S. factory readings are due on Monday, while the U.S. ISM report is out on Tuesday. Minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting come on Thursday and the week closes with U.S. payrolls for June. In currency markets, the euro was knocked back on reports German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had rejected a migration deal Merkel negotiated at an EU summit on Friday. The currency then partly bounced on news Seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party, only to slide back again after the euro zone manufacturing data came in weak. Seehofer’s move makes the future of Merkel’s government even more uncertain. Her Christian Democrats (CDU) rely on the CSU to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum. The euro was 0.5 percent lower at $1.1640, having skidded as far as $1.1628 at one stage. The U.S. dollar gained 0.25 percent on a basket of currencies to 94.891, but was still below Friday’s top of 95.324. It was flat on the yen at 110.74 having been as high as 111.06 at one stage. The Mexican peso see-sawed after leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory for president. Dealers said the clear win might settle one source of political uncertainty, but Obrador was also expected to sharpen Mexican divisions with Trump. After an initial retreat, the dollar soon rebounded to top 20 pesos, up from last week’s trough around 19.5580 per dollar. Trump also loomed large in oil markets with crude taking a spill after he tweeted that Saudi Arabia had agreed to lift oil production by “maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels”. The missive was later played down by the White House and Saudi Press Agency. Brent crude lost 85 cents to $78.26 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 30 cents to $73.88. The pullback was still modest given U.S. crude rallied more than 8 percent last week, while Brent gained more than 5 percent. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney

2018-07-02,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2KFCXa3 By John Kemp LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - Hedge funds became much more bullish about the outlook for U.S. crude prices last week, following an outage on Canada’s Syncrude system, which supplies the U.S. Midwest, and a drawdown in crude stocks around Cushing. But in the rest of the petroleum complex, the persistent liquidation of formerly record bullish positions continued for the tenth week running, according to an analysis of exchange and regulatory data. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 36 million barrels in the week to June 26. Net long positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI climbed by 75 million barrels, the largest one-week increase since OPEC decided to cut its production levels at the end of November 2016. Gross short positions in NYMEX WTI were slashed by 30 million barrels to leave just 20 million barrels remaining, the smallest number of short contracts since Feb 2013. The rush of short covering and the creation of fresh long positions sent nearby futures prices surging and has pushed the six-month WTI calendar spread to a backwardation of more than $6 per barrel. But bullish in WTI was linked to specific locational factors. Elsewhere, fund managers continued to realise profits and liquidate long positions (tmsnrt.rs/2KFCXa3). Net long positions were cut in Brent (-5 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (-8 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-11 million barrels) and European gasoil (-15 million barrels) in the week to June 26. Net length in Brent has fallen by a total of 179 million barrels since peaking in early April while net length in refined products is down by 131 million barrels since peaking in mid-May. Portfolio managers remain essentially bullish about the outlook for oil prices in the second half of 2018, with long petroleum positions outnumbering short ones by a margin of 9 to 1. But funds have become more cautious since the middle of April, when the margin was almost 14 to 1, given the significant rise in prices over the last 12 months and potential for a slowdown in consumption growth.

2018-07-02,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s REC Silicon (REC.OL), a supplier of silicon materials to the solar industry, will cut around 100 U.S. jobs and take further asset impairments due to a U.S.-China trade war over solar panels, it said on Monday.   The company has been unable to sell its goods in China since 2014 as a result of the dispute between the world’s two largest economies, leading to several rounds of redundancies at its two U.S. plants. The Oslo-listed firm said on Monday it would lay off around 40 percent of the 250 employees at its Moses Lake plant in the U.S. state of Washington and cut production there to about 25 percent of capacity. Its shares were down 14 percent at 1115 GMT, lagging an Oslo benchmark index .OSEBX down 0.5 percent, having already fallen 68 percent over the past five years.  China has imposed tariffs on U.S. imports of polysilicon, a key element to make solar panels that REC Silicon produces, while the United States slapped tariffs on solar panel imports starting in 2012 and with a latest round in January.  The company has another U.S. plant in Montana, which is unaffected by the latest job cuts. Some 70 workers at that plant were laid off in September and 70 were laid off at the Moses Lake plant in 2016. “It is really sad. We can’t access the market. We don’t want subsidies. We just want fair access,” CEO Tore Torvund told a conference call. REC Silicon also said it expected to report additional impairments when it publishes second-quarter results on July 19. Second-quarter revenue was expected at $58 million, it said, adding it had about $42 million in cash.  “Current market conditions will negatively impact the company’s profitability and credit risk exposure,” it said. REC Silicon did not say how much the impairments would be. “We make a strong demand to the present (U.S.) administration to find a solution so that we can continue to operate out of the U.S.,” said Torvund, reiterating calls the firm made in January, after Washington introduced 30-percent tariffs on imports of solar panels. “We are very dependent on the U.S. administration going to the administration in China so that we can continue to operate polysilicon out of the United States,” he said, adding  the company was cost-competitive because it held technology others did not have.

2018-07-02,"(Adds details, background) By Ahmed Rasheed BAGHDAD, July 2 (Reuters) - Iraq is still in talks with Turkey and Kurdish regional authorities to resume Kirkuk oil exports through the Ceyhan port, Iraqi Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi told state-run newspaper al-Sabah on Monday. “The decision to restart exports depends on the results of the talks,” Luaibi was quoted by al-Sabah as saying. Production from Iraq’s Kirkuk oilfields is currently at 220,000 barrels per day, which is entirely diverted to local refineries, Luaibi said. Exports from Kirkuk’s oilfields were halted after an Iraq military offensive to retake the disputed territories which had come under Kurdish control in 2014. The offensive was a response to the independence referendum held on Sept. 25 by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which Baghdad opposed. Kirkuk oil exports had been transported by a Kurdish-operated pipeline that connects to the twin Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline at Khabur on the border with Turkey. Late last year, Iraq began diverting output from Kirkuk oilfields to local refineries to boost fuel production and help free up more oil for exports from southern oilfields. Iraq also agreed last year to ship crude from Kirkuk to Iran for use in its refineries, after which Iran would deliver the same amount of oil to Iraq’s southern ports. Iraq’s oil minister said last month Iraq and Iran had not yet begun exchanging crude oil, for technical reasons. Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain about 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil, according to BP.

2018-07-02,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) By John Kemp LONDON, July 2 (Reuters) - The White House can drive Iran’s oil exports to zero, or it can have moderate U.S. gasoline prices, but it probably cannot have both. The awkward tension between the administration’s foreign policy priority (tough Iran sanctions) and its electoral calculation (to keep gasoline prices low) explains its increasingly frequent comments about oil prices. President Donald Trump has already blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for the sharp rise in prices that has pushed the average cost of U.S. gasoline close to $3 per gallon. “Looks like OPEC is at it again,” the president wrote in a message on Twitter on April 20. “Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Under pressure from the United States, OPEC and its allies agreed on June 23 to boost production by an implied 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from the start of July. Saudi Arabia is expected to provide most of the increase, with smaller contributions from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia, though specific country allocations were not included in the accord. But the agreement failed to bring prices down and senior U.S. officials have since indicated they want an even larger increase to dampen the market. The president has now weighed in by pressing Saudi Arabia for a much bigger increase in oil production, with another message on Twitter on June 30: “Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference,” the president wrote. “Prices to high! He has agreed!” Saudi Arabia’s official news agency confirmed the telephone call though it made no mention about volumes of extra oil. According to the Saudi Press Agency: “The two leaders stressed the need to make efforts to maintain the stability of oil markets, the growth of the global economy, and the efforts of producing countries to compensate for any potential shortage of supplies.” The White House also softened its position on extra barrels. “The two leaders agreed that balancing the energy market is essential,” it said in an official statement. “In response to the President’s assessment of a deficit in the oil market, King Salman affirmed that the Kingdom maintains a two million barrel per day spare capacity, which it will prudently use if and when necessary to ensure market balance and stability, and in coordination with its producer partners, to respond to any eventuality.” However, the president later made much more explicit the link between Iran sanctions and OPEC/Saudi Arabia’s production, in a television interview with Fox News on July 1. Asked whether OPEC was manipulating the oil market, the president replied affirmatively: “100 percent, OPEC is, and they better stop it, because we are protecting those countries, many of those countries.” “OPEC is manipulating, and you know they allowed (a production increase) less than we thought last week, they have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion, because we don’t want that happening.” “Don’t forget the one negative to the Iran deal is that you lose a lot of oil, and they got to make up for it. And who is their big enemy? Iran.” “Iran is their big enemy, so they are going to have to do it. And I have a very good relationship with the king and with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and with the others around and they are going to have to put out more oil.” In contrast to the Obama administration, which employed sanctions to reduce Iran’s oil exports gradually, the Trump administration has made clear it wants to see Iran’s oil exports fall to zero from November. In a media briefing on June 26, a senior State Department official repeatedly stated the administration wants U.S. allies as well as India and China to cut imports from Iran to zero and does not plan to issue waivers. So far in 2018, Iran has been exporting well over 2 million bpd of crude and condensates, according to the Joint Organizations Data Initiative. The problem is that the total amount of unused and available spare capacity held by OPEC members was just 3 million bpd at the end of May, International Energy Agency data shows. Most of the remaining spare capacity is in Saudi Arabia (2 million bpd) with smaller volumes in Iraq (330,000 bpd), the United Arab Emirates (330,000 bpd) and Kuwait (220,000 bpd). Other analysts put the level of spare capacity much lower. Russia also has the capacity to increase output by several hundred thousand barrels per day over the next six months, but unused capacity elsewhere is negligible. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait and Russia have already pledged to boost their combined output by 1 million bpd from July. If Iran’s exports are pushed close to zero from November, and Saudi Arabia and its allies step up production to fill the gap, remaining spare capacity will fall to 1 million bpd or less by the end of 2018. The volume of spare capacity has not fallen that low since 2004, and before that, the first U.S.-Iraq Gulf War in 1991. But if spare capacity is adjusted for increases in consumption, it will be at the lowest level since the oil shocks of 1973/74 and 1980/81. The oil market relies on a set of shock absorbers to help manage variations in production and consumption and ensure the smooth flow of oil from wellhead to consumer. In rough order of availability, these shock absorbers are: * Commercial inventories (including floating storage) * OPEC spare capacity * OECD strategic stocks * Short-cycle oil production (shale and development within existing oilfields) Most of these shock absorbers have become seriously depleted as a result of the recent tightening of the oil market. Commercial inventories have fallen below the average of the last five years and are much tighter if adjusted for the increase in consumption since 2013. If Iran’s exports are eliminated entirely, and Saudi Arabia and its allies step up their own production to compensate, the OPEC spare capacity shock absorber will also disappear. The market will then rely on strategic stocks and an increase in short-cycle oil production to meet any further disruptions of supply or unexpectedly fast growth in consumption. Stock releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve and other IEA members could help ease future shortages and calm prices but only as a temporary measure. Inventory releases (a one-time adjustment in stock levels) cannot offset an ongoing disruption in production (a flow problem). In the medium term, the market would have to rely on an increase in short-cycle production to cover any remaining production-consumption gap. Short-cycle producers, especially U.S. shale firms, could raise their output but their response will be limited by the lack of available pipeline capacity. The oil market is already at a relatively late stage in the cycle, when prices tend to rise to stimulate faster production growth and moderate consumption growth. Other things being equal, prices are more likely to rise than fall over the next two years, assuming the global economic expansion remains on track. If the Trump administration takes a tough line on sanctions and attempts to push Iran’s oil exports close to zero, it will be removing a further 2 million bpd of production from a market that is already likely to be very tight. The most likely outcome is that prices will rise to cut consumption growth and rebuild the spare capacity and inventory shock absorbers to a more comfortable level. The almost inevitable consequence is a further increase in gasoline and diesel costs and/or a slowdown in the global economy to curb consumption growth – perhaps as a result of the oil price increase or rising trade tensions. Markets have fundamental constraints of their own quite distinct from politics. No matter how much it presses Saudi Arabia to boost oil supplies, the White House cannot escape this logic.

2018-07-02,"(Adds details, background) TUNIS, July 2 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) declared force majeure on loadings from Zueitina and Hariga ports on Monday, resulting in total production losses of 850,000 barrels per day (bpd) due to the closure of eastern fields and ports. The Tripoli-based NOC made the announcement after eastern factions seeking control of Libya’s oil exports began to block tankers at the two ports last week. They have also prevented the NOC from resuming operations at the ports of Ras Lanuf and Es Sider, which were placed under force majeure on June 14 during an armed attack by opponents of Khalifa Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) that was later repelled. The standoff is part of a broader conflict in Libya and has raised the prospect of a prolonged output drop from the OPEC member, which had recently been pumping more than 1 million bpd. “Despite our warning of the consequences and attempts to reason with the LNA General Command, two legitimate allocations were blocked from loading at Hariga and Zueitina this weekend,” Tripoli-based NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla was quoted as saying in Monday’s statement. “The storage tanks are full and production will now go offline.” The NOC had warned of daily losses of $67.4 million and extensive disruption to oil, gas and power operations if force majeure was declared at Zueitina and Hariga.

2018-07-02,"OSLO (Reuters) - Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) increased its Norwegian presence with a view to extracting more offshore oil on Monday by merging its subsidiary there with privately-owned Point Resources, in the sector’s latest round of consolidation. The new company, named Vaar Energi and led by Point Resources’ Vice President Kristin F. Kragseth, will be one of the largest players on the Norwegian continental shelf with a portfolio of 17 producing oil and gas fields.  Recent deals include Point Resources buying Exxon Mobil- (XOM.N) operated assets off Norway last year, and BP (BP.L) merging its Norwegian business with Norway’s Det norske in an all-share deal in 2016, creating Aker BP (AKERBP.OL). But while BP became a minority shareholder in Aker BP, Eni will own 69.6 percent of its newly merged operation, with private equity investor HitecVision owning the remainder. The new company will have a daily output of around 180,000 barrels of oil equivalents (boe), Eni said in a statement. “This is a fundamental step ahead in our strategy to reinforce Eni’s presence in OECD countries with further upstream potential, such as Norway,” Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi added. Mediobanca oil analyst Alessandro Pozzi said the move gave Eni “critical mass” in Norway and helped reduce risk in its portfolio. Vaar Energi plans to invest more than 65 billion Norwegian crowns (6.00 billion pounds) over the next five years to develop new resources, which could help to boost daily output to 250,000 boe by 2023, Eni said. Vaar Energi’s combined reserves and resources total more than 1.3 billion barrels boe, it added. The merger is expected to be completed by the end of 2018, pending regulatory approvals.

2018-07-02,"BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump lashed out at OPEC with a warning to stop manipulating oil markets and piled pressure on U.S. ally Saudi Arabia to raise supplies to compensate for lower exports from Iran. Trump said in a tweet on Saturday that Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud had agreed to produce more oil. The White House later walked back the president’s comments, saying the king had said his country could raise oil production if needed. On Sunday, in an interview with Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo,” Trump reiterated his call on Saudi Arabia to raise production to a new record, arguing that it should help the United States lower fuel prices since Washington is helping Riyadh in its struggle against Tehran. “Don’t forget the one negative to the Iran deal is that you lose a lot of oil, and they got to make up for it. And who is their big enemy? Iran. OK. You think of it. Iran is their big enemy, so they are going to have to do it,” Trump said. “And I have a very good relationship with the (Saudi) king and with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia and with the others around and they are going to have to put out more oil.” Oil prices rose last week on worries that U.S. sanctions against Iran would take away significant volumes of crude oil from world markets while oil demand worldwide increases.  Earlier this year, to the chagrin of European partners, Trump said he would pull the United States out of the Iran nuclear agreement secured by world powers. On Monday, Brent oil prices were around 1 percent lower but not far from $79 per barrel as analysts have warned of thin global spare capacity to offset potential supply disruptions. Rising gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump ahead of the November elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the economy. On Fox, Trump directed blame at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is the biggest producer.  Asked whether someone was manipulating oil markets, Trump said: “100 percent. OPEC is and they better stop it because we’re protecting those countries, many of those countries.” “OPEC is manipulating, and you know they allowed (a production increase) less than we thought last week. They have to put out another 2 million barrels in my opinion, because we don’t want that happening,” Trump said. Trump was referring to OPEC’s decision to raise output together with its non-OPEC allies by around 1 million barrels per day, although since then Saudi Arabia has pledged to raise production to a new record. Saudi Arabia has been pumping around 10 million bpd in recent months and sources close to its oil policy have said it could raise output to 11 million bpd. Trump’s suggestion means he wants Riyadh to increase production to 12 million bpd - something the kingdom has never done in the past. Trump will visit Europe this month for a meeting with NATO allies, whom he has criticized sharply as paying too little for their joint defence.  Trade tensions are likely to overshadow that trip. Trump has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium in response to what he calls unfair trade practices from Europe, Canada, and other allies around the world, who have responded with retaliatory sanctions in kind. On trade, the president said in the Fox interview that he was not happy with the North American Free Trade Agreement and would not agree a new one until after the November elections. “I want to wait until after the election,” he said.

2018-07-02,"(Repeats late Friday item without changes) By Marc Jones LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - If last year’s financial markets boom was down to a ‘Goldilocks’ global economy, 2018 has so far been all about the bears, with the worst start to a year for world stocks since 2010. A grizzly mix of U.S.-China trade tensions, central banks turning off the money taps and cooling growth in hotspots including Europe has wiped a trillion dollars off MSCI’s 47-country world index. A pumped-up dollar, which has had its best first half in three years, and a 16 percent leap in oil prices have played a big role too clobbering emerging markets particularly hard. Argentina’s peso and Turkey’s lira have been shredded 30 and 17 percent, respectively, Chinese stocks have entered bear market territory and EM equities have slumped 10 percent, or 17 percent excluding a brief January surge. “People just woke up to the fact that something has changed,” said London & Capital’s Chief Investment Officer Pau Morilla-Giner. As well as the escalation in global trade tensions “there has been a realisation that the big central banks aren’t thinking about stimulating the economy anymore, they are trying to build up capacity in case of recession.” Still, it hasn’t been a doom-fest everywhere. One Wall Street bellwether, the S&P 500, is clinging on in positive territory and while the trade jitters have sapped the Dow Jones Industrial, the Nasdaq has set records this month. As a set, the FAANGs (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google) are up almost 40 percent despite having $400 billion wiped off their combined value in March when it was revealed Facebook misused 50 million of its users’ data. Netflix has more than doubled in price this year, Amazon is up 45 percent and Facebook is fully recovered and up over 11 percent. Also, for all the pressure heaped on China in recent months, its tech giant Alibaba is up 11 percent. Among the major currencies, the dollar is up almost 3 percent against the euro and nearly 2 percent versus the safe-haven yen . For emerging markets that rise has been a wrecking ball. On top of the ailing lira and peso, Brazil’s real is down 14 percent, India’s rupee 7 percent, South Africa’s rand 10 percent and - despite the oil rally - Russia’s rouble 9 percent. Having been the stars of 2017, MSCI’s EM equities index is down 8 percent and local currency and dollar-denominated EM bonds have fallen 6 percent and 5 percent respectively. What has caused the most concern though has been China. Stocks there entered a bear market this week having dropped 20 percent from their January peaks, while the yuan has just had its worst month on record. With China the biggest consumer of industrial commodities, its misfiring economy has also contributed to the respective 9 and 15 percent declines in the price of copper and zinc , used in things like pipes and galvinised steel. “What tends to move markets the most tends to be issues with China,” said Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, Chief Investment Officer for Private Wealth Management at Goldman Sachs, saying it was both her biggest short-term and longer-term worry. “These tensions with the U.S. are not going to disappear, they are just going to ebb and flow,” she said, adding the economy was also imbalanced and had very high debt levels. Another 2017 high-flier, cryptocurrency Bitcoin, has lost 60 percent, but even traditional safe havens have failed to provide protection over the last few months. Another two U.S. interest hikes have seen Treasuries cost holders 3 percent this year and German Bunds and gold are both down 4 percent. Italy’s government bonds meanwhile have plunged 13 percent this quarter as an anti-establishment government took charge in Rome and the European Central Bank confirmed its mass bond buying programme will end this year. In contrast to Wall Street and Japan’s Nikkei’s solid first halves, euro zone stocks are down too, having lost roughly 6 percent.

E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 followed with a loss of 0.5 percent and European bourses were seen opening down. Shanghai blue chips resumed their slide with a fall of 2.3 percent that soured sentiment across the region. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent, adding to a 2 percent drop last week. Japan’s Nikkei shed 2.2 percent to an 11-week low, with a survey of manufacturers showing sentiment had darkened a shade in the face of trade war threats. The purchasing managers’ index (PMI) still edged higher for June, but exports orders softened. Tension is growing ahead of a July 6 deadline when the U.S. is due to impose US$34 billion of tariffs on Chinese exports. “The key risk for the market isn’t that Trump actually implements his trade threats but rather that a protracted period of trade uncertainty begins to weigh on economic activity,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “The evidence suggesting this is happening is far from conclusive, but ominous data points are accumulating.” Two surveys of Chinese manufacturing out in the last few days showed a softening in activity, partly due to softness in exports. A slew of factory readings from across the globe are due on Monday, while the U.S. ISM report is out on Tuesday. Minutes of the last Federal Reserve policy meeting come on Thursday and the week closes with U.S. payrolls for June. In currency markets, the euro took an early knock on reports German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer had rejected a migration deal German Chancellor Angela Merkel negotiated at a European Union summit on Friday. The currency then partly bounced on news Seehofer had offered to step down as minister and as chair of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party. The move makes the future of Merkel’s government even more uncertain as her Christian Democrats party (CDU) relies on the CSU to maintain power through a coalition formed three months ago to end a political vacuum. After all that, the euro was 0.33 percent easier at $0.1642 , having skidded as far as $1.1632 at one stage. The U.S. dollar gained 0.18 percent on a basket of currencies to 94.808, but was still below Friday’s top of 95.324. It was flat on the yen at 110.68 having been as high as 111.06 at one stage. The Mexican peso see-sawed after leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador won a decisive victory for president. Dealers said the clear win might settle one source of political uncertainty, but Obrador was also expected to sharpen Mexican divisions with U.S. President Donald Trump. After an initial retreat, the dollar soon rebounded to be flat at 19.9050 pesos, up from last week’s trough around 19.5580. Trump also loomed large in oil markets with crude taking a spill after he tweeted that Saudi Arabia had agreed to lift oil production by “maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels”. The missive was later downplayed by the White House and Saudi Press Agency. Brent crude lost 97 cents to $78.26 a barrel, while U.S. crude fell 73 cents to $73.42. The pullback was still modest given U.S. crude rallied more than 8 percent last week, while Brent gained more than 5 percent.

2018-07-02,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A persistent crunch in supply of fuel oil to Asia driven by reduced shipments from exporters like Iran and Venezuela has pushed a key fuel’s cash premium to Singapore prices to a three-year peak, with levels expected to stay high for another month.  The Asian cash premium for the 380-centistoke (cst) grade of fuel oil, typically used to power ships, hit $5.28 a tonne on Friday, its highest since mid-2015.  “Lower volumes from Venezuela and Iran are certainly contributing towards a tighter fuel oil balance,” said Joe Willis, Senior Research Analyst at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie.  He said Venezuela was this year expected to export 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) of fuel oil, down from 100,000 bpd in 2017, with the nation engulfed in economic crisis. Between January and June this year, Singapore imported a monthly average of 475,000 tonnes of fuel oil from South America including Brazil, versus 810,000 tonnes in the same period in 2017, data from the World Flows Explorer on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed.  Fuel oil 380-cst cash premium: reut.rs/2tLr2B5 Meanwhile, Iran’s oil exports are being hit as the United States re-imposes sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation over its disputed nuclear programme. Alan Gelder, vice president of refining at Wood Mackenzie, noted that sanctions on the country were coming when oil markets were already tightening, unlike the last time they were introduced. Elsewhere, fuel oil exports from Northwestern Europe to Singapore have also dropped, down to an average monthly total of 1.074 million tonnes in the first six month of 2018 versus 1.308 million tonnes at the same time in 2017, the data showed. “There are ... a number of refinery upgrading projects in Russia, Europe and Asia resulting in lower fuel oil production,” said Willis at Wood McKenzie. Russia is still carrying out modernisation work on its biggest refineries that has been going on for years. Traders said robust 380-cst premiums would continue for another month.  Strong fundamentals have already boosted margins on the 180-cst grade of fuel oil, often used in power generation. The discount on 180-cst to Dubai crude had hit $1.57 a barrel as of June 28, the narrowest discount seen since the middle of last September.

2018-07-02,"(Reuters) - Sweltering temperatures flirting with 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 Celsius) will blister parts of the U.S. Midwest and East Coast on Monday and sizzle at least through the Independence Day holiday on Wednesday, the National Weather Service said. More than 113 million Americans are under heat warnings or advisories stretching from the Mississippi Valley, up to Philadelphia, Chicago and bending over to New York, Boston, Baltimore and Washington D.C., said Patrick Burke, a meteorologist with the NWS Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland. “Hot is the only word for it,” Burke said. The first heat wave in the eastern U.S. might bring record hot temperatures to Syracuse, New York, which might top 100 degrees Monday, Burke said. Cities from St. Louis to New York, Chicago and Boston will be in the mid-90s, but the humidity will push the heat index up, making it feel like 100-to-105 degrees Fahrenheit, he said. Baltimore, MD and Albany, NY, might hit 99 degrees, he said.  “It’s going to be a hot week everywhere east of the Rockies,” Burke said. “At risk populations should definitely seek cool shelter.” The hot weather is dangerous for young children, the elderly and people with health problems. Don’t expect much relief overnight for the next few days as nighttime lows might not dip below 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the weather service said. A bubble of high pressure air floating over northern Tennessee is to blame, he said, locking the hot air in a large swath of the eastern U.S., Burke said. Cities across the region from the Mississippi river to the East Coast have set up cooling centers to keep people out of the dangerous heat.

2018-07-02,"HOUSTON, July 2 (Reuters) - The owners of a long-closed oil refinery on St. Croix will disclose on Monday an agreement with the Caribbean island’s governor to restart the plant and begin producing fuels late next year, according to people familiar with the talks. The refinery would process up to 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) and supply low-sulfur fuels required by an International Maritime Organization mandate that begins in 2020, according to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency review of the project. The Caribbean is facing declining fuel supplies from Venezuela, which has sharply cut its shipments to the region. Kenneth Mapp, the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, has scheduled a press conference for Monday morning to detail the deal with ArcLight Capital Partners and Limetree Bay Terminals LLC, which own the refinery, spokeswoman Lisa Posey said on Sunday. Any restart requires approval by the governor and legislature of the U.S. Virgin Islands. BP Plc separately is in talks with the refinery’s owners to supply crude to the plant, said two of the people familiar with the matter. The deal under discussion would be similar to a supply and marketing arrangement BP struck with NARL Refining for the 115,000-bpd Come By Chance refinery in Newfoundland, one of the people said. That deal soured over two years ago. BP spokesman Mike Abendhoff declined to comment. In the 1970s, the former Hovensa refinery on St. Croix was one of the world’s largest, able to process 650,000 bpd. It halted processing in 2012, filed for bankruptcy three years later and was sold to ArcLight and trading firm Freepoint Commodities. The two companies run Limetree Bay Terminals, a 32 million barrel oil storage and marine terminal on the site. ArcLight, which owns 80 percent of the venture, declined to comment on Friday. Limetree Bay plans to restart one of the plant’s remaining crude units, sulfur-recovery and other facilities to produce “low-sulfur fuels, i.e. gasoline, diesel and fuel oil,” according to the EPA’s April 5 letter. The refinery could begin production as early as next year, said U.S. Virgin Islands Senator Nereida Rivera-O’Reilly, who called the prospect “welcome news” for an island still recovering from two hurricanes last year. The IMO’s 2020 regulation calls for sulfur content in marine fuels to decline to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent, spurring new demand for the distillates the refinery would produce. The regulation will mean about 3 million bpd of high-sulfur fuel oil will be displaced by low sulfur products, estimates Rob Thummel, a portfolio manager at investment group Tortoise.

2018-07-02,"TOKYO, July 2 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell early on Monday, following comments from the White House that the leader of Saudi Arabia promised President Donald Trump that he can raise oil production if needed. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery was down 65 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $73.50 a barrel by 2250 GMT, after rising more than 8 percent last week. It touched a low of $72.51. The contract on Friday touched a high of $74.46, which was the highest since November 2014, rallying on concerns that U.S. sanctions against Iran would remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets at a time of rising global demand. London Brent crude fell 55 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $78.68, after gaining more than 5 percent last week. The leader of Saudi Arabia promised President Donald Trump that he can raise oil production if needed and the country has 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity, the White House said on Saturday, rowing back on an earlier Trump tweet that appeared to suggest the Saudis had agreed to boost output by that amount. Trump told King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud that the oil market could need more supply when the men spoke on Friday, the White House said. The Saudi leader said he was ready to raise output if needed, the White House said in a statement. President Trump lashed out at OPEC with a warning to stop manipulating oil markets and piled pressure on close U.S. allies in an interview that aired on Sunday with a threat to sanction European companies that do business with Iran.

2018-07-02,"(Repeats story published on Sunday, no change to text) * Major retailers ditch single-use plastic bags * Checkout staff abused by enraged customers * U.N. push to end single-use plastics worldwide by 2022 By Alison Bevege SYDNEY, July 1 (Reuters) - Australia’s biggest supermarket chains are scrambling to combat “bag rage” as frustrated shoppers vent their anger over the removal of single-use plastic bags. One man put his hands around a supermarket worker’s throat, the West Australian newspaper reported, while grocery stores are putting on more staff to help customers get used to the change. The removal of single-use plastics is part of a national push to reduce waste. As of July 1, major retailers in all but two Australian states will be fined if they supply single-use plastic bags. National supermarket chain Coles, owned by Wesfarmers , on Sunday removed single-use plastic bags from its stores, shortly after rival Woolworths banned the bags on June 20. Consumer complaints forced Woolworths to backflip on charging customers 15 Australian cents (11 U.S. cents) for a reusable plastic bag, with the retailer now offering them free until July 8. “They just want a little extra help from us to get through the transition,” said Claire Peters, Woolworths managing director, in an emailed statement. After seeing the backlash at its rival, Coles said it would open every checkout lane on Sunday to reduce queue lengths as staff explain the changes to customers. “We are taking a proactive step,” a Coles spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The union that represents Australian shop assistants has launched a public awareness campaign on the issue. “While we understand that some customers may be frustrated by this change, there is absolutely no excuse for abusive or violent behaviour towards retail staff,” said Gerard Dwyer, national secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees’ Association, in a statement on the union website. The union conducted a survey earlier this week and of 132 members who responded, 57 said they suffered abuse due to the plastic bag ban. More than 8 million tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s oceans each year, according to United Nations Environment Programme figures. The U.N. wants to eliminate single-use plastic by 2022 and says more than 60 countries have so far taken steps to ban or reduce plastic consumption.

2018-07-02,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * BP operates largest teapot marketing team among majors * Four BP-chartered tankers have trouble unloading off China * Two half-full tankers still off East China after over 1 mth * Drop in teapot demand catches traders, others off guard By Chen Aizhu and Florence Tan BEIJING/SINGAPORE, June 29 (Reuters) - Four supertankers chartered by energy major BP have been held up or delayed off China’s east coast over the last two months, unable to fully discharge oil as slowing demand from the country’s private refiners starts to impact global markets. Two of the four BP-chartered very large crude carriers (VLCCs) are still off Shandong province holding half their cargoes of Angolan crude oil, and another is headed back there from South Korea, according to trade flow data in Thomson Reuters Eikon and two shipping sources who track these vessels. It’s not clear why the tankers have had so much trouble offloading all their oil, or if BP had first secured buyers for the 8 million barrels - worth more than $600 million at current market prices - that was loaded onto the vessels out of Africa. BP has declined to comment on the matter. What is apparent is that the fortunes of China’s independent refiners, often called “teapots”, have turned for the worse amid escalating global trade tensions, rising crude oil prices, an oversupplied domestic fuel market and tighter government tax scrutiny. “Either it’s because of lower run rates curbing teapots’ buying, or the buyers are having problems paying,” said an executive with a western trading house. While an executive at an independent Shandong refiner said: “The market is bad - weak demand as plants come under policy headwinds ... (with) the tax rules biting into margins.” Both executives declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak publicly about commercial operations. It is not unusual for producers like BP to ship cargoes before finding a buyer. But having cargoes orphaned for two months is less common, several oil traders and shippers said. Paying for supertankers, each half a kilometre (0.3 miles) long, to wait in open seas to unload is costly as well. Although it is not known at what rate BP chartered the four vessels, shippers estimate the daily charter rate for a VLCC is now about $30,000 a day. So, four chartered VLCCs sitting idle for a month would cost BP around $3.6 million. BP declined to comment on the cost of having the tankers waiting off China to unload oil. Several traders and shippers said BP was unlikely the only seller caught off guard by the slowdown in demand and the teapots’ troubles, although all said stranded cargoes of this size and duration is rare. Among the four BP-chartered ships, the Texas has been held up the longest. It discharged part of its Angolan crude load in mid-April at Qingdao and was slated to offload the rest of its cargo at Rizhao, another port in Shandong, shortly after. Instead, the Texas has been anchored off the coast until this week, when it discharged 130,000 tonnes on Thursday, according to a port source with knowledge of the matter. Another VLCC, the Olympic Light, has been floating near Qingdao after discharging part of its cargo on May 12, and may now be heading to the port to discharge the rest of its crude. The Mercury Hope, a third VLCC, has been looking for a home for its remaining cargo after it discharged part of it at Qingdao in late May. A fourth VLCC, Olympic Luck, planned to deliver crude to Qingdao in early May but turned away and transferred half of its cargo this week to a smaller tanker off Nagasaki, Japan, and then sailed towards South Korea. Now it has turned back and is heading towards Rizhao, still with oil onboard, according to shipping data on Eikon. The ship is scheduled to unload its cargo later on Friday, said Emma Li, an analyst with Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. China’s teapot refiners, of which there are now almost 40, were only given oil import permits from 2015. They now make up a fifth of the 9 million barrels per day (bpd) taken by the world’s largest crude importer. BP, which produces some 2.5 million bpd globally including equity production in Angola, was one of the first western firms to sell into China’s booming independent oil market. It regularly ships West African oil to Shandong, the teapot hub. While most western majors market oil from offices in Singapore, BP has a China-based team of four traders, including staff hired away from state oil firms Sinochem and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC). reut.rs/2tCSi4A Reporting by Chen Aizhu in BEIJING and Florence Tan in
