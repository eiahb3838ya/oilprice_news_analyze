2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is holding direct communications with members of Venezuela’s military urging them to abandon President Nicolas Maduro and is also preparing new sanctions aimed at increasing pressure on him, a senior White House official said. The Trump administration expects further military defections from Maduro’s side, the official told Reuters in an interview, despite only a few senior officers having done so since opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president last month, earning the recognition of the United States and dozens of other countries. “We believe these to be those first couple pebbles before we start really seeing bigger rocks rolling down the hill,” the official said this week, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We’re still having conversations with members of the former Maduro regime, with military members, although those conversations are very, very limited.” The official declined to provide details on the discussions or the level at which they are being held, and it was unclear whether such contacts could create cracks in the Venezuelan socialist leader’s support from the military, which is pivotal to his grip on power. With the Venezuelan military still apparently loyal to Maduro, a source in Washington close to the opposition expressed doubts whether the Trump administration has laid enough groundwork to spur a wider mutiny in the ranks where many officers are suspected of benefiting from corruption and drug trafficking. Members of the South American country’s security forces fear they or their families could be targeted by Maduro if they defect, so the U.S. would need to offer them something that could outweigh those concerns, said Eric Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas think tank in Washington. “It depends on what they’re offering,” Farnsworth said. “Are there incentives built into these contacts that will at least cause people to question their loyalty to the regime?” Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term as president was a sham and on Jan. 23 invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president, promising free and fair elections. The U.S. government also sees European allies as likely to do more to prevent Maduro from transferring or hiding Venezuela government assets held outside the country, the U.S. official said. Major European countries have joined the United States in backing Guaido but they have stopped short of the sweeping oil sanctions and financial measures that Washington has imposed. At the same time, the Trump administration is readying further possible sanctions on Venezuela, the official said. Previous rounds have targeted dozens of Venezuelan military and government officials, including Maduro himself, and last month finally hit the OPEC member’s vital oil sector. But the administration has stopped short of imposing so-called “secondary” sanctions, which would punish non-U.S. companies for doing business with the Venezuela government or the state oil monopoly PDVSA. The U.S. official said that Washington had every tool available to apply pressure on Maduro and his associates “to accept a legitimate democratic transition.” The U.S. government is also weighing possible sanctions on Cuban military and intelligence officials whom it says are helping Maduro remain in power, a second U.S. official and person familiar with the deliberations have told Reuters. Maduro’s government has accused Guaido, who has galvanized Venezuela’s opposition, of attempting to stage a U.S.-directed coup. General Francisco Yanez of the air force’s high command became the first active Venezuelan general to recognise Guaido, but he is one of about 2,000 generals. Venezuela’s chief military attache to the United States also said he was defecting late last month.       Guaido has actively courted members of the military with promises of amnesty and preferential legal treatment if they disavow Maduro and disobey his orders, and Washington this week raised the prospect of dropping sanctions on senior Venezuelan officers if they recognise Guaido. Maduro still has the support of the military high command, and now routinely appears in pre-recorded events at military bases where officers stand behind him and chant triumphal slogans such as “Loyal always, traitors never.” Reporting By Matt Spetalnick, Luc Cohen and Roberta Rampton; additional reporting by Brian Ellsworth in Caracas; Editing by Mary Milliken and Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-military/exclusive-u-s-in-direct-contact-with-venezuelan-military-urging-defections-source-idUKL1N2031SL,08 Feb 2019,"The United States is holding

2019-02-08,"ZAGREB, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Croatia will increase natural gas prices for households by an average of 6.9 percent from April due to a rise in wholesale prices on the international market, the national energy regulatory agency HERA said on Friday. HERA, in a statement announcing the average 6.9 percent price increase from April 1, also said the price from Jan. 1, 2020, would rise by an additional 0.3 percent because of higher distribution costs from that date. Energy and Environment Minister Tomislav Coric said there would be no more price changes until April 2020. “These changes mean a hike in monthly gas price for an average household by 20 kuna ($3.06). This (winter heating) season we haven’t had higher prices although the prices on the (wholesale) gas markets last year rose on average by 20 percent,” he said. Croatia currently covers some 40 percent of its gas needs from exploitation of its own fields. It annually consumes some 2.7 billion cubic metres of gas. It imports gas from Russia, but recently decided to construct a floating liquefied natural gas terminal in the northern Adriatic to diversify sources of gas imports. $1 = 6.5331 kuna

Output at the field will fall to 15.9 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year ending October 2020, the government said, which is 1.5 bcm lower than originally planned. The Dutch government last year said it would end production by 2030 and lower it as quickly as possible in coming years, as decades of extraction have led to a series of damaging earthquakes in the region. Demand for Groningen gas is falling as exports to Germany decline, while the Dutch increase purchases of nitrogen to mix with imported gas. Production in the field, operated by a Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil joint venture, is set to drop to 19.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) this year, down from a 2013 peak of 54 bcm.

The moves are the latest personnel changes at Gunvor, which became the biggest independent LNG trader last year after delivering about 11 million tonnes. Kalpesh Patel, based in Singapore, and Ksenia Alleyne, based in Geneva, will jointly run the LNG trading desk for the Swiss firm. Stephane Caudron, who has been the global head of LNG since 2009, will take on the role of global head of LNG business development out of Singapore. Gunvor went through major restructuring last year which included the expansion of its executive board, job losses across the company and a new natural gas trading desk in London. It had also flagged plans to close its Bahamas crude trading office in favour of its Houston base, but a company spokesman said on Friday that Gunvor no longer intends to close the Bahamas operation. The restructuring was also aimed at promoting a new generation at the Geneva-based firm which was founded in 2000. Some long-time Gunvor executives left, including the global head of crude Jose Orti who retired at the end of 2018. Stephane Dejenne then replaced Orti as the new global head of crude. Separately, Geneva-based SOCAR Trading, part of Azerbaijan’s state oil company SOCAR, has hired two LNG traders - Daniel Stephens and Francesca di Cesare - from Koch Supply & Trading, a spokesman said.

2019-02-08," (This Feb. 7 article has been corrected to show, in fourth paragraph, that a temperature rise of 2°C is equivalent to 3.6°F, not 35.6°F) By Gwladys Fouche OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion wealth fund will push the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose more data on greenhouse gases they emit and how they adapt to climate change during the coming annual general meeting season, a top fund official said. The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund invests the revenues of Norway’s oil and gas production and has stakes in some 9,000 companies across 72 countries. It was an early mover among international investors in trying to assess climate change risk, wanting to avoid investments in one sector negatively impacting another - so-called “externalities” - and hurting its overall portfolio. This year, it will make a fresh push on firms to explain how their business will be affected, and how they are adapting, to a world where temperatures may rise by 2 degrees Celsius (3.6°F). “What we would like to see more of is scenarios, including a two-degree scenario, and we want better disclosure of the assumptions for these scenarios,” Carine Smith Ihenacho, the fund’s chief corporate governance officer, told Reuters. “We want clear targets for CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases, including methane. And we want to see reporting of progress against the targets,” she added. “We would like to see it more disaggregated, meaning not for  the whole company, but more broken down, for instance regional or even on an asset level.” As part of its green push, the fund has been developing an in-house software, called Angle, that can take non-financial data, such as CO2 emissions, combine it with trading data and earnings data, and see how it will affect a company years ahead. That tool has informed divestments in some 30 companies in 2018, fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad told Reuters, helping show that these companies did not have a sustainable business model over the long-term. He did not name them. Presentation material showed two of the 30 divested companies were involved in palm oil; one in rubber; ten in coal-based power; and one in “CO2 intensity”.    The next step in the software’s development, first disclosed by Reuters in October [nL8N1X930R], is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves. “It is still in the works,” Slyngstad said. Smith Ihenacho said companies were generally better at reporting climate-related data, citing for instance banks and oil and gas companies as “quite good” examples.  But others, like power producers, were lagging. “There is still far to go for many companies to report at the level we would like to see,” she said. The fund itself “emitted” 107 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2018 via its ownership stakes — roughly twice the amount emitted by Norway in 2017 — according to its annual responsible investment report released on Thursday. In 2018, the fund voted against one or more resolutions put forward at 27.5 percent of AGMs it attended last year, roughly the same level as in 2017. The fund said it voted against the CEO also holding the position of board chairman at Amazon, Johnson & Johnson, Total, Procter & Gamble and Pfizer, among others. It also voted against executive pay proposals at JP Morgan Chase, Verizon, AstraZeneca and GlaxoSmithKline, among others.

En+ and aluminium giant Rusal, in which En+ owns a stake, were removed from Washington’s blacklist in January after tycoon Oleg Deripaska agreed to reduce his stake in En+ to 45 percent from 70 percent. “As far as I understand, in the long-term perspective VTB may consider exiting from this investment. Of course, these shares can not be sold back to a sanctioned body. But they (VTB) can place them on the market,” Barker said. VTB plans to gradually sell its stake in En+ in future, a banking source and a source close to the deal with the U.S. Treasury told Reuters. VTB would use proceeds from the sale to reduce En+’s debt to VTB, the second source added. VTB will also use En+’s dividend payments to reduce En+’s debt to the bank. VTB did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. Barker said VTB, Russia’s second largest lender, would not require permission from the U.S. Treasury to sell the stake but would have to notify it of the deal. En+’s new board of directors, which is dominated by independent members as part of the company’s sanctions-removal deal with the U.S. Treasury, will meet for the first time on Friday, Barker said. The meeting will take place in Vienna and will elect the head of the new committee that will, among other things, oversee sanctions compliance. The board remains committed to continuing the process of moving En+’s registered office from Jersey to Russia’s Kaliningrad region, and this process may be finalised in the nearest months, Barker added.

2019-02-08,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Global stocks fell for a third straight day on Friday, and were set for their first weekly loss in seven, as investors worried about a broadening global economic slowdown and the lack of any sign of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade row. Safe-haven government bonds benefited, with the German 10-year bund yield falling closer towards zero percent and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hitting its lowest point in a week. Weak earnings dragged on European stocks, with the pan-European STOXX 600 down 0.3 percent by early afternoon in London. Stock markets in Asia eased, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shedding over half a percent, retreating from a four-month peak touched the previous day. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.3 percent lower, putting it on course to break a six-week streak of gains. The European Commission on Thursday slashed its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking concern that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade frictions. The Bank of England said on Thursday that Britain faces its weakest economic growth in a decade this year, as uncertainty over Brexit mounts and the global economy slows. This week Australia’s central bank signalled monetary easing in the face of economic headwinds, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in indicating policy shifts. The Fed has all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, while the ECB also sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy this year. “If there was a single takeaway from the last few days it would appear to be this - ever since the Fed started to backtrack on its growth expectations for the U.S. economy, the global economic skies, to coin an aphorism from the recent World Bank report, have started to darken further,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. In a report last month titled ‘Darkening Skies’, the World Bank said global economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019, from 3 percent in 2018. Hewson added that the tone in markets on the day wasn’t helped by remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow that U.S.-China trade talks still had sizable differences to overcome. Trump himself said on Thursday he did not plan to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer are expected to kick off another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. “The trade issue is more in focus in the short term. Macro data over the last few weeks hasn’t given any reason to be more concerned about a recession than a month or two ago,” said Paul Harper, equity strategist at DNB. “The cycle is pretty mature now but it’s always pretty difficult to know how close to a recession you are when indications are not showing signs that it’s around the corner,” he added. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended its overnight decline to hit a one-week low of 2.638 percent.  The 20-year Japanese government bond yield dropped to a 27-month trough of 0.400 percent. The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.100 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission’s sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. The euro was on course for its biggest weekly loss in more than four months against the dollar, though traders seemed to be puzzled that it was finding support. The single currency was flat at $1.13370 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.1 percent higher. The Australian dollar was on course to end a bearish week firmly on the back foot, last trading down 0.3 percent at $0.7077. The Aussie slid sharply on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia stepped back from its long-standing tightening bias, saying the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The currency was headed for a weekly loss of 2.3 percent. In commodities, oil fell, pulled down by worries over a global economic slowdown, although OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela provided crude with some support. U.S. crude futures slipped over half a percent to $52.31 per barrel, extending losses after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous session. Brent crude was flat at $61.63 per barrel.

2019-02-08,"(Adds TransCanada statement, comments from Missouri government) By Rod Nickel and Devika  Krishna Kumar Feb 8 (Reuters) - An oil leak near St. Louis, Missouri likely originated from TransCanada Corp’s Keystone pipeline, the company said on Friday, with no projected restart timetable for the portion of the line that remains shut. The leak volume is estimated at 43 barrels of crude oil on land, according to Missouri’s Department of Natural Resources. The spill and subsequent shutdown of portions of Enbridge’s Platte pipeline and the bigger Keystone line raised fresh concerns about pipeline safety, and about the already constricted flow of Canadian oil to U.S. refineries. Crews were excavating a segment of the underground pipeline on Friday, TransCanada spokesman Terry Cunha said. He said there was no threat to public safety or the environment. The 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline is a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to U.S. refineries. The spill in rural St. Charles County, Missouri, on Wednesday led TransCanada to shut an arm of Keystone running between Steele City, Nebraska, and Patoka, Illinois. Brian Quinn, a spokesman for Missouri’s Natural Resources Department, said in an email that if Keystone is confirmed to be the leak’s source, it will remain closed until repairs are made. The exact quantity of oil released cannot be determined until excavation is complete and it’s unclear how long the release lasted, Quinn said. TransCanada told Keystone shippers on Thursday that it was declaring force majeure on shipments affected by the shutdown, according to a notice seen by Reuters. Force majeure is a declaration that unforeseeable circumstances prevented a party from fulfilling a contract. Canadian pipelines are congested because of expanding production in recent years, forcing the Alberta provincial government to order production cuts starting last month. Canadian heavy oil has attracted greater demand following U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s state oil company. Enbridge Inc said on Friday that it has begun a restart plan for its Platte pipeline and that the line could be fully operational by Saturday. The leak happened near the Mississippi River, at a spot upstream of the intake for St. Louis’s drinking water supply, said John Hickey, director of the Sierra Club’s Missouri chapter. The immediate concern is that leaked oil could contaminate farm wells, Hickey said. Keystone runs parallel to Enbridge’s Platte line and feeds refineries owned by BP Plc, Marathon Petroleum Corp and one jointly by Phillips 66 and Cenovus Energy. Wood River Refinery is undergoing planned maintenance, Phillips 66 spokeswoman Melissa Ory said. Marathon declined to comment and BP did not respond to a request for comment. The discount on Canadian heavy crude compared with U.S. light oil grew to as much as $11.50 per barrel on Friday from the previous day’s settlement of $10.25, according to Net Energy Exchange, indicating concerns about oil reaching buyers. TransCanada and Enbridge shares were down 2 percent and 3 percent respectively in Toronto.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - The United States is holding direct communications with members of Venezuela’s military urging them to abandon leader Nicolas Maduro and is also preparing new sanctions aimed at increasing pressure on him, a senior White House official said. The Trump administration expects further military defections from Maduro’s side, the official told Reuters in an interview, despite only a few senior officers having done so since opposition leader Juan Guaido proclaimed himself interim president last month, earning the recognition of the United States and dozens of other countries. “We believe these to be those first couple pebbles before we start really seeing bigger rocks rolling down the hill,” the official said this week, speaking on condition of anonymity. “We’re still having conversations with members of the former Maduro regime, with military members, although those conversations are very, very limited.” The official declined to provide details on the discussions or the level at which they are being held, and it was unclear whether such contacts could create cracks in the Venezuelan socialist leader’s support from the military, which is pivotal to his grip on power. With the Venezuelan military still apparently loyal to Maduro, a source in Washington close to the opposition expressed doubts whether the Trump administration has laid enough groundwork to spur a wider mutiny in the ranks where many officers are suspected of benefiting from corruption and drug trafficking. Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term as president was a sham and on Jan. 23 invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president, promising free and fair elections. The U.S. government also sees European allies as likely to do more to prevent Maduro from transferring or hiding Venezuela government assets held outside the country, the U.S. official said. Major European countries have joined the United States in backing Guaido but they have stopped short of the sweeping oil sanctions and financial measures that Washington has imposed. At the same time, the Trump administration is readying further possible sanctions on Venezuela, the official said. Previous rounds have targeted dozens of Venezuelan military and government officials, including Maduro himself, and last month finally hit the OPEC member’s vital oil sector. But the administration has stopped short of imposing so-called “secondary” sanctions, which would punish non-U.S. companies for doing business with the Venezuela government or the state oil monopoly PDVSA. The U.S. official said that Washington had every tool available to apply pressure on Maduro and his associates “to accept a legitimate democratic transition.” The U.S. government is also weighing possible sanctions on Cuban military and intelligence officials whom it says are helping Maduro remain in power, a second U.S. official and person familiar with the deliberations have told Reuters. Maduro’s government has accused Guaido, who has galvanized Venezuela’s opposition, of attempting to stage a U.S.-directed coup. General Francisco Yanez of the air force’s high command became the first active Venezuelan general to recognize Guaido, but he is one of about 2,000 generals. Venezuela’s chief military attache to the United States also said he was defecting late last month. Guaido has actively courted members of the military with promises of amnesty and preferential legal treatment if they disavow Maduro and disobey his orders, and Washington this week raised the prospect of dropping sanctions on senior Venezuelan officers if they recognize Guaido.

2019-02-08,"(Adds rig count in Permian) Feb 8 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week increased the number of oil rigs operating for the second time in three weeks after oil prices soared over 18 percent in January. Companies added 7 oil rigs in the week to Feb. 8, bringing the total count to 854, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still higher than a year ago when 791 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. In 2019, however, some drillers have said they plan to remove rigs due in part to forecasts for lower crude prices than last year. In the Permian basin in West Texas and eastern New Mexico where more than half the U.S. oil rigs are located, active units fell by three this week to 478, their lowest level since July. The Permian is the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Liberty Oilfield Services Inc this week estimated roughly 20 percent of the hydraulic fracturing fleets that were active in mid-2018 have now been idled or are being idled. U.S. crude futures were trading slightly under $53 a barrel on Friday, down about 5 percent for the week on worries of a global economic slowdown. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $54 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and $55 for calendar 2020. EIA projected West Texas Intermediate WTC- spot crude would average $54.19 in 2019 and $60.76 in 2020, down from an average of $65.06 in 2018. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said this week that early indications from the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks point to a 1 percent increase in capital expenditures for drilling and completions in 2019. Cowen noted larger spenders, like BP Plc and Chevron Corp, appear to be more resilient and have spending up year-over-year, while smaller, gas-exposed operators are generally down. In total, Cowen said those E&P companies spent about $88.7 billion in 2018. There were 1,049 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020.

2019-02-08,"(Adds analyst quotes, price reaction, data on wheat, soy, corn) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - U.S. soybean supplies as of Dec. 1 were the biggest on record as demand for the oilseed fizzled amid a trade war between the United States and China, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Friday. USDA also said that farmers seeded the smallest winter wheat area - 31.290 million acres - since 1909. An abundance of cheaper supplies around the globe has made U.S. wheat less desirable to overseas buyers in recent years. Soy supplies ballooned even though the government trimmed its estimate of the U.S. crop harvested last fall to 4.544 billion bushels from its previous forecast of 4.600 billion bushels. Soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 stood at 3.736 billion bushels. That compares with 3.161 billion bushels a year earlier, which had been the record. Analysts had expected soybean stocks of 3.743 billion bushels, according to the average of estimates in a Reuters poll. The reduction to the soybean harvest caused USDA to lower its forecast for 2018-19 U.S. ending stocks by 45 million bushels to 910 million bushels, which would still be the biggest on record. USDA also lowered its soybean export forecast by 25 million bushels, to 1.875 billion. “For soybeans, this was really just a punt,” said Ted Seifried, chief market strategist for Chicago-based Zaner Ag Hedge. “We’re right back in the position of it all depends on what happens with the trade deal.” Corn stocks as of Dec. 1 fell to 11.952 billion bushels from 12.567 billion bushels a year earlier, below the average forecast for 12.092 billion. The U.S. corn crop harvested last fall was cut to 14.420 billion bushels, based on a yield of 176.4 bushels per acre. That compares with the government’s previous estimate of 14.626 billion bushels on a yield of 178.9 bushels per acre. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures, which had been trading in positive territory before the report was released, briefly spiked to their highest since Jan. 23 before turning lower. Soybean futures showed little reaction to the report. “We’re right to be back to watching progress on trade talks and South American weather,” said Terry Reilly, senior commodities analyst with Futures International in Chicago. Dec. 1 wheat stocks were 1.999 billion bushels, up from the year-earlier figure of 1.873 billion bushels. Analysts had expected wheat stocks of 1.957 billion bushels.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union nations backed a plan to regulate Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline on Friday, a move that will likely slow but not rule out its construction. The long-stalled agreement comes after a last-ditch German and French push to amend the draft and give Berlin a greater say in how to ensure the pipeline to carry Russian gas to Europe under the Baltic Sea complies with EU law. Chancellor Angela Merkel hailed the vote as an example of Berlin’s close ties with Paris after the two major European powers, which both have firms invested in the project, were publicly at odds ahead of the EU meeting. Nord Stream 2 has divided the EU, with German opposition to the new draft rules stalling discussions since it was proposed by the EU executive in November 2017. Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries see the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline, which is already under construction, as increasing EU reliance on Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritize the economic benefits. EU capitals overcame differences on Friday over shared geopolitical concerns that the pipeline would deprive Ukraine of transit fees that are a lifeline of its economy by doubling the amount of gas that could be pumped under the Baltic Sea. Such worries have driven fierce U.S. lobbying against the Russian project. A French official rejected suggestions that Washington’s threat to sanction the project broke the EU logjam. “We don’t make decisions based on U.S. bravado,” the official said. France had long raised concerns in private about the pipeline, not wanting to be seen as supporting the U.S. stance, and French President Emmanuel Macron discussed it at least four times with Merkel, said another source familiar with the issue. The draft law will likely require a change in business model for the project, led by Russian state energy firm Gazprom in partnership with five Western firms - Germany’s Uniper and BASF’s Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch firm Shell, Austria’s OMV and France’s Engie. It calls for all import pipelines to meet EU energy market rules by not being directly owned by gas suppliers; applying non-discriminatory tariffs and transparent reporting; and allowing at least 10 percent of capacity to be made available to third parties. Berlin worked overnight with Paris to amend the proposed bill when it became clear that it had lost its blocking minority among the 28 nations. The last-minute changes give it greater say because the pipeline would connect with the European gas grid in Germany. EU sources say Berlin may now seek an exemption from the bloc’s energy rules, or it may cut a deal with Moscow over how the pipeline is operated, subject to review by the EU executive. The details of the proposal may still shift when the EU’s three lawmaking institutions meet next week to agree the final rules. If adopted, EU diplomats say the rules will not stop the pipeline but are likely to make its completion more costly and lengthy. The pipeline plan has become increasingly controversial since Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014. In an effort to address concerns, Merkel has insisted that gas volumes must continue via Ukraine - the traditional route for supplies that make up over a third of the EU’s gas needs. So far, EU-mediated talks between Russia and Ukraine have failed to agree the terms of such transits before their current contract expires by year’s end. “Russia has been in wait-and-see mode, but this compromise gives the European Commission major leverage,” said one of the sources. Any delay to Gazprom’s push to complete construction of Nord Stream 2 in 2019 could weaken Moscow’s hand in those negotiations. Western firms invested in the project have so far each financed 600 million euros ($681.00 million) until year’s end in what they say is a sign of faith that it will be continued, sources familiar with the matter said. “It would be fatal, if a fully approved billion-euro project, in which billions have been invested, could suddenly no longer be carried out,” OMV CEO Rainer Seele said earlier this week. “That wouldn’t necessarily strengthen investor confidence in Europe.” EU imports of Russian gas - tmsnrt.rs/2nz1ySg Reporting by Peter Maushagena and Alissa de Carbonnel in Brussels; Additional reporting by Kristi Knolle in Vienna, Gabriela Bacynska in Brussels, Jean-Baptiste Vey in Paris and Joseph Nasr in Berlin; Editing by Jan Harvey and Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-gazprom-nordstream/update-3-eu-nations-back-rules-that-may-stall-russias-nord-stream-2-pipeline-idUKL5N2035W8,08 Feb 2019,"European Union nations backed a

2019-02-08,"(Reuters) - U.S. refiner Phillips 66 posted a better-than-expected profit on Friday as access to low-cost crude oil from U.S. shale basins and Canada boosted its refining margins. Tight pipeline capacity in the U.S. shale basins and Canada has pulled down the price of crude oil from those regions, benefiting Phillips 66 as well as its rivals. The refiner’s utilization rate, the percentage of the total equipment or refinery involved in processing crude, touched 99 percent, while refining margins jumped 84 percent to $16.53 per barrel of oil, over the same period a year earlier. “The system ran well and capture rates were well above our forecast, retail clearly witnessed the benefit of sticky margins in the face of collapsing crude prices,” Piper Jaffray analyst Blake Fernandez said in a note. The increase in fourth-quarter refining results was largely driven by the company’s central and Gulf Coast regions, Phillips 66 said. And each of the four refining regions outperformed the margin estimates of energy-sector investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. The central refining region’s margin was at a record high of $31/bbl, the investment bank added in a note. The Houston, Texas-based company, which sells its fuel under different brand names including Conoco, 76 and JET, said earnings from its marketing and specialties business surged more than three-fold to $589 million. Phillips 66, which also reported higher earnings in its midstream and chemicals units, said last week that it is confident about securing alternative sources of oil, after U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, took away about 500,000 barrels per day of oil from the U.S. market.  Larger rival Marathon Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it would replace Venezuelan crude with imports from Middle East and Latin America. On an adjusted basis, Phillips 66’s profit rose to $2.26 billion, or $4.87 per share, in the quarter, from $548 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting the company to post a profit of $3.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s total revenue and other income fell nearly 1 percent to $29.84 billion.  Shares of Phillips 66 edged down 0.53 percent to $92.25, while Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1 percent.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.86 percent, and was set to fall this week following six consecutive weekly increases. Investors were digesting economic and trade developments from a day earlier, when the European Commission sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone growth this year and next, while President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. Thursday’s trade developments “took off the table what the market was probably starting to price in, which was a resolution by March 1,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. “It just adds to the fact that investors want some of these trade tensions off the front pages and it doesn’t look like we are going to get that,” Saglimbene said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 252.6 points, or 1 percent, to 24,916.93, the S&P 500 lost 20.9 points, or 0.77 percent, to 2,685.15 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 46.75 points, or 0.64 percent, to 7,241.60. “Slower global growth, trade tensions and the fact that we have moved an incredible amount off of the December lows probably means that stocks were a little bit overbought and we may be trading in a range for a little while,” Saglimbene said. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.71 percent. The dollar edged higher against a basket of currencies, keeping it on track for its strongest weekly gain in six months, as traders piled into the greenback in a safe-haven move on worries about a weakening global economy. The dollar index rose 0.1 percent, with the euro down 0.11 percent to $1.1327. “The rally that propelled the dollar broadly higher last year has enjoyed renewed life with U.S. growth remaining solid while peers abroad lose momentum,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. U.S. Treasury yields fell for a fourth straight session. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.6321 percent, from 2.654 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices inched up but were heading for a weekly loss. Worries about a global economic slowdown weighed while OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela provided crude with some support. U.S. crude rose 0.15 percent to $52.72 per barrel and Brent was last at $61.77, up 0.23 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York and Ritvik

German prosecutors last year fined Volkswagen 1 billion euros and its sister brand Audi 800 million euros for management oversight lapses which allowed polluting cars to hit the road.   German weekly magazine Der Spiegel reported on Friday that Volkswagen was reviewing whether to seek damages of up to 1 billion euros from Bosch. Volkswagen declined to comment on the report.  Bosch said: “Relationships with customers are kept confidential. The automaker-supplier relationship between Bosch and Volkswagen goes back over decades. We cannot imagine such an action against Bosch.”     ($1 = 0.8828 euros) Reporting by Edward Taylor; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-bosch/german-prosecutors-mull-dieselgate-fine-for-auto-supplier-bosch-idUKL5N20358U,08 Feb 2019,"Prosecutors in the German city

2019-02-08,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plan to split struggling state power utility Eskom is a positive show of intent to investors, although a lack of detail has raised concerns that change will take years to deliver. Eskom, which produces more than 90 percent of South Africa’s electricity and employs 48,000 people, is a lynchpin of Africa’s most developed economy but has racked up debts of $31 billion. Ramaphosa said on Thursday that to avert an economic crisis, Eskom’s generation, transmission and distribution would become separate entities under an Eskom holding company, leaving its inefficient and unwieldy monopoly intact. Ahead of a May parliamentary election, Ramaphosa also said another Eskom bailout would be laid out in this month’s budget. What markets were hoping for was the creation of three independent companies that could more easily cut costs, raise finance and be partially privatized in the future. “The risk is very little will change in this structure,” Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex, said. “The intention may well be to have this as a first step and then separate out after that from the umbrella. However, we think the market underestimates how complex this separation process will be,” he added, forecasting it could take two years. Max Wolman, investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds Eskom debt, said it was debatable whether the restructuring would happen soon. Most Eskom dollar-denominated bonds eased on Friday, with the 2025 bond slipping 1 cent to trade at 97.59 cents in the dollar, its lowest level in over a week.  The bonds had chalked up stellar gains in previous weeks, with many seeing their best monthly gains on record, as expectations built of a major restructuring. (Graphic - Dollar Bonds: South Africa & Eskom - tmsnrt.rs/2BrlkYV) Even if Ramaphosa intends eventually to create independent units that could be partly sold off, he will face fierce resistance from left-wing elements of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and powerful trade unions. The ANC is expected to win May’s election but Ramaphosa will need the support of a united ruling party and union allies if he is to deliver the decisive victory that would give him a mandate to push through unpopular, but much-needed, reforms. The two largest unions at Eskom, who say they account for half of the utility’s workforce, said on Friday they would fight Ramaphosa’s plan, with one calling it a “war”. In the short term, Ramaphosa will need to raise Eskom’s revenues and cut its debt if he is to delay inevitable job cuts until after the election. That means tariff increases and bailouts that are toxic with voters. “I agree with Mr. President that we need drastic action, but we can’t be paying for them screwing up all the time,” said Thokozane, a taxi driver in Johannesburg. “If they have to cut jobs, it is sad, but we can’t go on year after year with these bailouts and tariffs.” Ramaphosa is also trying to hold together the ANC to avoid the fate of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma, whom he ousted a year ago in a bitter internal battle. The anti-apartheid liberation movement remains deeply divided between socialist and reformist elements, and Ramaphosa faces resistance from a powerful pro-Zuma faction. A task team formed by Ramaphosa to create a reform program for Eskom recommended more market-friendly policies than were announced, however a backlash from left-wing members of his cabinet saw the plans diluted, an ANC source said. “Ramaphosa’s opponents will be obstructing him every step of the way with his plan for Eskom,” said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. “This is yet another proxy war involving entrenched interests linked to the Zuma faction in the ANC.” It is likely Ramaphosa will avoid major job cuts at Eskom until after the election, while the details of restructuring could be delayed so as not to rile allies, analysts say. But with Eskom expected to lose more than $1 billion a year this year and next, there is only so long Ramaphosa can delay reforms without risking economic malaise, investor departure and credit rating downgrades. “The Eskom issue needs a clear resolution, and we did not get that yesterday,” said Jonas David, strategist at Swiss bank UBS. “Eskom is a big concern for us.” Reporting by Alexander Winning and Joe Brock; Additional reporting and graphic by Karin Strohecker in London; Editing by Dale Hudson and Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/safrica-eskom/analysis-ramaphosa-plan-to-fix-south-africas-eskom-faces-roadblocks-idUKL5N2034Z4,08 Feb 2019,"* Parliamentary election to be held on May 8

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - “Once upon a time ...” Storytelling is one of the most fundamental human impulses. Humans have been telling stories for thousands of years as a means of entertainment but more importantly to help them make sense of the world around them and to transmit that understanding to others. Narratives are a way of organising a series of actions or events to understand the process of cause and effect, helping make sense of the past and anticipate the future. “Anthropologists, who conduct research on the behaviour of diverse tribes around the world, have observed a universal that people use narrative to explain how things came to be and to tell stories. “Visitors to any human society will observe people facing each other, sitting around the television, or the campfire, together and vocalising, and more recently tweeting, stories,” according to economist Robert Shiller. “It seems the human mind strives to reach enduring understanding of events by forming them into a narrative that is imbedded in social interactions” (“Narrative economics”, Shiller, 2017). Or according to the Pixar rules of storytelling, compiled by Emma Coates, the ideal narrative runs: “Once upon a time there was … , Every day …. , One day … , Because of that … , Because of that … , Until finally …” (“Pixar tips”, Washington Post, June 25, 2012). The narrative impulse is hard-wired into our brains and is present in every creation myth, fairy-tale, history book, academic research paper, newspaper, political rally and corporate earnings call. Satisfying stories obey a few simple rules: The problem with the campfire model (mono-causal, linear, proportionate, moral and determinant) is that it fails to explain many important real-world processes (which are non-linear/circular, exponential, amoral and random). Financial market movements, business cycles, oil cycles and even the rise and fall of companies, corporate leaders and politicians – none of them can be properly explained and predicted by the traditional narrative model. In these real examples, processes are multi-causal, complex, do not always produce virtuous winners, and often do not lead to clear outcomes and predictions. Descriptions of real-world processes often fail as satisfying stories – while emotionally pleasing stories often fail to explain and predict the real world properly. Politicians, business leaders, campaigners and opinion formers often prefer simpler narratives that provide a more satisfying explanation, stir an emotional response and serve as a call to action. The narratives used to frame and explain an issue can have a powerful impact on how businesses, employees, customers and voters respond and the choices they make (sometimes unconsciously). Storytelling can influence the real world as much as the other way around, so narratives can be instruments of power, whether they are right or wrong. But forecasters and analysts should prefer accurate descriptions of real processes, for all their limits of complexity and indeterminacy. The limits of predicting outcomes from circular and complex processes with a significant random element mean forecasts should normally be expressed as scenarios with an associated probability distribution. Even then, many forecasts are hyper-sensitive to small changes in the starting point or assumptions about the causation process, so the probability distribution itself is often highly unstable or uncertain. Forecasters should always be humble about their ability to make accurate predictions, especially far into the future or when many variables are changing simultaneously. Often the most useful part of forecasting is the discipline of having to think in a rigorous way, identifying and analysing all the potential variables in play, getting a better sense of the range of uncertainty. Once the key variables have been identified, some risks can be eliminated, transformed, insured or managed, while others simply have to be borne. Campfire storytellers are judged by the emotional satisfaction their narratives provide; forecasters and analysts should expect to be judged by a different standard. Acknowledging and embracing uncertainty is not a sign of failure or lack of courage but an honest admission of the limits of forecasting and of the complex way in which processes evolve.

2019-02-08,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Igor Sechin, head of Russian oil giant Rosneft and one of Vladimir Putin’s closest allies, has written to the Russian president saying Moscow’s deal with OPEC to cut oil output is a strategic threat and plays into the hands of the United States. The letter did not say whether the agreement in place since 2017 between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other large oil producers led by Russia to cut output should be extended or not. But according to two well-placed industry sources, the letter was a clear signal to other senior Russian officials involved in energy policy that Sechin wants the deal to come to an end. There is no guarantee Putin will back Sechin’s view because the president sees the pact with OPEC as part of a much bigger puzzle involving dialogue with OPEC’s leader Saudi Arabia over Syria and other geopolitical issues. “The letter is a threat to the deal extension. But anyway, Putin is the ultimate decision maker,” one of the sources said. Reuters has seen a copy of the letter with no date or header. A government source said it was sent at the end of December. The so-called OPEC+ deal has helped oil prices double to more than $60 per barrel. It has been extended several times and, under the latest deal, participants are cutting output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) until the end of June. OPEC and its allies will meet on April 17-18 in Vienna to review the pact. Should Russia abandon the deal, it would result in a steep oil price crash or force Saudi Arabia to carry most of the burden of cutting output to continue propping up global crude prices. Riyadh has said it will not do this alone. A price crash would deal a severe blow to U.S. oil firms as they operate fields where it is more expensive to extract oil, but would benefit the broader U.S. economy. The United States, which overtook Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest oil producer last year, is not participating in the output cuts. U.S. crude oil output is expected to rise to a record of more than 12 million bpd this year and climb to nearly 13 million bpd next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday. Sechin has been the only Russian official to consistently oppose the OPEC deal since the Kremlin endorsed the plan, saying it has allowed U.S. clout to rise significantly. “The participants of the OPEC+ agreement have actually created a preferential advantage for the USA - that sees raising its own market share and the seizure of target markets as its primary task - which has become a strategic threat to Russia’s oil industry development,” the letter seen by Reuters says. “The key strategic challenge which the domestic oil industry is faced with today is the further decline in Russia’s market share, despite the availability of quality recoverable oil reserves, necessary infrastructure and personnel,” it said. Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, has been the main contributor to the country’s share of cuts. Rosneft has signaled that its oil production may increase by 3 percent to 4.5 percent this year, subject to OPEC agreements. Sechin, who worked closely with Putin in the mayor’s office of St. Petersburg in the 1990s, has long been skeptical of OPEC’s ability to regulate oil markets and has opposed output cuts before. Former Saudi Energy Minister Ali al-Naimi said in his 2016 book “Out of the Desert” that Sechin told him in a meeting with several oil ministers in Vienna in 2014 that Russia was not in a position to cut production. In the book, Naimi wrote that he then gathered his papers and said, “so I think the meeting is over”. The first attempts to forge an OPEC-Russia output deal fell through that year. It took another two years of talks and Saudi Arabia replacing its oil minister to clinch a deal. Sechin’s letter also reflects growing tension within Russia’s government over the oil production agreement. The head of Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev, one of the main architects of Russia’s agreement with OPEC, told Reuters in January that he saw no reason to abandon the pact, despite a steep rise in U.S. output.  Dmitriev said U.S. oil output would decline only if prices fell to $40 per barrel but if that happened it would also cause major damage to the Russian economy, which relies on oil and gas exports for more than half its budget revenues.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Developers have lost a court appeal to build a coal mine in Australia’s Hunter Valley over its potentially “dire” environmental impact, after the country’s first legal review of a coal mine project to hear evidence from a climate scientist. In the landmark ruling, Justice Brian Preston denied the appeal on the Rocky Hill project in New South Wales state, citing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as uncertain economic benefits and adverse social and visual impacts. Australia is the world’s biggest coal exporter and the fuel is its largest resources earner. Canberra last year scrapped plans for a national energy policy that aimed to cut carbon emissions as well as power prices in part due to opposition from coal supporters within its ranks. In his ruling, the judge found that mine and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would add to the global total “at a time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions.” “In short, an open cut coal mine in this part of the Gloucester valley would be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Preston found. “These dire consequences should be avoided.” At the end of January the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development made waves in Australia when it said the country needed to cut emissions more sharply to meet its Paris Climate accord target as the country remained heavily dependent on coal-fired power. But on Thursday a study published earlier on Friday by Australian National University (ANU) researchers found the country is adopting renewable energy faster per capita than the rest of the world. Rapid recent growth in wind and solar power has left it on track to meet Paris carbon emissions reductions targets well before 2030, it found. The Rocky Hill project is being developed by privately held Gloucester Resources, a unit of GRL Holdings Pty Ltd. Representatives of Gloucester Resources did not immediately respond to email and telephone requests for comment. Mining services firm LDO Group, listed as a stakeholder in the project, said that the company had “no comment to make”. GRL has the right to appeal to the New South Wales surpreme court. Environmental campaigners welcomed the court ruling. The chief executive of Australia’s Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, said Australia “must continue to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy with storage”. “The science says so, and now the law does too,” she said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"(Repeats Feb. 7 column with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)) * Cyclical indicators: tmsnrt.rs/2ULs8I8 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Policymakers and analysts who claim the outlook is “unusually uncertain” are normally overstating their own forecasting problem and understating the difficulties faced by their predecessors. The outlook always looks more certain in retrospect, when the outcome is known, and a causal chain can be constructed that makes it appear nearly inevitable, than it does in prospect, when multiple pathways look possible. Unusually uncertain is often a fancy way of saying “I don’t know” and concealing the limits of forecasting, which is often much less reliable than policymakers and analysts would like their audience to believe. But there are times when it is genuinely more difficult to predict what will happen in future, especially when systems approach turning points or inflection points. I am normally sceptical when policymakers and analysts say the outlook is unusually uncertain, but at the moment they may actually be justified in making that claim, with the economy delicately poised between moderation and recession, and hyper-sensitive to even small shocks that could nudge it towards either eventuality. In both the economy and the oil market, forecast accuracy deteriorates around cyclical turning points, which is why almost all forecasters missed the onset of the last recession in 2007 or the collapse in oil prices in 2008. For the same reason, most forecasters missed the slump in oil prices in the middle of 2014, the recovery in oil prices from early 2016, or the renewed fall in prices during late 2018. “The largest errors in forecasts of real and nominal GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate, are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks,” wrote business cycle expert Victor Zarnowitz. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense that they miss the turns and underestimate recessions and recoveries.” “Leading indicators rarely miss major turns in economic activity, but they now and then err in giving false signals of recession or (less often) recovery” (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting”, Zarnowitz, 1992). However, even leading indicators may struggle to discriminate between a true turning point (where the cycle changes direction) and an inflection point (where the cycle continues in same direction but with a change of rate). In the vicinity of a turning point or an inflection, the economy and the oil market can become very sensitive to even small changes in conditions and sentiment, which contributes to the increased forecasting difficulty. The global economy and the oil market both now show clear signs of a slowdown. Every leading indicator tells the same story of a sharp loss of momentum in the second half of 2018 after strong growth in 2017. But all those indicators for the economy and the oil market are in a range that could be consistent with either an imminent recession or a renewed acceleration after a period of sluggish growth. With every indicator poised between a true turning point in the cycle or simply an inflection in the growth rate, there is no way to discriminate in advance (tmsnrt.rs/2ULs8I8). The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is one commonly employed leading indicator for predicting recessions in the United States. Based on the current shape of the yield curve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates there is a 24 percent probability the U.S. economy will be in recession in January 2020. The forecast probability of recession has more than doubled over the last year, and risen six times over the last two years, and is now unusually elevated. But the forecast probability is still well below the 40 percent hit in the run up to the recessions of 2007-2009, 2001, 1981-82 or 1980. The probability looks more like the elevated risk in 1990 (which turned into a recession) or 1996 and 1999 (which did not). Based on the yield curve, it is impossible to say whether the U.S. economy is heading for an end-of-cycle turning point or a temporary in-cycle slowdown. The U.S. equity market is similarly hovering uncertainly between an intra-cycle slowdown and an end-of-cycle turning point. The S&P 500 equity index is now down slightly over the last 12 months after strong year-on-year gains during 2017 and most of 2018. The flattening of equity prices is certainly consistent with a slowdown in the economic and corporate earnings outlook but is not yet at levels that preceded the recessions of 1990, 2001 or 2007. U.S. manufacturing surveys show a loss of momentum at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019, a warning sign, but the composite activity indicators are still well below the levels that preceded the last three recessions. Even the much-ballyhooed U.S. job market indicators are ambiguous. Non-farm employment is rising at around 1.8 percent per year, faster than the 1.5 percent reported 12 months earlier, but fairly slow compared with earlier expansions. If the U.S. economy is performing relatively well, most of the rest of the global economy is performing relatively poorly, but not so badly that we can confidently predicted a recession rather than a slowdown. China’s official purchasing managers’ index shows manufacturing activity has been losing momentum for the last year and actually contracted in December and January, but only slightly. Globally, purchasing managers’ indicators show new export orders have been losing momentum since the start of 2018 and have now fallen for five months in a row. But the declines in orders have been relatively small, so far, and could be consistent with an in-cycle slowdown such as 2015-2016 or 2011-2012 rather than a full recession like 2007-2009 or 2001. Air freight indicators also point to flat-lining or falling volumes in 2018 after strong growth in 2016 and 2017, but do not yet show the large falls associated with the last two recessions. Like the rest of the economy, the oil market appears to be poised uncertainly between the probability of a recession-induced supply surplus or a recovery-driven deficit. OPEC’s aggressive output cuts, coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, have offset the feared slowdown in oil consumption growth and eliminated much of the incipient surplus in 2019. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has returned close to flat, after collapsing from backwardation into contango during the fourth quarter, suggesting traders currently see the oil market close to balance this year. Brent spreads cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between periods of over- and under-supply; they do not usually stay close to flat for very long. But the outlook is poised between fears about a recession-driven slowdown in consumption and concerns about supply losses from Iran and Venezuela as well as OPEC cuts and a possible slowdown in U.S. shale growth. The global economic outlook is the single biggest source of uncertainty for the oil market, and until that source of uncertainty is resolved or at least reduced, the oil outlook remains equally unclear.

2019-02-08,"* U.S.-China trade disputes weigh on economic growth outlook * Saudi Arabia crude output down 400,000 bpd in Jan -OPEC sources By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Oil markets were cautious early on Friday, held back by concerns over a global economic slowdown but supported by supply cuts led by producer club OPEC and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.61 per barrel at 0046 GMT, down 3 cents from their last settlement. WTI dropped by around 2.5 percent the previous session. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Weighing on financial markets, including crude oil futures, were concerns that trade disputes between the United States and China would remain unresolved, denting global economic growth prospects. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal. If there is no agreement between the world’s two biggest economies, Trump has threatened to increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Another round of talks is scheduled for next week in Beijing. “Crude prices returned to the lows of the week as slower growth prospects...could signal a return (of reasons) for inventories to rise,” said Edward Moya, market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda. Despite this, traders said crude prices were prevented from falling much further by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which were introduced late last year and are aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. As part of these cuts, Saudi Arabia - the world’s biggest crude oil exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC - cut its crude output in January by about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.24 million bpd, according to OPEC sources. Another risk to oil supply comes from Venezuela after the implementation of U.S. sanctions against the OPEC-member’s petroleum industry in late January. Analysts expect this move to knock out 300,000-500,000 bpd of exports. Yet for the time being, the sanctions impact on international oil markets was limited. “The (Venezuela) disruption overall seems manageable both for the U.S. and the global market,” said Norbert Rücker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “The oil market sits on a comfortable cushion of supply.” (Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-squeezed-by-economy-concerns-but-opec-output-cuts-provide-support-idUKL3N203057,08 Feb 2019,"* Saudi Arabia crude output down 400,000 bpd in Jan -OPEC

Safe-haven government bonds benefited in the face of growing anxiety over the global outlook, with German long-term debt yields falling to their lowest in over two years. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.3 percent, easing back from a four-month peak touched the previous day. The index stood little changed on the week. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 percent. The European Commission on Thursday sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking fears of a global slowdown spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grappled with trade frictions. Adding to the gloomy mood, President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. That rattled investors hoping for a resolution to the months-long trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies. Wall Street shares slumped in response overnight, with the Dow falling 0.9 percent to pull back from a two-month peak scaled midweek on upbeat corporate results. “With many of the corporate earnings out of the way, equities appeared ready for a correction after their recent highs,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “Equities will face further hurdles next week, as (U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven) Mnuchin and (Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer will be visiting China. Brexit talks are also in focus.” Mnuchin and Lighthizer are expected to engage in another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood near a six-day low of 2.65 percent plumbed overnight, when it sank more than 4 basis points amid the broader risk aversion in markets. The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.105 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission’s sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. The euro sagged under the weight of declining German bund yields. The single currency was down 0.2 percent at $1.1339 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss. The dollar was little changed at 109.820 yen, nudged off a high of 110.09 reached the previous day. The yen tends to attract demand in times of political tensions and market volatility due to its perceived safe-haven status. Yet, the U.S. currency was still headed for a small gain of 0.3 percent against the yen this week. In commodities, U.S. crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $52.48 per barrel, extending losses after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous session. Oil fell on Thursday as the market was hurt by concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year.

2019-02-08,"* Ramaphosa pledges to split hapless state utility * Lack of detail raises market concerns * Powerful unions, parts of ANC oppose reforms * Investors, ratings agencies want concrete change * Parliamentary election to be held on May 8 By Alexander Winning and Joe Brock JOHANNESBURG, Feb 8 (Reuters) - South African President Cyril Ramaphosa’s plan to split struggling state power utility Eskom is a positive show of intent to investors but a lack of detail has raised market concerns that concrete change will take years to deliver. Eskom, which produces over 90 percent of South Africa’s electricity and employs 48,000 people, is a lynchpin of Africa’s most developed economy but is drowning in $31 billion of debt. Facing a parliamentary election on May 8, Ramaphosa said on Thursday that to avert an economic crisis, Eskom’s generation, transmission and distribution businesses would become separate entities. Crucially, Ramaphosa added that the newly created units would remain under an Eskom holding company, meaning its inefficient and unwieldy monopoly would remain. He also said another Eskom bailout would be laid out in the budget later this month. What markets were hoping for was the creation of three independent companies that could more easily cut costs, raise finance and be partially privatised in the future. Most Eskom dollar-denominated bonds eased very slightly on Friday, with the 2028 bond softening 0.1 cent to trade at 103.22 cents in the dollar. However, Eskom’s bonds had chalked up stellar gains in previous weeks, with many issues seeing their best monthly gains on record. “The risk is very little will change in this structure,” said Peter Attard Montalto, head of capital markets research at Intellidex. “The intention may well be to have this as a first step and then separate out after that from the umbrella. However, we think the market underestimates how complex this separation process will be,” he added, forecasting it could take two years. Even if Ramaphosa intends eventually to create independent units that could be partly sold off, he will face fierce resistance from left-wing elements of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and powerful trade unions. The ANC is expected to win May’s election but Ramaphosa will need the support of a united ruling party and union allies if he is to deliver the decisive victory that would give him a mandate to push through unpopular, but much-needed, reforms. The two largest unions at Eskom, who say they account for half of the utility’s workforce, said on Friday they would fight Ramaphosa’s plan, with one calling it a “war”. In the short term, Ramaphosa will need to raise Eskom’s revenues and cut its debt if he is to delay inevitable job cuts until after the election. That means tariff increases and bailouts that are toxic with voters. “I agree with Mr. President that we need drastic action, but we can’t be paying for them screwing up all the time,” said Thokozane, a taxi driver in Johannesburg. “If they have to cut jobs, it is sad, but we can’t go on year after year with these bailouts and tariffs.” Ramaphosa is also trying to hold together the ANC to avoid the fate of his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma, whom he ousted a year ago in a bitter internal battle. The anti-apartheid liberation movement remains deeply divided between socialist and reformist elements, and Ramaphosa faces resistance from a powerful pro-Zuma faction. A task team formed by Ramaphosa to create a reform programme for Eskom recommended more market-friendly policies than were announced, however a backlash from left-wing members of his cabinet saw the plans diluted, an ANC source said. “Ramaphosa’s opponents will be obstructing him every step of the way with his plan for Eskom,” said Darias Jonker, director for Africa at Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. “This is yet another proxy war involving entrenched interests linked to the Zuma faction in the ANC.” It is likely Ramaphosa will avoid major job cuts at Eskom until after the election, while the details of restructuring could be delayed so as not to rile allies, analysts say. But with Eskom expected to lose more than $1 billion a year this year and next, there is only so long Ramaphosa can delay reforms without risking economic malaise, investor departure and credit rating downgrades. “The Eskom issue needs a clear resolution, and we did not get that yesterday,” said Jonas David, strategist at Swiss bank UBS. “Eskom is a big concern for us.” Reporting by Alexander Winning and Joe Brock; Additional

2019-02-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell widened its lead over Exxon Mobil as king of cash among the world’s top oil and gas companies last year but its U.S. rival could catch up with its investment drive in new production. The five leading firms, known as oil majors, more than tripled profits and doubled cash generation since 2016 as deep cost cutting bore fruit after an industry slump. Unlike previous cycles, most executives have promised in the past week to stay thrifty, with memories of the 2016 oil price plunge below $30 a barrel still fresh and the outlook remaining foggy.  For investors, it’s been a bumpy ride. In the past five years, oil majors broadly underperformed global stock markets. A sharp drop in crude prices in the last quarter of 2018 to below $50 a barrel from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in October was a bleak reminder of the uncertainty. But stronger than expected results in the fourth quarter of 2018 reported over the past week gave the sector a boost as companies surprised investors with their resilience to generate profit, or breakeven, at oil prices around $50 a barrel. A barrel of benchmark Brent is now trading around $60. “The cyclical driver is higher oil prices and strong refining margins but underlying this is a structural move to lower breakevens which is driving higher cash flows,” said Rohan Murphy, energy equity analyst at Allianz Global Investors. “I think the companies will remain disciplined,” he said. “When I meet the managements of these companies they are enthused about the future rather than feeling constrained.” After Exxon and Shell, the other three majors are U.S. firm Chevron, Britain’s BP and France’s Total.  Exxon is the outlier of the group for now, as it boosts its spending to develop large-scale projects in Guyana and Mozambique and its sprawling U.S. onshore shale portfolio. The company, still the biggest energy firm in terms of production and market size, was slow to respond to the drop in crude prices, lagging rivals when they slashed costs, sacked employees and sold assets in the past three years. But under Chief Executive Darren Woods, who succeeded Rex Tillerson when he became U.S. secretary of state from 2017 until last year, Exxon is undergoing profound changes in its operations and structure in an effort to catch up.  Exxon will increase capital spending to $30 billion this year from $26 billion in 2018. It is also trying to sell large assets in Azerbaijan and Tanzania. Woods told analysts in a fourth quarter earnings call that the Irving, Texas-based company would accelerate divestments. “Exxon Mobil has pulled the divestiture value creation lever much less than peers over five and 10 years,” said Doug Terreson, analyst at Evercore ISI. “It is timely for them to divest and use proceeds to reinvest in higher quality areas.” Exxon has pledged to double earnings and cash flow from operations by 2025. Anglo-Dutch Shell is still set to retain the crown for cash generation until the end of the decade thanks to rising production and its dominance in liquefied natural gas (LNG). But Exxon’s new production should sharply narrow the gap, according to estimates by HSBC, which has a ‘hold’ rating on Shell and ‘buy’ on Exxon. While Exxon invests heavily into future production, Shell’s output growth is set to slow after years of gains following the acquisition of rival BG Group in 2016. For Shell and other rivals which have held back on new investments, the race to find new reserves to replace depleting fields will be a key challenge, said Darren Sissons, portfolio manager at Canadian investment management firm Campbell, Lee & Ross. “The trade off of balance sheet and reduced exploration and production (E&P) and capital expenditure has worked to strengthen balance sheets with the cost being reserve life deterioration,” Sissons said. “The next wave of E&P was largely started tepidly last year by Exxon and BP but all the others have now joined in.” Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-cash/analysis-shell-leads-cash-race-but-exxon-catching-up-idUKL5N2032BR,08 Feb 2019,"Royal Dutch Shell widened

2019-02-08,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Canadian private equity firm Brookfield Asset Management is in preliminary talks with India’s Reliance Industries to buy a stake in its optical fibre and telecom tower assets, The Times of India newspaper reported on Friday. Reliance Industries Ltd said in December it planned to separate its fibre and tower business from its telecom arm Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, commonly known as Jio. “The end objective of that is to find a different set of investors who would be wanting to run these kind of assets,” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer of Reliance Industries said in January at the company’s quarterly results announcement.  The move will help Reliance to unlock value in the assets and reduce debt, he said. While Srikanth declined to mention the number of towers the company has, or the reach and length of the fibre optic infrastructure, the company had said earlier it wanted to cover 99 percent of India’s population by the end of December 2019 with its telecom service.  The value of the assets is expected to be around $15 billion, the newspaper said, without citing its sources. Reliance and Brookfield did not reply to emails seeking comment. Jio, which has absorbed $40 billion of Reliance’s capital expenditure (capex) in the last five years, has around $25 billion of debt and has been instrumental in turning India’s most valuable energy company into a position of net debt. Analysts at foreign broking firm CLSA have said that since a big chunk of Jio’s capex has been put towards building its tower and fibre infrastructure, a potential sale of the assets could reduce the telecom firm’s debt substantially. Since its launch in September 2016, Jio, billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s most ambitious venture, has upended the telecom sector in India with cut price data and free voice calls. The entry of Jio has pushed all telecom companies into losses or forced consolidation. Last year, newspapers reported that Brookfield was also in talks to acquire a natural gas pipeline owned by a personal investment vehicle of Mukesh Ambani.

2019-02-08,"(Adds LNA statement on flights) BENGHAZI, Libya/LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corp on Friday urged all parties to avoid escalation at the El Sharara oilfield, the country’s largest, and said it would not resume normal operations until security had been restored. “Worker safety remains our primary concern,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement. “We urge all parties to avoid conflict and the politicisation of key infrastructure.” The eastern-based Libyan National Army said on Wednesday it had seized the 315,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) southwestern field from tribesmen and protesters who forced operations to halt when they took the site on Dec. 8. But an engineer at the field told Reuters that eastern forces were controlling only a pumping substation and that the main production area was still held by armed tribesmen. The field manager had communicated with all parties in the vicinity of the site and urged restraint, the NOC said. In a statement, the LNA said any plane planning to take off or land in any airport in the south from midnight on Thursday would require approval from the air force operations room. It said this would apply to local or foreign flights, adding it would treat any aircraft contravening those orders as an enemy target. This effectively means the NOC would be unable to fly to Sharara without permission from Haftar’s forces. Oil production in Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been disrupted since conflict broke out in 2011, with protesters and armed groups often targeting oilfields and energy infrastructure. National production now stands at under 1 million bpd, well below pre-2011 capacity of 1.6 million bpd.

2019-02-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain is leading a group of European Union states who are trying to block an EU plan to include Saudi Arabia and 22 other jurisdictions on a blacklist of countries that pose money-laundering and terrorism financing threats, sources said. The EU’s executive commission adopted last month a draft list that adds Saudi Arabia, Panama and small Pacific and Caribbean islands to the existing list of 16 states, which currently includes Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and North Korea. The list needs the endorsement of a majority of the 28 EU nations but Britain and other heavyweights of the bloc, including Germany, France, Italy and Spain, are raising concerns, three EU officials told Reuters. Two of the sources said EU states’ reluctance to endorse the list was mostly driven by concerns over the inclusion of Saudi Arabia and Panama on the list.  Listed countries face higher scrutiny in their financial dealings with the EU, with bloc’s banks forced to carry out additional checks on payments involving entities from those jurisdictions.  Britain is the country that is pushing more openly not to include Riyadh in the list, one official said, while Spain is insisting it excludes Panama.  Oil-rich Saudi Arabia is a top importer of EU products and weapons, while Panama is a major financial centre in Latin America with many EU firms involved in the multi-billion-dollar expansion of its trans-oceanic canal. British officials were not immediately available for a comment. A Spanish government official declined to comment. Countries are blacklisted if they “have strategic deficiencies in their anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism regimes that pose significant threats to the financial system of the Union,” the existing EU list says. Panama’s ambassador to the EU Miguel Verzbolovskis said the country had reformed its anti-money laundering rules and urged the EU not to include Panama in the new list. Saudi government officials were not immediately available for a comment. Several EU states in a meeting of national envoys this week in Brussels called for more time to assess listed jurisdictions, the officials said. They resisted the EU Commission’s plan to take control of the listing process. This has so far been carried out by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), a global body composed by wealthy nations, including half of the EU countries. The existing EU list mirrors the FATF list of 16 states, while the new one would be expanded by imposing stricter criteria on countries to avoid listing. EU states’ pressure against the new listing has intensified after a meeting of EU and Arab League foreign ministers ended with no agreement on a joint statement on Monday, in a sign of worsening relations between the two blocs. Relations between Brussels and Riyadh, which plays a prominent role in the Arab League, have grown colder after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate on Oct. 2. A Saudi government team of diplomats has set up shop in Brussels to lobby against the listing, one EU official and one source in Saudi Arabia said. The EU official said the Saudis have threatened to cancel lucrative contracts in some EU countries. Two senior officials of the EU Commission said that Brussels was, however, not inclined to bend to pressure and would formally adopt the list, with Saudi Arabia in it, in the coming weeks. EU states could however reject it within two months of its approval by qualified majority.

2019-02-08,"BANGKOK, Feb 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Solar power companies in Southeast Asian that are competing for land with agriculture, industry and expanding populations have found an innovative alternative: placing floating panels in lakes, dams, reservoirs and the sea. Earlier this week, the state utility Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) said it will submit a proposal for a 45-megawatt floating solar plant in the Sirindhorn dam in the country’s northeast. EGAT plans to invest in about 16 such projects across nine dams in the country, deputy governor Thepparat Theppitak told reporters. Elsewhere in the region, Singapore is developing one of the world’s largest offshore floating solar systems in the Strait of Johor to the north of the island. “In land-scarce countries like Singapore, the widespread use of PV systems is hindered by space constraints and limited roof space,” said Frank Phuan, chief executive officer of Sunseap Group, which is building the system. The platform has to be “more robust” than systems in reservoirs or lakes to withstand tougher conditions on the open sea, and to overcome barnacles that may grow on it, he said. It was also difficult to find a spot in the sea that was not frequented by shipping vessels, he said. Despite these challenges, floating solar systems are growing quickly in Asia alongside those on the ground and on roofs, according to the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS). While floating panels are more expensive to install, they are up to 16 percent more efficient because the water’s cooling effect helps reduce thermal losses and extend their life, according to SERIS. The panels also reduce evaporation from water bodies when temperatures are warm, thus saving freshwater for drinking. “The greater efficiency offsets the higher cost of installation,” said Celine Paton, a senior financial analyst at SERIS. “Technological advances should soon bring them on par with ground systems” in terms of cost, she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Southeast Asia is particularly well suited for floating panels because of the scarcity of land and because they can be easily installed in the region’s many hydropower dams, where they can use existing transmission systems, she said. China currently accounts for most of the more than 1.1 gigawatts of floating solar capacity now installed, according to the World Bank. India recently announced a plan to develop 10 GW of floating solar capacity. The technology’s potential is about 400 GW, or about as much generating capacity as all the solar photovoltaic panels installed in the world through 2017, the World Bank said. There are concerns that the panels could block sunlight, affecting marine life and ecosystems, and that the electrical systems might not withstand the onslaught of water. But backers say the technology is proven, and that the panels cover too small a surface area to create major problems. “The first floating PV system was installed as recently as 2007, so there are still some unknowns,” said Paton. “But it’s not a contest with ground systems - it’s about context,” she said.

2019-02-08,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Germany’s second largest sugar refiner Nordzucker said on Friday it had agreed to purchase 70 percent of Australia’s Mackay Sugar Limited, giving it access to Australian and wider Southeast Asian markets.  Nordzucker said in November it was in talks to buy Mackay as part of the German company’s international expansion. “The growth in sugar is taking place in regions outside the EU,” said Nordzucker CEO Lars Gorissen in a statement. By acquiring a stake in Mackay Sugar, we can secure a substantial share of the Australian market and gain access to the Southeast Asian market.” Nordzucker said last year it was seeking takeovers of producers of sugar from cane outside the depressed European sugar market.  Nordzucker will contribute equity capital totaling 60 million Australian dollars ($42.4 million) for the 70 percent shareholding, Nordzucker said. Mackay Sugar will also receive an additional loan of up to 60 million Australian dollars. “Nordzucker is so building up production capacities outside Europe and consistently pursuing its strategy of focusing on sugar production from sugar beet and sugar cane,” Nordzucker added.  The transaction is subject to the approval of Mackay Sugar’s shareholders, mainly sugar farmers. The deal involves three of Mackay’s four factories producing around 700,000 tonnes of raw sugar annually for both the Australian market and exports. “The equity and debt capital contribution will mainly be used for maintenance and capital expenditures in order to significantly increase the availability of the three remaining plants… over the next few years and make the company sustainably profitable,” Nordzucker added.

2019-02-08,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Global shares fell for a third straight day on Friday and were set to post their first weekly loss in seven, as investors worried about a broadening global economic slowdown and the lack of any sign of a resolution to the U.S.-China trade row. Safe-haven government bonds benefited, with the German 10-year bund yield falling closer towards the zero percent mark and the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield hitting its lowest point in a week. Weak earnings saw a subdued open for European stocks although most major indices climbed into the black for the day, putting the pan-European STOXX 600 in positive territory. Spain’s IBEX fell half a percent. But stock markets in Asia earlier eased, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shedding half a percent, easing back from a four-month peak touched the previous day. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.3 percent on the day. It was down for a third straight day and was set to break a six-week streak of gains. The European Commission on Thursday slashed its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking concern that a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade friction. The Bank of England on Thursday said Britain faces its weakest economic growth in a decade this year, as uncertainty over Brexit mounts and the global economy slows. Earlier in the week, Australia’s central bank signalled monetary easing in the face of economic headwinds, joining the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank in signalling policy shifts. The Fed has all but abandoned plans for further rate hikes, while the ECB also sounded less certain that it will start tightening policy this year. “If there was a single takeaway from the last few days it would appear to be this - ever since the Fed started to backtrack on its growth expectations for the U.S. economy, the global economic skies, to coin an aphorism from the recent World Bank report, have started to darken further,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. In a report last month titled ‘Darkening Skies’, the World Bank said global economic growth is expected to slow to 2.9 percent in 2019, compared with 3 percent in 2018. Hewson added that the tone in markets on the day wasn’t helped by remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump’s chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow, that U.S.-China trade talks still had sizable differences to overcome. Trump himself said on Thursday he did not plan to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Robert Lighthizer are expected to kick off another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended its overnight decline to a one-week low of 2.643 percent. The 20-year Japanese government bond yield dropped to a 27-month trough of 0.400 percent. The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.105 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission’s sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. The euro was on course for its biggest weekly loss in more than four months against the dollar, though traders seemed to be puzzled that it was finding support. The single currency was 0.1 percent lower on the day at $1.13240 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was 0.15 percent higher. The Australian dollar was on course to end a bearish week firmly on the back foot, last trading down 0.25 percent at $0.7083. The Aussie slid sharply on Wednesday after the Reserve Bank of Australia stepped back from its long-standing tightening bias, saying the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The currency was headed for a weekly loss of 2.3 percent. In commodities, oil fell, pulled down by worries over a global economic slowdown, although OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela provided crude with some support.

Safe-haven government bonds benefited in the face of growing anxiety over the global outlook, with German and Japanese debt yields falling to their lowest in over two years. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open mixed, with Britain’s FTSE inching up 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX retreating 0.05 percent and France’s CAC starting flat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.5 percent, easing back from a four-month peak touched the previous day. The index was down 0.1 percent on the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost 0.25 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI retreated 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei tumbled about 2 percent. The European Commission on Thursday sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking fears a global slowdown is spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grapple with trade frictions. Adding to the gloomy mood, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. “Investors are getting nervous as the market had been optimistic about a resolution of the trade dispute since the beginning of the year,” said Shusuke Yamada, chief Japan FX and equity strategist at Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Trump’s stance rattled investors hoping for a resolution to the months-long trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies. Wall Street shares slumped in response overnight, with the Dow falling 0.9 percent to pull back from a two-month peak scaled midweek on upbeat corporate results. “With many of the corporate earnings out of the way, equities appeared ready for a correction after their recent highs,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “Equities will face further hurdles next week, as (U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven) Mnuchin and (Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer will be visiting China. Brexit talks are also in focus.” Mnuchin and Lighthizer are expected to kick off another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended its overnight decline to a one-week low of 2.643 percent. The 20-year Japanese government bond yield dropped to a 27-month trough of 0.400 percent. The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.105 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission’s sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. The euro sagged under the weight of declining German bund yields. The single currency was little changed at $1.1339 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss. The dollar was a shade lower at 109.750 yen, nudged off a high of 110.09 reached the previous day. The yen tends to attract demand in times of political tensions and market volatility due to its perceived safe-haven status. Yet, the U.S. currency was still headed for a small weekly gain of 0.3 percent against the yen, supported by the earlier rise in Treasury yields. The Australian dollar was on course to end a bearish week firmly on the back foot, last trading down 0.35 percent at $0.7079 after the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) cut its growth outlook. The Aussie slid sharply on Wednesday after the RBA stepped back from its long-standing tightening bias, saying the next move in rates could just as well be down as up. The currency was headed for a weekly loss of 2.3 percent. In commodities, U.S. crude futures slipped 0.7 percent to $52.27 per barrel, extending losses after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous session. Brent crude was down 0.6 percent at $61.26 per barrel. Oil fell as the market was hurt by concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian coal haulier Pacific National said on Thursday that one of its trains derailed near the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and that some services would be affected while repair work was carried out.  The Hunter Valley is Australia’s top thermal coal-producing region and home to operations run by Yancoal, Glencore and Peabody Energy.  There were no injuries, Pacific National said by email, adding that the train had derailed in the early morning on Wednesday near the area of Baerami with the last six wagons coming off the tracks.  “The regulator is currently onsite assessing the situation with the removal of the wagons and repairs to the track expected to commence after assessments have been completed,” the company said.  The derailment is the third involving a freight train in as many months. Australia’s rail safety regulator said each incident involved unique circumstances and cautioned against trying to link them. “The rate of freight train derailments in Australia in recent years has remained steady at between 0.4 and 0.5 derailments per million freight train kilometres,” the Office of the National Rail Safety Regulator told Reuters in an email.  It said it was working with industry to drive the figure lower.  Pacific National said rail services west of Mount Pleasant would be impacted while the work is being done.  The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was investigating the incident that caused damage to around 2 km (1.3 miles) of the train track.  The train had been travelling through a section of the network that was under a temporary speed restriction of 20 km per hour (13 miles per hour), which had been imposed to “mitigate risk due to a measured series of defects in the track,” the bureau said in a statement on its website.  A Yancoal spokesman said that its Moolarben Coal complex  had been directly impacted by the train derailment but that it was too early to advise of any potential impact to customers, as it awaited confirmation of when haulage would restart.  A Glencore spokesman referred Reuters to Pacific National. Representatives from Peabody were not immediately available to comment.  In November, BHP Group forced a train off its tracks after it ran away without its driver en route to the northwestern iron ore export hub of Port Hedland.  The following month, around 30 wagons in an empty iron ore train derailed around 700 km (438 miles) east of Perth after poor weather eroded part of the track.

2019-02-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Developers have lost a court appeal to build a coal mine in Australia’s Hunter Valley over its potentially “dire” environmental impact in the country’s first legal review of a coal mine project to hear evidence from a climate scientist. In the landmark ruling, Justice Brian Preston on Friday denied the appeal on the Rocky Hill project in New South Wales state, citing an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as uncertain economic benefits and adverse social and visual impacts.  The Rocky Hill project was developed by privately held Gloucester Resources, a unit of GRL Holdings Pty Ltd, which has the right to appeal to the New South Wales supreme court.   “Gloucester Resources Limited will assess the implications of today’s decision and consider its next steps,” it said in a statement.  Australia is the world’s biggest coal exporter and the fuel is its largest resources earner. Canberra last year scrapped plans for a national energy policy that aimed to cut carbon emissions as well as power prices in part due to opposition from coal supporters within its ranks. In his ruling, the judge found that mine and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would add to the global total “at a time when what is now urgently needed, in order to meet generally agreed climate targets, is a rapid and deep decrease in GHG emissions.”      “In short, an open cut coal mine in this part of the Gloucester valley would be in the wrong place at the wrong time,” Preston found. “These dire consequences should be avoided.” At the end of January the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development made waves in Australia when it said the country needed to cut emissions more sharply to meet its Paris Climate accord target as the country remained heavily dependent on coal-fired power. But on Thursday a study published earlier on Friday by Australian National University (ANU) researchers found the country is adopting renewable energy faster per capita than the rest of the world. Rapid recent growth in wind and solar power has left it on track to meet Paris carbon emissions reductions targets well before 2030, it found.  The ruling was set to make developing new coal mines or expanding existing projects more challenging, said Shaw & Partners analyst Peter O’Connor. “On first pass it doesn’t read well for the industry,” he said. “And it does indicate an ongoing and increased level of scrutiny of this industry, which is only likely to become greater.”  Shares in Australian-listed coal miners Whitehaven and New Hope, which both have coal projects on the drawing board, fell 3.5 and 2.2 percent respectively by 0446 GMT on Friday, in line with lower Australian thermal coal prices.  Whitehaven declined to comment on whether it expects any impact on its own development plans. New Hope officials couldn’t immediately be reached. Environmental campaigners welcomed the court ruling.  The chief executive of Australia’s Climate Council, Amanda McKenzie, said Australia “must continue to transition away from fossil fuels and embrace renewable energy with storage”. “The science says so, and now the law does too,” she said in a statement.

2019-02-08,"SYDNEY, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A prominent Chinese businessman and political donor, linked in the past to a row about the promotion of Chinese interests, said on Friday Australia’s decision to rescind his visa was based on nothing more than speculation. Huang Xiangmo is unable to return to Australia after the government rejected his application for citizenship and revoked his visa while he was overseas, newspaper reports said this week. Australian media, citing unidentified sources, said Huang was denied residency after intelligence agencies concluded he could undertake “acts of foreign interference” and that he was unfit for residency. Huang rejected that assessment and criticised Australia in his first public comments since the visa cancellation was revealed. “It is profoundly disappointing to be treated in such a grotesquely unfair manner. The decision to cancel my visa was based on unfounded speculations that are prejudiced and groundless,” Huang told the Australian Financial Review. “There are many Australian companies in China, aren’t they more likely to be susceptible to potential manipulation by the Chinese government?” he said. Representatives for Australia’s Department of Home Affairs and a spokeswoman for Minister for Immigration David Coleman did not respond immediately to requests for comment. Huang’s expulsion comes as Australia and China seek to repair ties that have been strained since 2017, when Canberra accused Beijing of meddling in its domestic affairs. China denies the accusation. Huang emerged as one of Australia’s biggest political donors soon after he began living in Australia. He rose to prominence after an influential opposition lawmaker was forced to resign in 2017, when allegations emerged that he was linked to Chinese-aligned interests. The lawmaker, Sam Dastyari, sought to encourage a senior politician not to meet a Chinese pro-democracy activist opposed to Beijing’s rule in Hong Kong in 2015. Dastyari was also recorded warning Huang that his phone may be tapped. Huang stopped political donations after that incident but later expanded his business interests in Australia. He paid nearly A$1 billion ($715 million) in 2018 for two Australian projects owned by Chinese conglomerate Dalian Wanda Group.

2019-02-08,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Australian thermal coal prices have fallen to their lowest since April 2018 as a slowdown in Chinese imports dents demand for the commodity. Spot cargo prices for Australian thermal coal exports from the port of Newcastle were last settled at $95.75 per tonne, the lowest since a spike in April 2018 pushed prices above $100 a tonne. The 6 percent slump since the start of the year is a result of a sharp slowdown in Chinese imports of coal. (GRAPHIC: Australian Newcastle coal price - tmsnrt.rs/2Bqjibs)  Refinitiv ship tracking data on Friday showed dozens of large dry-bulk carriers sitting outside China’s major coal import terminals, waiting to unload. “As far as we know, Australian metallurgical and thermal coal vessels still cannot clear customs in China, and there have been reports of customs officers telling customers that the blockage will continue at least until the end of February,” said a senior analyst with a coal merchant in Singapore. He declined to be named due to company policy. China has been celebrating the start of the Lunar New Year this week, resulting in an almost complete shutdown of official business. However, customs had already been slow to clear imports in the weeks running up to the holiday, with no official reasons given. Trade data in Refinitiv showed Chinese coal imports to have dropped from 4.67 million tonnes in week four of 2019 to 3.57 million tonnes a week later. Australian coal exports dropped from 8.36 million tonnes to 7.46 million tonnes during that time. (GRAPHIC: Australia coal exports vs China coal imports - tmsnrt.rs/2tbt9xa)  High inventories could be part of the import slowdown. “Total (coal) stocks at the main Bohai sea ports of Caofeidian, Qinhuangdao and Jingtang in Northern China totalled 16.01 million tonnes as of Feb. 2, 2019, over 5 million tonnes higher year-on-year,” said Vishal Thiruvedula, Refinitiv coal analyst, in a report published this week. Beyond the this, the upcoming end of the peak winter heating seasons would also dent coal demand, two traders said.  “Temperatures will moderate across the Northeast (of China) in the 6 to 10 day time frame, while North China remains mild,” said Refinitiv weather analyst Ed Whalen. For Japan and South Korea, the region’s other main coal importers, “the temperature pattern is fairly similar ... (with) slightly warmer than normal” conditions, which imply relatively low thermal coal demand towards the end of winter.

2019-02-08,"WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday unveiled a resolution calling for the cancellation of Russia’s Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline, a link under the Baltic Sea from Russia to Germany. Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said they would take up the resolution at their next business meeting. Opponents of the pipeline worry it will weaken support for Ukraine by depriving Kiev of gas transit fees along the traditional route for Russian supplies, which meet more than a third of the European Union’s gas needs. The pipeline, owned by Russian state energy firm Gazprom , has been a focus of international attention since Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014. Germany has been trying to garner support for the pipeline. President Donald Trump’s administration has been pushing against it. The U.S. ambassadors to Germany, Denmark and the European Union urged EU members to vote against the pipeline in an opinion column published by Deutsche Welle on Thursday. The resolution calls for the pipeline’s cancellation and supports a multinational freedom of navigation in the Black Sea after Russia’s aggression against Ukraine in the Kerch Strait. The EU bloc is divided in its support for the project. Eastern European, Nordic and Baltic Sea countries view the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline as holding the EU hostage to Moscow, while those in northern Europe, especially Germany, prioritize the economic benefits. France plans to back an EU proposal to regulate the pipeline, its foreign ministry said on Thursday, potentially threatening its completion and dealing a blow to Germany.

2019-02-08,"(Repeats Feb. 7 column with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)) * Cyclical indicators: tmsnrt.rs/2ULs8I8 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Policymakers and analysts who claim the outlook is “unusually uncertain” are normally overstating their own forecasting problem and understating the difficulties faced by their predecessors. The outlook always looks more certain in retrospect, when the outcome is known, and a causal chain can be constructed that makes it appear nearly inevitable, than it does in prospect, when multiple pathways look possible. Unusually uncertain is often a fancy way of saying “I don’t know” and concealing the limits of forecasting, which is often much less reliable than policymakers and analysts would like their audience to believe. But there are times when it is genuinely more difficult to predict what will happen in future, especially when systems approach turning points or inflection points. I am normally sceptical when policymakers and analysts say the outlook is unusually uncertain, but at the moment they may actually be justified in making that claim, with the economy delicately poised between moderation and recession, and hyper-sensitive to even small shocks that could nudge it towards either eventuality. In both the economy and the oil market, forecast accuracy deteriorates around cyclical turning points, which is why almost all forecasters missed the onset of the last recession in 2007 or the collapse in oil prices in 2008. For the same reason, most forecasters missed the slump in oil prices in the middle of 2014, the recovery in oil prices from early 2016, or the renewed fall in prices during late 2018. “The largest errors in forecasts of real and nominal GDP growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate, are made in the vicinity of business cycle and growth cycle turning points, particularly peaks,” wrote business cycle expert Victor Zarnowitz. “Many forecasts are overly influenced by the most recent events or developments; they rely on the persistence of local trends and are insufficiently cyclical in the sense that they miss the turns and underestimate recessions and recoveries.” “Leading indicators rarely miss major turns in economic activity, but they now and then err in giving false signals of recession or (less often) recovery” (“Business cycles: theory, history, indicators and forecasting”, Zarnowitz, 1992). However, even leading indicators may struggle to discriminate between a true turning point (where the cycle changes direction) and an inflection point (where the cycle continues in same direction but with a change of rate). In the vicinity of a turning point or an inflection, the economy and the oil market can become very sensitive to even small changes in conditions and sentiment, which contributes to the increased forecasting difficulty. The global economy and the oil market both now show clear signs of a slowdown. Every leading indicator tells the same story of a sharp loss of momentum in the second half of 2018 after strong growth in 2017. But all those indicators for the economy and the oil market are in a range that could be consistent with either an imminent recession or a renewed acceleration after a period of sluggish growth. With every indicator poised between a true turning point in the cycle or simply an inflection in the growth rate, there is no way to discriminate in advance (tmsnrt.rs/2ULs8I8). The shape of the U.S. Treasury yield curve is one commonly employed leading indicator for predicting recessions in the United States. Based on the current shape of the yield curve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimates there is a 24 percent probability the U.S. economy will be in recession in January 2020. The forecast probability of recession has more than doubled over the last year, and risen six times over the last two years, and is now unusually elevated. But the forecast probability is still well below the 40 percent hit in the run up to the recessions of 2007-2009, 2001, 1981-82 or 1980. The probability looks more like the elevated risk in 1990 (which turned into a recession) or 1996 and 1999 (which did not). Based on the yield curve, it is impossible to say whether the U.S. economy is heading for an end-of-cycle turning point or a temporary in-cycle slowdown. The U.S. equity market is similarly hovering uncertainly between an intra-cycle slowdown and an end-of-cycle turning point. The S&P 500 equity index is now down slightly over the last 12 months after strong year-on-year gains during 2017 and most of 2018. The flattening of equity prices is certainly consistent with a slowdown in the economic and corporate earnings outlook but is not yet at levels that preceded the recessions of 1990, 2001 or 2007. U.S. manufacturing surveys show a loss of momentum at the end of 2018 and the start of 2019, a warning sign, but the composite activity indicators are still well below the levels that preceded the last three recessions. Even the much-ballyhooed U.S. job market indicators are ambiguous. Non-farm employment is rising at around 1.8 percent per year, faster than the 1.5 percent reported 12 months earlier, but fairly slow compared with earlier expansions. If the U.S. economy is performing relatively well, most of the rest of the global economy is performing relatively poorly, but not so badly that we can confidently predicted a recession rather than a slowdown. China’s official purchasing managers’ index shows manufacturing activity has been losing momentum for the last year and actually contracted in December and January, but only slightly. Globally, purchasing managers’ indicators show new export orders have been losing momentum since the start of 2018 and have now fallen for five months in a row. But the declines in orders have been relatively small, so far, and could be consistent with an in-cycle slowdown such as 2015-2016 or 2011-2012 rather than a full recession like 2007-2009 or 2001. Air freight indicators also point to flat-lining or falling volumes in 2018 after strong growth in 2016 and 2017, but do not yet show the large falls associated with the last two recessions. Like the rest of the economy, the oil market appears to be poised uncertainly between the probability of a recession-induced supply surplus or a recovery-driven deficit. OPEC’s aggressive output cuts, coupled with U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, have offset the feared slowdown in oil consumption growth and eliminated much of the incipient surplus in 2019. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has returned close to flat, after collapsing from backwardation into contango during the fourth quarter, suggesting traders currently see the oil market close to balance this year. Brent spreads cycle between contango and backwardation as the oil market alternates between periods of over- and under-supply; they do not usually stay close to flat for very long. But the outlook is poised between fears about a recession-driven slowdown in consumption and concerns about supply losses from Iran and Venezuela as well as OPEC cuts and a possible slowdown in U.S. shale growth. The global economic outlook is the single biggest source of uncertainty for the oil market, and until that source of uncertainty is resolved or at least reduced, the oil outlook remains equally unclear.

2019-02-08,"* U.S.-China trade disputes weigh on economic growth outlook * Saudi Arabia crude output down 400,000 bpd in Jan -OPEC sources By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Oil markets were cautious early on Friday, held back by concerns over a global economic slowdown but supported by supply cuts led by producer club OPEC and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.61 per barrel at 0046 GMT, down 3 cents from their last settlement. WTI dropped by around 2.5 percent the previous session. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Weighing on financial markets, including crude oil futures, were concerns that trade disputes between the United States and China would remain unresolved, denting global economic growth prospects. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline set by the two countries to achieve a trade deal. If there is no agreement between the world’s two biggest economies, Trump has threatened to increase U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Another round of talks is scheduled for next week in Beijing. “Crude prices returned to the lows of the week as slower growth prospects...could signal a return (of reasons) for inventories to rise,” said Edward Moya, market analyst at futures brokerage Oanda. Despite this, traders said crude prices were prevented from falling much further by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which were introduced late last year and are aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. As part of these cuts, Saudi Arabia - the world’s biggest crude oil exporter and de-facto leader of OPEC - cut its crude output in January by about 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.24 million bpd, according to OPEC sources. Another risk to oil supply comes from Venezuela after the implementation of U.S. sanctions against the OPEC-member’s petroleum industry in late January. Analysts expect this move to knock out 300,000-500,000 bpd of exports. Yet for the time being, the sanctions impact on international oil markets was limited. “The (Venezuela) disruption overall seems manageable both for the U.S. and the global market,” said Norbert Rücker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “The oil market sits on a comfortable cushion of supply.” (Reporting by Henning Gloystein Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-squeezed-by-economy-concerns-but-opec-output-cuts-provide-support-idUKL3N203057,08 Feb 2019,"* Saudi Arabia crude output down 400,000 bpd in Jan -OPEC

2019-02-08,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Downbeat views on euro zone growth, renewed trade woes weigh * Bonds draw demand, German 10-yr yield lowest in two years By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Friday as investors fretted about a broadening global economic slowdown, with sentiment not helped by the absence of any positive signs for a resolution in the U.S.-China trade row. Safe-haven government bonds benefited in the face of growing anxiety over the global outlook, with German long-term debt yields falling to their lowest in over two years. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.3 percent, easing back from a four-month peak touched the previous day. The index stood little changed on the week. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 percent. The European Commission on Thursday sharply cut its forecasts for euro zone economic growth this year and next, stoking fears of a global slowdown spreading to Europe as businesses and investors grappled with trade frictions. Adding to the gloomy mood, President Donald Trump said he did not plan to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping before a March 1 deadline to achieve a trade deal. That rattled investors hoping for a resolution to the months-long trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies. Wall Street shares slumped in response overnight, with the Dow falling 0.9 percent to pull back from a two-month peak scaled midweek on upbeat corporate results. “With many of the corporate earnings out of the way, equities appeared ready for a correction after their recent highs,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “Equities will face further hurdles next week, as (U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven) Mnuchin and (Trade Representative Robert) Lighthizer will be visiting China. Brexit talks are also in focus.” Mnuchin and Lighthizer are expected to engage in another round of trade talks in Beijing next week to push for a deal to protect American intellectual property and avert a March 2 increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood near a six-day low of 2.65 percent plumbed overnight, when it sank more than 4 basis points amid the broader risk aversion in markets. The 10-year German bund yield fell to 0.105 percent on Thursday, its lowest since November 2016 after the European Commission’s sharp cuts to growth and inflation forecasts. The euro sagged under the weight of declining German bund yields. The single currency was down 0.2 percent at $1.1339 after dropping to a two-week low of $1.1325 the previous day. It was on track for a 1 percent weekly loss. The dollar was little changed at 109.820 yen, nudged off a high of 110.09 reached the previous day. The yen tends to attract demand in times of political tensions and market volatility due to its perceived safe-haven status. Yet, the U.S. currency was still headed for a small gain of 0.3 percent against the yen this week. In commodities, U.S. crude futures slipped 0.3 percent to $52.48 per barrel, extending losses after dropping 2.5 percent in the previous session. Oil fell on Thursday as the market was hurt by concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year.
