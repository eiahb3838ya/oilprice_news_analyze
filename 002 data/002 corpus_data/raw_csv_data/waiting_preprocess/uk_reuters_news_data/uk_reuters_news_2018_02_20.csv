2018-02-20,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) on Tuesday reported quarterly results that fell short of analyst profit estimates on weaker-than-expected production. The Oklahoma City-based company reported profit of $183 million, or 35 cents a share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $207 million, or 41 cents a share, a year earlier. The profit was below analysts’ forecasts for 60 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters data. Devon shares shed $1.65, or nearly 5 percent, to $33 apiece in late trading. Dave Hager, Devon’s chief executive, said in a statement the company will continue on a track to reduce debt in its upstream business by $1.5 billion and plans to use excess cash to pursue share buybacks and dividend expansion. Devon said its oil production missed its own forecasts by about 14,000 barrels per day during the period, citing delayed well tie-ins in the United States and temporary steam-plant problems in its Canadian operations. It reported output totaled 548,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) in the quarter. The company forecast production in the current quarter of between 530,000 and 554,000 boepd. Devon forecast full-year production would rise to between 552,000 and 576,000 boepd with U.S. oil production increasing about 14 percent this year over 2017.

2018-02-20,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Michel Temer’s decision to throw in the towel on reforming Brazil’s loss-making pension system leaves the unpopular measure as a campaign issue for October’s elections and a major headache for his successor. Monday’s announcement that Temer was abandoning an overhaul of the social security system - billed as the centrepiece of his efforts at fiscal reform - sparked immediate concern from credit rating agencies that Latin America’s largest economy was failing to put its financial house in order.  Brazil’s generous pension system is at the heart of budget deficit that ballooned from 3 percent of GDP in 2013 to a massive 10 percent in 2015, before edging back to 8 percent last year as the $1.8 trillion economy emerged from recession. The official reason for dropping the pension bill was a military intervention in crime-plagued Rio de Janeiro state, decreed on Friday after unprecedented violence during Carnival. Constitutional amendments such as the pension bill are blocked during federal intervention of a state. Deploying the army in Rio will go down well with voters in a nation where polls show public safety is the top concern. Brazil has 60,000 murders a year and its cities are among the world’s most dangerous. Temer’s critics, however, said he merely found a pretext to avoid acknowledging an embarrassing defeat. While Temer, 77, came close to the super majority needed to pass the bill last year, he lost political capital fighting off corruption charges and the government soon discovered it had run out of time, as lawmakers seeking re-election this year refused to back the unpopular legislation. “Now the government does not have to admit it lost the battle for pension reform,” said Fabio Sousa, a congressman for the centrist Brazilian Social Democratic Party, which backed the reform. “The next president will have to do the fiscal adjustment, which is fine, because he will have a mandate from voters to do something about it,” Sousa said in an interview. “The good thing is that pension reform will now be an election campaign issue.” Temer, a former vice president, replaced impeached leftist Dilma Rousseff in 2016. But he has single-digit approval ratings that rule out a presidential bid of his own. Brazilian markets were stable on Tuesday, with Sao Paulo’s BOVESPA stock index gaining 1.2 percent in mid-afternoon as investors had largely expected an already watered-down pension reform to sink in Congress. In an effort to reassure investors, Temer’s cabinet on Monday announced plans to accelerate 15 other policies - ranging from tax breaks to privatising Brazil’s largest utility and strengthening the central bank’s autonomy. Yet Moody’s Investors Service promptly warned on Tuesday that the government’s pension decision was credit negative and would restrict its ability to comply with a spending ceiling approved last year. The government is expected to meet its 2018 deficit target but it is doubtful it can do so in 2019, as a sluggish recovery from Brazil’s worst recession on record has left tax revenues struggling.  According to the main industry lobby, the CNI, the reform would have saved government coffers about 1 trillion reais ($308 billion) over the next decade. Brazil’s gross public debt already stands at 4.9 trillion reais ($1.5 trillion) or 75 percent of GDP - relatively high for an emerging economy. Without steps to reduce heavy mandatory spending, it will continue climbing, said Felipe Salto, head of the Independent Fiscal Institute, a bipartisan Senate office that aims at transparency in government accounts. Government projections have the debt stabilizing in 2020 at 80 percent of GDP, but without pension reform that is in doubt.  “You have to show investors it will stabilise. If there is no horizon of stabilization, the market will see a risk of insolvency and higher interest rates will be needed to finance a snowballing debt,” Salto said.

2018-02-20,"BRASILIA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Privatization of Brazil’s largest power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA , a key step for Brazil to meet its 2018 fiscal target, will be difficult for Congress to approve this year, sources in the government’s economic team said on Tuesday. They also doubted the elimination of payroll tax breaks awarded by the previous government will win approval. One of the officials, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak about the matter, said it was difficult but not impossible. He added that the government might have to give up on other issues, referring to some 15 policies that the government plans to put on the front burner after giving up on an unpopular pension reform bill that failed to raise enough support in Congress in an election year. They range from closing tax breaks to strengthening the Central Bank’s autonomy and giving regulatory agencies more muscle, a set of policies designed to reassure investors that the government’s reform program is still on track. Privatization of Eletrobras, as the company is known, faces open resistance in Congress. The government hopes to raise 12.2 billion reais from the process. The proposal to end payroll tax breaks to improve revenue has been stuck in Congress for months. A second source in the economic team said ending the tax breaks was opposed by industries that will put pressure on lawmakers as they campaign for re-election in October.

2018-02-20,"LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum’s plan to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Mozambique moved a step closer to completion on Tuesday after it agreed a 15-year LNG sales and purchase agreement (SPA) with Electricite de France. France’s state-controlled utility will take 1.2 million tonnes of LNG annually from the Mozambique Area 1 marketing venture led by Anadarko and consisting of Japanese trader Mitsui, India’s ONGC Videsh and Thailand’s PTT, among others. In all Anadarko has agreed commercial terms including volume and price for 5.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG off-take deals from Mozambique, closing in on its 8.1 mtpa target needed to trigger a final investment decision (FID), said company spokeswoman Helen Wells. The Texas-based energy company plans to build a plant estimated to cost around $15 billion and start exporting LNG drawn from vast finds in Mozambique’s offshore Area 1 block from 2022 or 2023. Deals so far include Anadarko’s first binding SPA with EDF as well as an earlier SPA with Thailand’s state-run PTT that is still undergoing government approvals. There is also a preliminary deal with Japanese utility Tohoku Electric. “Additionally, we are in advanced negotiations with a variety of buyers to meet our FID target,” Wells said. The choice of European customer diversifies Anadarko’s Asia-weighted supply offering and could see east African LNG flowing into the region’s terminals as declining indigenous gas production makes Europe more reliant on imports, especially Russian piped gas. “Reaching this SPA continues to validate Mozambique LNG’s position as a competitive long-term LNG supplier and as one of the world’s leading greenfield projects,” said Mitch Ingram, Anadarko’s executive vice president of International and Deepwater Operations and Project Management. LNG project developers across the board have struggled to find the long-term buyers needed before banks and export credit agencies could commit financing for new plants. Low oil prices, surging global LNG output and buyer’s demands for flexibility, shorter contract terms and competitive pricing have challenged the profitability of many projects and delayed investments in new ones. Anadarko’s SPAs hint at a potential thaw in buyer-seller relations and a chance at becoming the first major East African LNG project to reach FID just as rising demand lifts prices and encourages investments in new supply. The tug-of-war between buyers and sellers has unsettled lenders. A typical financing model asked buyers to pay for a plant’s entire output over 25-years, thereby guaranteeing returns on loans. Buyers’ growing rejection of this model has led to calls for shorter terms, smaller volumes and flexibility to adjust or divert supply as circumstances change, making it harder for banks to commit funds in light of new project risks. “With regards to our project financing efforts, lenders are keenly engaged and have indicated a willingness to support the initial project with the necessary levels of project finance commitments,” Wells said. “We are actively negotiating the terms and conditions of the financing.” (Reporting by Oleg Vukmanovic)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/anadarko-petrol-lng-edf/anadarko-agrees-mozambique-lng-sale-banks-discuss-finance-terms-idUKL8N1QA7U4,20 Feb 2018,"Anadarko Petroleum's plan

2018-02-20,"(Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer Concho Resources Inc (CXO.N) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by higher crude prices, and forecast a 16-20 percent rise in total production for 2018 from a year earlier. The company estimated capital expenditure for 2018 at between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion, higher than its 2017 guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Concho posted net income of $267 million, or $1.79 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $125 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. In the latest reported quarter, the company booked a benefit of $398 million as a result of U.S. tax changes. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 66 cents per share. By that measure, analysts had expected earnings of 45 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Concho’s average realized price for oil and natural gas for the quarter was $40.18 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe), compared to $34.7 per boe a year earlier. Total production rose 28 percent to 19 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.

2018-02-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. yields rose in government debt auctions on Tuesday and yields on short-term bills hit their highest levels since September 2008, bolstering the U.S. dollar but helping end a six-session rebound in world stocks. Wall Street stocks were also hurt as Walmart, the world’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer, reported a lower-than-expected profit, dragging down other retailers. Shares of Walmart Inc (WMT.N) slumped 10.2 percent after the company reported quarterly results that showed a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period.  Shares of Target (TGT.N) and Costco Wholesale (COST.O) also fell, dragging the S&P consumer staples .SPLRCS index down 2.3 percent.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 254.63 points, or 1.01 percent, to 24,964.75, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 15.96 points, or 0.58 percent, to 2,716.26, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 5.16 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,234.31.    World equity markets also sank, with the MSCI gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shedding 0.47 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.55 percent, and Asian stocks were also subdued.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.41 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.01 percent. European shares held steady, supported by softer domestic currencies. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.56 percent. Investors looking to the greenback shrugged off worries about the U.S. budget deficit, focussing on large U.S. government debt auctions this week and sending the dollar higher. U.S. Treasury yields rose, with the benchmark 10-year yield hovering near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week’s deluge of $258 billion of government debt supply. Tuesday’s wave of supply, which comprised of $151 billion in bills and $28 billion in two-year fixed-rate notes, fetched mixed reception from investors. Concerns about more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and the possibility of further increases in federal borrowing may keep a lid on demand at this week’s auctions, they said. “I suspect, however, that when the next economic downturn eventually comes, tax receipts fall and the deficit widens that Treasury spreads will widen further,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.8896 percent. The Treasury also sold $55 billion in one-month bills at an interest rate of 1.380 percent, and $28 billion in two-year fixed-rate debt at a yield of 2.255 percent, the highest level since August 2008. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the greenback against a basket of other key world currencies, rose 0.7 percent, continuing its rebound from three-year lows. The euro EUR= was last 0.58 percent lower at $1.2335. The dollar’s rebound also put most emerging market currencies under pressure. Growing concerns about fraud at India's second-largest state-run bank sent the rupee INR= to a near three-month low. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 0.1 percent to $61.61 per barrel, hitting a near two-week high amid inventory declines, while Brent LCOcv1 was last at $65.09, down 0.88 percent on the day, under pressure from the stronger dollar.

2018-02-20,"FAIRFAX, Va. (Reuters) - A Virginia state court judge on Tuesday rejected a request by the U.S. unit of Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) to delay several of the company’s trials over excess emissions because of  “inflammatory” comments made by a lawyer representing car owners that it fears will prejudice the jury. Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Bruce White said after a hearing that he would proceed with a Feb. 26 trial involving a North Carolina man who bought a 2014 diesel Jetta. Volkswagen said publicity from a Netflix documentary that disclosed the company had jointly sponsored tests that exposed monkeys in 2014 to toxic diesel fumes could prejudice its chances of receiving a fair trial. Judge White said he was satisfied a fair panel could be seated for the expected three-week trial. “The jurors don’t know much about these cases,” White said generally of high-profile cases. The German carmaker is being sued by some consumers after it admitted in September 2015 to cheating on diesel emissions tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers. About 2,000 owners, however, opted out and most are pursuing court claims seeking additional compensation. Volkswagen of America had asked White to delay that trial for at least six months after a lawyer for more than 300 U.S. VW diesel owners, Michael Melkersen, gave an interview in the Netflix documentary in which he referred to the company testing diesel fumes on monkeys. In the Netflix interview, Melkersen criticized the tests, adding: “One cannot help to think back throughout history of another series of events involving individuals being gassed by a person who was actually at the opening of the very first Volkswagen factory,” an apparent reference to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust. In its legal filing, VW’s lawyers argued those comments would prevent a fair trial. Volkswagen lawyers said that “pretrial publicity has connected (the company) directly with Hitler and the Holocaust,” which they said was not relevant to a trial about claims of consumer fraud. Melkersen previously said it was “another tactic to postpone (Volkswagen’s) day of reckoning.” In response to Judge White’s ruling, a VW spokeswoman said the company looks “forward to demonstrating at the upcoming trial that the plaintiff has suffered no damages and that his demands for compensation are extravagant and unfounded.” Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Grant McCool and Steve Orlofsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions/update-1-vw-bid-to-delay-first-u-s-diesel-emissions-trial-rejected-idUKL2N1QA1E7,20 Feb 2018,"A Virginia state court

2018-02-20,"(Adds project details, context on rising corn-based ethanol production in Brazil) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - FS Bioenergia, a joint venture between Brazilian and U.S.-based  investors, said on Tuesday it will build its second corn-based ethanol plant in Brazil’s top grains-producing state of Mato Grosso. FS Bioenergia, the first venture to build a 100 percent corn-based ethanol plant in Brazil - where basically all ethanol is made from sugar cane - said it will spend 1 billion reais ($308 million) on the project. The announcement reinforces an investment trend in Brazil’s center-west region toward corn-based ethanol production capacity, as low corn prices in the area and rising ethanol demand in the country attract investors. UNEM, a local association of corn ethanol producers, sees six new corn-based ethanol projects being developed in the next two years. FS Bioenergia is owned by privately-held Brazilian firm Tapajós Participações SA and U.S.-based Summit Agricultural Group. Last year, the companies opened their first plant, located in Lucas do Rio Verde, a top soy- and corn-producing part of Mato Grosso. For the second project, FS Bioenergia followed the same strategy and chose the municipality of Sorriso, in northern Mato Grosso, which is also a large grains-producing region. “The Sorriso area and Mato Grosso in general are strategic for us. They will provide the raw material we need to produce ethanol and (corn) meal with the quality we seek,” FS Bioenergia Chief Executive Henrique Ubrig said in a statement. The Sorriso plant will be larger than the first one in Lucas do Rio Verde. The investors project an annual production of 680 million liters of ethanol, 500,000 tonnes of corn meal and 20,000 tonnes of corn oil. The plant is expected to process 1.8 million tonnes of corn per year. Brazil’s Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi has encouraged that type of investment in the center-west region, saying it would provide the demand it needs for its growing corn production. The government has subsidized the transportation of corn from center-west states to markets in other parts of the country as a way to support prices and help farmers. When the second plant is ready, FS Bioenergia projects that it will process 3.1 million tonnes of corn per year in Mato Grosso, which currently produces around 26 million tonnes of the cereal per crop. $1 = 3.25 Brazilian reais

2018-02-20,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Audi (NSUG.DE) Chief Executive Rupert Stadler has rejected suggestions he is about to be ousted and believes he has the support of parent company Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), a German newspaper reported on Tuesday. “It is not possible to stop that speculation from coming up again and again,” Stadler was quoted as telling the Handelsblatt daily, adding that he feels “very clearly” that he has the support of the leadership of Volkswagen. Audi Chairman Matthias Mueller, who is also CEO of parent company Volkswagen, appealed to workers last week to ignore a media report that Stadler was about to be removed. German tabloid Bild reported that Stadler would leave in April because of his handling of the diesel emissions affair, in which Audi played a prominent role, adding Stadler would however be given a new role as VW group finance chief. Volkswagen has repeatedly attempted to draw a line under a scandal that broke out in 2015 when it admitted cheating diesel-emission tests in the United States to conceal the amount of noxious gases emitted by some of its vehicles. Stadler said the diesel scandal would continue to plague the company: “Of course, I am aware that the legal proceedings will continue to occupy us for some time.” But he added that he and his management team had enough space to focus on the company’s future strategy: “We are doing that with great passion.” Stadler ran finance at Audi for four years before becoming CEO in 2007. He was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of Volkswagen’s controlling clan who was himself ousted in 2015. His position as CEO has been questioned before but so far Audi’s board has rallied around him.

2018-02-20,"ABUJA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s state oil firm said on Tuesday it had spent $5.8 billion on fuel imports since late 2017, as it combats a fuel shortage that has left people queuing for hours at filling stations and hobbled an already-struggling economy. “The corporation’s intervention became necessary following the inability of the major and independent marketers to import the product because of the high landing cost which made cost recovery and profitability difficult,” the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said in a statement. The price of gasoline is a highly charged subject in Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil exporter. President Muhammadu Buhari in 2016 raised the top gasoline price to 145 naira ($0.4603) per litre, a 67 percent hike, but did not remove a cap for fear of hurting people on low incomes. The price cap makes it tough for many importers to profit from gasoline and NNPC has imported as much as 90 percent of the nation’s gasoline needs over the past year. Fuel shortages have gripped much of the country in the last few months. An economic body that advises Nigeria’s government has been in discussion with the state oil company to determine whether gasoline is appropriately priced in the country, a state governor said last week. The relatively cheaper cost of Nigerian fuel combined with crude oil price rises in the last few months mean smugglers can make more money selling fuel intended for the Nigerian market across borders, creating shortages in the West African giant. Nigeria’s refining system means it is almost wholly reliant on imports for the 40 million litres per day of gasoline it consumes. Efforts by Buhari’s predecessor, Goodluck Jonathan, to end expensive subsidies in 2012 led to riots in the streets because the move would have doubled gasoline prices, angering citizens who see cheap pump prices as the only benefit from living in an oil-rich country.

2018-02-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Sanctions should be stepped up against Venezuela’s leaders and oil sector in response to the country’s repressive political climate, the head of the Organisation of American States (OAS) said on Tuesday. Under President Nicolas Maduro, “dictatorship has become more tyrannical” and the suffering of its 30 million people has increased amid dire shortages of food and medicine, said Luis Almagro.  “Sanctions have to become harsher, this is the way to move forward. Those against dictatorship should unite,” the secretary general of the 34-member OAS told a Geneva human rights forum organised by UN Watch, a non-governmental organisation.  “We must apply sanctions, harsher ones. We must starve the regime financially.” Sanctions have so far focussed on individual members of Maduro’s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. Restrictions on Venezuela’s all-important oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member state. Almagro, asked by Reuters to elaborate on his remarks, later told reporters: “The sanctions should be not only personal sanctions, but sanctions also against the regime itself.  “That makes it necessary of course to target oil production, it makes it necessary to target the family of the dictators, it makes it necessary to target money-laundering.” Maduro will stand for re-election in April in a ballot opposition leaders plan to boycott. Critics say it is a farce, with his main rivals barred from standing and a compliant election body bound to favour the ruling socialists.  Maduro denies the system is undemocratic and calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said two weeks ago at the end of a five-nation tour of Latin America that the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil.  Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian minister of justice serving on an OAS panel investigating alleged crimes against humanity in Venezuela, said it would report its findings next month. “We heard compelling witness testimony and we received documentary evidence of extrajudicial executions and widespread systematic attacks on civilians as a matter of state policy,” Cotler told the forum.

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares rose on Tuesday thanks to a slew of well-received results, though banks were a weak spot after HSBC (HSBA.L) reported weaker than expected earnings and said it needed as much as $7 billion of fresh capital.  The pan-regional STOXX 600  benchmark ended the session with a gain of 0.6 percent, while the banking index .SX7P declined 0.1 percent. A weaker euro also helped euro zone stocks make headway after a lacklustre start to the week.     HSBC dropped 3 percent after its trading update, the last under outgoing CEO Stuart Gulliver, who has pushed through a painful restructuring of Europe’s biggest bank by market value.  Credit Suisse analysts said HSBC’s pledge to undertake share buybacks “as and when appropriate” could mark a change in capital-return strategy by the new management.  Elsewhere, some positive earnings buoyed sentiment.  Edenred (EDEN.PA) was among top performers, rising 6.5 percent after the French provider of prepaid meal vouchers and cards reported record 2017 earnings, increased its dividend and expressed confidence for 2018. Danish software developer Simcorp (SIM.CO) led the STOXX index with a 12.2 percent rise after its full-year results.  Energy stocks supported indices, with BP (BP.L), Total (TOTF.PA), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and ENI (ENI.MI) up between 0.2 percent and 1.6 percent. Among regional indexes, London’s FTSE 100 was flat, with the world’s biggest miner, BHP BLT.L, joining HSBC among fallers as it dropped by 4.6 percent after missing results forecasts.  InterContinental Hotels (IHG.L) fell 2.7 percent after putting shareholder payouts on ice as it pursues a new strategy to accelerate growth.  Swiss financial software company Temenos (TEMN.S) was 6 percent lower after news that it was in talks to buy British rival Fidessa Group FDSA.L for about 1.4 billion pounds.

2018-02-20,"CARACAS (Reuters) - The vice president of Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party on Tuesday proposed holding an early congressional election alongside the April 22 presidential vote, a move that could shorten the tenure of the currently opposition-run legislature. Venezuela’s opposition won control of the National Assembly in a 2015 landslide vote that was their biggest electoral victory in nearly two decades of socialist government. But President Nicolas Maduro and the pro-government judiciary rendered the congress toothless by striking down all its measures. Authorities held a controversial vote to set up instead a new all-powerful superbody Constituent Assembly, which a raft of foreign nations have refused to recognise. Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello, a hardline stalwart of Maduro’s government, told state TV that a new National Assembly vote was needed “in the national interest” because the opposition-run body was idle.  “Our country needs to take decisions. If it wasn’t for the Constituent Assembly, the country would be paralysed,” Cabello said. In the past, his proposals have quickly gone to the entirely pro-government Constituent Assembly for rubber-stamping. Critics blasted Cabello’s proposal to bring forward the next congressional vote, which had been due in 2020. They viewed it as a further attempt to crush opposition in a nation they say the socialists have turned into a dictatorship.   Henri Falcon, a former socialist supporter who crossed to the opposition and is mulling running in the April 22 election, chided Cabello for his comments. “This hardly contributes to the climate of calm and security the nation is demanding faced with an upcoming election,” Falcon told reporters, adding that both the pro-government national election board and the Constituent Assembly lacked legitimacy in the eyes of most Venezuelans and the world. The opposition coalition is expected to boycott the April presidential poll, because they believe it is rigged to ensure Maduro’s re-election despite his unpopularity and a crushing national economic crisis. The opposition’s most popular leaders are banned from standing: Leopoldo Lopez is under house arrest while Henrique Capriles is prohibited from holding office for alleged “administrative irregularities” when a state governor.  Capriles’ Justice First party became the second major opposition party to announce formally it would boycott the presidential vote given the lack of fair conditions.  “We have decided not to participate in a fraudulent process ... the electoral farce,” it said in a communique on Tuesday. “Noone will shift us from the democratic track but we’re not going to play the game of a dictatorship clinging to power to the detriment of Venezuela’s suffering people.” Maduro, a former bus driver and foreign minister, was narrowly elected president in 2013 to replace the late Hugo Chavez. He says he is fighting a U.S.-led international right-wing conspiracy to topple socialism and win control of Venezuela’s oil wealth. He accuses Justice First and other opposition groups of being fronts for violent coup-plotters.

2018-02-20,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas company Energen Corp EGN.N, under pressure from Keith Meister-led Corvex Management to sell itself, reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, but its expectations for oil production this year fell short of analysts’ estimates. The company also said on Tuesday it would review biggest shareholder Corvex’s recent nominations to its board. Last month, the activist hedge fund, which owns almost 10 percent of Energen, proposed four candidates to the board. Activism in the U.S. oil and gas sector has increased as investors get impatient and look for ways to increase the value of energy companies, hurt by the oil crash of 2014. Energen has been shedding non-core assets for five years to concentrate on the Permian basin, which has the highest oil production in the United States. The company on Tuesday set a three-year timeline to better production. The company said it expects to spend in the range of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion for drilling and development in 2020 as part of that plan, up from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion expected in 2018. The plan assumes an allocation split of 50-50 between Delaware and Midland, two of the main portions of the Permian basin, Chief Executive James McManus said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Energen said it expects to produce 555,000-585,000 barrels of oil per day (bbl/d) in 2018. Analysts on average were expecting the Alabama-based company to produce 626,500 bbl/d, according to Thomson Reuters data. The company’s shares, which fell more than 3 percent after the production forecast, were marginally up at $52.36 in late morning trade. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, Energen said it produced 974,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), up from 535,000 boe/d a year earlier. The company posted a net profit of $262.4 million, or $2.68 per share, in the quarter, compared with a loss of $54.5 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter saw a tax benefit of $240.1 million from changes in the U.S. tax code. Excluding items, Energen earned 63 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 42 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-02-20,"(Adds detail, quotes) By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Prospects for the offshore oil drilling market are improving but profits for drillers are still under pressure and rates will not rise before 2019, the head of A.P. Moller-Maersk’s energy business said. Oil firms have seen cash flow climb in 2017 a high since a three-year slump in crude prices, lifted by their cost-cutting plans and a crude price recovery. Although this has spurred new investment, it has yet to benefit suppliers, such as Maersk, which sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business to France’s Total last year and now focuses on providing transport and logistics. “You see from the oil companies’ 2016 and 2017 earnings that they’ve performed really well. You also see that they have started increasing capital expenditure,” Claus Hemmingsen told Reuters on the sidelines of Maersk’s capital markets day. “But one of the reasons that they’re faring better is also because they’ve put an enormous pressure on their suppliers,” the CEO of the energy unit said, adding “profitability is still low and under pressure” for suppliers. Hemmingsen said the industry could see a “small uptick” in business this year, with increased demand for jack-up rigs for shallow waters, although there was still little sign of a boost in demand for deepwater rigs. “We believe the market in 2018 will still be under pressure,” he said. “I think day rates will start increasing in 2019 and 2020 but we don’t expect the offshore services market to come back to the level before the oil price crashed.” Oil prices plunged from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 at the start of 2016. They are now at about $65. Hemmingsen said Maersk was still seeking a buyer or partner for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, but did not indicate how far the search had progressed. Danish business daily Borsen reported in January that Maersk might be looking to peers Norwegian peers Aker, Odfjell Drilling and Borr Drilling to sell the unit. Hemmingsen declined to comment on the report.

2018-02-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - South Korea has launched a wide-ranging complaint at the World Trade Organization to challenge the U.S. use of anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties, citing their use on steel and transformers, a WTO filing showed on Tuesday.  The United States has 60 days to settle the issue, after which time South Korea could ask the WTO to adjudicate. The complaint targets U.S. trade laws that pre-date the administration of President Donald Trump, but it adds to the friction already stoked by Trump’s policy of putting “America first”, which is widely seen as protectionist.   Washington is already wrestling with a WTO case brought by Canada that challenges the foundations of U.S. trade law, and is fighting China’s claim to be treated as a “market economy”, a designation that could stymie U.S. defenses against Beijing. Meanwhile Trump has thrown the whole WTO dispute settlement process into crisis by blocking the appointment of new appeals judges, threatening to halt the workings of a system that has refereed global commerce for almost quarter of a century.   South Korea filed its complaint on Feb. 14, challenging anti-dumping duties of up to 60.81 percent that were slapped on South Korean steel products and transformers in May 2016. Its Trade Ministry said last week that applying “Adverse Facts Available” (AFA) rules allowed the United States to unfairly levy high anti-dumping duties without thoroughly verifying data available to it. Last May, in a dispute with China, the WTO appeals judges ruled that the use of AFA could be challenged in a dispute, although there was not enough evidence to challenge them in the Chinese case. The South Korean complaint made no mention of recent trade friction over the U.S. imposition of “safeguard” duties on solar panels and washing machines. Seoul has asked Washington for compensation in that case, a demand that could potentially be undermined if it became the subject of a dispute. The European Union, China, Taiwan and Japan have also demanded compensation for those U.S. safeguard duties.

2018-02-20,"* Tensions running high over tax bill * Rio Tinto, Turquoise Hill say are assessing options By Terrence Edwards ULAANBAATAR, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Mongolia can build a power plant at its Tavan Tolgoi coal mine by 2021 to supply the Oyu Tolgoi copper project, energy officials said on Tuesday, as the government seeks to hold Rio Tinto  to an agreement to use Mongolian power. Tensions have mounted between the Mongolian government and its fellow shareholders in Oyu Tolgoi, where Rio Tinto is operating a huge underground extension. Last week, Rio Tinto said it was working with its partners to find a solution after the government announced the cancellation of a contract, which Rio interpreted as meaning the Tavan Tolgoi power project was no longer viable. Mongolia’s Energy Minister Tserenpil Davaasuren said on Tuesday a cooperation agreement with a party called South Gobi Energy had been cancelled, but a plant at the Tavan Tolgoi coal mine was still in development. Oyu Tolgoi had “the responsibility to choose total energy demand for Oyu Tolgoi from Mongolia within four years,” he said. D. Batbileg, director of the Tavantolgoi Power Plant Project, addressing the same news conference said construction work was “ready to begin”. Local media reported the government was seeking guarantees from Rio Tinto before going ahead. Rio Tinto was not immediately available to comment. Its statement last week said it was working on all options, including the construction of a power plant at Oyu Tolgoi whose cost would be finalised between shareholders. The mine is jointly owned by the government of Mongolia, with 34 percent, and Turquoise Hill Resources with 66 percent. Turquoise Hill is in turn 51 percent-owned by Rio Tinto. Turquoise Hill also said it was evaluating its options. “A final decision on the outcome, cost or financing of a permanent domestic power supply has not been concluded at this time,” an emailed statement said. Tensions over tax and benefits to the country held up an expansion project for underground mining to tap into most of the resource in 2013. Construction resumed after May 2015, when the parties signed a new agreement. But the international partners are again at odds with the government following a claim from the Mongolian Tax Authority for an additional $155 million for the years 2013 through 2015.

Pressured by higher yields, Wall Street’s main equity indexes fell after six straight days of gains as the market reopened following the Presidents’ Day holiday on Monday. Shares of the world’s biggest brick-and-mortar retailer Walmart slumped more than 9 percent after the company reported a lower-than-expected profit and a sharp drop in online sales growth during the holiday period. Shares of other retail majors Target and Costco Wholesale also fell, dragging the S&P consumer staples index down 1.93 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 188.27 points, or 0.75 percent, to 25,031.11, the S&P 500 lost 10.19 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,722.03 and the Nasdaq Composite added 11.76 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,251.23. World equity markets also sank, with the MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shedding 0.42 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.58 percent, and Asian stocks were also subdued. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.38 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.01 percent. European shares held steady, supported by softer domestic currencies. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.22 percent. Investors looking to the greenback shrugged off worries about the U.S. budget deficit, focusing on large U.S. government debt auctions this week and sending the dollar higher. “What we are seeing is just a little bit of profit-taking (in other currencies), a little bit of bargain-hunting,” said Omer Esiner, chief market strategist with Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. “Given the focus on the deficit, the dependence on foreign investment, I think we will have to see relatively strong demand at these auctions,” he said. U.S. Treasury yields rose on Tuesday, with the benchmark 10-year yield hovering near a four-year peak as investors made room for this week’s deluge of $258 billion of government debt supply. The dollar index, tracking the unit against key world currencies, rose 0.59 percent, continuing its rebound from three-year lows. The euro was last 0.51 percent lower at $1.2344. The stronger dollar and uncertainty about big Treasury auctions weighed on gold prices, which dropped for a third session. Spot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,338.00 an ounce. The dollar’s rebound also meant most emerging market currencies were under pressure. South Africa’s rand and Turkey’s lira both gave back more of their recent gains, while growing concerns about fraud at India’s second-largest state-run bank sent the rupee skidding to a near three-month low. U.S. crude rose 0.31 percent to $61.74 per barrel. However, Brent was last at $65.12, down 0.84 percent on the day, under pressure from a stronger dollar and a bout of profit taking.

2018-02-20,"GENEVA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Sanctions should be stepped up against Venezuela’s leaders and oil sector in response to the country’s repressive political climate, the head of the Organisation of American States (OAS) said on Tuesday. Under President Nicolas Maduro, “dictatorship has become more tyrannical” and the suffering of its 30 million people has increased amid dire shortages of food and medicine, said Luis Almagro. “Sanctions have to become harsher, this is the way to move forward. Those against dictatorship should unite,” the secretary general of the 34-member OAS told a Geneva human rights forum organised by UN Watch, a non-governmental organisation. “We must apply sanctions, harsher ones. We must starve the regime financially.” Sanctions have so far focused on individual members of Maduro’s government and a ban on buying new Venezuelan debt. Restrictions on Venezuela’s all-important oil industry would represent an escalation of financial pressure on the OPEC member state. Almagro, asked by Reuters to elaborate on his remarks on sanctions, later told reporters: “The sanctions should be not only personal sanctions, but sanctions also against the regime itself. And that is to affect the conditions with which the regime operates. “That makes it necessary of course to target oil production, it makes it necessary to target the family of the dictators, it makes it necessary to target money-laundering.” Maduro will stand for re-election in April in a ballot opposition leaders plan to boycott. Critics say it is a farce, with Maduro’s main rivals barred from standing and a compliant election body bound to favour the ruling socialists. Maduro denies the system is undemocratic. Maduro’s government calls the OAS a pawn of U.S. policy and dismisses Almagro, a former Uruguayan foreign minister once friendly with Venezuela’s socialists, as a turncoat working for Washington. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said two weeks ago at the end of a five-nation tour of Latin America that the United States was closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil.

2018-02-20,"TOULOUSE, France (Reuters) - Airbus got a boost for its largest twin-engined jet on Tuesday when Qatar Airways said it was considering upgrading some of its A350 orders to the largest model as it took delivery of the first such plane. The A350-1000 is designed to seat 366 people and competes head-to-head with Boeing’s profitable 777. The first A350-1000 was handed over to the Gulf carrier on Tuesday, joining the smaller A350-900, which has been in service for three years. Airbus says the lightweight A350-1000 is 25 percent more efficient than the most popular current version of the 777, the 777-300ER.  But sales of the 777-300ER have picked up, and Boeing is working on plans to leapfrog the A350-1000 with an upgraded 777X boasting over 400 seats.  Boeing last year sold 32 777-300ERs against just one order for the A350-1000. Some airlines have begun downgrading some A350-1000 orders to the 325-seat A350-900. Qatar Airways, which has ordered both the A350-1000 and the 777X, indicated it was moving in the opposite direction and said it could shift more of its A350 orders to the largest model. “There is a possibility that we could convert some of the 900s to the 1000,” Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said. Qatar is the top A350 customer with 76 on order, including 37 A350-1000s, which have a list price of $367 million.  It recently canceled four A350-900 orders following delays,  but subsequently re-committed to the new European jet family. The prospect of upgrades will come as a relief to Airbus,  which is gambling on the A350-1000 to contain any market pressure from the 777 as Boeing develops its new model. Last summer, the European planemaker shelved tentative plans for an even bigger A350 that would compete more directly with Boeing’s planned 777X. Fabrice Bregier, speaking on his last day as Airbus chief operating officer, said on Tuesday studies had shown the idea worked in principle, but that Airbus would focus instead on pushing the A350-1000. “It’s now time to start to be more aggressive and to explain to our customers, or Boeing’s customers, that this aircraft will  be a better choice than a 777-9X,” Bregier said. Boeing insists that its jet will be the world’s most efficient  aircraft in its category, thanks to new wings. Baker said Qatar Airways, one of the world’s major fleet buyers, is not interested in an ultra-long-haul version of the A350-900 being floated by Airbus for carriers like Qantas (QAN.AX) but could buy more of regular A350 jets. “Yes, there may in future be a requirement for more of these airplanes for Qatar Airways, especially when we do further enhancements of our acquisitions,” he said. “And of course there is a probability we will buy more of these airplanes to put in our leasing company.” He also ruled out orders for the largest and smallest Airbus jets - whether the 544-seat A380, of which it has bought 10 and has options for another three, or the Bombardier (BBDb.TO) CSeries, a 110 to 130-seater that Airbus agreed to rescue last year.

2018-02-20,"(Updates share price, adds CEO on capex, refinery stoppages) By Andrei Khalip LISBON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia expects largely flat pre-tax earnings this year after a 32 percent increase in 2017 as production growth slows. The company said it still aims to boost output by more than 50 percent by 2020, but its shares fell almost 3 percent after it released its outlook at a capital markets day on Tuesday, even though Galp also proposed increasing its dividend payout for 2017 by 10 percent to 0.55 euros a share. The shares later recovered to trade just 0.2 percent lower. The company said it expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.8 billion-1.9 billion euros this year, after last year’s 1.87 billion. Unlike last year, it would not provide a five-year EBITDA growth outlook, which it last put at 20 percent a year until 2021. This year, Galp expects to increase output by 15-20 percent after last year’s 38 percent jump. In the final quarter of 2017, production exceeded 100,000 bpd for the first time, driving net profit 54 percent higher in the quarter to 186 million euros, the company said in a separate results statement. EBITDA rose 24 percent in the quarter and 32 percent for all of last year, exceeding Galp’s initial guidance for 2017 of up to 1.6 billion euros. Galp estimated capital expenditure at up to 1.1 billion euros this year and at around 1 billion euros on average per year until 2020 in a slight shift from the previous outlook, which put it in range of 0.8 billion to 1 billion euros. “Capex guidance seems somewhat disappointing considering the expectations for savings with ongoing efficiencies in Brazil,” BPI analysts said in a note. But CEO Carlos Gomes da Silva said this year’s capex included two refinery stoppages for maintenance, an increased exposure to the BM-S-8 project in Brazil after Galp raised its stake there to 17 percent from 14 percent, and investment in the adjacent North Carcara area. Expenses related to maintenance works alone - one already completed in a shorter-than-scheduled 30 days at the Sines refinery and another due in the fourth quarter in Matosinhos - should amount to up to 70 million euros. Additional expenditure on the Brazilian projects is seen at more than 200 million. “We will be very selective, very rigorous in terms of capex, always sticking to our target of 15 percent of return on capital employed,” Carlos Gomes told analysts. When questioned about the decision to raise the dividend, he said the improved performance last year and better market conditions meant “that we are almost obliged to share the gains with shareholders”, adding that Galp saw the potential to further increase dividends in the future. The company plans to boost output to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020. Most of Galp’s production growth will come from Brazil, where it has stakes in large offshore oil fields and continues to look for expansion opportunities. From 2020 onwards it plans to add new projects in Mozambique and Brazil which should boost the share of natural gas output to up to 30 percent of its total output, from around 20 percent now. Galp expects free cash flow of over 1 billion euros by 2020, up from 600 million last year, and said it should break even at oil prices around $25 a barrel shortly after 2020, down from a break-even price of $35 in its previous forecast.

2018-02-20,"OSLO (Reuters) - Sea levels will rise between 0.7 and 1.2 metres (27-47 inches) in the next two centuries even if governments end the fossil fuel era as promised under the Paris climate agreement, scientists said on Tuesday. Early action to cut greenhouse gas emissions would limit the long-term rise, driven by a thaw of ice from Greenland to Antarctica that will re-draw global coastlines, a German-led team wrote in the journal Nature Communications. Sea level rise is a threat to cities from Shanghai to London, to low-lying swathes of Florida or Bangladesh, and to entire nations such as the Maldives in the Indian Ocean or Kiribati in the Pacific. By 2300, the report projected that sea levels would gain by 0.7-1.2 metres, even if almost 200 nations fully meet goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which include cutting greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in the second half of this century. Ocean levels will rise inexorably because heat-trapping industrial gases already emitted will linger in the atmosphere, melting more ice, it said. In addition, water naturally expands as it warms above four degrees Celsius (39.2°F). The report also found that every five years of delay beyond 2020 in peaking global emissions would mean an extra 20 centimetres (8 inches) of sea level rise by 2300. “Sea level is often communicated as a really slow process that you can’t do much about ... but the next 30 years really matter,” lead author Matthias Mengel, of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, told Reuters. Governments are not on track to meet the Paris pledges. Global emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas emitted by burning fossil fuels, rose last year after a three-year plateau. And U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts that human activities are the prime cause of warming, plans to quit the Paris deal and instead promote U.S. coal, oil and natural gas. Maldives Environment Minister Thoriq Ibrahim, who chairs the 44-member Alliance of Small Island States, said Tuesday’s findings showed a need for faster action to cut emissions, especially by rich nations. “Unfortunately, the study confirms what small island nations have been saying for years: decades of procrastination on climate change have brought many of us to the brink of inundation,” he told Reuters. Professor John Church, of the Climate Change Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who was not involved in the study, said 100 million people now live within one metre of the high tide mark. “More people are moving to live within the coastal zone, increasing the vulnerable population and infrastructure,” he said in a statement. “Adaptation to sea level rise will be essential.” Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-seas/seas-to-rise-about-a-metre-even-if-climate-goals-are-met-study-idUKL8N1Q93L2,20 Feb 2018,"Sea levels will rise between 0.7

2018-02-20,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) reported adjusted quarterly profit on Tuesday that easily beat analyst estimates due to cost cuts and higher crude prices, sending shares surging more than 7 percent in morning trading. The results came as Noble’s U.S. shale oil production jumped in the fourth quarter through Dec. 31, reflecting the greater attention the industry is giving to improving profit and output. Houston-based Noble plans to spend $2.8 billion each year through 2020, about 6 percent more than it spent in 2017.  Much of that will go toward projects in its red-hot U.S. shale portfolio, where better technology should help Noble pump 30 percent more oil this year than in 2017, even as it spends less per well, the company said. Noble posted quarterly net income of $494 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with a loss of $252 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Noble earned 32 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 4 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The results delivered in 2017 provide significant momentum as we enter 2018 and deliver growing value for shareholders,” Chief Executive David Stover said in a statement. If oil prices stay at or above $50 per barrel, Noble said it could generate $1.5 billion in extra cash flow in total through 2020.     A rise in global crude prices, led by OPEC cuts, has prompted oil and gas companies to ramp up production. U.S. crude prices CLc1 averaged $55.30 per barrel in the last quarter of 2017, up 12.2 percent from a year earlier. Noble’s total operating expenses nearly halved to $740 million in the quarter, as exploration costs sank 90 percent. Total sales volumes from U.S. onshore rose 40.5 percent to 104,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and prices realized per barrel rose by $7.14.    Noble’s total revenue surged 19 percent to $1.2 billion.  Shares jumped 7 percent to $28.15 in morning trading as oil prices fell. [O/R]   On Monday, Noble, along with its operating partner Delek Drilling (DEDRp.TA) signed a 10-year agreement to sell $15 billion worth of Israeli natural gas to Egyptian company Dolphinus Holdings. Last month, Noble sold a 7.5 percent stake in the Tamar natural gas field offshore Israel to Tamar Petroleum Ltd (TMRP.TA) for about $800 million in cash and shares, to comply with government plans to open the market to competition.

2018-02-20,"OSLO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Norwegian state-owned utility Statkraft said it may have to put on hold some planned investments if the tax office goes ahead with a 4 billion crown ($511 million) claim for unaccounted taxes. Statkraft said previously that it received a preliminary claim from the Norwegian tax office in October for unpaid taxes relating to the capital structure of its now closed Belgian unit Statkraft Treasury Centre SA (STC). If the tax office formalises the claim, Statkraft would have to pay the amount immediately, meaning it would lose about a third of its record 2017 available cash, earned by selling all its offshore wind assets. “Statkraft strongly disagrees that there is a legal basis for any reassessment ... A possible tax claim could affect Statkraft’s future financial capacity,” Statkraft spokesman Lars Magnus Gunther said on Tuesday, when asked about the possible consequences to investments of the tax claim. “There is no formal decision yet ... (but) it will be possible to take it to court if necessary,” he added. The utility last week reported record high cash and cash equivalents of 14.2 billion crowns, as of the end of its 2017 fiscal year, most of it intended to fund planned investments in onshore renewable energy projects. Gunther said the company had no indication of when the tax authorities would make a final decision and had not made any relevant provisions in its balance sheet. The Norwegian tax office found the company was not compliant with the “arm’s length principle,” Statkraft said its 2017 annual results statement. The tax reassessment regards STC’s income tax returns for the fiscal years 2008-2014 and the total financial exposure until 2017 is seen at 4 billion Norwegian crowns, the firm calculated. Norway’s tax authority declined to comment on Statkraft’s case. Speaking generally, it said that any company that receives a tax claim has to pay the full tax immediately. “Such claims must be paid immediately (irrespective of any ongoing appeals, litigation, etc. in relation to the tax claim),” Astrid Dugstad Tveter, head of corporate law at Norway’s tax office, told Reuters in an email. The arm’s length principle applies to transactions between related parties. It states that the amount charged by one related party to another for a given product must be the same as if the parties were not related, said Tveter. Failure to comply with this principle can provide a basis for reassessment, it said.

2018-02-20,"(Repeats to notify subscribers TV is available, no changes to text) By George Obulutsa NAIROBI, Feb 19 (Reuters) - State-run Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) plans to add 1,745 megawatts (MW) of electricity from geothermal sources by 2025, part of a government push to end power generation from fossil fuels. “You are aware that going forward, the government policy which all generators including KenGen and including independent power producers, is to eliminate generation from fossil fuels,” Moses Wekesa, Business Development Director, said during a visit to KenGen’s geothermal plants last week. Kenya has an installed generating capacity of 2,370 MW and peak demand of about 1,770 MW. Of this, KenGen, which is 70 percent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW, with 533 MW from geothermal. Demand for electricity is growing at about 8 percent per year until 2020, and will rise to 9 percent in 2021, after which it will stabilise at 7 percent, according to the government’s transmission and generation plan. “First as a rule of thumb, your supply must always be ahead of demand. The reason being, that it takes a while to put up a power plant,” Wekesa said. The East African nation is ramping up electricity production and investing in its grid to keep up with growing demand for power and to reduce frequent blackouts. It relies heavily on renewables such as geothermal and hydro power. Kenya is ranked at No.37 worldwide by Ernst and Young’s latest Renewable energy country attractiveness index, issued in October. The Geothermal Resources Council ranks Kenya at no.8 worldwide in terms of installed capacity from geothermal.

2018-02-20,"(Corrects official’s title in first paragraph) BUCHAREST, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Romania could almost double its natural gas production to about 20 billion cubic metres a year by 2025, helped by new offshore discoveries in the Black Sea, one of the general directors of the National Agency for Mineral Resources (ANRM), Sorin Gal, said on Tuesday. Unlike other countries in the region, Romania is almost entirely energy independent. The European Union state imports less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, largely by state producer Romgaz and OMV Petrom, controlled by Austria’s OMV . “We produce 10-11 billion cubic metres and consume about as much,” Gal told an energy seminar. “Production will rise to 18-20 billion cubic metres by 2025. Gas producers are looking for markets and buyers.” Gal also said he had information that neighbouring Ukraine could privatise its national gas transport network within 18 months, with U.S. investors showing interest, adding that Romanian producers could find a new market there. Two companies could be producing natural gas offshore in Romanian Black Sea waters by 2021, he said. Black Sea Oil & Gas, controlled by private equity firm Carlyle Group LP, has almost finalised its project and could start producing roughly 1 billion cubic metres of gas per year by the start of 2020 at the latest. Meanwhile, a joint venture of OMV Petrom and ExxonMobil could start extracting 6 billion cubic metres per year in 2020-2021, Gal said. Petrom and Exxon have yet to announce an investment decision on their Domino-1 well where they have said they have discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic metres (bcm)) of gas reserves. “By the end of November 2018, Exxon should express an intention to ... develop the project,” Gal said. “By 2020-2021 they will probably also start production.” Russia’s second-largest oil company Lukoil, in a partnership with state-owned Romgaz, has also made a discovery and could start production two years after Exxon, he added. Gal said official estimates showed Romania could gain 2.8 billion euros ($3.45 billion) in royalty taxes from its offshore gas overall in the next 20 years, based on current prices and discoveries. In addition, Romgaz and Petrom were digging wells onshore at depths of 5,000 metres or more, with the possibility of new discoveries. Romania plans to start work this year on its section of a new EU-backed natural gas pipeline to connect Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Austria and ease reliance on Russian gas.

2018-02-20,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) plans to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS (UPS.N) and Fedex (FDX.N) as it expands its transport and logistics business, its chief executive said on Tuesday. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, sold its North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August to France’s Total (TOTF.PA) in a $7.5 billion (5.37 billion pounds) deal in August as it focuses on transport and logistics.  As part of its restructuring, Maersk aims to expand its services to all parts of the supply chain, giving customers the chance to deal with one firm when shipping goods from one side  of the world to another. “We’re building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,” CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday. “I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,” he added. The capital markets day was being held less than two weeks after the world’s largest container shipping firm missed profit forecasts and gave what analysts saw as a conservative outlook. Maersk has acknowledged that despite handling one in seven containers globally, being the biggest is no longer enough, as the growth of e-commerce is driving demand for quicker, easier and more flexible shipping. “Our customers businesses are to a large extent changing, they are being disrupted by new technologies, by e-commerce and new ways of doing things,” said Maersk’s chief commercial officer Vincent Clerc. Maersk is betting that a digital drive, in which it for example has teamed up with IBM (IBM.N) to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform, will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas such as freight forwarding and trade finance. However, on Tuesday investors were left with little detail on Maersk plans to monetise the blockchain project or how it will use the proceeds from breaking up the conglomerate. Shares in Maersk were trading 4.6 percent lower at 10,400 Danish crowns at 1420 GMT, below the August level when the Total sale was announced and around same level as when it announced its new strategy in September 2016.  “Many had hoped for something more specific for example with regards to how the proceeds from the sale of Maersk Oil will be distributed,” said Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard of the fall in share price. The firm still aims to find solutions this year for its offshore drilling and supply service unit, which is being valued at $4.7 billion and $0.6 billion respectively according to analysts’ consensus.

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - The emergence of self-driving electric cars and travel sharing are set to dent oil consumption by 2040, oil and gas giant BP (BP.L) said, forecasting a peak in demand for the first time. In its benchmark annual Energy Outlook, BP forecast a 100-fold growth in electric vehicles by 2040, with its chief economist Spencer Dale painting a world in which we travel much more but instead of using private cars, we increasingly share trips in autonomous vehicles. While travel demand more than doubles over the period as economies in countries such as China and India grow, higher oil demand will be more than offset by increased engine efficiency standards as well as the larger number of EVs and shared traveling. Unlike many other forecasts, including previous BP Energy Outlooks, which looked solely at the growing share of EVs in the car fleet, BP this year focused on the share of vehicles kilometers powered by electricity. Under BP’s Evolving Transition scenario, which assumes that policies and technology continue to evolve at a speed similar to that seen in the recent past, some 30 percent of car kilometers are powered by electricity by 2040 from almost zero in 2016.  At the same time, the number of EVs is set to increase from 3 million today to over 320 million by 2040, representing roughly 15 percent out of a total car fleet of 2 billion. The gap between the increasing number of EVs on the road and the kilometers powered by electricity is due to the expected growth in so-called shared mobility by EVs, Dale said. “Cars will be used much more intensely over time,” Dale told reporters in a briefing on Monday ahead of the release of the report on Tuesday. As a result, fuel demand from the car fleet is forecast to dip to 18.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2040 from 18.7 million bpd in 2016, when it represented around one fifth of total oil demand, according to BP.    BP expects autonomous vehicles to become available in the early 2020s. Their initial high cost means the vast majority of the cars will be bought by fleets offering shared mobility services. The average electric car is expected to be driven about two and a half times more than an internal combustion car, according to Dale.  “What we expect to see in the 2030s is a huge growth in shared mobility autonomous cars ... Once you don’t have to pay for a driver, the cost of taking one of those share mobility fleets services will fall by about 40 or 50 percent,” Dale said. The vast majority of the shared mobility is expected to be EVs because of their lower maintenance costs.   Car makers including General Motors (GM.N) and high-tech giants such as Google Waymo and Uber Technologies have poured billions into the autonomous vehicles industry hoping gain a first-mover advantage. Robo-taxi services are seen as the main use for most self-driving vehicles. BP sharply raised its estimate of growth in electric vehicles in the coming decades from last year’s forecast that EVs would reach 100 million by 2035. The big upwards revision is due to an increase in hybrid cars and an expected sharp growth in EV purchases in the second half of the 2030s, Dale said.  London-based BP joined other oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) in forecasting a peak for oil demand in the late 2030s, when it is expected to slightly decline at around 110 million bpd. It did not foresee a peak in demand in its previous outlooks that stretched into 2035. While the transportation sector will continue to dominate the growth in oil consumption, demand for plastic manufacturing will become the main source of growth in the 2030s.  Oil companies such as BP, Shell and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) are betting on growing demand from the petrochemical sector in the coming decades.  Dale however said changes in regulations for plastics consumption such as stringent policies on plastic bags and packaging could dent oil demand by as much as 2 million bpd, roughly the same as the impact of EVs. Overall energy demand will continue to grow in the coming decades, rising by a third into 2040, or roughly 1.3 percent per year, driven by growth in China and India, but the world is learning to “do more with less energy” as economies become more efficient, Dale said. For example, the European Union’s gross domestic product is set to treble in 2040 from 1975 but the level of energy demand will be the same. China’s energy demand will continue to grow but at a slower pace by the 2030s, when India will become the main driver of growth. BP once again revised upwards its forecast for growth in renewable power, which is set to grow by 40 percent by 2040, with its share in the energy mix increasing from 4 percent to 14 percent.  The revision is due to technological gains as well as more aggressive government policies, particularly in India and China. “There is plenty of scope for policy to continue to surprise us” to further boost the growth in the renewables, Dale said.

2018-02-20,"(Updates to add graphic) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload. Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did. Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets. The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefitted from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years. The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner. More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can’t pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner’s operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015. (For a graphic detailing how PES went bankrupt, see: tmsnrt.rs/2BzYUW2 ) PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner’s collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery’s decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show. PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people. Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner’s bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a “significant” role its collapse. “We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” Corley said. Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill. Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market. The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November. The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council. “The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,” Coleman said. Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings. Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner. The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery. At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity. At the time, U.S. oil production was skyrocketing as improved drilling technology unlocked new reserves in places such as North Dakota. Carlyle saw an opportunity to tap this cheaper supply and wean PES off costly imports. The plan worked well at first, in 2013 and 2014, and PES posted earnings of about $500 million for the two years combined. In January 2015, PES spun off the terminal, creating North Yard as a separate firm. PES then signed a ten-year agreement with North Yard to pay $1.95 for each barrel unloaded and agreed to a minimum quarterly volume of 170,000 bpd, guaranteeing the $30 million quarterly payments to North Yard. For any barrel PES unloaded above the threshold, the refinery paid North Yard 51 cents. The system was designed to reward PES for success, but had no contingency plan to protect the refiner against the failure that would quickly follow the deal. The rail terminal has averaged just 58,000 bpd since the contract was signed, according to figures provided to Reuters by energy intelligence service Genscape, because Carlyle and PES could no longer access crude at prices low enough to make the rail shipments profitable. That left PES paying millions of dollars to Carlyle, through North Yard, for oil shipments it never received. Carlyle’s purchase of PES and the rail terminal investment were bets that U.S. oil would remain cheap relative to imports. A glut of domestic production had caused U.S. crude to sell at a deep discount to imported barrels, with the gap averaging about $8.60 between 2012 and 2015. But by late 2015, an oil price rebound slashed the domestic discount to less than $3 a barrel – not enough to cover the cost of a long rail journey. PES nonetheless continued to pay North Yard a total of $298 million between 2015 until August 2017, filings show. The Carlyle-led investor group received $151 million, in eight distributions, of the total paid to North Yard. In November of that year, PES took on more debt to finance more payouts to investors, borrowing a total of $160 million in two loans against the rail terminal and delivering the proceeds its Carlyle-led backers, filings show. Corley, the PES spokeswoman said terminal investment more than paid for itself during its more profitable period. But for last two years, PES said in filings, the refinery remained largely cut off from the cheap crude it needed to survive. “Perversely, it became cheaper to transport crude oil from North Dakota to points in Western Europe than it was to transport the same crude oil to Philadelphia,” the firm said.

2018-02-20," NEW YORK (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload. Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did. Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets. The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefited from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years. The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner. More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can’t pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner’s operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015. PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner’s collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery’s decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show. PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people. Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner’s bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a “significant” role its collapse. “We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” Corley said. Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill. Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market. The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November. The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council. “The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,” Coleman said. Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings. Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners ETP.N - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner. The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery. At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity.

2018-02-20,"(Corrects title of Kayne Anderson executive in 11th paragraph) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Some publicly-traded U.S. energy pipeline and oil-storage partnerships are restructuring into simpler business models to help attract new investors and spur growth. Rising oil and gas production has spawned billions of dollars of new transport, gathering and storage projects. But the companies most responsible for these projects can allocate up to 50 percent of their income to the general partner, leaving less for other holders or to invest in new projects. Historically, these firms have passed most of their income along to holders and sold equity or debt to finance new projects or acquisitions. But in the last year, what they have had to offer investors has jumped. MPLX Energy Logistics LP, for instance, paid a 9.7 percent annualized distribution last quarter to its holders, up from 7.9 percent a year earlier, according to figures from investment firm East Daley Capital Advisors. “The higher cash yield makes the economics of these projects a little tougher,” said Kendrick Rhea, an analyst at East Daley Capital. He estimates the cost of equity has risen nearly a third for some companies in the last year. NuStar Energy and ArchRock in recent weeks said they would cut income distributions to the general partners and combine units, shifting away from the general and limited partners structures common among energy pipeline and storage firms. Competitor TallGrass Energy in early February said it was considering a similar change. “Removing a layer of complexity makes a lot more investible,” said James Mick, a portfolio manager for Tortoise, which invests in energy master limited partnerships (MLPs). Private equity firms have been successfully acquiring pipeline operators in the shale patch because of their lower cost of capital. They are proving strong rivals to MLPs for these deals because of their willingness to use more debt financing. Nustar, Archrock and TallGrass did not respond to requests for comment. An early move away from partnership models came in 2014 when Kinder Morgan Inc, then the largest publicly traded pipeline partnership, folded three units into a single company to address investor concerns about its growth and financial structure. Mick estimates that up to 75 percent of the MLPs Tortoise covers will have eliminated incentive distribution rights within the next two years to free up cash for growth. As of last year, about 51 percent had eliminated their payouts, called Incentive Distribution Rights (IDRs), compared with 4 percent in 2007, he said. Another factor in the restructurings are institutional investors seeking stronger governance and more independent boards. In some cases, about 80 percent of a limited partner’s board will be comprised of individuals appointed by the general partner, investors said. “In the real world, I don’t see how directors can be truly independent and represent the best interests of the limited partners if they can be fired by the general partner,” said Kevin McCarthy, a managing partner at investment firm Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors. Restructuring the partnerships to resemble corporations could draw renewed interest from investors, helping the firms raise new cash. “Our view is that governance has to change if the sector is going to move to the next level and attract the attention of long-only institutional investors,” McCarthy added. Although mature MLPs are revamping their structures, newer firms that go public are expected to continue using mechanisms such as IDRs to encourage growth. Hess Corp and BP Plc last year both launched MLPs that included incentive distribution payments to partners. “It is unlikely they will go away for new issuance and partnership structures moving forward.

2018-02-20,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The opposition will not field a candidate in Venezuela’s April 22 presidential election, the exiled mayor of Caracas said, calling the vote a “trap” set by President Nicolas Maduro. Antonio Ledezma, put under house arrest in 2015 for allegedly plotting a coup before escaping to Colombia in November, called for a United Nations probe into human rights violations in the OPEC nation and more humanitarian aid.  “It’s not a boycott. We are rather ignoring a trap. We cannot call it an election, because we know it is going to be a fraud,” Ledezma told Reuters in Geneva, where he was attending a human rights meeting organised by the group UN Watch.  “Yes, the election has united the opposition because we have a shared opinion that this election is just one more lie from the government,” he said, speaking through an interpreter. The country of 30 million is close to economic collapse, with inflation of more than 2,000 percent last year and millions without enough to eat. Critics say the election is a farce, with Maduro’s main rivals barred from standing and a compliant election body bound to favour the ruling socialists. Maduro denies the system is undemocratic. “There will be no official candidate from the opposition. From the government what we’ve seen is repression against the heads of the opposition because they don’t want to participate as that legitimises the process,” said Ledezma, who is now based in Spain. “The real opposition is the people - the millions of Venezuelans who want clear and transparent elections which were denied us. “The last thing we saw was the government closing the door to dialogue in our faces,” he said, referring to talks between the government and an opposition coalition held in the Dominican Republic in December. Ledezma met separately in Geneva on Monday with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein and Luis Almagro, secretary-general of the Organisation of American States (OAS), to ask for support. “I asked the High Commissioner also to send a commission to Venezuela so that they can be witness to the human rights violations that happen daily,” he said, citing anti-government protests last year during which more than 125 people were killed. “The long queue, caravans of migrants trying to leave the country, that’s a sign of protests. There are no queues in front of the supermarkets, because there is no food left in supermarkets.” More humanitarian aid is needed, but the crisis cannot be solved through relief supplies alone, he said, adding: “With the food and drug crisis in Venezuela, any aid would be like putting a bandaid on a broken leg.” Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; editing by Andrew Roche",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-ledezma/interview-ex-mayor-of-caracas-says-opposition-wont-take-part-in-venezuela-elections-idUKL8N1QA3UJ,20 Feb 2018,"The opposition will not field a

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) will expand deepwater output and turn a profit from its shale production in coming years as both together will help the oil major cope with a world of low crude prices, the head of its oil and gas production said on Tuesday. Shell’s deepwater production in Brazil, Nigeria, the Gulf of Mexico is much bigger and more profitable, but the firm sees the nimble, fast-returns U.S. onshore shale as an engine for growth. “We can see strong (shale) production growth, strong cash surpluses that gives us a balance in our portfolio where you can ramp investment up and down, you can moderate that, very unlike deepwater which is quite chunky,” Andy Brown told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the IP Week conference.  “They sit nicely together in a portfolio.” Now, mammoth deepwater projects and smaller shale fields both compete for Shell’s tightly-controlled capital and could generate profits with oil as low as $40 a barrel, Brown said. Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 is now trading at about $65, up from below $30 at the start of 2016. Following Shell’s $54 billion acquisition of BG Group in 2016, the Anglo-Dutch company became a major player in deep water, which is set to produce 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by the end of the decade, roughly a fifth of Shell’s total output. Today, it produces about 750,000 boed. Shell made its deepwater goals clear when it swept up nearly half the Gulf of Mexico oil and gas blocks awarded in a Mexican auction in January, months after picking up Brazilian blocks. The offshore business was set to generate $6 billion to $7 billion a year in free cash flow in the next three years, roughly a quarter of Shell’s total free cash flow, Brown said. “The aim is to get it (the cash generation) and sustain it through the next decade,” he said.  Shell aimed to approve several new deepwater developments this year, including Vito in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and Bonga Southwest in Nigeria, he said, adding it would also work on plans to develop its Gulf of Mexico Whale discovery. Brown has overseen a sharp reduction in development costs in recent years with the help of new technology and by simplifying designs to make projects profitable at lower oil prices.     But Shell, along with others such as Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Chevron (CVX.N), has invested heavily in the shale businesses, lured by lower development costs and quicker start up. Shell still did not generate a profit from its shale activities, much of it focused in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, but aimed to break even by 2019, a year earlier than originally planned, Brown said. “We had an ambition to get cash flow positive in 2020, we accelerated that to 2019. There are circumstances we can be cash flow positive this year,” Brown said. Shell would increase its shale output to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by 2020, he added.

2018-02-20,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Turkey has yet to issue a permit for Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) to start building the land-based part of the TurkStream gas pipeline, three sources familiar with the matter said, stoking fears the strategically important project will be delayed. If completed, the 7 billion euro (6.18 billion pounds) pipeline would allow Russia to reduce its reliance on Ukraine as a transit route for its gas supplies to Europe. Ankara has authorised Gazprom, which has a de facto monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, to start building two undersea sections of the project. However, it has still not given Gazprom the green light for the land-based segment to ship Russian gas onward to southern Europe, the sources told Reuters. “There is no permission from Turkey, which hampers talks about building the second line to Europe,” one of the sources familiar with the talks said. Relations between Moscow and Kiev have been badly strained by Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and a pro-Moscow insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Even before this, the countries had a series of disputes over gas prices, with the Kremlin accusing Ukraine of diverting supplies to domestic consumers that were supposed to transit to European Union countries.  Russia therefore wants to ship gas by alternative transit   routes as much and soon as possible. It is planning to boost capacity of an existing undersea pipeline to Germany, a project known as Nord Stream 2, which together with TurkStream would remove the need to send any gas via Ukraine. Any serious delay to TurkStream, a project promoted by President Vladimir Putin, could deepen doubts among some Western analysts that it will ever be built in its current form. TurkStream is designed to deliver more supplies to Turkey, the biggest buyer of Russian gas after Germany. More significantly for Moscow, it is also designed to extend across Turkey to the borders of southern Europe, thus opening up a new transit route for Russian gas. Gazprom, which did not respond to a written request for comment, wants to complete the pipeline’s construction in 2019 so time is of the essence. A second source said the permit problem might be related to talks between Gazprom and Turkish state company Botas about a possible discount for Russian gas. “It looks like Gazprom will have to give in (to Botas),” the source said. A third source in the Turkish energy industry told Reuters that Botas and Gazprom had yet to set up a joint venture they were meant to form for the land-based part of TurkStream. This was why a construction permit had not yet been issued, the source added.  Botas and the Turkish Energy Ministry declined to comment. For TurkStream map, click on bit.ly/2EIYRdu Gazprom has already started laying the undersea TurkStream lines, to Turkey and southern Europe respectively, beneath the Black Sea. The pipes, with a combined capacity of 31.5 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year, have yet to reach land. On Monday, TurkStream’s operating company said Gazprom had already built 884 km (550 miles) of the two lines, almost half the pipeline’s entire subsea portion. Gazprom already supplies gas to Samsun on Turkey’s Black Sea coast via an underwater pipeline called Blue Stream with a capacity of 16 bcm per year. TurkStream’s birth has been troubled. Gazprom was forced to abandon plans for a total of four TurkStream lines after failing to agree on an entry point into southern Europe.  Talks between Moscow and Ankara about the project were also suspended in October 2015 after the Turkish military downed a Russian warplane near the Turkish-Syrian border. Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan eventually  mended their relations and agreed to revive trade ties a year later. Russia and Turkey have since begun to cooperate with Iran on trying to find a solution to the Syrian crisis. Putin and Erdogan are in regular contact on this and other issues.

2018-02-20,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2C9rZZC By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline consumption has levelled off as the stimulus provided by low and falling oil prices between 2014 and 2016 has faded, so refiners are increasingly turning to diesel and customers in emerging markets. U.S. gasoline consumption is forecast to rise by just 40,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, after remaining essentially unchanged last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Slower consumption growth stands in contrast to the earlier surge when usage rose by almost 260,000 bpd in 2015 and another 140,000 bpd in 2016 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, February 2018). Traffic volumes are also growing more slowly, after rising sharply during most of 2015 and 2016, according to separate estimates from the Federal Highway Administration. Traffic on U.S. roads was up by less than 1 percent in the three months to November compared with the same period a year earlier (“Traffic volume trends”, FHWA, January 2018). Traffic growth has slowed from a peak of well over 3 percent per year in the early part of 2016, shortly after oil prices hit their lowest point in the current cycle. Oil prices have been trending higher for more than two years and are now within $10 per barrel of their average real level over the entire of the last cycle (tmsnrt.rs/2C9rZZC). So while the cost of fuel is not expensive, it is no longer especially cheap, and the steady increase in prices has started to moderate consumption growth. The nationwide weighted-average retail price of gasoline was $2.67 per gallon in January, an increase of more than 60 cents per gallon compared with two years previously. If oil prices continue to climb through the remainder of 2018 and into 2019 as the price cycle matures, U.S. gasoline consumption growth will likely slow even further. After two years in 2015/16 when the U.S. motorists provided a significant boost to global oil demand, the main drivers of demand growth are rotating towards diesel and the emerging economies of Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Freight volumes are rising at some of the fastest rates this decade in the United States and around the rest of the world. Since almost all cargo is moved by high-powered engines on ships, trucks and railroads that use diesel fuel, freight growth is providing a major stimulus for diesel consumption. In geographical terms, the fastest growth in consumption will come from outside the United States and the other advanced industrial economies. Developing economies accounted for most of the growth in oil consumption between 2004 and 2014 but were hit hard by the slump in commodity prices during 2015 and 2016. The economic downturn in commodity-dependent developing countries and associated slowdown in their own oil demand growth was one of the factors that worsened the oil price slump in 2015 and 2016. As commodity prices rise again, however, economic growth across emerging markets is accelerating and propelling faster increases in fuel demand and adding to the upward pressure on oil prices. U.S. refiners exported more than 1.1 billion barrels of finished petroleum products in the first 11 months of 2017, an increase of almost 12 percent compared with the same period in 2016. Finished product exports have accelerated significantly over the last two years and the trend is set to continue in 2018. With the focus for demand growth shifting from gasoline to diesel and emerging markets, fuel exports will become steadily more important for U.S. refiners.

2018-02-20,"* European stocks struggle, Wall Street to restart lower * MSCI Asia index falls 0.25 pct, Nikkei drops 1 pct * 10-yr Treasury yields at 2.91 pct ahead of U.S. trading * Commodities, EM FX struggle as dollar pushes higher * India rupee skids amid state-run bank fraud concerns By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - A six-day rebound in world stocks spluttered to a halt on Tuesday as bond market borrowing costs regained traction and the dollar kicked firmly off a three-year low. The rise in bond yields looked set to pressure Wall Street’s main indexes when it reopens after a holiday on Monday, though there was plenty in Europe and Asia to subdue the mood anyway. Europe’s main bourses held steady, supported by softer domestic currencies but weakness across Asia, where Tokyo saw a 1 percent drop, meant MSCI’s 47-country world share index was 0.25 percent in the red. The dollar meanwhile continued its rebound from three-year lows, having recovered 1.5 percent since Friday on the view that the U.S. currency was due a correction after a brutal sell-off in recent weeks. U.S. Treasury 10-year yields - the benchmark for global borrowing costs - were also on the up again and approaching 3 percent for the first time in four years. “I just advise caution,” Principal Global Investors’ chief global economist Bob Baur said about stocks with Wall Street futures pointed around 0.7 percent lower. “I’m not sure whether this (early February sell-off) was the dip to buy, there will probably be a relapse and then another relapse, before maybe around mid-summer stocks make another run up.” European bond yields pushed up in line with Treasuries, with traders also pondering who might succeed Mario Draghi as European Central Bank chief next year after Spain’s economy minister was nominated for the bank’s number two job. The choice of a southern European for ECB vice president increases the likelihood of a northerner such as ‘hawkish’ German Bundesbank governor Jens Weidmann getting Draghi’s seat, although there are already a number of Germans in top euro zone finance posts. Back among equities, another catalyst of the recent market upheaval, the VIX volatility index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - was moving higher again. It was up to 21 percent ahead of U.S. trading, although that was still less than half the more than 50 level it peaked at earlier this month. And though currency moves helped keep Europe level more broadly, banking giant HSBC and BHP, the world’s biggest miner, both had torrid days - the worst in over a year in HSBC’s case - after disappointing results. U.S. traders winced too as retail behemoth Walmart’s shares slumped more than 6 percent in premarket trade after it reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit and a sharp drop in online sales growth during the busy holiday period. The dollar’s rebound also meant most emerging market currencies were under pressure. South Africa’s rand and Turkey’s lira both gave back more of their recent gains, while growing concerns about fraud at India’s second-largest state-run bank sent the rupee skidding to a near three-month low. “Punjab National Bank will need to provide for at least a substantial portion of the exposure. As a result, the bank’s profitability will likely come under pressure,” rating agency Moody’s said as it put it on a downgrade warning. The rand’s underperformance pulled it away from a three-year peak scaled last week after new President Cyril Ramaphosa took office. The country is set to present what will be a crucial budget on Wednesday. There is growing speculation though about whether current Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba - who is due to deliver the budget - will keep his job. Against the yen, the dollar climbed half a percent to 107.10 yen, having bounced back from a 15-month low of 105.545 set on Friday. It made similar ground on the euro, getting to $1.2335 compared with Friday’s three-year low of $1.2556. In commodity markets, Oil prices were mixed, with reduced flows from Canada pushing up U.S. crude while Brent sagged to $65.45 per barrel on the back of weaker stocks and the dollar’s bounce. Spot gold slipped 0.6 percent to 1,338 an ounce, also corseted by the dollar’s bounce, while industrial metals including copper drifted lower for a second day in a thinner-than-usual trading due to new year holidays in China.

2018-02-20,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Standing by a towering equatorial forest, Jean-Noel Kouame’s new breeze-block house may be beyond the reach of Ivory Coast’s power grid, but it’s perfectly located for solar power entrepreneurs. Buoyed by success in East Africa, off-grid solar power startups are pouring into West Africa, offering pay-as-you-go kits in a race to claim tens of millions of customers who lack reliable access to electricity. At least 11 companies, including leading East African players such as Greenlight Planet, d.light, Off-Grid Electric (OGE), M-KOPE Solar, Fenix International and BBOXX, have moved into the region, most within the last two years. With a potential market worth billions of dollars, major European energy companies such as French utilities EDF (EDF.PA) and Engie (ENGIE.PA) are taking notice too. “It’s important to be there now, because the race has already started,” said Marianne Laigneau, senior executive vice president of EDF’s international division. The main challenge facing smaller companies now is how to raise enough capital to supply the expensive solar kits in return for small upfront payments from customers. Mobilising funding for firms providing home solar systems is also part of the U.S. government’s Power Africa initiative. Major power generation projects have been slow to get off the ground so Power Africa has partnered with startups such as OGE, M-KOPE and d.light, among others, to accelerate off-grid access. In Abidjan, Kouame doesn’t know when, or if, the national grid will reach the outer edge of the urban sprawl, but thanks to his new solar panel kit he has indoor lighting, an electric fan and a television. But it’s the light bulb hanging outside his front door that he values the most. “At night we were scared to go outside,” the 31-year-old taxi driver says as his pregnant wife watches a dubbed Brazilian soap opera. “Where there is light there is safety.” Some 1.2 billion people around the world have no access to a power grid, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Lighting and phone charging alone costs them about $27 billion (19.34 billion pounds) a year and some estimates put their total annual energy costs at more than $60 billion. While governments in much of the developing world are extending access to national networks, Africa is lagging, with less than 40 percent of African households connected, IEA figures show. But what has long been decried as a major obstacle to Africa’s development is viewed as an opportunity by entrepreneurs such as Nir Marom, co-founder of Lumos Global, the Dutch startup that built and sold Kouame his kit. “I read an article about people paying 50 cents a day for kerosene and candles, and that just didn’t make sense,” said Marom. “I said I can give them four kilowatt hours for the price of kerosene. And that started everything.”  OFF-GRID EXPANSION Lumos Global’s kits, which cost about $600, include a solar panel linked to a battery that supports power sockets, a mobile phone adapter and LED light bulbs. Kouame, who paid 30,000 CFA francs ($57) upfront for his kit, is now leasing-to-own. A digital counter on the yellow battery pack tells him when he needs to top up his account using his mobile phone. If he doesn’t pay, the kit, which also houses a global positioning system, shuts down. But in five years, he’ll own it outright and his solar power will be free. “Five years is nothing,” he says, already weighing the option of another system to run a large freezer sitting empty and unplugged in the corner of his living room. “So my wife can do a little business.” Pay-as-you-go solar home systems (SHS) like Kouame’s have been the main driver of off-grid power expansion in Africa.  In 2010, when most purchases were limited to simple lighting systems, customers spent $30 to $80 on average over a product’s lifetime, according to GOGLA, an independent off-grid industry association.  Now it’s $370 to $1,120.  Global revenues from the pay-as-you-go SHS sector were $150 million to $200 million in 2016, GOGLA estimates. That should jump to $6 billion to $7 billion in 2022. Most of the main players in West Africa cut their teeth in East Africa, drawn by the widespread use of mobile money transfers, a key element of the pay-as-you-go off-grid model. Success there drove annual sector-wide growth of about 140 percent from 2013 to 2016. But as the East African market becomes more crowded and mobile money services spread across the continent, many are now heading west. “I remember doing a market sizing very early on and from a number of metrics West Africa was a better market,” said Xavier Helgesen, CEO of Tanzania-based Off-Grid Electric (OGE), one of the sector leaders. About half of the overall African off-grid population are in West and Central Africa, according to the IEA. Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest economy and most populous nation, is  alone home to roughly 90 million people with no grid access. Lumos is an outlier to the extent it picked West Africa as its first market. It launched in Nigeria in 2016 and by the end of 2017 had sold 73,000 kits and was averaging 16 percent month-on-month revenue growth. Late last year, it expanded into Ivory Coast, French-speaking West Africa’s largest economy. Still, despite the rapid growth to date, off-grid solar startups say more must be done to improve the capacity of solar home systems and to bring down their cost so the sector can reach its full potential. “I don’t believe off-grid electrification is a stop-gap,” said Jamie Evans, director of partnerships with d.light. “I believe it’s here to stay. If the price of batteries starts dropping precipitously, then it will almost certainly change the face of the industry,” he said. The need to provide consumer financing for the relatively expensive kits means expansion requires significant capital. But banks, lacking expertise in the new sector, often shy away from lending to off-grid companies, said Rolake Akinkugbe, head of energy at Nigeria’s FBNQuest Merchant Bank. “There’s also a size issue. Most of the off-grid solutions, particularly those that deal with pay-as-you-go, from a funding perspective, are not within the threshold for banks,” she said. That means startups have largely relied on venture capital, impact investors looking to generate social benefits as well as a profit, and development finance institutions. But the model has its drawbacks.  “Right now off-grid companies are having to constantly fundraise,” said Lyndsay Handler, CEO of Uganda-based Fenix International.  In what was considered a milestone in the African off-grid sector, Engie bought Fenix in October. With access to Engie’s capital, Handler says Fenix aims to become a pan-African off-grid leader, serving millions in the near term and tens of millions further down the road. “Hundreds of millions of dollars of investment are needed to have the impact we want to have,” she said. Facing stagnating customer growth in their home markets, European energy companies such as Engie are increasingly looking abroad. Africa’s underserved, growing population is seen by many as the future.  The number of Africans without grid access actually increased by nearly 14 percent between 2000 and 2016 to 588 million people. By 2030, the IEA estimates that some 80 percent of the global off-grid population will be in sub-Saharan Africa.  Raphael Tilot, Engie Africa’s head of customer solutions, likens off-grid solar to the rise of the mobile phone, which leap-frogged landline networks on the continent.     “Today, no one is thinking about putting telecom wires to individual houses in these places. You can look at energy in the same way today,” he said. “Mini-grids or solar home systems are a far better solution.” In addition to Engie, French giants Total (TOTF.PA) and EDF also hold stakes in off-grid startups, or are partnering with them. Italian utility Enel (ENEI.MI) and Germany’s E.ON (EONGn.DE) are investing in solar mini-grid companies. Evidence of the market growth is on exhibit on Kouame’s hillside in Abidjan, where several rooftops, including his neighbour’s, are now crowned with solar panels. “He asked me how it worked,” Kouame smiles. “Then he went and bought one of his own.” ($1 = 527.0000 CFA francs) Reporting by Joe Bavier; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/africa-power/insight-off-grid-power-pioneers-pour-into-west-africa-idUKL8N1Q25WB,20 Feb 2018,"Standing by a towering

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Congo Republic is set to become the latest African country to start debt relief talks with trading houses after borrowing $2 billion (1.43 billion pounds) from merchants such as Trafigura and Glencore (GLEN.L) but now finding its debt levels unsustainable, sources familiar with the matter said. Trading houses regularly lend money to resource-rich clients in financial distress - be it countries such as Congo, Chad, Morocco or Iraq’s Kurdistan region - when other lenders walk away. But traders often charge heavy interest on loans and require access to resources. Congo has recently appointed investment bank Lazard (LAZ.N) as an advisor to help it renegotiate debts with the traders, three banking and oil industry sources said.  Lazard declined to comment. The move is similar to Chad which has appointed Rothschild as an advisor in talks with Glencore and four bank lenders.     The development in Congo is similar to the situation in Chad, which borrowed $1.45 billion from Glencore guaranteed by crude cargoes at a time of high oil prices. The central African country was forced to seek a restructuring because it had to channel most oil revenue towards debt repayments instead of its own budget when oil prices fell.  Negotiations to restructure the loan for a second time have been on-going since mid-2017 and became fraught after Chad said it would cut off some of the oil going to Glencore when the two sides clashed over the terms. Like Chad, Congo Republic has come under pressure from the IMF to restructure its debt, which trade sources fear may result in painful and prolonged talks with the traders unwilling to unilaterally improve credit terms. “The Republic of Congo’s overall debt, including loans from oil traders, is unsustainable and the authorities are planning measures to restore medium-term debt sustainability,” a spokesman for the IMF said. Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. Congo Republic’s finance ministry declined to comment.     Congo is seeking an IMF bailout and, as in the case of Chad, the IMF has laid out tough terms before releasing the funds. Congo is regularly singled out by anti-corruption groups for the opaque management of its oil sector.. In December, the country pledged to cut its 2018 spending by 9 percent in a bid to win the IMF’s support.The IMF said in October that Congo’s public or publicly guaranteed debt totalled $9.14 billion or around 110 percent of its GDP as of the end of July. Out of this total, the debt to traders represents about $2.3 billion, the country’s prime minister said in October, without providing a breakdown. He also said the country was weighing a moratorium on payments with private creditors.    Trafigura has lent the country around $1 billion together with banks. In the case that Congo defaults, the trading house is fully responsible for the debt, although it has insured it with re-insurers, according to two trade sources.  Glencore, backed by a syndicate of banks, lent Brazzaville about $850 million between 2015 and 2016, according to the company’s annual accounts, to be repaid with future oil deliveries over 5 years. At the end of 2016, Glencore was directly owed $336 million, while the banks were still owed about $500 million.”All in all, we don’t think the government is in a desperate situation and requires a massive restructuring. Some sort of restructuring with a four to five-year timeframe would probably be acceptable,” said a source at one of the trading houses who asked not to be identified because the issue cannot be discussed in public.Congo produces close to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) and is heavily dependent on its oil sales revenue.  It said last June that it aimed to increase production by 25 percent to 350,000 bpd.Unlike Chad, Congo has a wider set of creditors. Glencore and its bank lenders accounted for nearly all of Chad’s external commercial debt.

2018-02-20,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload. Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did. Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets. The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefitted from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years. The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner. More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can’t pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner’s operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015. PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner’s collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery’s decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show. PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people. Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner’s bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a “significant” role its collapse. “We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” Corley said. Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill. Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market. The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November. The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council. “The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,” Coleman said. Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings. Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner. The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery. At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity. At the time, U.S. oil production was skyrocketing as improved drilling technology unlocked new reserves in places such as North Dakota. Carlyle saw an opportunity to tap this cheaper supply and wean PES off costly imports. The plan worked well at first, in 2013 and 2014, and PES posted earnings of about $500 million for the two years combined. In January 2015, PES spun off the terminal, creating North Yard as a separate firm. PES then signed a ten-year agreement with North Yard to pay $1.95 for each barrel unloaded and agreed to a minimum quarterly volume of 170,000 bpd, guaranteeing the $30 million quarterly payments to North Yard. For any barrel PES unloaded above the threshold, the refinery paid North Yard 51 cents. The system was designed to reward PES for success, but had no contingency plan to protect the refiner against the failure that would quickly follow the deal. The rail terminal has averaged just 58,000 bpd since the contract was signed, according to figures provided to Reuters by energy intelligence service Genscape, because Carlyle and PES could no longer access crude at prices low enough to make the rail shipments profitable. That left PES paying millions of dollars to Carlyle, through North Yard, for oil shipments it never received. Carlyle’s purchase of PES and the rail terminal investment were bets that U.S. oil would remain cheap relative to imports. A glut of domestic production had caused U.S. crude to sell at a deep discount to imported barrels, with the gap averaging about $8.60 between 2012 and 2015. But by late 2015, an oil price rebound slashed the domestic discount to less than $3 a barrel – not enough to cover the cost of a long rail journey. PES nonetheless continued to pay North Yard a total of $298 million between 2015 until August 2017, filings show. The Carlyle-led investor group received $151 million, in eight distributions, of the total paid to North Yard. In November of that year, PES took on more debt to finance more payouts to investors, borrowing a total of $160 million in two loans against the rail terminal and delivering the proceeds its Carlyle-led backers, filings show. Corley, the PES spokeswoman said terminal investment more than paid for itself during its more profitable period. But for last two years, PES said in filings, the refinery remained largely cut off from the cheap crude it needed to survive. “Perversely, it became cheaper to transport crude oil from North Dakota to points in Western Europe than it was to transport the same crude oil to Philadelphia,” the firm said.

2018-02-20,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Seaborne U.S. coal exports by region: reut.rs/2EBzHNI By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 20 (Reuters) - If China does seek a way to retaliate against U.S. proposals to impose import curbs on steel and aluminium, then targeting President Donald Trump’s favoured coal would be tempting. One of Trump’s key campaign promises in the 2016 election victory was to end the war on what he termed “beautiful, clean” coal. Figures released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggest he has met with some success. U.S. coal output surged the most in 16 years to reach 773 million short tonnes, equivalent to about 701 million metric tonnes, in 2017, the EIA said on Feb. 16. Coal miners produced about 40.8 million tonnes more in 2017 than in 2016, the EIA said. So far, so good for Trump. But the problem is that virtually all of the good news for U.S. coal producers is on the export side - and this is mainly a China phenomenon. U.S. exports are expected to have risen 58 percent in 2017 from the prior year to about 86.2 million tonnes, according to the EIA, with volumes to Asia nearly doubling to about 28.1 million tonnes. These figures largely tally with ship-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. Seaborne U.S. coal exports were about 79.4 million tonnes in 2017, up from 64.1 million in 2016, according to the vessel data. China bought 5.95 million tonnes of U.S. coal last year, more than double the 2.8 million of the prior year, while India remained the top Asian destination, with imports of 13 million tonnes, up from 8.7 million in 2016. Japan remained slightly ahead of China with imports of 6.9 million tonnes of U.S. coal in 2017, up from 5.2 million the prior year, according to the vessel-tracking numbers. These figures don’t make it explicit that China is the main driver behind the burgeoning U.S. coal exports, given that the world’s largest importer of the polluting fuel only bought 3.15 million tonnes more from the United States last year than in 2016. However, the main dynamic driving coal markets is Chinese import demand, and the 6.1 percent gain in its imports in 2017 from the prior year has helped prices for both thermal and coking coal remain at robust levels. The Asian benchmark thermal coal price, the Newcastle Weekly Index ended 2017 at $103.88 a tonne, up 10 percent from the end of 2016. While this represents a solid gain, it’s worth noting that the low for 2017 was $72.42 a tonne, and that the index spent the majority of the year trading above $80 - something it hadn’t done since 2013. For U.S. coal exports to be competitive in Asia, and also in Europe, a thermal coal price of at least $70 a tonne is required, given the cost of mining, inland transportation and shipping in the United States. Chinese import demand has ensured that thermal coal prices have remained in the sweet spot for U.S. producers, allowing them to be competitive in Europe against exports from Colombia and South Africa, as well as in Asia. The relatively high prices for coking coal, used in steel-making, has also helped U.S. exporters of this higher-quality fuel, especially in India where they compete against supplies from top exporter Australia. The outlook for U.S. coal exports is largely price-dependent, and this in turn is largely a function of how much China imports. If China comes close in 2018 to importing the 270 million tonnes it did in 2017, then prices are likely to hold up, providing U.S. miners with the opportunity to maintain, or possibly even grow their exports. The current balance of risks is that China’s coal imports will moderate somewhat this year as the country ramps up domestic output and continues its switch to less-polluting fuels such as natural gas. If this is the case, then prices may drift lower toward the level where U.S. exports start to struggle, especially in Asia. There is also no current suggestion that China would retaliate against the United States by targeting coal, should Trump accept the recommendation of the U.S. Commerce Department for a slew of curbs and tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from a variety of exporting countries. So far the Chinese response has been limited to saying the U.S. trade review report is “baseless” and that it will take steps to protect its interests if the final decision affects China. While a tit-for-tat trade war is unlikely to be in either the interests of China or the United States, putting barriers on U.S. coal imports would be a powerful signal from Beijing, aimed straight at Trump’s heartland.

Moller-Maersk plans to expand its transport and logistics business to compete directly with package delivery companies UPS and Fedex as part of a major restructuring, its chief executive said Tuesday. Maersk, the world’s largest container shipping company, has sold off the majority of its energy assets to focus entirely on transport and logistics. “We’re building this company that is a global integrated container business, a company very similar to UPS and Fedex,” CEO Soren Skou told investors at a capital markets day in Copenhagen on Tuesday. “I hope they will be considered peers of ours, when we are done with this journey in 3-5 years,” he added. As part of the restructuring, Maersk aims to expand its services to all parts of the supply chain, giving customers the ability to deal with one firm when shipping goods from one end of the world to another. In a digitisation drive, Maersk has teamed up with IBM to create an industry-wide blockchain-based trading platform it says will allow it to offer more value-added services in areas like freight forwarding and trade finance. In the biggest deal in breaking up the Maersk conglomerate, French oil major Total purchased the company’s North Sea-focused oil and gas business in August in a $7.5 billion deal.

2018-02-20,"LISBON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Portuguese oil company Galp Energia expects largely flat pre-tax earnings this year after a 32 percent increase in 2017 as production growth should slow, although it is still seeking to boost output by more than 50 percent by 2020. Galp shares fell 2.65 percent after the release of the outlook in a capital markets day presentation, even as it increased its proposed dividend payout for 2017 by 10 percent to 0.55 euros a share. It put this year’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) at 1.8-1.9 billion euros, after last year’s 1.87 billion.  Unlike last year, Galp would not provide a five-year EBITDA growth outlook, which it last put at 20 percent a year until 2021. This year, Galp expects an output increase of 15-20 percent after last year’s 38 percent jump. In the last quarter of 2017, production exceeded 100,000 bpd for the first time, driving net profit 54 percent higher in the quarter to 186 million euros, the company said in a separate results statement. EBITDA rose 24 percent in the quarter and 32 percent for all of last year, exceeding Galp’s initial guidance for 2017 of up to 1.6 billion euros. Galp estimated annual average capital expenditure in the next five years at around 1 billion euros in a slight shift from the previous outlook, which put it in a 0.8 billion to 1 billion euro range. “Capex guidance seems somewhat disappointing considering the expectations for savings with ongoing efficiencies in Brazil,” BPI analysts said in a note. Still, Galp plans to boost output to 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020. Most of Galp’s production growth will come from Brazil, where it has stakes in large offshore oil fields and continues to look for expansion opportunities. Galp, which is still largely a refiner, said that from 2020 onwards it plans to add new projects in Mozambique and Brazil which should boost the share of natural gas output in its total output to up to 30 percent from around 20 percent now. Galp expects free cash flow of over 1 billion euros by 2020, up from 600 million last year, and should break even at oil prices around $25 a barrel shortly after 2020, down from a breakeven price of $35 in its previous forecast.

Europe’s main bourses saw steady start as lower domestic currencies helped their cause but weakness across Asia where Tokyo saw a 1 percent drop meant MSCI’s 47-country world share index was 0.2 percent in the red. The dollar meanwhile continued its rebound from three-year lows, having recovered 1.5 percent since Friday on the view that the U.S. currency was due a correction after a brutal sell-off in recent weeks. U.S. Treasury 10-year yields - the benchmark for global borrowing costs - were also on the up again and approaching 3 percent for the first time in four years. “I just advise caution,” said Principal Global Investors’ chief global economist Bob Baur said about stocks as Wall Street futures also pointed lower. “I’m not sure whether this (early February sell-off) was the dip to buy, there will probably be a relapse and then another relapse, before maybe around mid-summer stocks make another run up.” European bond yields pushed up too, with traders also working through the options of who could succeed Mario Draghi as European Central Bank chief next year after Spain’s economy minister was nominated for the bank’s number two job. One of other recent catalysts for the recent market disturbances, the VIX volatility index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” - was moving higher again as well, although at just over 20 percent in early European trading it was still well below early February’s peak of above 50. The dollar’s rebound also meant most emerging market currencies were under pressure. South Africa’s rand and Turkey’s lira both gave back more of their recent gains, while growing concerns about an alleged fraud at India’s second-largest state-run bank sent the rupee skidding to a near three-month low. “Punjab National Bank will need to provide for at least a substantial portion of the exposure. As a result, the bank’s profitability will likely come under pressure,” rating agency Moody’s said as it put it on a downgrade warning. Against the yen, the dollar climbed half a percent to 107.09 yen, having bounced back from a 15-month low of 105.545 set on Friday. The euro eased 0.4 percent to $1.2360, backing down from Friday’s three-year high of $1.2556. In commodity markets, Oil prices were mixed, with reduced flows from Canada pushing up U.S. crude while Brent sagged $65.45 per barrel on the back of weaker Asian stocks and the dollar’s bounce. Spot gold slipped 0.4 percent to 1,341.06 an ounce, also corseted by the dollar’s bounce, while industrial metals including copper drifted lower for a second day in a thinner-than-usual trading due to new year holidays in China.

2018-02-20,"* Japan’s energy policies outdated, task force says * Report commissioned by foreign minister Taro Kono * Urges more renewables, less coal, nuclear * Ambitious lawmaker a long-time critic of nuclear By Aaron Sheldrick and Linda Sieg TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - An energy task force advising Japan’s foreign minister has proposed boosting renewable energy and shifting away from coal-fired and nuclear power at home, arguing the country’s energy policies are outdated and undermine its global competitiveness. The advice comes in a report commissioned by minister Taro Kono, a maverick lawmaker with prime ministerial ambitions, and echoes his own convictions, pitting him against Japan’s powerful Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). METI urges using coal at home and financing coal-powered projects abroad. The task force report, presented to Kono on Monday, argues nuclear power has lost economic competitiveness and says the world’s third-biggest economy should cut reliance on atomic energy to as little as possible, and instead boost use of renewables. “If Japan focuses on renewable energy rooted in its abundant natural resources and reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels and uranium, this will contribute to its energy security and make possible a new domestic economy,” the task force said in the report. “It is obvious that Japan is lagging.” The report comes as METI, also a proponent of nuclear power, is reviewing the country’s energy policy. METI said it had no immediate response to the task force report. In its current official targets Japan, one of the world’s biggest importers of thermal coal and natural gas, aims for renewables to make up 22 to 24 percent of its energy mix in 2030, up from about 14 percent now. Kono, in a speech in Abu Dhabi last month, called that target “lamentable” since 24 percent is the global average now. The U.S.-educated son of a former foreign minister, Kono has made no secret of his ambition to lead the country at some point and has long been critical of Japan’s nuclear power industry. Japan is the world’s biggest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the third-biggest importer of coal used for power generation. Thermal coal imports rose to a record last year, while those of LNG were near record highs, as the fuels filled the gap in power generation left by the country’s slow restart of nuclear power plants closed after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Japanese companies are planning to build more than 40 new coal plants. The Fukushima crisis has also spurred a push into renewables, mainly solar energy, but non-hydro renewable power only accounted for 3.5 percent of Japan’s electricity supplies in October last year. Renewable energy use has surged around the world in recent years as costs have come down. Meanwhile, the Japanese government will next month submit a bill to parliament to make it easier to develop offshore wind power, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Tuesday.

2018-02-20,"(Corrects to say Malampaya gas field in western Philippine waters, not eastern, in paragraph 10.) * Energy World in talks to build another LNG facility in Mindanao * Australia-listed company plans to list Philippine assets By Manolo Serapio Jr MANILA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Australia-listed Energy World Corp expects to start up a gas-fired power plant in the Philippines by end-2018, its chief executive said, fed by the country’s first liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. The Philippines does not currently import LNG, but its domestic natural gas reserves are depleting, and the country has been developing plans for import terminals for years. EWC’s terminal on Pagbilao island in Quezon province, if started up this year, would mark the country’s first LNG imports. “By the end of this year, we should have 400 megawatts (MW) in operation,” Energy World Corp (EWC) Managing Director and CEO Stewart Elliott told Reuters in an interview in Manila. The generating capacity is part of a 650 MW power plant EWC is building in Quezon, located near its LNG receiving plant that is 90 percent complete, and will be capable of receiving 3 million tonnes of LNG a year, Elliott said. The company will initially source the gas from the spot market and later possibly from its Sengkang gas field in Indonesia, Elliot said. EWC has been developing the power plant and import terminal since 2011 but completion has been set back by several delays. Elliott said the project was now far enough advanced for EWC to have a tanker on stand-by in Singapore to bring in LNG once the facility is ready. In a sign the project is close to start-up, the privately-owned National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), in charge of running the country’s power grid, has issued a system impact study to Energy World that details how the plant’s entry would affect the grid and is “one of many requirements” before power stations go online, said an NGCP spokeswoman. Power demand in the Philippines is rising fast along with its expanding economy, and imports of LNG are expected to rise rapidly as the nation’s natural gas reserves decline. The Philippines plans to rely on imported LNG when its Malampaya gas field - in western Philippine waters - dries up in 2024. The field fuels around a fifth of the country’s power. To meet future demand, Elliott said EWC was in early talks on another LNG receiving site in southern Mindanao island. The government is already looking for partners to invest in a separate, $2 billion LNG facility to be built in Batangas province, also south of Manila where many of the current gas-fired power stations are located. EWC has also expressed interest to invest in the Batangas LNG project. Elliott is looking as well to spin off its Quezon LNG terminal and power station and list the assets on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). “The stock market is very actively talking to us, saying they’d like us to be listed and I would like it to be listed. I would prefer the end of this year but probably it will be next year,” he said. EWC has made some inquiries and the exchange is waiting for it to take any listing initiative, PSE Chief Operating Officer Roel Refran told Reuters. The company is also in discussions with local government officials for a 5-million-tonne LNG plant to be built in Sulu province, in southern Mindanao island, though the project is in early stages of development. Elliott said there could also be potential for the Philippines to find new domestic gas reserves. There are gas wells in Sulu province that have been shut in by earlier explorers looking for oil, Elliott said. “There’s gas sitting there. I know one (concession holder) was planning to sell it to Malaysia but that would look stupid, wouldn’t it? Philippine gas being sold to Malaysia.” Reporting by Manolo Serapio Jr.; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/energyworld-philippines-lng/corrected-interview-energy-world-to-kick-off-philippines-lng-terminal-plans-another-idUKL4N1Q43C2,20 Feb 2018,"* Energy World in talks to build another LNG facility in

2018-02-20,"(Repeats Monday report) * Ukraine buys U.S. coal as Trump tries to help miners * Deal followed Poroshenko visit to the White House * Kiev short of coal due to rebellion, conflict with Russia * Anthracite contract “a matter of necessity” - energy chief By Alessandra  Prentice KIEV, Feb 19 (Reuters) - For the first time in Ukraine’s history, U.S. anthracite is helping to keep the lights on and the heating going this winter following a deal that has also helped to warm Kiev’s relations with President Donald Trump. The Ukrainian state-owned company that imported the coal told Reuters that the deal made commercial sense. But it was also politically expedient, according to a person involved in the talks on the agreement and power industry insiders. On Trump’s side it provided much-needed orders for a coal-producing region of the United States which was a vital constituency in his 2016 presidential election victory. On the Ukrainian side the deal helped to win favour with the White House, whose support Kiev needs in its conflict with Russia, as well as opening up a new source of coal at a time when its traditional supplies are disrupted. Trump’s campaign call to improve relations with the Kremlin alarmed the pro-Western leadership in Ukraine, which lost Crimea to Russia in 2014 and is still fighting pro-Moscow separatists. However, things looked up when President Petro Poroshenko visited the White House on June 20 last year. “The meeting with Trump was a key point, a milestone,” a Ukrainian government source told Reuters, requesting anonymity. The Americans had set particular store by supplying coal to Ukraine. “I felt that for them it is important,” said the source, who was present at the talks that also included a session with Vice President Mike Pence. Despite Trump’s incentives, U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired plants and shifting to gas, wind and solar power. Ailing U.S. mining companies are therefore boosting exports to Asia and seeking new buyers among eastern European countries trying to diversify from Russian supplies. Trump, who championed U.S. coal producers on the campaign trail, pressed the message after meeting Poroshenko. “Ukraine already tells us they need millions and millions of metric tons right now,” he said in a speech nine days later. “We want to sell it to them, and to everyone else all over the globe who need it.” The deal with Kiev was sealed the following month, after which U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said: “As promised during the campaign, President Trump is unshackling American energy with each day on the job.” The deal helped to “bolster a key strategic partner against regional pressures that seek to undermine U.S. interests”, Ross added, referring to past Russian attempts to restrict natural gas flows to its western neighbours. Ukraine was once a major producer of anthracite, a coal used in power generation, but it has faced a shortage in recent winters as it lost control of almost all its mines in eastern areas to the separatists. Along with South Africa, Ukrainian-owned mines in Russia have been the main source of anthracite imports but this is fraught with uncertainty. In the past Moscow has cut off gas supplies to the country over disputes with Kiev, while the Ukrainian government considered forbidding anthracite imports from Russia in 2017 although no ban has yet been imposed. Overall anthracite imports shot up to 3.05 million tonnes in the first 11 months of 2017 from just 0.05 million in all of 2013 - the year before the rebellion erupted. Neighbouring Poland, which Trump visited in July, is also turning increasingly to U.S. coal. Its imports from the United States jumped five-fold last year to 839,000 tonnes, data from the state-run ARP agency showed. In July Ukrainian state-owned energy company Centrenergo announced the deal with U.S. company Xcoal for the supply of up to 700,000 tonnes of anthracite. Centrenergo initially said it would pay $113 per tonne for the first shipment, a price industry experts and traders told Reuters was expensive compared with alternatives. However, chief executive Oleg Kozemko said the cost varied according to the quality of the coal delivered, so Centrenergo had paid around $100 per tonne on average for the 410,000 tonnes supplied by the end of 2017. Kozemko said in an interview that the U.S. deal was Centrenergo’s only viable option after three tenders it launched earlier last year had failed. “The idea to sign a contract with Xcoal was a matter of necessity,” he said. “We had agreements but they didn’t work out, because the pricing that they discussed with us and that we signed an agreement on didn’t work out.” Data on the state tenders registry and documents seen by Reuters show that two of the tenders failed due to a lack of bids, while the results of the third were cancelled. If that contract had worked out, Centrenergo would have paid around $96 per tonne, according to Reuters calculations based on the exchange rate at the time of the tender in April. Energy expert Andriy Gerus told Reuters the Xcoal deal “probably helps Ukraine to build some good political connections with the USA and that is quite important right now”. The anthracite for Centrenergo is mined in Pennsylvania, which backed Trump in 2016. This marked the first time a Republican presidential candidate had won the state since 1988, and followed Trump’s pledge to reverse the coal industry’s history of plant closures and lay-offs in recent years. Centrenergo says it and Xcoal agreed the contract independently of their governments and without any political pressure. However, Kozemko said: “If talks between the heads of our countries helped in this, then we can only say thank you... It was a mutual desire.” For the Ukrainian authorities, the diplomatic benefit is clear. When the first shipment of U.S. anthracite arrived in September, Poroshenko tweeted a photo of himself shaking hands with Trump in Washington. “As agreed with @realDonaldTrump, first American coal has reached Ukraine,” he wrote. Poroshenko’s press service said the deal “is an exact example of when the friendly and warm atmosphere of one conversation helps strengthen the foundations of a strategic partnership in the interests of both sides for the future”. The Washington meeting also discussed U.S.-Ukrainian military and technical cooperation. Soon after, the Trump administration said it was considering supplying defensive weapons to Ukraine to counter the Russian-backed separatists. In late December the U.S. State Department announced that the provision of “enhanced defensive capabilities” had been approved. Kozemko said the Xcoal deal was likely to be only the beginning of Centrenergo’s trade relations with the United States as it is currently holding talks on supplies of bituminous coal, a poorer quality variety. “It’s good that we studied the U.S. market because we had never looked at it before. We see big prospects for bituminous coal,” he said, adding that other Ukrainian firms were thinking similarly. “We showed how to bring coal from America and they are following our lead.” (Additional reporting by Natalia Zinets and Pavel Polityuk in Kiev and Agnieszka Barteczko in Warsaw; editing by David Stamp)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ukraine-usa-coal/rpt-how-a-u-s-coal-deal-warmed-ukraines-ties-with-trump-idUKL8N1Q947R,20 Feb 2018,"For the first time in Ukraine's

2018-02-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - When a Belgian court ordered a bank to freeze $22.6 billion (16.2 billion pounds) of assets held in trust for a Kazakhstan sovereign wealth fund (SWF), it set a worrying precedent for other SWFs. The case is one of several brought to courts in Europe by Moldovan businessman Anatolie Stati who is attempting to force the Kazakh government to pay up in a dispute about his energy investments in the oil-rich country. Court rulings imposing asset freezes in Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Luxembourg are significant because they address the issue of whether SWFs should be treated as investment arms of governments, or as independent institutional investors. SWFs, which often invest the proceeds from the sale of national resources or manufactured goods, have traditionally enjoyed the legal immunity reserved for a sovereign to protect their assets in foreign jurisdictions.   The rulings in the Kazakhstan case made waves because they ignore that immunity.  “This is a dangerous and worrisome precedent for other funds,” said Paul Rose, an Ohio State University law professor specialising in SWFs. “Lots of funds will be looking very carefully at the outcome of this case and wondering whether their assets can be frozen.”    The Kazakh government has said it will challenge the judgements.   Whether Kazakhstan succeeds in getting the accounts unfrozen or not, those watching the case reckon it is a landmark for SWFs, whose $7 trillion in global investments range from real estate to equities and government bonds.      In countries such as Norway, where disputes between investors and the government are more likely to be dealt with through efficient and independent domestic courts, SWFs have little cause to worry, analysts say. But the Kazakh case should be a concern for countries with a poor track record on investor protection, as it could encourage disgruntled investors to target SWFs’ offshore-held assets. Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund, predicted repercussions from the Kazakh case. “SWFs represent a significant (share of) global capital and any attacks on SWFs may trigger significant market turbulence,” he said.           Orders in Dutch and Belgian courts required Bank of New York Mellon to freeze monies it held in custody for the Kazakh National Fund and the Republic of Kazakhstan. The Dutch court order has since been lifted. The Belgian ruling is still in place but Kazakhstan will challenge it at a court hearing that has been adjourned until April 27. Kazakh assets in Luxembourg and Sweden are still frozen.   SWF assets have been frozen before, but only in exceptional circumstances. For instance, the United Nations imposed a freeze on the Libyan Investment Authority’s overseas assets in 2011 as it feared personnel in the deposed government would spirit them away. The Kazakh asset freezes followed a 2013 decision by the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to award Stati and his co-investors some $500 million in an arbitration. The body provides dispute resolution services to international businesses but it is not a court and is up to national courts to enforce its decisions.  Kazakhstan is refusing to pay and President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s government said it has done nothing wrong. It has argued that this ruling was based on fraudulent information, according to a press release from the Kazakh Justice Ministry.    Stati’s petition to a Belgian court to enforce the award resulted in an order requiring BNY Mellon to freeze $22.6 billion in Kazakh National Fund and Republic of Kazakhstan assets. The assets are held in custody by BNY Mellon’s European bank, Brussels-based The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV. BNY Mellon declined to comment.  Stati also obtained a separate order from a Dutch court to freeze an approximately $5.2 billion stake in KMG Kashagan B.V.  owned by Samruk-Kazyna, another Kazakh SWF. KMG Kashagan is a special purpose vehicle through which the country holds a stake in the Kashagan energy project. There were further orders to freeze assets in Luxembourg and Sweden.   Stati has also tried to get the award enforced in courts in London and Washington, according to press releases from the Kazakh Justice Ministry. Those decisions would apply to Kazakh assets held in England or the United States.  Both attempts have run into difficulties. In a preliminary hearing in June 2017, the English High Court found that the initial arbitration award may have been obtained by fraud. Proceedings are ongoing, with a full trial scheduled to begin in October, the Kazakh Justice Ministry said. Kazakhstan has also filed a separate claim against Stati in Washington with regard to the alleged fraud.                Industry participants are watching the court cases closely.  “If 40 percent of a sovereign fund is frozen and you don’t have access to it, that should be an alarm bell for policymakers,” said Simon Quijano-Evans, a strategist at Legal & General Investment Management. “It’s been assumed so far that these assets were relatively immune.” SWFs have laboured for years to position themselves as little different from any other institutional investor, mostly to allay concerns countries might have about selling assets to foreign governments.  Some SWFs have even renounced their sovereign immunity in investment contracts, according to Professor Fabio Bassan, an SWF law specialist and International Law Chair at Roma Tre University. But by depicting themselves as commercial investors rather than as agents of the state, SWFs have allowed their claim to sovereign immunity to be eroded, experts say. “The more they act like ordinary commercial investors and not as vehicles of the state, it creates a risk that courts will not view them as instruments of the state, and are less likely to give them immunity,” Ohio University’s Rose said. As in the Kazakh case, courts in different countries have different interpretations of the status of an SWF. Graham Harris, a partner at law firm Squire Patton Boggs, noted that English law still makes it difficult to seize sovereign wealth, but continental European courts are increasingly likely to view an SWF as a commercial entity.  “It’s a moving target,” he said.

2018-02-20,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index falls 0.25 pct, Nikkei drops 1 pct * European stocks dip overnight, US markets closed Mon for holiday * Spreadbetters expect mixed start for European stocks By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday, their recent recovery stalling after European equities broke a winning streak, while the dollar edged further away from three-year lows. Spreadbetters expected a mixed start for European stocks, with Britain’s FTSE seen rising 0.1 percent, Germany’s DAX dropping 0.1 percent and France’s CAC dipping 0.07 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.25 percent. Australian stocks were little changed, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei retreated 1 percent after three successive days of gains. The pan-European STOXX index fell 0.6 percent on Monday following a three-day ascent, dragged down by falls in consumer staples stocks. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for a holiday, and the focus will be on whether Wall Street can maintain its recovery once trading resumes. The Dow gained 4.5 percent last week, winning back more than half of the territory lost during a sharp downturn earlier in the month. “Whether other markets can continue their recovery depends to a large degree on how U.S. stocks perform,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “Volatility will also have to keep settling for the broader recovery to continue,” he said. The VIX index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” measure of market volatility - has slipped below 20, less than half the 50-point peak touched earlier in February. Upbeat prospects for global growth helped lift world stocks to record highs earlier this year, although slow wage increases have been a common issue for many economies. For example Japan has marked its longest economic expansion since the 1980s but wage increases have remained elusive amid long stretches of deflation. A monthly Reuters survey showed that more than half of companies in the world’s third largest economy do not plan to raise base pay in annual wage talks in coming months. DOLLAR PULLS AWAY FROM 3-YEAR LOWS The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.3 percent higher at 89.346, continuing its rebound from a three-year low of 88.253 set on Friday. The dollar added 0.15 percent to 106.760 yen and the euro dipped 0.15 percent to $1.2387. Oil prices were mixed, with reduced flows from Canada pushing up U.S. crude while Brent sagged on the back of weaker Asian stocks and the dollar’s bounce. U.S. crude futures were 1 percent higher at $62.32 per barrel after touching $62.74, the highest since Feb. 7. Brent lost 0.35 percent to $65.45 per barrel. Overall, oil markets remain well supported due to supply restraint by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). “OPEC and Russia continue to support the production cuts that are due to expire at the end of this year, and they assure markets that there will be an orderly ramp up of production once the cuts expire,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Spot gold slipped 0.4 percent to 1,341.06 an ounce, weighed by the dollar’s bounce.

2018-02-20,"NEW YORK, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Throughout 2016 and 2017, a rail terminal built to accept crude oil for the largest East Coast refinery often sat idle, with few trains showing up to unload. Although little oil flowed, plenty of money did. Under a deal Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) signed in 2015, the refiner paid minimum quarterly payments of $30 million to terminal owner North Yard Logistics LP - even if little crude arrived. Much of that cash, in turn, flowed to the investors that own both PES and North Yard, led by the Carlyle Group, a global private equity firm with $178 billion in assets. The deal in effect guaranteed lucrative payouts to Carlyle regardless of whether the refinery benefitted from the arrangement. When oil market conditions made the rail shipments unprofitable later that year, the refinery took heavy losses while its investors continued to collect large distributions for two more years. The rail contract exemplifies the financial demands Carlyle imposed on PES in the years leading up to the refiner’s bankruptcy in January. The Carlyle-led consortium collected at least $594 million in cash distributions from PES before it collapsed, according to a Reuters review of bankruptcy filings. Carlyle paid $175 million in 2012 for its two-thirds stake in the refiner. More than half the distributions to the Carlyle-led investors were financed by loans against PES assets that the refiner now can’t pay back, the filings show. The rest came from the refiner’s operating budget and payments PES made under the terminal deal to North Yard, a firm with no offices or employees that PES spun off in 2015. PES has blamed its bankruptcy on environmental regulations that require all U.S. refiners to cover the costs of blending corn-based ethanol into the nation’s gasoline. But the ill-fated train terminal deal and other large payouts to investors played key roles in the refiner’s collapse, according to filings and five current or former PES employees who were involved in the refinery’s decision-making. The employees spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The investor payouts, along with a slump in refining economics, left PES unable to cover its obligations under the decade-old U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard or the loans it took to finance the distributions to Carlyle, the filings show. PES had $600 million in debt and $43 million in cash on hand when it filed bankruptcy last month. It now hopes to restructure and continue operations, which employ about 1,100 people. Carlyle Group spokesman Christopher Ullman declined to comment on whether the distributions or the rail-terminal deal contributed to the refiner’s bankruptcy. PES spokeswoman Cherice Corley defended the payments to Carlyle and said the biofuels regulations played a “significant” role its collapse. “We feel our capital structure was appropriate, and any suggestion that it was the cause of our restructuring is completely ignoring the significant effect of the flawed Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS),” Corley said. Other refiners and Pennsylvania officials have also blamed biofuels regulation for the South Philadelphia refinery’s failure, triggering renewed debate about the program on Capitol Hill. Refiners without the necessary blending facilities, such as PES, are required to purchase regulatory credits, known as RINs, from firms that do such blending. The cost of compliance for PES rose from $13 million in 2012 to $218 million in 2017 as prices increased for the credits, which are traded in an open market. The refiner, however, failed to pay a large portion of that obligation. In addition to its conventional debt, PES still owes the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulatory credits worth about $350 million, an amount tied to the fuel it produced over the past two years, according to filings. The firm stopped buying RINs last year - and instead sold them to other refiners for what likely amounted to tens of millions of dollars, Reuters reported in November. The corn and ethanol lobby has pushed back on the argument that biofuels regulation sunk PES, pointing out that other refiners governed by the same law are raking in their highest profits in years. The refinery’s failure had more to do with the hefty profits it paid to Carlyle as its cash reserves dwindled and its debt soared, said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Council. “The Carlyle Group looks more like a corporate raider than a savior in this deal,” Coleman said. Carlyle would not lose any of its gains on the PES investment under the refiner’s proposed restructuring plan, which has the support of almost all creditors, according to filings. PES also asks the bankruptcy court to entirely absolve its $350 million obligation to the EPA. EPA spokeswoman Liz Bowman declined to comment on the delinquent PES credit obligations, citing the bankruptcy proceedings. Carlyle bought its stake in PES as many other East Coast refineries were closing down because of weak margins. The previous owner, Sunoco - now Energy Transfer Partners - contributed the refinery’s assets and became a non-controlling partner. The $175 million Carlyle paid was its only investment in PES, filings show, and the firm soon recouped its acquisition costs through a loan against the refinery. At the direction of its investor-controlled board, PES borrowed $550 million in March 2013 and paid $200 million of that to investors, according to bankruptcy filings. PES then spent $100 million building the rail terminal that year and $30 million in 2014 to double its capacity. At the time, U.S. oil production was skyrocketing as improved drilling technology unlocked new reserves in places such as North Dakota. Carlyle saw an opportunity to tap this cheaper supply and wean PES off costly imports. The plan worked well at first, in 2013 and 2014, and PES posted earnings of about $500 million for the two years combined. In January 2015, PES spun off the terminal, creating North Yard as a separate firm. PES then signed a ten-year agreement with North Yard to pay $1.95 for each barrel unloaded and agreed to a minimum quarterly volume of 170,000 bpd, guaranteeing the $30 million quarterly payments to North Yard. For any barrel PES unloaded above the threshold, the refinery paid North Yard 51 cents. The system was designed to reward PES for success, but had no contingency plan to protect the refiner against the failure that would quickly follow the deal. The rail terminal has averaged just 58,000 bpd since the contract was signed, according to figures provided to Reuters by energy intelligence service Genscape, because Carlyle and PES could no longer access crude at prices low enough to make the rail shipments profitable. That left PES paying millions of dollars to Carlyle, through North Yard, for oil shipments it never received. Carlyle’s purchase of PES and the rail terminal investment were bets that U.S. oil would remain cheap relative to imports. A glut of domestic production had caused U.S. crude to sell at a deep discount to imported barrels, with the gap averaging about $8.60 between 2012 and 2015. But by late 2015, an oil price rebound slashed the domestic discount to less than $3 a barrel – not enough to cover the cost of a long rail journey. PES nonetheless continued to pay North Yard a total of $298 million between 2015 until August 2017, filings show. The Carlyle-led investor group received $151 million, in eight distributions, of the total paid to North Yard. In November of that year, PES took on more debt to finance more payouts to investors, borrowing a total of $160 million in two loans against the rail terminal and delivering the proceeds its Carlyle-led backers, filings show. Corley, the PES spokeswoman said terminal investment more than paid for itself during its more profitable period. But for last two years, PES said in filings, the refinery remained largely cut off from the cheap crude it needed to survive. “Perversely, it became cheaper to transport crude oil from North Dakota to points in Western Europe than it was to transport the same crude oil to Philadelphia,” the firm said.

2018-02-20,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Seaborne U.S. coal exports by region: reut.rs/2EBzHNI By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 20 (Reuters) - If China does seek a way to retaliate against U.S. proposals to impose import curbs on steel and aluminium, then targeting President Donald Trump’s favoured coal would be tempting. One of Trump’s key campaign promises in the 2016 election victory was to end the war on what he termed “beautiful, clean” coal. Figures released last week by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) suggest he has met with some success. U.S. coal output surged the most in 16 years to reach 773 million short tonnes, equivalent to about 701 million metric tonnes, in 2017, the EIA said on Feb. 16. Coal miners produced about 40.8 million tonnes more in 2017 than in 2016, the EIA said. So far, so good for Trump. But the problem is that virtually all of the good news for U.S. coal producers is on the export side - and this is mainly a China phenomenon. U.S. exports are expected to have risen 58 percent in 2017 from the prior year to about 86.2 million tonnes, according to the EIA, with volumes to Asia nearly doubling to about 28.1 million tonnes. These figures largely tally with ship-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. Seaborne U.S. coal exports were about 79.4 million tonnes in 2017, up from 64.1 million in 2016, according to the vessel data. China bought 5.95 million tonnes of U.S. coal last year, more than double the 2.8 million of the prior year, while India remained the top Asian destination, with imports of 13 million tonnes, up from 8.7 million in 2016. Japan remained slightly ahead of China with imports of 6.9 million tonnes of U.S. coal in 2017, up from 5.2 million the prior year, according to the vessel-tracking numbers. These figures don’t make it explicit that China is the main driver behind the burgeoning U.S. coal exports, given that the world’s largest importer of the polluting fuel only bought 3.15 million tonnes more from the United States last year than in 2016. However, the main dynamic driving coal markets is Chinese import demand, and the 6.1 percent gain in its imports in 2017 from the prior year has helped prices for both thermal and coking coal remain at robust levels. The Asian benchmark thermal coal price, the Newcastle Weekly Index ended 2017 at $103.88 a tonne, up 10 percent from the end of 2016. While this represents a solid gain, it’s worth noting that the low for 2017 was $72.42 a tonne, and that the index spent the majority of the year trading above $80 - something it hadn’t done since 2013. For U.S. coal exports to be competitive in Asia, and also in Europe, a thermal coal price of at least $70 a tonne is required, given the cost of mining, inland transportation and shipping in the United States. Chinese import demand has ensured that thermal coal prices have remained in the sweet spot for U.S. producers, allowing them to be competitive in Europe against exports from Colombia and South Africa, as well as in Asia. The relatively high prices for coking coal, used in steel-making, has also helped U.S. exporters of this higher-quality fuel, especially in India where they compete against supplies from top exporter Australia. The outlook for U.S. coal exports is largely price-dependent, and this in turn is largely a function of how much China imports. If China comes close in 2018 to importing the 270 million tonnes it did in 2017, then prices are likely to hold up, providing U.S. miners with the opportunity to maintain, or possibly even grow their exports. The current balance of risks is that China’s coal imports will moderate somewhat this year as the country ramps up domestic output and continues its switch to less-polluting fuels such as natural gas. If this is the case, then prices may drift lower toward the level where U.S. exports start to struggle, especially in Asia. There is also no current suggestion that China would retaliate against the United States by targeting coal, should Trump accept the recommendation of the U.S. Commerce Department for a slew of curbs and tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from a variety of exporting countries. So far the Chinese response has been limited to saying the U.S. trade review report is “baseless” and that it will take steps to protect its interests if the final decision affects China. While a tit-for-tat trade war is unlikely to be in either the interests of China or the United States, putting barriers on U.S. coal imports would be a powerful signal from Beijing, aimed straight at Trump’s heartland.

2018-02-20,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global giants ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA) have reached broad agreement on plans to double gas exports from Papua New Guinea, their partner Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX) said on Tuesday. The plan to expand the ExxonMobil-operated Papua New Guinea liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant to around 16 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) would see it rival Australia’s biggest LNG projects, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts. Oil Search said the companies plan to add three new LNG units, or trains, with two underpinned by gas from the Elk-Antelope fields, run by Total, and one underpinned by existing fields and the new P’nyang field, run by Exxon. “There’s no doubt that keeping it simple is one of the great advantages of the concept that is presently on the table,” Managing Director Peter Botten told analysts after the company reported a near threefold rise in annual core profit. “It also allows a smart way of both marketing gas and financing.” The partners aim to start engineering and design work in the second half of this year, but first need to agree terms with the PNG government, Botten said. These include domestic gas supply requirements, local content and landowner agreements. The companies also need to sign off on cost-sharing and phasing the timing of their gas field developments.   “Joint venture alignment challenges remain, and shouldn’t be underestimated,” said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with consultants Wood Mackenzie. Botten was confident ExxonMobil and Total are committed to the project, which is aiming for a final investment decision in 2019. “I know they all have other interests around the world. But in no way do I see any blinking or any reluctance to move these projects forward. They’re good, economic solid projects,” he told reporters. The expansion is expected to be much cheaper than the original $19.5 billion cost of building the PNG LNG plant. Botten said, declining to comment on the cost estimate ahead of further engineering work. Bernstein analysts estimate the 8 mtpa of new capacity could be added for between $12 billion and $14 billion, or around $1,600 a ton.  That would be less than half the per ton cost of Chevron Corp’s (CVX.N) Gorgon LNG plant in Australia, which is slightly smaller than the expanded PNG LNG plant would be. Australia’s other major LNG plant is the Woodside-operated (WPL.AX) North West Shelf, which has annual production of around 16 mtpa. “This is the big shift in the next cycle of the PNG-Australian LNG story. It’s very much about lower cost, brownfield, backfill developments,” Bernstein analyst Neil Beveridge said. The partners in Papua New Guinea are racing to start producing from the new trains by around 2023 or 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply due to rapidly growing demand in Asia and a lack of other new projects. “We believe we’re marketing at a perfect time for PNG LNG and Papua LNG to secure these markets,” Botten told analysts. He was speaking after Oil Search reported core profit for 2017 rose to $302.1 million from $106.7 million a year earlier, on the back of sharply higher oil and gas prices and higher sales.

2018-02-20,"(Removes extraneous word from paragraph 1) * U.S. crude futures rise on reduced Canadian oil flows * Firmer dollar dents international Brent crude * Overall markets well supported by ongoing OPEC production cuts By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Oil markets were split on Tuesday, with U.S. crude pushed up by reduced flows from Canada while international Brent prices eased. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel at 0153 GMT, up 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. Traders said the higher WTI prices were a result of reduced flows from Canada’s Keystone pipeline, which has been operating below capacity since late last year due to a leak, cutting Canadian supplies into the United States. Outside North America, Brent crude eased on the back of a dip in Asian stocks and a stronger dollar, which potentially curbs demand as it makes fuel more expensive for countries using other currencies domestically. Brent crude futures were at $65.23 per barrel, down 44 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close. Despite this, oil markets remain well supported due to supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started last year in order to draw down excess global inventories. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Monday the organisation registered 133 percent compliance with agreed output reduction targets in January. Barkindo said compliance last year stood at 107 percent. Global oil demand for 2018 is estimated to grow 1.6 million barrels per day due to an “encouraging environment”, Barkindo added. “OPEC and Russia continue to support the production cuts that are due to expire at the end of this year, and they assure markets that there will be an orderly ramp up of production once the cuts expire,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. While most of OPEC, especially its de-facto leader Saudi Arabia, is showing strong support for the production restraint, non-OPEC producer Russia has shown signs it may at some stage gradually start to increase output again. Saudi Arabia - not least in an attempt to give the planned listing of its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco - a boost, is keen for Russia and other producers to keep withholding supplies to prop up prices. But soaring U.S. production is threatening to erode OPEC’s efforts. Last week, the amount of U.S. oil rigs drilling for new production rose for a fourth straight week to 798, in an indication that U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA, already at a record 10.27 million bpd, may rise further. The United States late last year became the world’s second biggest oil producers, only slightly behind Russia and ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia.

2018-02-20,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A massive annual loss estimate by commodities trader Noble Group makes it more likely that creditors will back its $3.4 billion (2.4 billion pounds) debt-for-equity restructuring to ensure the company’s survival, analysts said. Noble, which flagged an annual loss of up to $5 billion on Monday, announced an initial deal with creditors last month to halve its senior debt and give them 70 percent of the company, with existing equity holders diluted to 10 percent.  “The losses were expected to clean the old Noble balance sheet once and for all. In doing so, the management makes endorsing the restructuring the only viable alternative for creditors,” said Jean-Francois Lambert, a consultant and former global head of commodity trade finance at HSBC. Over the last three years, Noble - once a global commodity trader with ambitions to rival the likes of Glencore and Vitol - has cut hundreds of jobs, sold billions of dollars of assets, taken hefty writedowns and changed its CEOs and chairman. In a statement, Singapore-listed Noble highlighted challenging operating conditions and flagged a total net loss of $1.72 billion to $1.92 billion for the quarter to December 2017, stemming largely from non-cash losses from its mark-to-market derivatives portfolio. “I expect something close to the current deal to go through based on a much worse outcome for everybody if they have to liquidate and start over,” said Andrew DeVries, an analyst at research firm CreditSights. Noble flagged a record annual loss for 2017 of $4.78 billion to $4.98 billion, which follows a profit of $9 million in 2016 and a loss of $1.7 billion in 2015. It said a group of senior creditors, known as the Ad Hoc Group, with whom it had struck an agreement in principle to restructure debt, held about 36 percent of the company’s senior bonds and loans. It said the group’s advisers were in contact with creditors who held about an additional 15 percent of Noble’s senior debt instruments and had indicated their broad support for the restructuring. “Shareholders and perpetual bond holders will bite the bullet in any case,” said Lambert. Founded in 1986 by Richard Elman, who rode a commodities bull run to build one of the world’s biggest traders, Noble was plunged into crisis in February 2015 when Iceberg Research questioned its accounts. Noble has defended its accounts. Noble’s market value has fallen to just S$259 million ($197 million) from $6 billion in February 2015. Noble reports annual results on Feb. 28. “Following a challenging 2017, we are looking forward to the final phase of our restructuring, and the creation of a new Noble...” said Paul Brough, a restructuring specialist who took over as Noble’s chairman last year.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.5 percent. Australian stocks fell 0.3 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.85 percent. Japan’s Nikkei retreated 1.25 percent after three successive days of gains. The pan-European STOXX index fell 0.6 percent on Monday following a three-day ascent, dragged down by falls in consumer staples stocks. U.S. markets were closed on Monday for a holiday, and the focus will be on whether Wall Street can maintain its recovery once trading resumes. The Dow gained 4.5 percent last week, winning back more than half of the territory lost during a sharp downturn earlier in the month. “Whether other markets can continue their recovery depends to a large degree on how U.S. stocks perform,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “Volatility will also have to keep settling for the broader recovery to continue,” he said. The VIX index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” measure of market volatility - has slipped below 20, less than half the 50-point peak touched earlier in February. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.3 percent higher at 89.348 to put further distance between a three-year low of 88.253 set on Friday. The dollar was a shade higher at 106.720 yen and the euro dipped 0.15 percent to $1.2388.

2018-02-20,"* U.S. crude futures rise on reduced Canadian oil flows * Firmer dollar dents international Brent crude * Overall markets well supported by ongoing OPEC production cuts By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Oil markets were split on Tuesday, with U.S. crude was pushed up by reduced flows from Canada while international Brent prices eased. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $62.16 a barrel at 0153 GMT, up 48 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. Traders said the higher WTI prices were a result of reduced flows from Canada’s Keystone pipeline, which has been operating below capacity since late last year due to a leak, cutting Canadian supplies into the United States. Outside North America, Brent crude eased on the back of a dip in Asian stocks and a stronger dollar, which potentially curbs demand as it makes fuel more expensive for countries using other currencies domestically. Brent crude futures were at $65.23 per barrel, down 44 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close. Despite this, oil markets remain well supported due to supply restraint by the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started last year in order to draw down excess global inventories. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said on Monday the organisation registered 133 percent compliance with agreed output reduction targets in January. Barkindo said compliance last year stood at 107 percent. Global oil demand for 2018 is estimated to grow 1.6 million barrels per day due to an “encouraging environment”, Barkindo added. “OPEC and Russia continue to support the production cuts that are due to expire at the end of this year, and they assure markets that there will be an orderly ramp up of production once the cuts expire,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. While most of OPEC, especially its de-facto leader Saudi Arabia, is showing strong support for the production restraint, non-OPEC producer Russia has shown signs it may at some stage gradually start to increase output again. Saudi Arabia - not least in an attempt to give the planned listing of its state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco - a boost, is keen for Russia and other producers to keep withholding supplies to prop up prices. But soaring U.S. production is threatening to erode OPEC’s efforts. Last week, the amount of U.S. oil rigs drilling for new production rose for a fourth straight week to 798, in an indication that U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA, already at a record 10.27 million bpd, may rise further. The United States late last year became the world’s second biggest oil producers, only slightly behind Russia and ahead of top exporter Saudi Arabia.

2018-02-20,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2BCCBz1 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Petroleum markets were hit by a heavy bout of profit-taking in the second week of February as hedge funds liquidated some of the record long positions they accumulated over the previous seven months. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by the equivalent of 152 million barrels in the week to Feb. 13. Fund managers have now cut the combined net long position in Brent, NYMEX and ICE, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil by a total of 215 million barrels over the three most recent weeks. Even so, the combined net long position is still 959 million barrels higher than at the end of June 2017, when fund managers began to turn bullish (tmsnrt.rs/2BCCBz1). The most recent week saw large reductions in net long positions in Brent (-32 million barrels) and WTI (-31 million barrels). But in proportionate terms, there were even larger reductions in European gasoil (-38 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-32 million barrels) and U.S. gasoline (-20 million barrels). Refined fuels accounted for 25 percent of hedge fund managers’ net long position in the petroleum complex but almost 60 percent of the liquidation in the week to Feb. 13. The reduction in net long positions across the complex was the largest pull for nine months, according to position records published by exchanges and regulators. In every contract, the liquidation of long positions far outstripped the creation of new short ones, indicating fund managers were realising some profits after the strong rally in oil prices, rather than turning outright bearish. Portfolio managers’ positioning remains very lopsided across the complex, with longs outnumbering shorts by a ratio of more than 10:1, down from almost 12:1 at the end of January, but still exceptionally high. The near-record imbalance remains a significant source of downside risk and could lead to a further sharp drop in oil prices if anything triggers further profit-taking. Fund managers still hold more than 1,400 million barrels of long positions in petroleum futures and options, a scale that was unprecedented until two months ago. There are fewer than 140 million barrels of hedge fund short positions, which is close to the lowest level since prices started falling in 2014, and means there will be little support from short-covering should prices fall. But the fundamental backdrop remains strong, with oil consumption growing rapidly, reported inventories declining and OPEC signalling production cuts will be extended through the end of 2018. Strong fundamentals have discouraged aggressive short-selling and convinced many fund managers to retain (most of) their existing long positions despite the recent pull back in crude prices.

2018-02-20,"(Corrects to say three bodies, not three crew members in 2nd paragraph) * Jan Iranian crude imports at 950,013 T, lowest since Oct 2016 * Total Jan crude imports at 13.25 mln T, up 7 pct y/y By Jane Chung SEOUL, Feb 15 (Reuters) - South Korea’s crude oil imports from Iran fell 47 percent in January from a year ago to 950,013 tonnes, or 224,632 barrels per day (bpd), the lowest since October 2016, customs data showed on Thursday. The fall in South Korea’s Iranian oil intake partly reflects the sinking last month of an Iranian tanker carrying 136,000 tonnes of condensate after a collision with a Chinese cargo ship. The bodies of three of the 32 crew members were recovered and the other 29 are presumed dead. The condensate cargo was to be delivered to South Korea’s petrochemical company Hanwha Total Petrochemical. South Korea, the world’s fifth-biggest crude oil importer, mainly buys condensate - an ultra-light oil - from Iran and increased purchases of the oil after sanctions against the Islamic republic were lifted in 2016. But South Korea’s oil imports from Iran have declined since November 2017 as Iran’s condensate exports had been dented by a “technical problem” at South Pars field. The Middle East country cut the official selling price for its crude in February and widened discounts for heavy grades against Saudi Arabia to retain its major Asian buyers. Overall, South Korea’s January crude oil imports totalled 13.25 million tonnes, or 3.13 million bpd, up 7.1 percent from 12.37 million tonnes in the same month last year, according to the data. Crude oil imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude oil supplier, rose 11.2 percent from a year ago to 3.69 million tonnes in January, or 872,840 bpd, but were down 7.8 percent on December as the kingdom continues to curb its oil output to comply with a global oil supply cut deal. Final data for South Korea’s January crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.

2018-02-20,"(Repeats story first published on Monday) * GST to be raised to 9 pct from 7 pct ‘sometime’ in 2021-2025 * Finmin: Hike likely earlier than later in period * Goods and services tax has not been hiked since 2007 * Carbon taxes to be implemented from 2019 * Citizens to get bonus payment after solid 2017 growth By Masayuki Kitano and John Geddie SINGAPORE, Feb 19 (Reuters) - Singapore said its sales tax will rise to 9 percent from 7 percent, but the change will only come “sometime” between 2021 and 2025, making it likely that the increase would kick in after the city-state’s next general election. Instead of getting a GST hike soon, Singaporeans aged 21 and above will get a “hong bao”, or Lunar New Year red packet, as Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a “one-off” bonus in 2018 of up to S$300 ($228.50), depending on their income. The bonus comes after Singapore’s trade-reliant economy grew 3.6 percent in 2017, its best pace in three years. Global economic growth, plus comments by policymakers on the importance of raising revenue to meet future spending needs for Singapore’s ageing population, led many analysts to expect that the Goods and Services Tax, kept at 7 percent since 2007, would increase as early as the coming fiscal year. “The surprise for us was that the planned increase was for a much later period,” said Jeff Ng, chief economist Asia for Continuum Economics. “This eases the need for a future government or administration to announce the GST,” Ng said. Singapore’s next general election is due to be held by January 2021. In the last one in 2015, the ruling People’s Action Party won 70 percent of the vote, a strong improvement from the 60 percent garnered in 2011. After announcing the planned GST hike, the finance minister said “the exact timing will depend on the state of the economy, how much our expenditures grow, and how buoyant our existing taxes are. But I expect that we will need to do so earlier rather than later in the period.” Singapore introduced a GST in 1994, with a 3 percent rate. This was raised to 4 percent in 2003 and 5 percent in 2004, then to 7 percent in 2007. The current rate is among the world’s lowest for a consumption tax. Besides the plan for raising GST, Heng unveiled other tax measures. These include increasing the top marginal buyer’s stamp duty on residential property worth more than S$1 million effective from Tuesday, raising the excise duty on tobacco products and introducing GST on imported services from 2020. Coming in 2019 is a carbon tax, which will be S$5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions until 2023. The plan is to increase it to between S$10-S$15 per tonne by 2030. Heng said spending needs will rise across various sectors in coming years, including in healthcare, infrastructure and security. The government expects average annual healthcare spending to rise from 2.2 percent of GDP currently, to almost 3 percent of GDP over the next decade, he added. “With an ageing population and an increasing chronic disease burden, the demands on families and Government will rise,” the finance minister said. “We will need to spend even more on healthcare.” Heng, one of several cabinet ministers considered a possible successor to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, said in the speech “We must anchor Singapore as a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise.” Song Seng Wun, an economist for CIMB private banking, said the one-off “hong bao” bonus was a product of Singapore’s economy having a “better than expected outcome” in the last year.
