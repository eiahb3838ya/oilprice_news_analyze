2018-12-15,"(Reuters) - Motiva Enterprises has preliminarily been chosen by the government of Curacao to operate the 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery, replacing Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA, local media said on Saturday. The refinery has been idle since May when a legal dispute between PDVSA and U.S. producer ConocoPhillips (COP.N) forced its closure. PDVSA’s contract to run the facility, which is crucial for its storage, refining and shipping operations, will expire at the end of 2019. The government of the Caribbean island is seeking a company willing to handle it in the long run and  probably also to finish the lease term next year. Motiva, based in Houston, was chosen by Curacao from a list of interested companies as the “preferred bidder” to run the refinery from 2020 or possibly before, if a separate agreement is reached, according to the Antilliaans Dagblad newspaper. Motiva is a U.S. subsidiary of Saudi energy giant Aramco and a regular buyer of Venezuelan crude. The Curacao refinery on Saturday confirmed a company was chosen but said it would not disclose the name of the new operator until a final agreement is signed. Motiva declined to comment in a statement.  A memorandum of understanding between the chosen operator and the government is expected to be signed in mid-January, the manager of the refinery, Marcelino de Lannoy, told Reuters.  Lannoy, who is temporarily replacing Isla’s managing director, Roderick Van Kwartel, amid accusations of corruption linked to the bidding process to choose the new operator, also said PDVSA has agreed to cooperate in any transition. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Curacao Refinery Utilities (CUR), the company that provides water and electricity to the facility, is expected to resume supply this month to prepare the refinery for its restart.  Earlier this year, Motiva said it was weighing an expansion of its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery. But in June that plan was scrapped over what sources said were worries about concentrating too much production in a single, hurricane-prone location.  Instead, Motiva was “actively exploring a number of opportunities and locations” to boost its North American refining capacity to as much as 1.5 million barrels per day, a Motiva spokeswoman said.

2018-12-15,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Nearly 200 countries overcame political divisions late on Saturday to agree on rules for implementing a landmark global climate deal, but critics say it is not ambitious enough to prevent the dangerous effects of global warming. After two weeks of talks in the Polish city of Katowice, nations finally reached consensus on a more detailed framework for the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit a rise in average world temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. “It is not easy to find agreement on a deal so specific and technical. Through this package you have made a thousand little steps forward together. You can feel proud,” Polish president of the talks Michal Kurtyka told delegates. After he struck the gavel to signal agreement had been reached, ministers joined him on the stage, hugging and laughing in signs of relief after the marathon talks. Before the talks started, many expected the deal would not be as robust as needed. The unity which underpinned the Paris talks has fragmented, and U.S. President Donald Trump intends to pull his country - one of the world’s biggest emitters - out of the pact. At the 11th hour, ministers managed to break a deadlock between Brazil and other countries over the accounting rules for  the monitoring of carbon credits, deferring the bulk of that discussion to next year, but missing an opportunity to send a signal to businesses to speed up their actions. Still, exhausted ministers managed to bridge a series of divides to produce a 156-page rulebook - which is broken down into themes such as how countries will report and monitor their national pledges to curb greenhouse gas emissions and update their emissions plans. Not everyone is happy with everything, but the process is still on track and it is something to build on, several ministers said. “While some rulebook elements still need to be fleshed out, it is a foundation for strengthening the Paris Agreement and could help facilitate U.S. re-entry into the Paris Agreement by a future presidential administration,” said Alden Meyer of the Union of Concerned Scientists.  Some countries and green groups criticised the outcome for failing to urge increased ambitions on emissions cuts sufficiently to curb rising temperatures. Poorer nations vulnerable to climate change also wanted more clarity on how an already agreed $100 billion a year of climate finance by 2020 will be provided and on efforts to build on that amount further from the end of the decade.  A statement by U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, who left the talks on Thursday, stressed the need for more work. “From now on, my five priorities will be: ambition, ambition, ambition, ambition and ambition,” it said. “And ambition must guide all member states as they prepare their (emissions cut plans) for 2020 to reverse the present trend in which climate change is still running faster than us.” A U.N.-commissioned report by the IPCC in October warned that keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C would need “unprecedented changes” in every aspect of society. Last week, Saudi Arabia, the Unites States, Russia and Kuwait refused to use the word “welcome” in association with the findings of the report. The decision text now merely expresses gratitude for the work on the report, welcomes its timely completion and invites parties to use the information in it. For many low-lying states and islands at risk from rising sea levels, this is not strong enough but had to be accepted grudgingly in exchange for other trade-offs. During the two weeks of talks in Katowice - in the mining region of Silesia, a focus on the fossil fuel industry provided an unwelcome distraction for some countries and environmental groups which want to focus on cleaner energy. The conference itself has been hosted by coal-reliant Poland, which has sought to protect its mining industry. The U.S. administration’s only event in Katowice was seen as trying to rebrand coal as a potentially clean energy source.

The OPEC deal had hung in the balance for two days - first on fears that Russia would cut too little, and later on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement.

2018-12-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has aggressively sought to roll back Obama-era environmental protections, will be leaving his post at the end of the year, President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday, the latest high-profile departure from his administration.  Trump did not give a reason for Zinke’s departure. However, the former Navy Seal and ex-congressman from Montana has faced scrutiny of his use of security details, chartered flights and a real estate deal. “Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation,” Trump said on Twitter. “The Trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the Interior next week.” Zinke has run the Interior Department, which oversees America’s vast public lands, since early 2017. He has aggressively pursued Trump’s agenda to promote oil drilling and coal mining by expanding federal leasing, cutting royalty rates, and easing land protections despite environmental protests. Zinke, 51, was among Trump’s most active Cabinet members, cutting huge wilderness national monuments in Utah to a fraction of their size and proposing offshore oil drilling in the Arctic, Pacific and Atlantic. He became a darling of the U.S. energy and mining industries and a prime target for conservationists and environmental groups. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer welcomed Zinke’s departure in a tweet: “Ryan Zinke was one of the most toxic members of the cabinet in the way he treated our environment, our precious public lands, and the way he treated the govt like it was his personal honey pot.” “The swamp cabinet will be a little less foul without him,” Schumer said. Jamie Williams, president of the non-profit Wilderness Society, said he expects Zinke’s deputy and likely successor, David Bernhardt, to continue with the “drill everywhere” agenda. “Deputy Secretary Bernhardt has made it his mission to stifle climate science and silence the public so polluters can profit,” said Williams. “Unfortunately, even with Secretary Zinke out, the Interior Department remains disturbingly biased in favour of special interests over the health of American communities and the public lands that they love.” Critics have questioned Zinke’s ethics and some of his moves triggered government investigations. In July, the Interior Department’s Office of Inspector General began investigating a Montana land deal between a foundation Zinke set up and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton Co (HAL.N), which has business with the Interior Department. In late October, that investigation was referred to the U.S. Justice Department for a possible criminal investigation, according to multiple media reports. The Department of Justice and the Interior Department have declined to comment. There are two other investigations of Zinke’s conduct. Interior’s watchdog is examining whether the department purposely redrew the boundaries of Utah’s Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument to benefit a state lawmaker who owns adjoining property. It is also probing Zinke’s decision to block casinos proposed by two Connecticut Native American tribes. Critics allege he made that move, overruling his staff’s recommendation, shortly after he met with lobbyists for MGM Resorts International (MGM.N), which owns a new casino in the region.  Zinke has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Earlier this year, Interior’s inspector general wrapped up two other investigations related to Zinke’s travel expenses. Those probes found that a $12,000 private flight he took after a meeting with a professional hockey team could have been avoided and that the security detail he took on a family vacation to Greece and Turkey cost taxpayers $25,000. Trump, who has repeatedly praised Zinke, said on Nov. 5 that he would look at the allegations. Zinke’s departure makes him the ninth Cabinet-level official to leave since Trump took office two years ago. Other departures have included Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt.

2018-12-15,"* Climate talks in Poland in overtime * Marathon talks clouded by political divisions * Sticking points remain but some say deal within reach By Nina Chestney KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 15 (Reuters) - United Nations’ climate talks to agree on the rules of the 2015 Paris Agreement dragged on into an extra day on Saturday as ministers tried to overcome the last political hurdles after working through the night. The schedule for the closing plenary, when sparks could fly among nations if there are issues in the text still open to opposition, has been repeatedly pushed back to later in the day - a sign a more diplomacy work needs to be done. Some exhausted negotiators were seen leaving the conference venue in Katowice, Poland, in the early hours of Saturday morning to get a few hours’ rest but many ministers worked through the night to try and iron out differences. Despite this, European climate commissioner Miguel Arias Canete seemed optimistic on Saturday morning. “UN climate talks go into overtime. Latest version of the draft agreement just out...A deal to make the Paris Agreement operational is within reach,” he tweeted. The last stumbling blocks have been around the ambition of developed countries’ emissions cut pledges which countries more vulnerable to climate change are trying to increase. Another sticking point remains over accounting rules for future carbon market mechanisms. A senior negotiator said Brazil still had concerns over the rules aimed at avoiding double counting emissions cuts. “There are still a range of possible outcomes and Brazil continues to work constructively with other parties to find a workable pathway forward,” Antonio Marcondes, Brazil’s chief negotiator, told Reuters. Countries are on a self-imposed deadline to produce a “rulebook” to flesh out details of the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aims to limit the global temperature rise to less than 2 degrees Celsius and which comes into force in 2020. Talks in Katowice have been going on for two weeks and were due to end on Dec. 14 but they have been clouded by political divisions. A rift last week over how to express the importance of a U.N. commissioned report on keeping global warming within a 1.5 degrees Celsius limit appears to have been calmed, with language changed to “note” rather than “welcome” the report. Talks have also faltered over increasing finance for climate adaptation for poorer countries. Governments have already agreed to raise $100 billion a year by 2020, but developing countries wanted more. The latest text says a meeting in 2020 will start “deliberations” to increase that amount.

2018-12-15,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Climate change talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the 2015 Paris global warming deal are in their last week in Katowice, capital of Poland’s coal mining district. Below is a look at the mood round the event, in a sprawl of temporary passageways and rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped venue on the site of the former Katowice coal mine. Eikon subscribers can see a summary here: The United Nations climate conference in the Polish city of Katowice went into overtime on Saturday after intensive shuttle diplomacy overnight by ministers, negotiators and delegates from nearly 200 countries trying to find common ground on rules to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement. Initially scheduled to end on Friday, the Polish presidency of the talks has several times postponed the final plenary session after it released a draft of the deal, as it holds last minute talks with various parties to smooth out differences. A plenary has been scheduled for 1100 GMT on Saturday, while the time of a final joint closing session has been changed a few times in the last two hours.  One sticking point that has held up the negotiations is the issue of emissions counting cited in Article 6 of the Paris Agreement regarding market-based mechanisms to combat climate change. Under the article, countries should agree to rules to ensure they do not double count emissions reductions.  A senior negotiator told Reuters that Brazil was still obstructive on this issue and did not want clear rules to prevent double counting, which is unacceptable to many nations. Bits and pieces of the draft agreement were published early on Saturday, but the main body of the text is still to be released.  Meanwhile the sprawling flying-saucer-shaped Spodek sports and concert venue has started to resemble a ghost town in the wait for the latest draft text and the final plenary. As support services start their work of dismantling the temporal sections of the venue including exhibition pavilions, water, food and coffee is running low in some sections of the venue.  Haggard activists, observers and reporters try to catch a quick sleep on their desks, chairs and wherever they can. Some hope the talks will not drag on until Sunday, fearing potential complications in their families’ plans for Christmas.  However, some are changing their travel plans with the latest postponement of the final joint plenary to later on Saturday afternoon. As the talks in Katowice draw to a close, participants of the annual U.N. climate gatherings paid tribute to Bernarditas de Castro Muller, a former Filipina diplomat and veteran finance negotiator at the UN climate conference who passed away on Friday. She vociferously fought for developing countries at UN climate talks, an observer said.

U.S. President Donald Trump welcomed the announcement. “China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes,” Trump said in a tweet. “U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!” Shortly after the Chinese announcement, Tesla Inc said it had cut prices on its Model S and Model X vehicles in China. “This is a good signal that China and the United States are on track to solve the trade war,” said Wang Cun, director of the China Automobile Dealers Association’s import committee. “Car makers might be ordering a large number of imported cars now.” Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Motor Co’s global operations, also welcomed Beijing’s announcement, noting that the U.S. automaker exported nearly 50,000 U.S.-built vehicles to China in 2017. “We applaud both governments for working together constructively to reduce trade barriers and open markets,” Hinrichs said. Ford shares rose 2 percent on Friday. In July, China hiked its tariffs on U.S. autos and parts after the United States raised its tariffs on Chinese vehicles and parts to 27.5 percent. Automakers do not expect the United States to immediately cut its higher tariffs on Chinese imports in response to China’s move. Auto exports between the two countries are relatively small. China exported 53,300 vehicles to the U.S. market last year and imported 280,208 U.S. manufactured vehicles, according to data from the China Automotive Technology and Research Center (CATARC), a government-affiliated think-tank. In contrast, in the first 11 months of this year, China produced 25.3 million cars, down 2.6 percent from the same period last year, industry figures showed. Wang said car makers in China that imported cars from the United States had seen a 30 percent decline in volume in the first 10 months of 2018, but the tariff cut would bring imports back to previous levels. German automaker BMW said it welcomes the temporary reduction of tariffs on vehicles imported to China from the United States, adding it is in talks with partners in China how to respond. The financial impact by fees in China for cars imported from the United States is expected to amount to almost 300 million euros ($338 million) for the BMW Group in 2018, the company has said. BMW announced on Saturday that it was cutting its China prices on four U.S.-made models by between 3 and 7 percent: the X5, X6, X5M and X6M. The latest announcement on the planned tariff suspension followed China’s first major purchase of U.S. soybeans since Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping’s landmark talks on trade in Argentina on Dec. 1. The tariff suspension and soybean purchase are early signs that the bitter trade war between China and the United States may be starting to thaw. In Argentina, Trump and Xi agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. increase of tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal. China’s tariff cut was communicated earlier this week during a phone call between Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a Trump administration official said. China will now suspend 25 percent tariffs on 144 U.S. vehicle and auto part items and 5 percent tariffs on 67 auto items between Jan. 1 and March 31, the Chinese finance ministry said.
