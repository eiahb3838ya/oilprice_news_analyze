2019-01-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets mostly rose on Thursday, fueled by upbeat  Facebook earnings and the Federal Reserve’s pledge to be patient in raising borrowing costs further, while U.S. bond yields fell on indications of weaker-than-expected inflation. The benchmark S&P 500 posted its biggest monthly percentage gain, at 7.89 percent, since October 2015 as U.S. equities continued to surge from their late 2018 swoon. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 9.74 percent in its best month since October 2011. The Dow edged lower on a downbeat report by DowDuPont Inc, but MSCI’s gauge of global stock performance rose as it posted its best January on record. DowDuPont shares closed down 9.2 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 15.19 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,999.67. The S&P 500 gained 23.05 points, or 0.86 percent, to 2,704.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 98.66 points, or 1.37 percent, to 7,281.74. U.S. crude prices settled lower as uncertainty about Sino-U.S. trade talks overtook the bullish news about production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, and the Fed’s dovish stance. President Donald Trump said he wanted a “very big” trade deal with China, but he signaled there could be delays if talks fail to meet his goals of opening the Chinese economy broadly to U.S. industry and agriculture. The Fed’s dovish message on monetary policy eased concerns that tighter financial conditions could crimp growth and helped spur stocks along with solid corporate results, such as earnings from Facebook, which topped analysts’ estimates. Facebook shares rose 10.82 percent. The Fed’s stance was “stunning” but Chairman Jerome Powell may be trying to calm the market so that he can hike rates later this year in a classic “rope-a-dope” tactic, said Mike Terwilliger, a portfolio manager at Resource America Inc. Economic data remains weak and a future downturn suggest the Fed should hike rates this year because it won’t be able to when the U.S. electoral campaign is in full swing in 2020, he said. “The need to reload the gun is not going away and the politics suggest he should be as well,” Terwilliger said.  Amazon.com Inc forecast first-quarter sales below Wall Street estimates, even as sales for the holiday quarter hit a record high, rising 20 percent. Shares of the company fell 1.1 percent to $1,700 in trading after the bell. MSCI’s index of stocks worldwide rose 0.92 percent and its emerging market index gained 1.28 percent.  European shares ended a choppy session flat as disappointingeconomic data, including a technical recession in Italy, sapped an early boost provided by the Fed’s dovish tone. German retail sales fell at the fastest rate in 11 years, British car production posted its biggest drop since 2009 and euro zone growth was the slowest in four years. The STOXX 600 ended the day up 0.04 percent but gained 6.1 percent in January, its strongest month since October 2015.  The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed up 0.23 percent, with oil heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total among top gainers. The dollar index rose 0.23 percent, with the euro down 0.28 percent to $1.1445. The Japanese yen firmed 0.12 percent versus the greenback at 108.92 per dollar. Treasury yields fell after the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a measure of regional manufacturing activity, fell to its lowest in two years.  The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of U.S. labor costs, rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0.8 percent gain the previous quarter, the Labor Department said. The data continued a pattern of low inflation. “What you’ve seen the last couple days with the market is the Street’s reaction to recognition that cheap money is going to continue for the foreseeable future,” said Brian Ward, chief executive of Trimont Real Estate Advisors in Atlanta. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 17/32 in price to push its yield down to 2.6328 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 44 cents to settle at $53.79 per barrel.

2019-01-31,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - Magellan Midstream Partners LP has canceled plans to develop a stand-alone crude pipeline West Texas, the area of the nation’s top oil field as it considers a lower-cost project for the same region, an executive said on Thursday. The Tulsa-based company plans to pursue a lower-cost project to meet shipper needs in an effort to be more capital efficient, its chief executive told investors on a conference call. “It would be a much, much lower capital investment, and it would be a much more efficient way for us to source barrels into Longhorn (pipeline) for our customers,” Magellan Chief Executive Michael Mears said. In 2017, Magellan estimated that the pipeline would cost $150 million. A write off of expenditures related to the project reduced fourth-quarter distributable cash flow by $9 million, an executive said on the call. The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based pipeline operator had said in 2017 it would build a 60-mile pipeline from Wink to Crane, Texas to supply crude to its large, 275,000-barrel-per-day Longhorn crude pipeline.

2019-01-31,"(Adds quotes from official, context throughout) By Roberta Rampton and Doina Chiacu WASHINGTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday warned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of consequences for what it called “egregious” acts of intimidation, and said Russia and other countries should cease “last-minute looting” of oil and gold. Juan Guaido, Venezuela’s self-proclaimed interim president, said on Thursday that agents from a feared special police unit had visited his home. “Such acts of intimidation are seen as very serious, very egregious by the United States,” a senior U.S. administration official told reporters on a conference call. “There will be consequences for those engaged in such acts, they will be held accountable and they will be missing this unique opportunity to move on.” Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official urged Venezuelan military officials to accept Guaido’s offer of amnesty if they backed his claim. So far, the Venezuelan military has remained loyal to Maduro. The United States and most other Western nations have backed Guaido’s push for a transition and new elections. But Russia and China, among others, are supporting Maduro. Washington also warned Maduro, Russia and other international players against making deals for Venezuelan commodities like gold and oil. The arrival of an unusual Russian plane in Caracas this week sparked rumors, denied by Russia, that gold was being shipped out the country. Venezuela is selling gold from its central bank vaults to the United Arab Emirates in coming days in return for euros in cash, a source said. The U.S. government wants Venezuela oil company PDVSA’s U.S. subsidiary, Citgo, to keep operational despite tough new sanctions it imposed earlier this week. “Our goal is to ensure that Citgo remains viable, but to make sure that Maduro and his cronies are not able to loot Citgo in the way that they’ve been looting it for years,” the official said, adding that the U.S. was also looking at further economic sanctions. The official said Maduro and a dozen other Venezuelan officials were standing in the way of a political transition, and the U.S. government was open to conversations about how to help them leave the country. But the U.S. government rejects recent suggestions that Uruguay, Mexico, or the Vatican should play a mediating role between Maduro and Guaido, the official said. “We explicitly reject any talk about any type of effort that would allow Nicolas Maduro to usurp or, maintain himself in power, or be a political player in that regard,” the official said. Maduro, who has been in power since 2013 and began a second term earlier this month after disputed elections last year, has said Guaido’s actions are an attempt at a U.S.-backed coup.

2019-01-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude prices settled lower on Thursday as uncertainty about trade overtook bullish news about production cuts and U.S. monetary policy that drove prices higher early in the session. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would either strike a very big trade deal with China or “postpone” it, which sent oil traders scrambling to sell in the last day of trading for the March contract.  “There was a tendency to take profits if there was any sign of weakness, and President Trump’s suggestion that a deal with China could be postponed triggered a move lower,” said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. WTI crude fell 44 cents a barrel to settle at $53.79. Brent crude futures for March delivery rose 24 cents to $61.89 a barrel. Investors have been concerned about the outcome of the U.S.-China trade talks, which could shape the outlook for oil demand in the world’s largest economies.  The two-day talks, which resumed in Washington on Wednesday, are aimed at easing a months-long tariff war between the world’s top two economies. “Market participants desperately need to see a tangible progress in the U.S.-China trade talks, which unfortunately is in short supply at present,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. There is little indication that Beijing will address core U.S. demands in the talks. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. The uncertainty overtook bullish sentiment driven by production cuts from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, including Russia.  OPEC oil supply has fallen in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found Thursday, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. OPEC and its allies announced supply cuts effective Jan. 1 to tighten the market after worries over a global glut caused heavy price losses in late 2018.     The Federal Reserve on Wednesday held interest rates steady, signaling its three-year drive to tighten monetary policy may be at an end amid the cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. The U.S. central bank discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates, and said it would be “patient” before making any further moves.  U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) this week are also causing some supply disruptions. Inventories have started to build up at Venezuela’s oil ports and terminals as PDVSA is finding it cannot export crude at its usual rate due to U.S. sanctions imposed this week.

2019-01-31,"(Adds analyst comment, details on consolidation, updates share price) By John Benny and Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp on Thursday outlined a major reorganization of its global exploration businesses aimed at reversing years of weak oil and gas output. Chief Executive Darren Woods, who took over the helm two years ago, has spent billions to buy production, build new pipelines and expand refineries after a series of costly misfires on deals under predecessor Rex Tillerson. Woods, who will address Wall Street analysts on an earnings call Friday for the first time as CEO, has been pleading with investors for patience as he restructures its sprawling businesses. The Exxon veteran replaced Tillerson, who became U.S. Secretary of State in February 2017, and reorganized Exxon’s refining operations that year. Exxon, which has spent heavily on U.S. shale and deep-water blocks in Brazil and Guyana, has posted lower output in nine of the last 10 quarters. “I am skeptical that this decision will make any real difference in practical terms,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. He cited hurdles and a sharp drop in output in a gas field in the Netherlands that accounts for 2.5 percent of Exxon’s total production. The reorganization will fold seven companies into three as of April 1, merging units for production, exploration, development, gas and power marketing, and others. The new companies - ExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas Co, ExxonMobil Upstream Business Development Co and ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions Co - are designed to help the company double profits by 2025 and better coordinate oil and gas production with logistics and refining operations. “Our focus is on increasing overall value by strengthening our upstream business and further integrating it with the downstream and chemical segments,” Senior Vice President Neil Chapman said in a statement. Liam Mallon was named president of ExxonMobil Upstream Oil & Gas, Steve Greenlee president of ExxonMobil Upstream Business Development, and Linda DuCharme president of ExxonMobil Upstream Integrated Solutions. XTO Energy, which Exxon acquired for $41 billion in 2009, will be part of Upstream Oil & Gas, a spokesman said. One of the new business units will oversee its existing portfolio of exploration projects, and handle future acquisitions. Analysts have been pushing Exxon to sell some assets to improve returns. Analysts expect Exxon to earn $1.08 per share for the fourth quarter, excluding one-time items, according to Refinitiv data. Exxon shares rose 0.6 percent to $72.71 shortly before the close. They fell to $65.51 in December, a level last reached in October 2010.

2019-01-31,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel signalled her readiness on Thursday to implement costly proposals tabled by a government-appointed commission to facilitate the phasing out of coal-fired power, but key questions about money and priorities remain. The commission proposed the shutdown of all Germany’s coal power stations by 2038 at the latest, recommending that at least 40 billion euros (£35 billion) in aid be provided for affected regions, with further payments to cushion the potential burden of rising energy prices for companies and consumers. Speaking after a meeting with state premiers, Merkel said that the federal government would handle the commission’s proposals “very carefully”, adding that the phase-out of coal-fired power plants was a task for society as a whole. The centre-right leader said the government would present a draft law by May in which Berlin would address the commission’s recommendations. Touching on the thorny issue of how to finance its switch away from coal, Merkel said it was too early to start a debate about money. The government’s mid-term budget plans cover a time period until 2023. “We’re talking about 2038. Nobody knows what the mid-term planning will be in the future,” Merkel said. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz made clear that he is not planning to allocate any extra money to help with the phasing out of coal-fired power, complicating efforts by Europe’s largest economy to achieve its climate protection goals. Scholz told Handelsblatt business daily that the proposed 2 billion euros of annual aid until 2040 was a “plausible assumption” but other ministries would have to manage the coal shift with money from existing budgets. “We have earmarked big funds for investments; for example, in the budgets of the transport ministry, economy ministry, science ministry and construction ministry,” Scholz said. Scholz, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government, rejected the coal commission’s proposal to support the construction of new gas power plants with state money. He said that state money would be better used in research to fund solutions such as using hydrogen as an energy source. Reiner Haseloff, prime minister in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, called on the federal government to implement the coal commission’s proposals without changes. “The proposals must be implemented as recommended. Changing them would jeopardize the hard-won compromise as a whole,” Haseloff told Reuters. “The 40 billion euros are urgently needed to cushion the earlier exit from brown coal, as demanded by the federal government.” (This story was refiled to cut an extraneous paragraph on Scholz and Merkel meeting state premiers in the afternoon) Reporting by Michael Nienaber, Andreas Rinke; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-coal-scholz/refile-update-1-merkel-signals-readiness-to-push-ahead-with-coal-exit-idUKL5N1ZV7W7,31 Jan 2019,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel

2019-01-31,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government paid a high price for the Trans Mountain oil pipeline last summer, and delays in expanding it could reduce its resale value, a watchdog on the country’s public finances said on Thursday. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government purchased the Trans Mountain pipeline and a related expansion in August from Kinder Morgan Canada, fearing the company might abandon the capacity expansion. The project and others like it have faced stiff opposition in Canada from environmental groups and some local governments. The Canadian government paid C$4.4 billion for the pipeline, related assets and the expansion project and intends to eventually sell it. The pipeline, running from Alberta’s oil-gathering hub to the Vancouver, British Columbia area, is actually worth between C$3.6 billion and C$4.6 billion, the Parliamentary Budget Officer (PBO) said in an analysis. Expansion is likely to cost C$9.3 billion for an in-service date at the end of 2021, the PBO wrote. Delays in construction, however, could reduce its value, it said. Pierre-Olivier Herbert, a spokesperson for Finance Minister Bill Morneau, noted that the PBO’s analysis did not include the benefit that moving oil to new markets would have on Canada’s economy. Most Canadian oil ships to the United States, but an expanded Trans Mountain may allow for greater Asian sales. “When the political risks made it too difficult for the private sector to move forward, and after extensive due diligence, our government acquired the project,” Herbert said.  Congested pipelines depressed Canadian oil prices severely last year, causing the Alberta government to impose mandatory production cuts this month. The opposition Conservative Party chastised Trudeau in a statement saying he overpaid for the pipeline. In the past, the Conservatives have criticized the Liberal prime minister for doing too little to help the struggling industry.  An appeals court last summer overturned the government’s approval for expanding Trans Mountain, saying the National Energy Board needed to address risks to marine life and government must better consult indigenous people.  After a new review, the board is scheduled to report to Trudeau’s cabinet next month.

The UK energy supplier said the proposed reductions will be out of a workforce of 6,300, although as around this number leave each year, the number of redundancies will be much lower. Britain’s energy market regulator Ofgem imposed a price cap on default energy bills from January this year to save households about a billion pounds a year, following a government promise to tackle rising prices. “Ofgem itself forecasts that five of the Big Six energy companies will make a loss or less than normal profits this year due to the implementation of the price cap, and with several recent failures of new energy suppliers, it is clear that many have been pricing at levels that are not sustainable,” npower chief executive Paul Coffey said.

Large energy suppliers have been losing market share as smaller rivals have lured customers with cheaper deals. But several smaller providers have ceased trading in the past year.

Oil prices rose for a third day, extending a rally this month as an output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others took effect. The dollar was mixed after the Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday. MSCI’s gauge of global stock performance and an emerging markets index rose, as did the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Wall Street, propelled by a 13 percent gain by Facebook after its quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates. European shares edged lower and the Dow fell on downbeat reports by DowDuPont Inc, among others, as investors awaited news about the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington. But broadly speaking, U.S. stocks rose. “We have positive earnings, positive economy and a positive Fed,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey, adding that trade was the missing piece of the puzzle for investors. “It seems as if most of the fears have been taken away except for trade,” Bakhos said. The two-day talks, which began on Wednesday, are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights. If a deal is not reached soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. E-commerce behemoth Amazon was the other big focus, with it set to report results after the closing bell. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.76 percent, on track to its best January on record, and its emerging market index gained 1.46 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.20 percent and FTSEurofirst 300 slid 0.12 percent. The dollar dropped to a two-week low versus the yen, pressured by the Fed’s cautious U.S. economic outlook, and it was lower against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. The dollar index rose 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.11 percent to $1.1464. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 108.83 per dollar. The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0.8 percent gain the previous quarter, the Labor Department said.

2019-01-31,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept to power on a wave of optimism in 2015, is set for an ugly reelection campaign this October, judging by exchanges with voters in public town halls this month where he was grilled on topics ranging from immigration to housing affordability. Opinion polls show his centre-left Liberals are barely ahead of their rivals, and party insiders privately admit they might lose their majority in the House of Commons, which would crimp the government’s ability to govern. “The next election is going to be a referendum on Justin Trudeau...and whether or not people think he has performed,” said Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker. In contrast to more gentle exchanges in previous years, angry citizens slammed Trudeau for bungling the construction of pipelines, breaking promises to respect the right of indigenous groups, ignoring a pledge to balance the budget and allowing too many migrants into Canada. Liberal insiders say as a result of the feedback from the town halls, where attendees can also jot down their concerns on paper, policy tweaks are already being considered. Public unhappiness over illegal immigrants crossing the border from the United States is so great that the party will consider a promise to clamp down further, even though Ottawa considers the matter is under control, said one top Liberal. Widespread complaints about the lack of affordable housing are likely to produce a commitment for more spending, said the Liberal, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The verdict from voters is definitely mixed, judging by Trudeau’s experiences as he travelled the country in January taking questions from all-comers, a practise he says helps him break out of what he calls the Ottawa bubble. A woman at a town hall in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada’s west, a region where the Liberals are in trouble, accused Trudeau of “working for your globalist partners” to betray Canada.  “What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau?  We used to hang them, hang them for treason,” the woman told the stunned prime minister after asking him about Moslem sharia law and Saudi Arabian oil imports.  In the Quebec town of Saint-Hyacinthe, a man dressed in a yellow vest swore loudly at Trudeau and accused him of selling out the country. Liberals like the town halls on the grounds they demonstrate Trudeau is not afraid to take tough questions.  Yet they also admit the exchanges show voters have more urgent concerns than topics such as gender equality, climate change and the aboriginal rights that Trudeau has been pushing hard at home and abroad since he took power in 2015. “We need to focus on things that are of interest to all Canadians and not just some of them,” conceded a second Liberal. While Trudeau has emerged as one of the world’s leading progressive leaders, at home Canadians are concentrating more on their jobs and taxes, said Bricker. Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, present in the hall at Saint-Hyacinthe as abuse was levelled at Trudeau, conceded, “There is a level of anxiety out there and we need to allow for these discussions to happen.” But insiders say regardless of the insults, Trudeau intends to stick to his policy of avoiding public arguments. The Liberals won a surprise victory in 2015 by mounting a massive campaign to register young and aboriginal voters and concede a similar effort will be needed this time. The Liberals have a majority of just 11 in the 338-seat House of Commons and polls show they are only slightly ahead of the main opposition Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer. “It’s going to be tight...the message to the troops is, there is no magic commercial advert that is going to win this campaign. Don’t rely on the prime minister to belt one out of the park during the debates,” said a third Liberal.

2019-01-31,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday as an arctic freeze blanketed the eastern half of the country, prompting several utilities to urge customers to cut back on energy use. Harsh winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest, causing at least a dozen deaths and forcing residents who pride themselves on their winter hardiness to huddle indoors. As consumers cranked up heaters to escape the bitter cold, gas demand in the Lower 48 U.S. states jumped to a preliminary record high of 145.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Wednesday, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. That tops the current all-time high of 144.6 bcfd set on Jan. 1, 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. To meet soaring energy consumption during the brutal freeze, some Midwest utilities urged customers to cut back on power and gas use. In Michigan, auto makers agreed to interrupt production schedules through Friday after local utility Consumers Energy made an emergency appeal to curtail gas use so it could manage supplies following a fire at a gas compressor station on Wednesday. Consumers, a unit of Michigan energy company CMS Energy Corp , said on Thursday that the Ray compressor station in Macomb County was partially back in service but urged all of its 1.8 million Michigan customers to continue their conservation efforts through the end of Friday. Elsewhere in Michigan, DTE Energy Inc asked its 2.2 million power customers to voluntarily reduce electric use to help safeguard the reliability of the regional grid. PJM, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, said there were no reliability issues and noted that power demand had already peaked on Thursday below 140,000 megawatts. That is well below the PJM region’s all-time winter peak of 143,338 MW set on Feb. 20, 2015. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. At the same time the brutal cold boosts gas use for heating, it can also reduce production by freezing pipes in gathering systems in producing regions, called freeze-offs. Gas production in the Lower 48 states was projected to fall to a four-month low of 84.9 bcfd on Thursday due primarily to freeze-offs in the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Refinitiv.

2019-01-31,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Thousands of Belgian students skipped classes for the fourth week in a row on Thursday to protest against global warming, part of a growing youth protest around the world. Beating drums, chanting and carrying signs, some 30,000 teenagers braved the cold in Brussels and other cities to call on local politicians for stronger action to prevent climate change. “It’s our planet and the generation before us hasn’t done anything,” said Julian Rume, 17. “In 20, 30 years, we will all be migrants, we’ll all be moved out of our planet.”  The demonstrations are part of a broader grassroots movement started by Swedish student Greta Thunberg, 16, last year.  Students in Germany, Switzerland, France and Australia have followed her lead and also skipped classes to protest. Thunberg took her protest to this month’s World Economic Forum in Davos to galvanize leaders meeting there to action. While Thursday’s march in Brussels drew fewer people than last week, demonstrations spread to other cities, with some 15,000 students in the streets of Liege, according to police.  “The climate is a disaster,” said demonstrator Allison Debonte, 15, adding that she fears her children will not be able to live in Brussels due to climate change. One student held a sign saying: “It’s you who decided... it’s us who will suffer.” The student demonstrations have been supported by many political figures and personalities including Belgium’s King Phillipe. They are part of rolling protests urging greater action in recent weeks, as extreme temperatures fuel concerns that climate change is gathering pace.  On Sunday, two months since the first demonstration, some 70,000 people rallied in Brussels. Organizers are urging European leaders to adopt ambitious climate policies in line with goals set by the Paris agreement in 2015. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations, set a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for a tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C. Brussels has been regularly ranked as one of the most congested cities in western Europe due to its high population density and large number of commuters. That is a mark of shame for a capital where the EU sets European climate policies.

2019-01-31,"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes, General Electric Co’s oilfield services arm, gave an upbeat outlook for the year on Thursday as its quarterly orders rose and sanctions of liquefied natural gas projects accelerated.  Unlike rivals Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co, Baker Hughes has less exposure to the North American pressure pumping sector, where demand has softened in recent months. Many oilfield service companies have also been hurt by  the drop in oil prices at the end of last year.   Shares were up more than 5 percent in pre-market trading but pared those gains when the market opened, standing at $24.30, up 1.5 percent, at mid-morning. Wall Street analysts called the results positive, pointing to over $1 billion in free cash flow from operations and the highest quarterly orders in roughly three years. The company reported $6.9 billion in orders, up from $5.7 billion last year. Orders in its oilfield equipment business more than doubled from the prior year to over $1 billion.  “We think the market will continue to increasingly appreciate BHGE’s leverage to the improving offshore, international, and LNG markets and limited exposure to North America pressure pumping,” analysts for Evercore ISI wrote in a note after the results came out.  The company gave a positive outlook for its turbomachinery and process solutions business, which supplies turbines and compressors, pointing to an acceleration of liquefied natural gas project sanctions. In the fourth quarter, Baker Hughes secured an award to provide modular turbocompressor technology for LNG Canada’s project in Kitimat, British Columbia.  “The underlying market drivers are extremely positive for turbomachinery segment,” Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said on Thursday. He estimated a potential 100 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity could get the green light this year.  A record amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production is expected in 2019 amid strong global demand, especially from China, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from earlier this month. Simonelli also said he expected lower oil prices to have an impact on U.S., Canadian and Latin American markets in the first half of 2019, while other international markets would remain relatively stable. Last year marked Baker Hughes’ first full year combined with General Electric, which bought a stake in the services firm in 2017. In November, General Electric reduced its ownership from roughly 62.5 percent to 50.4 percent.  Baker Hughes said it has reached commercial agreements with General Electric to position its company for the future.  Revenue in Baker Hughes’ oilfield services business, which accounts for roughly half of total sales, rose 10 percent to $3.1 billion in the reported quarter. The company reported an adjusted net income of $120 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, in line with analysts’ expectations. Last year, the company reported a fourth-quarter adjusted net income of $65 million, or 15 cents per share.

2019-01-31,"TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The United Nations is likely to delay a conference intended to prepare Libya for elections this year until there is more support from rival leaders, sources familiar with the plans said. The national meeting is central to a U.N. and Western roadmap for a vote in Libya as a way out of its eight-year war since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. But big players and their allied armed groups wield considerable power under the status quo, and there is mistrust between rival governments and parliaments. Libya splintered following the NATO-backed revolt against Gaddafi and has since 2014 been divided between competing political and armed groups based in Tripoli and the east. More delay in the U.N.-sponsored conference, where Libyans from all walks of society are supposed to decide details of their elections such as the presidential or parliamentary system, would also probably push back an actual vote.  Under a French plan, Libya was meant to hold elections last Dec. 10, but that was shelved due to divisions among rival leaders and a spike in violence in the capital Tripoli. In a new push, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame wanted a conference in “the first weeks of 2019” with potential polls by June. But momentum for that has been lost due to resistance from major parties backing the parallel governments in Tripoli and the east who benefit from access to oil revenues and jobs for armed groups in the absence of police. EAST-WEST POWER PLAY Sources familiar with the U.N. plans told Reuters the conference could still happen by the end of February, but a delay until at least March looked more likely. “Salame won’t announce a venue and date ahead until he thinks there is enough support from all sides,” one source said. The U.N. mission in Libya said it was seeking a successful meeting but no date was set yet. “We plan for the conference to happen as soon as possible,” it said in a statement to Reuters. Diplomats say the conference is a “last joker” in the pack for Salame who has toiled since September 2017 for elections. Western nations hope ordinary Libyans will pressure armed groups into a peaceful solution  But in eastern Libya, some worry the forum may give a platform to Islamists and other opponents defeated by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar. Some 20 lawmakers in the eastern-based parliament last week proposed to ban the Muslim Brotherhood. That would make it difficult to talk to Khaled Mishri, head of a rival parliament in Tripoli who is close to the Brotherhood. “I personally think the conference is a good idea but it will be hard to achieve results,” said eastern lawmaker Hamd Bazaq. Diplomats fear a recent spat between Salame and the LNA might further complicate preparing the conference.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil supply has fallen in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed on Thursday, down 890,000 bpd from December and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. The survey suggests OPEC is almost three quarters of the way in delivering supply cuts that started on Jan. 1 in an effort to avert a glut, even though the group’s second-largest producer Iraq and some smaller members pumped above agreed levels. An OPEC official said he hoped more members would deliver on their pledges and that the drop in supply so far was acceptable, calling it a “good start”. Crude oil has risen to $62 a barrel after a dip below $50 in December, boosted by the Saudi cuts, a host of involuntary curbs in other OPEC countries and the prospect of lower supply from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump this week imposed sanctions on its oil industry.  OPEC, Russia and other non-members - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. In January the 11 OPEC members bound by the supply-limiting agreement achieved 70 percent of the pledged cuts, the survey found. Further declines in Iran, Libya and Venezuela boosted the total OPEC decline to 890,000 bpd. The latest OPEC+ deal came months after they had agreed to pump more oil, which in turn partially unwound their original supply-limiting accord that took effect in 2017. The biggest drop in supply came from Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest oil producer, which pumped 350,000 bpd less than in December, the survey showed. Saudi supply in November had hit a record-high 11 million bpd, after Trump demanded more be pumped to curb rising prices and make up for losses from Iran. The kingdom rapidly changed course as prices slid on the prospect of oversupply in 2019. The second- and third-biggest drops occurred in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi delivered a larger cut than required under the deal, the survey found. Of the three OPEC members exempted from making voluntary cuts, Libyan production fell the most as unrest kept the country’s biggest oilfield, Sharara, offline for a month. Output from Iran declined further as U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying its oil. Iran has managed to maintain crude exports of as much as 1 million bpd, helped by sanctions waivers and its efforts to keep selling crude. Production in Venezuela, once a top-three OPEC producer but whose output has been sliding amid the country’s economic collapse, posted a further drop in January, the survey found. The U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA this week are keeping tankers stuck at ports and expected to accelerate the supply drop in February. Among countries showing lower compliance, Iraq reduced output in January but pumped more than its target, as did Nigeria and Algeria. Gabon kept output steady. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2019-01-31,"FARAFFENI/BARRA, Gambia (Reuters) - A gleaming new bridge in West Africa is transforming transport between Gambia and Senegal, but spells disaster for traders making a living off travellers making the agonising wait to catch a ferry across the Gambia River. Gambia is a sliver of land on either side of the river cutting through the middle of the much larger Senegal, the product of a colonial-era deal between Britain and France staking a claim to each.   The absurd geography means anyone crossing from northern to southern Senegal or vice-versa has to enter Gambia and, before the bridge, join long queues to cross the river. The wait for the ferry could take up to a week.  The 1.9 km (1.2-mile) Senegambia bridge, which opened to cars and minibuses last week, changed all that. “I’m happy about this bridge,” 42-year-old traveller Amadou Bah said of the concrete structure stretching high over the river from one mangrove-lined shore to the other. “Vehicles just come and pass without any delay.” Trucks will not be allowed on the bridge until July and drivers can hardly wait. “A few months ago, I spent 10 days (at the ferry terminal) before it was my time to cross,” Senegalese truck driver Mawdo Saine told Reuters as he waited to board a boat at Barra, a rusting ferry terminal on the sandy riverbank.  “That’s a lot of difficulty for us drivers because what you should do in one week, you end up doing in one month.” The bridge is also a welcome success for Gambia, one of the poorest countries in West Africa after more than two decades of dictatorship.  But ferry operators and food vendors who serve the river traffic are struggling. Wuyeh Jaiteh, who supports a large extended family, says he used to make 10,000 West African francs (13 pounds) a day from ferrying people across the river. But since last week his customers have disappeared. “Today is my third day here that I have not gone home because there is nothing to take to the family,” Jaiteh said. “I will have to spend the night.” Jaiteh admitted the bridge was good for development, but, like other traders, said he would need government help. “For 25 years I have been selling at this place, walking around to sell stuff like torches (and) perfume,” hawker Bubacarr Jallow said.  “We are appealing to the government to see how to help us because this is what we depend on for (our) livelihood.” Writing by Juliette Jabkhiro; Editing by Tim Cocks and Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/gambia-senegal-bridge/trans-gambia-bridge-a-boon-for-trade-but-a-blow-for-local-traders-idUKL5N1ZT745,31 Jan 2019,"A gleaming new

2019-01-31,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner, said on Thursday it plans to close two German sugar production plants as part of a restructuring programme announced this week. The plants are in Brottewitz and Warburg and together produce around 200,000 tonnes of sugar annually, a Suedzucker spokesman said.  The company said on Tuesday it plans to cut sugar production volumes by up to around 700,000 tonnes per year including factory closures because of the current slump in sugar prices. Suedzucker produces about 5.9 million tonnes of sugar a year. “I can confirm that closure plans for the plants in Brottewitz and Warburg have been sent to the supervisory board by the management board in the framework of the restructuring measures,” the spokesman said. However, both plants would continue to operate normally in the 2019 sugar production season, he added. The production season starts in the autumn.  The two plants employ around 150 people in total. Suedzucker said on Tuesday the restructuring plan aims to cut costs by about 100 million euros (88 million pounds) annually in the face of a “historically low” EU sugar price. Raw sugar futures ended 2018 at their lowest in 10 years, pressured by heavy global oversupply. Suedzucker on Jan. 10 reported a third-quarter operating loss, hit by the global collapse in sugar prices. The European Union liberalised its sugar market in September 2017, ending its system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas. This gave producers more freedom to expand and export, but a worst-case scenario emerged, with European producers exposed to collapsing world prices.

The bolt from the bulls came as the Fed said it would pause its three-year interest rate rise campaign while assessing the weakening of the economy. Crucially, it also said that the rundown of its balance sheet - or the stockpile of bonds it has accumulated over the past 10 years of quantitative easing - could slow too. That ticked all the boxes for financial markets. Wall Street and Asia both rallied and Europe ran up as much as 1 percent until news that Italy was back in recession and other poor data took the wind out of the sails of most markets bar London . Futures pointed to the U.S. S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rising later though. That likely move added with Asia’s gains lifted the $4 trillion MSCI world index, which tracks 47 countries, for the 20th day out of the last 23. For January it is up more than 7 percent, which is its best January since the index began in 1990 and the best performance in any month since December 2015. “The rally really does lift all boats,” said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro. The gains for stocks were matched in bond markets. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to set the bar for global borrowing costs, had dived significantly and Europe’s big move saw Italian 2-year yields hit their lowest since May. But it was all pain for the dollar. It was struggling near a three-week trough against its major peers and emerging market currencies rose almost in unison having been crushed by the greenback last year. “Risk assets are dancing in the streets and the dollar’s down in the dumps,” Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said. “We may yet get a (Fed) rate hike in June, but if what matters is where policy’s heading in the medium term, the FX market would overlook that and sell the dollar anyway.” U.S. stocks were also set for another packed day of data and earnings. Jobless claims figures had already come out showing a 1-1/2 year high, Electric carmaker Tesla missed forecasts again but General Electric surged, marked up almost 10 percent after it beat estimates. Internet shopping behemoth Amazon was the other big focus with it set to report after the closing bell. Apple shares jumped almost 7 percent on Wednesday after soothing China worries while Facebook shares leapt 11 percent after hours on better-than-expected profits following a year of high profile data scandals. RE-EMERGING MARKETS MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose to its highest since October, helped by a 1 percent jump on Japan’s Nikkei, which shrugged off the normal headwind of a higher yen. The main emerging market index skipped to a more than 8 percent January gain while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent, despite data showing China’s factory activity contracted for a second straight month. “We were underweight emerging markets. We have changed that yesterday,” said Lyxor Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Guillaume Lasserre. With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks aimed at easing a months-long tariff war. The two-day talks which began in Washington on Wednesday are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. Donald Trump tweeted that talks were “going well” but “No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points.” In the commodity markets, industrial metals were up and oil rose for a third day, pushed up by lower imports into the United States amid OPEC efforts to tighten the market, and as Venezuela struggles to keep up its crude exports after Washington imposed sanctions on the nation. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.39 per barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. Brent was up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.01 per barrel. Back in the currency markets, the pound was a shade higher at $1.3127, while gold held near an eight-month high of $1,323 an ounce hit in the previous session as its buyers also cheered the weak dollar.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s promise to be “patient” as it determines how to adjust interest rates in future has been welcomed by investors fearful that an economic slowdown could preface a slide into recession. The central bank’s statement, issued following the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee on Jan. 30, has sparked a limited relief rally in equity markets. But the committee’s decision to put rate hikes on hold, at least for now, is a bearish rather than bullish sign for the economy and confirms that the risk of recession is elevated. The committee’s new-found patience is a sign of how much the economic environment has already weakened since the autumn, when it was planning to continue increasing rates in 2019. In its press statement, the committee noted that a sustained expansion of economic activity is the most likely outcome, but it dropped language from previous meetings suggesting risks to the outlook were balanced. Actions speak louder than words, and the Fed’s decision to go on hold suggests it now senses greater risks to the downside than before, and it is consistent with past interest rate cycles. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TjHXFC) Before the onset of each of the last four recessions (1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007), the effective federal funds rate had peaked and was already falling by the time the business cycle turned down. In fact, the federal funds rate peaked shortly before almost every recession since 1960 (the limited exception was the recession starting in 1980). Peaking interest rates have often been a harbinger of an imminent recession as the Fed responds to signs that the expansion is running out of momentum. In every one of those cases, even interest rate reductions were not enough to prevent the economy turning down a few months later. So while the Fed’s promise to be patient will be welcome in the White House, it is an indication of how much the outlook has already deteriorated, and reinforces the reasons for investors to be cautious.

2019-01-31,"(Reuters) - ConocoPhillips beat quarterly profit estimates on Thursday as the world’s largest independent oil producer sold more oil at higher prices, sending its shares up more than 2 percent. Total production, excluding Libya, rose 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) to 1.31 million boe/d in the fourth quarter.  The company also said it received $85 million from Venezuela’s state-run oil firm PDVSA in the fourth quarter as part of a $2 billion arbitration agreement the company received last year with the embattled producer. The $85 million brings the total payout under the agreement to $430 million, the company said, below the expected $500 million in 2018. Conoco has said that if PDVSA does not continue to meet its obligations, it would renew its efforts to seize the company’s assets around the world. PDVSA has compiled with the terms of the settlement and has said it intends to continue making quarterly payments, Conoco finance chief Donald Wallette said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday. The Houston-based company said it has existing permission from the U.S. government to accept the payments, he said.   Analyst Scott Hanold of RBC Capital Markets said the company was likely to cover any shortfall in the payout “in kind”, taking oil to sell to the market. At home, Conoco, like its peers, has been riding a surge in crude production in the U.S. shale basins. The country’s output has reached record levels, overtaking that of Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the top world producer. Conoco said total realized price per barrel was $53 in the fourth quarter, compared with $46.10 per barrel a year earlier. “The combination of production and price realizations drove the outperformance,” analyst Hanold said. In the first quarter of 2019, ConocoPhillips expects to produce 1.29 million boe/d to 1.33 million boe/d. The company said adjusted net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $540 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.01 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company were up 2.5 percent at $67.33 in afternoon trading.

2019-01-31,"(Adds oil and fuel demand figures) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production rose to a new high of 11.9 million barrels per day in November, up 345,000 bpd from the previous month, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Thursday. The increase came as output in Texas rose 115,000 bpd and Gulf of Mexico offshore production rose by 188,000 bpd, outstripping a slight decline in North Dakota, where production fell by 11,000 bpd. The United States has become the world’s largest oil producer due to gains in output from shale formations. The EIA previously reported that production from seven major shale formations was estimated at 7.8 million bpd in November. U.S. crude production was up 17.8 percent from a year earlier, the agency said. U.S. total oil demand in November was up 3 percent, or 615,000 bpd, versus last year, buoyed by strong demand for gasoline and diesel, EIA data showed. U.S. gasoline demand was up 1.1 percent, or 100,000 bpd, versus last year, EIA data showed. Gasoline demand was down 0.8 percent in October. Gasoline demand is closely watched by traders because the U.S. accounts for roughly 10 percent of global gasoline demand. U.S. distillate demand was up 2.3 percent, or 96,000 bpd, in November, EIA data showed. In October, distillate demand rose by 10.4 percent year-over-year. Meanwhile, gross natural gas production in the lower 48 U.S. states rose to an all-time high of 97.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in November, up from the prior record of 96.8 bcfd in October, according to EIA’s 914 production report. In Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, output increased to a record high of 25.3 bcfd in November, up 0.2 percent from October. That compares with output of 22.7 bcfd in November 2017. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producing state, production rose to a record 18.2 bcfd in November, up 1.7 percent from October. That compares with output of 15.8 bcfd in November 2017.

2019-01-31,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a return to “unity and harmony” on Thursday as he welcomed gas-rich Qatar’s emir to Beijing, amid a dispute that has seen some Arab states led by Saudi Arabia severing relations with Doha. China has largely stayed out of the dispute, calling for the problem to be resolved via talks, but it has played host to senior Qatari officials since the spat began, including in December to the foreign minister. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017. They accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and cultivating ties with Saudi Arabia’s regional foe, Iran. Qatar, which denies the charges, says the boycott seeks to curtail its sovereignty. The row has defied mediation efforts by Kuwait and the United States, which sees Gulf unity as essential to containing Iran. It has shown no sign of being resolved soon. Qatar has been bolstering ties with its supporters, including Turkey, with trade between those two expected to have risen by more than half in 2018. Meeting in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Xi told Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that regional cooperation was an important basis for prosperity in the Gulf region, Chinese state television reported. Xi said China supports the efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council — which includes both Saudi Arabia and Qatar — to seek an “appropriate resolution to disputes and contradictions via political and diplomatic means, to return unity and harmony between Gulf and Arab countries”. “China is willing to continue to play a constructive role according to the wishes of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries,” Xi added, according to the report, which did not make direct mention of the Gulf rift. China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil, but it has been trying to raise its profile, especially in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited Beijing in 2017. However, China has had to walk a fine line, as it also has close ties with both Iran and Israel. In remarks in front of reporters, Xi called Sheikh Tamim “an old friend and a good friend”. Sheikh Tamim told Xi that he was very happy with their personal friendship. “We are ready to have bigger investments in China, in infrastructure or in any other field we see as important for us,” he said. “We are happy to provide China with liquid gas and we are ready to provide China with more in the near future. I am very happy to be in China.” Last October, state energy giant Qatar Petroleum said it had signed a five-year agreement to supply China with 600,000 tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) per year. Qatar’s state news agency said Sheikh Tamim and Xi had signed memoranda of understanding on diplomatic training, future trade delegations, and the creation of a road map for Qatar to take part in China’s Belt and Road initiative, an expansion of infrastructure and trade links worldwide. Qatar Free Zones Authority also signed three MOUs including one with China Harbour Engineering Co (CHEC) to establish a clean energy bus assembly factory to serve the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Earlier in January, state-owned Qatar Airways said it had acquired a 5 percent stake in China Southern Airlines, in a move to gain access to the fast-growing Chinese market.

2019-01-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The bankruptcy of major California utility PG&E Corp as a result of over $30 billion in costs from California wildfires sparked by the state’s prolonged drought will likely prompt more companies to discuss how they will respond to the effects of climate change on their businesses. Already, the trend is increasing. Nearly 50 companies mentioned climate change as a factor in their risk outlook or strategic decision-making on corporate earnings calls with analysts and investors over the last 12 months, more than double the number of companies discussing climate change 4 years ago, a Reuters analysis found. Among companies focusing on climate change were not only those in the utility or energy sectors that are significant emitters of carbon, but companies ranging from casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp to tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc that tend to cater to consumers and are feeling the effects of more extreme weather patterns. Fund managers and analysts say that the increasing focus on climate change and its impacts comes about as the effects of extreme weather are easier to quantify, whether in the form of decreased sales of winter apparel due to warming trends or disruptions in supply chains due to hurricanes.  A June 2018 report from S&P Global, for instance, found that companies that mentioned weather as a factor in their quarterly results said it influenced their earnings by an average of 6 percent. At the same time, environmentally focused investors in the ESG sector - who rate companies based on their environmental, social, and governance attributes - are increasingly influencing company behavior as U.S. corporations work to appeal to the growing $11.6 trillion industry.  “The PG&E example will encourage other companies to think about climate change,” said Julie Gorte, a senior vice president at Pax World Funds, which has $4.8 billion in assets under management. “The science is getting better and it’s getting harder and harder for companies to say that something was an act of God and no one could have seen it coming.”  At the same time, investors are increasingly focusing on companies that may see a benefit from adapting to changing climate patterns and the reduced cost of renewable energy. Waste Management Inc, for instance, is reducing its climate impact and its energy costs by converting methane into natural gas to fuel its trucks, while data center operator Digital Realty Trust Inc now gets over 40 percent of its energy from renewable sources, helping it secure long-term deals with companies like Facebook Inc that are hoping to reduce their own environmental impact.  Shares of Waste Management are up over 8 percent over the last 12 months, while shares of Digital Realty are down more than 2 percent.  “Regardless of what happens in Washington, management teams are going to have to be more transparent around disclosures, and opportunities too, when it comes to the impacts of climate change,” said Lori Keith, co-portfolio manager of the $3.1 billion Parnassus Mid Cap fund.  Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and exchange traded fund research at New York-based CFRA, said that companies and asset managers are both likely to pay more attention to climate change as its effects become more apparent and investors increasingly focus on a company’s environmental impact. Environmentally focused investors are also much less likely to be swayed by lower costs at competitors, making them especially attractive customers for asset managers, he said.  “There is much less performance chasing among ESG investors, and that makes them more appealing as an investor base for companies and fund firms alike,” he said.

2019-01-31,"(Reuters) - Independent U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp beat quarterly profit estimates on Thursday and said it was well prepared for a fallout from sanctions imposed by the U.S. government on crude supplier Venezuela, sending its shares up 5 percent. The San Antonio, Texas-based company, one of the largest buyers of Venezuelan crude in the United States, said it had stopped intake from the country after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA earlier this week. (reut.rs/2Gd1gMW) PDVSA exports roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the United States. Valero has been substituting light crude oil from North America and other sources to make up for the lack of Venezuelan heavy crude, supply and international operations Senior Vice President Gary Simmons said on a conference call with Wall Street analysts. Refiners like Valero, Phillips 66 and Marathon Petroleum Corp process crude into diesel, gasoline, and other products.  “The current economics are certainly pushing the country to maximize light sweet in the system,” Chief Executive Officer Joseph Gorder said. During the quarter, refining margins rose 26 percent to $3.05 billion in the last three months of 2018. “The main driver of the beat was solid performance in every region of the refining segment, but particular stand-outs were the Gulf Coast and North Atlantic regions,” Simmons Energy analysts Blake Fernandez and Patrick Flam said. Valero plans to run its 14 refineries at up to 95 percent of their combined production capacity of 3.1 million bpd in the first quarter of 2019. The company, which has also been investing heavily in pipelines and storage to reduce costs, said the completion of some projects provided it with greater access to discounted North American crudes in the fourth quarter. “We also set a record on the volume of Canadian heavy that we ran in our system,” Valero’s Simmons said. Access to cheaper crude helped boost profitability. On an adjusted basis, income attributable to Valero shareholders rose to $900 million, or $2.12 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $509 million, or $1.16 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.07 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the year-earlier quarter, the company had recorded a $1.9 billion gain from U.S. tax reforms.

2019-01-31,"BERLIN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - No extra money will be allocated by Germany to help with the phasing out of coal-fired power, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said on Thursday, complicating efforts by Europe’s largest economy to achieve ambitious climate protection goals. A government-appointed commission proposed the shutdown of all Germany’s coal power stations by 2038 at the latest, recommending that at least 40 billion euros ($45.8 billion) in aid be provided for affected regions, with further payments to cushion the potential burden of rising energy prices for companies and consumers. Scholz told Handelsblatt business daily that the proposed 2 billion euros of annual aid until 2040 was a “plausible assumption” but other ministries must manage the coal shift with money from existing budgets. “We have earmarked big funds for investments; for example, in the budgets of the transport ministry, economy ministry, science ministry and construction ministry,” Scholz said. Scholz, a member of the centre-left Social Democrats, junior partner in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government, rejected the coal commission’s proposal to support the construction of new gas power plants with state money. He said that state money would be better used in research to fund solutions such as using hydrogen as an energy source. Scholz and Merkel will meet the state premiers of affected regions later on Thursday to discuss how to finance the coal commission’s proposed measures. Reiner Haseloff, prime minister in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt, called on the federal government to implement the coal commission’s proposals without changes. “The proposals must be implemented as recommended. Changing them would jeopardize the hard-won compromise as a whole,” Haseloff told Reuters. “The 40 billion euros are urgently needed to cushion the earlier exit from brown coal, as demanded by the federal government.” ($1 = 0.8732 euros) Reporting by Michael Nienaber, Andreas Rinke

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Innogy SE’s npower said on Thursday it will cut 900 jobs in Britain this year to lower operating costs as it faces an “incredibly tough” retail energy market. The UK energy supplier said the proposed reductions will be out of a workforce of 6,300, although as around this number leave each year, the number of redundancies will be much lower. Britain’s energy market regulator Ofgem imposed a price cap on default energy bills from January this year to save households about a billion pounds a year, following a government promise to tackle rising prices. “Ofgem itself forecasts that five of the Big Six energy companies will make a loss or less than normal profits this year due to the implementation of the price cap, and with several recent failures of new energy suppliers, it is clear that many have been pricing at levels that are not sustainable,” npower chief executive Paul Coffey said. Britain’s big six energy suppliers are Centrica’s British Gas, Innogy’s npower and Iberdrola’s Scottish Power, SSE, EDF’s EDF Energy and E.ON Even with the job reductions, npower forecasts significant losses this year but is trying to minimise them and continues to focus on service and value for customers, it said. Large energy suppliers have been losing market share as smaller rivals have lured customers with cheaper deals. But several smaller providers have ceased trading in the past year. SSE and Innogy had planned to merge their British retail energy units but this was scrapped after they failed to agree on new commercial terms after the price cap was announced.

Oil prices rose for a third day, extending a rally this month as an output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and others took effect. The dollar was mixed after the Fed’s policy statement on Wednesday. MSCI’s gauge of global stock performance and an emerging markets index rose, as did the Nasdaq and S&P 500 on Wall Street, propelled by a 13 percent gain by Facebook after its quarterly results topped analysts’ estimates. European shares edged lower and the Dow fell on downbeat reports by DowDuPont Inc, among others, as investors awaited news about the U.S.-China trade talks in Washington. But broadly speaking, U.S. stocks rose. “We have positive earnings, positive economy and a positive Fed,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at New Vines Capital LLC in Bernardsville, New Jersey, adding that trade was the missing piece of the puzzle for investors. “It seems as if most of the fears have been taken away except for trade,” Bakhos said. The two-day talks, which began on Wednesday, are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights. If a deal is not reached soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. E-commerce behemoth Amazon was the other big focus, with it set to report results after the closing bell. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe rose 0.76 percent, on track to its best January on record, and its emerging market index gained 1.46 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.20 percent and FTSEurofirst 300 slid 0.12 percent. The dollar dropped to a two-week low versus the yen, pressured by the Fed’s cautious U.S. economic outlook, and it was lower against the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso. The dollar index rose 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.11 percent to $1.1464. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.21 percent versus the greenback at 108.83 per dollar. The Employment Cost Index, the broadest measure of labor costs, rose 0.7 percent in the fourth quarter after an unrevised 0.8 percent gain the previous quarter, the Labor Department said. The data continued a pattern of low inflation. Two-year yields, which reflect expectations of rate hikes, fell to a nearly four-week low of 2.49 percent. “What you’ve seen the last couple days with the market is the Street’s reaction to recognition that cheap money is going to continue for the foreseeable future,” said Brian Ward, chief executive of Trimont Real Estate Advisors in Atlanta. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 14/32 in price to push its yield down to 2.6453 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 85 cents at $55.08 per barrel.

2019-01-31,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who swept to power on a wave of optimism in 2015, is set for an ugly reelection campaign this October, judging by exchanges with voters in public town halls this month where he was grilled on topics ranging from immigration to housing affordability. Opinion polls show his centre-left Liberals are barely ahead of their rivals, and party insiders privately admit they might lose their majority in the House of Commons, which would crimp the government’s ability to govern. “The next election is going to be a referendum on Justin Trudeau...and whether or not people think he has performed,” said Ipsos Public Affairs pollster Darrell Bricker. In contrast to more gentle exchanges in previous years, angry citizens slammed Trudeau for bungling the construction of pipelines, breaking promises to respect the right of indigenous groups, ignoring a pledge to balance the budget and allowing too many migrants into Canada. Liberal insiders say as a result of the feedback from the town halls, where attendees can also jot down their concerns on paper, policy tweaks are already being considered. Public unhappiness over illegal immigrants crossing the border from the United States is so great that the party will consider a promise to clamp down further, even though Ottawa considers the matter is under control, said one top Liberal. Widespread complaints about the lack of affordable housing are likely to produce a commitment for more spending, said the Liberal, who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. The verdict from voters is definitely mixed, judging by Trudeau’s experiences as he travelled the country in January taking questions from all-comers, a practise he says helps him break out of what he calls the Ottawa bubble. A woman at a town hall in the province of Saskatchewan in Canada’s west, a region where the Liberals are in trouble, accused Trudeau of “working for your globalist partners” to betray Canada.  “What do we do with traitors in Canada, Mr. Trudeau?  We used to hang them, hang them for treason,” the woman told the stunned prime minister after asking him about Moslem sharia law and Saudi Arabian oil imports.  In the Quebec town of Saint-Hyacinthe, a man dressed in a yellow vest swore loudly at Trudeau and accused him of selling out the country. Liberals like the town halls on the grounds they demonstrate Trudeau is not afraid to take tough questions.  Yet they also admit the exchanges show voters have more urgent concerns than topics such as gender equality, climate change and the aboriginal rights that Trudeau has been pushing hard at home and abroad since he took power in 2015. “We need to focus on things that are of interest to all Canadians and not just some of them,” conceded a second Liberal. While Trudeau has emerged as one of the world’s leading progressive leaders, at home Canadians are concentrating more on their jobs and taxes, said Bricker. Infrastructure Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, present in the hall at Saint-Hyacinthe as abuse was levelled at Trudeau, conceded, “There is a level of anxiety out there and we need to allow for these discussions to happen.” But insiders say regardless of the insults, Trudeau intends to stick to his policy of avoiding public arguments. The Liberals won a surprise victory in 2015 by mounting a massive campaign to register young and aboriginal voters and concede a similar effort will be needed this time. The Liberals have a majority of just 11 in the 338-seat House of Commons and polls show they are only slightly ahead of the main opposition Conservative Party, led by Andrew Scheer. “It’s going to be tight...the message to the troops is, there is no magic commercial advert that is going to win this campaign. Don’t rely on the prime minister to belt one out of the park during the debates,” said a third Liberal.

2019-01-31,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. homes and businesses used record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday as an arctic freeze blanketed the eastern half of the country, prompting several utilities to urge customers to cut back on energy use. Harsh winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest, causing at least a dozen deaths and forcing residents who pride themselves on their winter hardiness to huddle indoors. As consumers cranked up heaters to escape the bitter cold, gas demand in the Lower 48 U.S. states jumped to a preliminary record high of 145.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Wednesday, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. That tops the current all-time high of 144.6 bcfd set on Jan. 1, 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. To meet soaring energy consumption during the brutal freeze, some Midwest utilities urged customers to cut back on power and gas use. In Michigan, auto makers agreed to interrupt production schedules through Friday after local utility Consumers Energy made an emergency appeal to curtail gas use so it could manage supplies following a fire at a gas compressor station on Wednesday. Consumers, a unit of Michigan energy company CMS Energy Corp , said on Thursday that the Ray compressor station in Macomb County was partially back in service but urged all of its 1.8 million Michigan customers to continue their conservation efforts through the end of Friday. Elsewhere in Michigan, DTE Energy Inc asked its 2.2 million power customers to voluntarily reduce electric use to help safeguard the reliability of the regional grid. PJM, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, said there were no reliability issues and noted that power demand had already peaked on Thursday below 140,000 megawatts. That is well below the PJM region’s all-time winter peak of 143,338 MW set on Feb. 20, 2015. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. At the same time the brutal cold boosts gas use for heating, it can also reduce production by freezing pipes in gathering systems in producing regions, called freeze-offs. Gas production in the Lower 48 states was projected to fall to a four-month low of 84.9 bcfd on Thursday due primarily to freeze-offs in the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, according to Refinitiv.

2019-01-31,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Thousands of Belgian students skipped classes for the fourth week in a row on Thursday to protest against global warming, part of a growing youth protest around the world. Beating drums, chanting and carrying signs, some 30,000 teenagers braved the cold in Brussels and other cities to call on local politicians for stronger action to prevent climate change. “It’s our planet and the generation before us hasn’t done anything,” said Julian Rume, 17. “In 20, 30 years, we will all be migrants, we’ll all be moved out of our planet.”  The demonstrations are part of a broader grassroots movement started by Swedish student Greta Thunberg, 16, last year.  Students in Germany, Switzerland, France and Australia have followed her lead and also skipped classes to protest. Thunberg took her protest to this month’s World Economic Forum in Davos to galvanize leaders meeting there to action. While Thursday’s march in Brussels drew fewer people than last week, demonstrations spread to other cities, with some 15,000 students in the streets of Liege, according to police.  “The climate is a disaster,” said demonstrator Allison Debonte, 15, adding that she fears her children will not be able to live in Brussels due to climate change. One student held a sign saying: “It’s you who decided... it’s us who will suffer.” The student demonstrations have been supported by many political figures and personalities including Belgium’s King Phillipe. They are part of rolling protests urging greater action in recent weeks, as extreme temperatures fuel concerns that climate change is gathering pace.  On Sunday, two months since the first demonstration, some 70,000 people rallied in Brussels. Organizers are urging European leaders to adopt ambitious climate policies in line with goals set by the Paris agreement in 2015. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations, set a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for a tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C. Brussels has been regularly ranked as one of the most congested cities in western Europe due to its high population density and large number of commuters. That is a mark of shame for a capital where the EU sets European climate policies.

2019-01-31,"(Reuters) - Baker Hughes, General Electric Co’s oilfield services arm, gave an upbeat outlook for the year on Thursday as its quarterly orders rose and sanctions of liquefied natural gas projects accelerated.  Unlike rivals Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co, Baker Hughes has less exposure to the North American pressure pumping sector, where demand has softened in recent months. Many oilfield service companies have also been hurt by  the drop in oil prices at the end of last year.   Shares were up more than 5 percent in pre-market trading but pared those gains when the market opened, standing at $24.30, up 1.5 percent, at mid-morning. Wall Street analysts called the results positive, pointing to over $1 billion in free cash flow from operations and the highest quarterly orders in roughly three years. The company reported $6.9 billion in orders, up from $5.7 billion last year. Orders in its oilfield equipment business more than doubled from the prior year to over $1 billion.  “We think the market will continue to increasingly appreciate BHGE’s leverage to the improving offshore, international, and LNG markets and limited exposure to North America pressure pumping,” analysts for Evercore ISI wrote in a note after the results came out.  The company gave a positive outlook for its turbomachinery and process solutions business, which supplies turbines and compressors, pointing to an acceleration of liquefied natural gas project sanctions. In the fourth quarter, Baker Hughes secured an award to provide modular turbocompressor technology for LNG Canada’s project in Kitimat, British Columbia.  “The underlying market drivers are extremely positive for turbomachinery segment,” Baker Hughes Chief Executive Officer Lorenzo Simonelli said on Thursday. He estimated a potential 100 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity could get the green light this year.  A record amount of liquefied natural gas (LNG) production is expected in 2019 amid strong global demand, especially from China, according to a Wood Mackenzie report from earlier this month. Simonelli also said he expected lower oil prices to have an impact on U.S., Canadian and Latin American markets in the first half of 2019, while other international markets would remain relatively stable. Last year marked Baker Hughes’ first full year combined with General Electric, which bought a stake in the services firm in 2017. In November, General Electric reduced its ownership from roughly 62.5 percent to 50.4 percent.  Baker Hughes said it has reached commercial agreements with General Electric to position its company for the future.  Revenue in Baker Hughes’ oilfield services business, which accounts for roughly half of total sales, rose 10 percent to $3.1 billion in the reported quarter. The company reported an adjusted net income of $120 million, or 26 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, in line with analysts’ expectations. Last year, the company reported a fourth-quarter adjusted net income of $65 million, or 15 cents per share.

2019-01-31,"TUNIS/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - The United Nations is likely to delay a conference intended to prepare Libya for elections this year until there is more support from rival leaders, sources familiar with the plans said. The national meeting is central to a U.N. and Western roadmap for a vote in Libya as a way out of its eight-year war since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi. But big players and their allied armed groups wield considerable power under the status quo, and there is mistrust between rival governments and parliaments. Libya splintered following the NATO-backed revolt against Gaddafi and has since 2014 been divided between competing political and armed groups based in Tripoli and the east. More delay in the U.N.-sponsored conference, where Libyans from all walks of society are supposed to decide details of their elections such as the presidential or parliamentary system, would also probably push back an actual vote.  Under a French plan, Libya was meant to hold elections last Dec. 10, but that was shelved due to divisions among rival leaders and a spike in violence in the capital Tripoli. In a new push, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame wanted a conference in “the first weeks of 2019” with potential polls by June. But momentum for that has been lost due to resistance from major parties backing the parallel governments in Tripoli and the east who benefit from access to oil revenues and jobs for armed groups in the absence of police. EAST-WEST POWER PLAY Sources familiar with the U.N. plans told Reuters the conference could still happen by the end of February, but a delay until at least March looked more likely. “Salame won’t announce a venue and date ahead until he thinks there is enough support from all sides,” one source said. The U.N. mission in Libya said it was seeking a successful meeting but no date was set yet. “We plan for the conference to happen as soon as possible,” it said in a statement to Reuters. Diplomats say the conference is a “last joker” in the pack for Salame who has toiled since September 2017 for elections. Western nations hope ordinary Libyans will pressure armed groups into a peaceful solution  But in eastern Libya, some worry the forum may give a platform to Islamists and other opponents defeated by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar. Some 20 lawmakers in the eastern-based parliament last week proposed to ban the Muslim Brotherhood. That would make it difficult to talk to Khaled Mishri, head of a rival parliament in Tripoli who is close to the Brotherhood. “I personally think the conference is a good idea but it will be hard to achieve results,” said eastern lawmaker Hamd Bazaq. Diplomats fear a recent spat between Salame and the LNA might further complicate preparing the conference.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil supply has fallen in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed on Thursday, down 890,000 bpd from December and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. The survey suggests OPEC is almost three quarters of the way in delivering supply cuts that started on Jan. 1 in an effort to avert a glut, even though the group’s second-largest producer Iraq and some smaller members pumped above agreed levels. An OPEC official said he hoped more members would deliver on their pledges and that the drop in supply so far was acceptable, calling it a “good start”. Crude oil has risen to $62 a barrel after a dip below $50 in December, boosted by the Saudi cuts, a host of involuntary curbs in other OPEC countries and the prospect of lower supply from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump this week imposed sanctions on its oil industry.  OPEC, Russia and other non-members - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. In January the 11 OPEC members bound by the supply-limiting agreement achieved 70 percent of the pledged cuts, the survey found. Further declines in Iran, Libya and Venezuela boosted the total OPEC decline to 890,000 bpd. The latest OPEC+ deal came months after they had agreed to pump more oil, which in turn partially unwound their original supply-limiting accord that took effect in 2017. The biggest drop in supply came from Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest oil producer, which pumped 350,000 bpd less than in December, the survey showed. Saudi supply in November had hit a record-high 11 million bpd, after Trump demanded more be pumped to curb rising prices and make up for losses from Iran. The kingdom rapidly changed course as prices slid on the prospect of oversupply in 2019. The second- and third-biggest drops occurred in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi delivered a larger cut than required under the deal, the survey found. Of the three OPEC members exempted from making voluntary cuts, Libyan production fell the most as unrest kept the country’s biggest oilfield, Sharara, offline for a month. Output from Iran declined further as U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying its oil. Iran has managed to maintain crude exports of as much as 1 million bpd, helped by sanctions waivers and its efforts to keep selling crude. Production in Venezuela, once a top-three OPEC producer but whose output has been sliding amid the country’s economic collapse, posted a further drop in January, the survey found. The U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA this week are keeping tankers stuck at ports and expected to accelerate the supply drop in February. Among countries showing lower compliance, Iraq reduced output in January but pumped more than its target, as did Nigeria and Algeria. Gabon kept output steady. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

Gambia is a sliver of land on either side of the river cutting through the middle of the much larger Senegal, the product of a colonial-era deal between Britain and France staking a claim to each.   The absurd geography means anyone crossing from northern to southern Senegal or vice-versa has to enter Gambia and, before the bridge, join long queues to cross the river. The wait for the ferry could take up to a week.  The 1.9 km (1.2-mile) Senegambia bridge, which opened to cars and minibuses last week, changed all that. “I’m happy about this bridge,” 42-year-old traveller Amadou Bah said of the concrete structure stretching high over the river from one mangrove-lined shore to the other. “Vehicles just come and pass without any delay.” Trucks will not be allowed on the bridge until July and drivers can hardly wait. “A few months ago, I spent 10 days (at the ferry terminal) before it was my time to cross,” Senegalese truck driver Mawdo Saine told Reuters as he waited to board a boat at Barra, a rusting ferry terminal on the sandy riverbank.  “That’s a lot of difficulty for us drivers because what you should do in one week, you end up doing in one month.” The bridge is also a welcome success for Gambia, one of the poorest countries in West Africa after more than two decades of dictatorship.  But ferry operators and food vendors who serve the river traffic are struggling. Wuyeh Jaiteh, who supports a large extended family, says he used to make 10,000 West African francs (13 pounds) a day from ferrying people across the river. But since last week his customers have disappeared. “Today is my third day here that I have not gone home because there is nothing to take to the family,” Jaiteh said. “I will have to spend the night.” Jaiteh admitted the bridge was good for development, but, like other traders, said he would need government help. “For 25 years I have been selling at this place, walking around to sell stuff like torches (and) perfume,” hawker Bubacarr Jallow said.  “We are appealing to the government to see how to help us because this is what we depend on for (our) livelihood.” Writing by Juliette Jabkhiro; Editing by Tim Cocks and Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/gambia-senegal-bridge/trans-gambia-bridge-a-boon-for-trade-but-a-blow-for-local-traders-idUKL5N1ZT745,31 Jan 2019,"A gleaming new

2019-01-31,"HAMBURG (Reuters) - Suedzucker, Europe’s largest sugar refiner, said on Thursday it plans to close two German sugar production plants as part of a restructuring programme announced this week. The plants are in Brottewitz and Warburg and together produce around 200,000 tonnes of sugar annually, a Suedzucker spokesman said.  The company said on Tuesday it plans to cut sugar production volumes by up to around 700,000 tonnes per year including factory closures because of the current slump in sugar prices. Suedzucker produces about 5.9 million tonnes of sugar a year. “I can confirm that closure plans for the plants in Brottewitz and Warburg have been sent to the supervisory board by the management board in the framework of the restructuring measures,” the spokesman said. However, both plants would continue to operate normally in the 2019 sugar production season, he added. The production season starts in the autumn.  The two plants employ around 150 people in total. Suedzucker said on Tuesday the restructuring plan aims to cut costs by about 100 million euros (88 million pounds) annually in the face of a “historically low” EU sugar price. Raw sugar futures ended 2018 at their lowest in 10 years, pressured by heavy global oversupply. Suedzucker on Jan. 10 reported a third-quarter operating loss, hit by the global collapse in sugar prices. The European Union liberalised its sugar market in September 2017, ending its system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas. This gave producers more freedom to expand and export, but a worst-case scenario emerged, with European producers exposed to collapsing world prices.

The bolt from the bulls came as the Fed said it would pause its three-year interest rate rise campaign while assessing the weakening of the economy. Crucially, it also said that the rundown of its balance sheet - or the stockpile of bonds it has accumulated over the past 10 years of quantitative easing - could slow too. That ticked all the boxes for financial markets. Wall Street and Asia both rallied and Europe ran up as much as 1 percent until news that Italy was back in recession and other poor data took the wind out of the sails of most markets bar London . Futures pointed to the U.S. S&P 500 and Nasdaq both rising later though. That likely move added with Asia’s gains lifted the $4 trillion MSCI world index, which tracks 47 countries, for the 20th day out of the last 23. For January it is up more than 7 percent, which is its best January since the index began in 1990 and the best performance in any month since December 2015. “The rally really does lift all boats,” said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro. The gains for stocks were matched in bond markets. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to set the bar for global borrowing costs, had dived significantly and Europe’s big move saw Italian 2-year yields hit their lowest since May. But it was all pain for the dollar. It was struggling near a three-week trough against its major peers and emerging market currencies rose almost in unison having been crushed by the greenback last year. “Risk assets are dancing in the streets and the dollar’s down in the dumps,” Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said. “We may yet get a (Fed) rate hike in June, but if what matters is where policy’s heading in the medium term, the FX market would overlook that and sell the dollar anyway.” U.S. stocks were also set for another packed day of data and earnings. Jobless claims figures had already come out showing a 1-1/2 year high, Electric carmaker Tesla missed forecasts again but General Electric surged, marked up almost 10 percent after it beat estimates. Internet shopping behemoth Amazon was the other big focus with it set to report after the closing bell. Apple shares jumped almost 7 percent on Wednesday after soothing China worries while Facebook shares leapt 11 percent after hours on better-than-expected profits following a year of high profile data scandals. RE-EMERGING MARKETS MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose to its highest since October, helped by a 1 percent jump on Japan’s Nikkei, which shrugged off the normal headwind of a higher yen. The main emerging market index skipped to a more than 8 percent January gain while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent, despite data showing China’s factory activity contracted for a second straight month. “We were underweight emerging markets. We have changed that yesterday,” said Lyxor Asset Management Chief Investment Officer Guillaume Lasserre. With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks aimed at easing a months-long tariff war. The two-day talks which began in Washington on Wednesday are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. Donald Trump tweeted that talks were “going well” but “No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points.” In the commodity markets, industrial metals were up and oil rose for a third day, pushed up by lower imports into the United States amid OPEC efforts to tighten the market, and as Venezuela struggles to keep up its crude exports after Washington imposed sanctions on the nation. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.39 per barrel, up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. Brent was up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.01 per barrel. Back in the currency markets, the pound was a shade higher at $1.3127, while gold held near an eight-month high of $1,323 an ounce hit in the previous session as its buyers also cheered the weak dollar.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve’s promise to be “patient” as it determines how to adjust interest rates in future has been welcomed by investors fearful that an economic slowdown could preface a slide into recession. The central bank’s statement, issued following the conclusion of a two-day meeting of the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee on Jan. 30, has sparked a limited relief rally in equity markets. But the committee’s decision to put rate hikes on hold, at least for now, is a bearish rather than bullish sign for the economy and confirms that the risk of recession is elevated. The committee’s new-found patience is a sign of how much the economic environment has already weakened since the autumn, when it was planning to continue increasing rates in 2019. In its press statement, the committee noted that a sustained expansion of economic activity is the most likely outcome, but it dropped language from previous meetings suggesting risks to the outlook were balanced. Actions speak louder than words, and the Fed’s decision to go on hold suggests it now senses greater risks to the downside than before, and it is consistent with past interest rate cycles. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2TjHXFC) Before the onset of each of the last four recessions (1981, 1990, 2001 and 2007), the effective federal funds rate had peaked and was already falling by the time the business cycle turned down. In fact, the federal funds rate peaked shortly before almost every recession since 1960 (the limited exception was the recession starting in 1980). Peaking interest rates have often been a harbinger of an imminent recession as the Fed responds to signs that the expansion is running out of momentum. In every one of those cases, even interest rate reductions were not enough to prevent the economy turning down a few months later. So while the Fed’s promise to be patient will be welcome in the White House, it is an indication of how much the outlook has already deteriorated, and reinforces the reasons for investors to be cautious.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) have fallen below the UK front-month gas price, reversing a multi-year trend in which Asian prices had a premium over Europe and prompting some traders to redirect cargoes to Europe from Asia. Typical Asian LNG premiums over European gas prices occur especially in winter, when Asian demand jumps. But as temperatures in Asia have been unseasonably warm this winter, Asian gas stocks have remained full, dragging prices in December and January in Asia below winter levels of the past two years.  The price flip happened on Wednesday when wholesale front-month prices on the UK NBP gas hub opened at around $7.25 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), rising above $7.30/mmBtu later in the day, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.  Meanwhile in Asia, Royal Dutch Shell lowered its offer for March delivery in the Platts window from $7.45/mmBtu at 0759 GMT to $7.10/mmBtu at 0826 GMT on Wednesday.  At the time of the offer, the British front-month gas price was around $7.25/mmBtu. On Thursday, BP lowered its offer for late March delivery in Asia to $7.10/mmBtu from $7.20/mmBtu. The UK gas front-month price fell by the session’s end to $7.07/mmBtu at 1630 GMT on Wednesday. It opened around $7.06/mmBtu on Thursday on a well-supplied system.  However, as no deals for either Shell or BP offers took place in the window on Wednesday or Thursday, the tradeable level in Asia may still be below the British gas price.  Traders said they often compare the spread between the Asian front-month price, which is March now, and the NBP front month, which is February now, because of the difference in delivery times to Asia and Europe from Atlantic-based LNG plants. Also, a cargo’s loading date defines which delivery periods are compared, they said. “(To decide where to send a cargo) you consider the delivery month for price calculation purposes, which may be different for Europe and Asia,” one trader said.  “Delivery from the U.S. to Europe takes less time than from the U.S. to Asia, so the delivery months might be different.” The UK gas premium over Asian LNG has prompted some traders to start redirecting LNG cargoes to northwest Europe from Asia. Vitol on Wednesday changed the destination of two LNG cargoes sourced in the United States to northwest Europe from Asia due to the discount on Asian prices compared to those in Britain, an industry source familiar with the matter said.  Those cargoes are for delivery in February and March. Vitol has redirected five cargoes from Asia to Europe since the start of the year with arrivals up to March. (Graphic: Japan Korea Marker (JKM) front month price versus Dutch and British gas hub front month prices    tmsnrt.rs/2SkfTEE) The UK front-month price was last above the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) LNG price in the second quarter of 2016, when the Asian price dropped below UK quotes several times. In February 2015, the UK price continuously held above the Asian LNG price.  Europe has seen an influx of U.S. cargoes this winter due to low Asian demand and prices, with 48 cargoes delivered between October and March. Total send-out levels in the UK have averaged 50 million cubic metres (mcm) per day this month, compared to 6 mcm per day in January 2018 and 8 mcm per day in January 2017, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.  However, the latest level is well below the send-out capacity of over 157 mcm per day, with traders expecting a further increase in LNG arrivals. “It is truly an armada of LNG (into Europe), and the best is yet to come in March and April when the winter season is over in (Asia),” the industry source said.

2019-01-31,"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Oil prices will struggle to gain much upward traction this year, as concern about the global economy and growth in U.S. crude supply could offset a boost from OPEC production cuts and sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, a Reuters poll showed. “The ‘low for longer’ view is deferred but not repealed,” Julius Baer analyst Carsten Menke said.  The survey of 39 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude oil futures to average $67.32 a barrel in 2019, down from the $69.13 projected in the previous monthly poll. This is the third consecutive month in which analysts have cut their oil price forecasts. “Oil demand will underperform long-run averages in 2019 as major consuming economies face a slowdown and serious downside risks, not least of which is the U.S.-China trade dispute,” Edward Bell of Emirates NBD bank said. “Despite OPEC cuts, supply growth will still be positive and contribute to an overall market surplus and stockbuilds in 2019.”  The price of Brent marked its first annual decline in three years in 2018 and has averaged about $60 a barrel so far this year, under pressure mainly from concerns about a global economic slowdown, exacerbated by the trade war between the United States and China, and booming U.S. output.  Potential supply losses from Iran and Venezuela due to U.S. sanctions, coupled with production cuts led by OPEC and Russia, have helped prices recover by about 24 percent since touching their lowest in nearly 18 months on Dec. 26. An OPEC-led group of leading producers meets on April 17-18 in Vienna to review their supply cuts, which were agreed in December in an effort to drain global stockpiles. The potential loss in supply will, however, offer only limited support to prices, analysts said. “There still remains a fair deal of hesitancy in going long the oil market in the short term due to the uncertain economic outlook largely tied to the outcome of U.S.-China trade talks,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, strategist at BNP Paribas. Global oil demand is seen growing by between 1.1 and 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, mostly in line with the International Energy Agency’s 1.4 million bpd forecast, but it will largely depend on the economy, analysts said. “Most of the demand growth will come from China and the rest of Asia. But with slowing economic growth, the dynamics from the emerging markets will be much lower than last year,” said Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. On the supply side, while U.S. production growth could slow this year, it should be large enough to limit any price gains. “U.S. shale producers remain a key impediment to exponential gains in oil prices. U.S. swing producers will capitalise with incremental output should oil prices rise sharply from OPEC-led cuts,” said Benjamin Lu, commodities analyst at Phillip Futures. The Reuters poll forecast U.S. light crude would average $59.43 per barrel in 2019, versus $61.05 projected in the previous poll.

The 14-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) this month, the survey showed on Thursday, down 890,000 bpd from December and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. The survey suggests that Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on pledged supply curbs to avert the possibility of a new glut building up this year. A formal accord by OPEC and its allies to cut supply in 2019 took effect on Jan. 1. Crude oil has risen to $62 a barrel after a dip below $50 in December, boosted by the Saudi move, a host of involuntary curbs in other OPEC countries and the prospect of lower supply from Venezuela after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on its oil industry. OPEC, Russia and other non-members — an alliance known as OPEC+ — agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members — all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. In January the 11 OPEC members bound by the new supply-limiting agreement achieved 70 percent of the pledged cuts, the survey found. Further declines in Iran, Libya and Venezuela boosted the total OPEC decline to 890,000 bpd. The latest OPEC+ deal came months after they had agreed to pump more oil, which in turn partially unwound the original supply-limiting accord that took effect in 2017. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment in the British car industry halved last year due largely to uncertainty about future trade with the EU and surveys showed consumers and businesses were more anxious about the economic outlook as Britain heads towards a no-deal Brexit. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said on Thursday that investment in Britain’s automotive sector was 589 million pounds last year, nearly 50 percent less  than in 2017 and the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis.  “Investment has effectively stalled,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes, who called on the government to avoid “the permanent devastation” of a no-deal exit by Britain from the European Union. “A lot of that is on hold because until you see what the future is, do you have the confidence to invest in that plant when there is that sort of uncertainty?” Production also fell, by 9 percent.  The SMMT said it expected car production to fall another 3 percent in 2019, assuming an orderly Brexit with a transition period to minimise economic disruption. Some 850,000 Britons are employed in the car industry.  Britain is due to leave the EU, the world’s biggest trading bloc, on March 29. Its lawmakers have rejected the withdrawal agreement Prime Minister Theresa May negotiated with Brussels, leaving the country on course for an abrupt exit that could cause major disruptions to trade.  As May headed back to Brussels on Thursday to demand changes to her divorce deal, leading EU lawmaker Danuta Hubner warned that the risk of a no-deal Brexit had grown. Hubner told Reuters the bloc could offer Britain more assurances over the “backstop” aimed at preventing a hard border in Ireland in a political declaration on post-Brexit ties if London moves towards staying in a customs union with the EU.   May wants to replace the emergency Irish border fix with unspecified “alternative arrangements”, something the EU says is vague and not enough of a guarantee.  “If there is no openness on the UK side to include those assurances in the political declaration on the future EU-UK ties, the process could mechanically take us to no-deal,” Hubner said. Other data on Thursday showed confidence among British consumers held at a 5-1/2 year low in January. Increasing gloom about the outlook for the next 12 months was offset by a small improvement in personal finances, the GfK index showed. Surveys of businesses by the Confederation of British Industry and Lloyds Bank also gave a sobering outlook for the world’s fifth-largest economy. House prices, a key barometer of consumer confidence in Britain, rose by just 0.1 percent in annual terms in January, their weakest rise in nearly six years.  Britain’s housing market has slowed since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 when Nationwide estimated house prices were rising by around 5 percent a year. But warnings by former finance minister George Osborne that a “Leave” vote would hit the value of people’s homes by up to 18 percent have not materialised. That has led many advocates of Brexit to dismiss as a continued “Project Fear” current warnings that a no-deal scenario could cause severe disruptions to food and medical supplies, transportation and manufacturing. But the SMMT’s Hawes pinned the fall in automotive industry investment firmly on the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  “I think the numbers give the lie to that accusation: investment figures, production figures,” said Hawes.  “If it’s ‘Project Fear’, then we’re doing a good impression of it being a reality.”  Additional reporting by David Milliken and William Schomberg; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Catherine Evans",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu/british-car-industry-warns-against-no-deal-brexit-as-investment-slumps-idUKL5N1ZV3BQ,31 Jan 2019,"* Consumers remained at their gloomiest in over 5 years

2019-01-31,"LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Thursday that crude trading boosted its fourth quarter profits to a four-year high even as oil prices collapsed. Benchmark Brent oil prices collapsed from a four-year high of $86 in early October to a low of $50 a barrel within weeks. Shell is the world’s largest oil trader, buying an selling over 10 million barrels a day. The trading operations often help oil producers offset large swings in oil prices and in some cases can generate large profits. Shell said that its trading operations in the previous three quarters were weak. For the year, trading of refined products such as gasoline and diesel was weaker in 2018 compared to the previous year, while crude oil trading was stronger and liquefied natural gas (LNG) trading gave a further boost, Shell said in its results. The trading results, which the company did not disclose in detail, were boosted by the Anglo-Dutch firm’s positions in Oman and Brazil, two of its large oil production hubs, Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said.

2019-01-31,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Erwin Seba and Marianna Parraga CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp, the eighth largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela’s top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug-of-war as the Trump administration tries to use the company as leverage to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Following the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry this week, both sides have engaged in aggressive moves for control of Citgo, which has roots in the United States dating back 100 years, but has been owned by Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, or PVDSA , for three decades. Washington, along with numerous nations in the Western Hemisphere, has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president amid an economic crisis that has caused millions of people to flee the country. Maduro was re-elected last year in a contest widely seen as fraudulent. As Guaido this week worked with Washington to wrest control of the company, Venezuela responded by ordering dozens of Citgo’s expatriate staff in the United States to return to Caracas by the end of February, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier in the week, Citgo sent a team of executives to Washington amid efforts by Guaido and the U.S. government to appoint a new board of directors for Citgo, the people said. PDVSA also has said it would pursue legal efforts to block a Citgo takeover. White House national security adviser John Bolton on Wednesday tweeted photos confirming the meeting with Citgo executives. “The United States is continuing to work to make sure that the economic benefits of Venezuela’s resources are not pilfered by Maduro and his cronies,” he wrote. The company, which operates three refineries and distributes fuel to more than 5,500 gasoline stations across 29 U.S. states, recognizable by a red triangle logo, has become the largest potential casualty from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. The Trump administration ordered Citgo profits to be retained to pressure Maduro to step down. It also barred U.S. customers from transferring payment to PDVSA, depriving the OPEC-member nation its largest source of cash. Citgo imports crude from PDVSA in exchange for refined products, which raises the possibility that Citgo would be without a third of its crude supplies after a grace period ends. Employees at the firms’ refineries say they have been advised by managers to ignore the furor. But the pressure is now threatening Citgo operations, from its oil-processing capacity and plant management to debt refinancing and commercial relationships, according to the people close to the matter. Venezuelan expats, whose numbers have increased in recent years, hold key jobs at the company, from running its finance operations to overseeing refineries. Citgo did not respond to a request for comment on the executives’ discussions with U.S. officials or oil supplies for its refineries. The seriousness of the situation was underscored by the hurried exchanges among Houston, Washington and Caracas and the recall notice to expats. Citgo Corporate Treasurer Gina Coon, assistant finance chief Curtis Rowe, strategy chief Rick Esser, and legislative affairs chief Larry Elizondo were among executives who met in Washington this week. Citgo President Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, rushed to Caracas from his Bahamas office over the weekend, missing a contingent of Citgo executives who went to the Bahamas to discuss the sanctions, the people said. Chavez works from the Bahamas because he does not have a U.S. visa. The Houston-based company has accumulated cash and credit lines in recent months as dividends payments to Caracas have been blocked by U.S. sanctions imposed in 2017. Stephen Goltz, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, projected Citgo would generate about $800 million in total cash from operations for the 12 months ending June 30, saying it was “performing fine.” That may allow it to continue to source the crude oil it needs to refine into gasoline and other fuels to meet U.S. demand. Citgo’s three refineries can process a combined 750,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 4 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. However, Citgo has been struggling to refinance a revolving line of credit, a task that must be completed by July, according to people close to the matter. PDVSA also faces a $72 million interest bond payment in April, though the sanctions could prevent a foreclosure sale of Citgo shares in event of a default, said Mark Weidemaier, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s congress and self-proclaimed president, has asked the United States to protect Citgo from creditors in event of a default while moving fast to appoint a new board loyal to his government. At least three former executives turned him down, the people said. “Discussions are happening right now between Venezuela’s new government and the U.S. government on what to do with Citgo,” said an adviser close to Guaido and the U.S. government. “The size of the task is huge, starting with obstacles to appointing a new board.” Last week, Citgo idled the smaller of two gasoline-producing units at its Corpus Christi refinery in Texas. The shutdown was due to weak margins for gasoline, exacerbated by higher costs for purchased crude, people familiar with the plant’s operations said. Still, company managers this week were telling employees their jobs are safe, according to staff at the Corpus Christi refinery. “We’ll still be here doing business as usual,” a refinery worker said.

2019-01-31,"BEIJING, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a return to “unity and harmony” on Thursday as he welcomed gas-rich Qatar’s emir to Beijing, amid a festering dispute that has seen some Arab states lead by Saudi Arabia severing relations with Doha. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, trade and transport ties with Qatar in June 2017. They accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and cultivating ties with Saudi Arabia’s regional foe, Iran. Qatar, which denies the charge, says the boycott seeks to curtail its sovereignty, while the row has defied mediation efforts by Kuwait and the United States which sees Gulf unity as essential to containing Iran. The rift has shown no sign of being resolved soon. Qatar has been bolstering ties with its supporters, such as Turkey, with trade between those two expected to have risen by more than half in 2018. China has largely stayed out of the dispute, calling for the problem to be resolved via talks, though has played host to senior Qatari officials since the spat began, including in December to Qatar’s foreign minister. Meeting in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People, Xi told Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani that regional cooperation was an important basis for prosperity in the Gulf region, Chinese state television reported. China supports the efforts of the Gulf Cooperation Council to seek an “appropriate resolution to disputes and contradictions via political and diplomatic means, to return unity and harmony between Gulf and Arab countries”, Xi said. “China is willing to continue to play a constructive role according to the wishes of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries,” Xi added, according to the report, which did not make direct mention of the Gulf rift. In remarks in front of reporters, Xi called Al Thani “an old friend and a good friend”. Al Thani told Xi that he was very happy with his personal friendship with him. “We are ready to have bigger investments in China, in infrastructure or in any other field we see as important for us,” he said. “We are happy to provide China with liquid gas and we are ready to provide China with more in the near future. I am very happy to be in China.” Last October, state energy giant Qatar Petroleum said it had signed a five-year agreement to supply China with 600,000 tonnes of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) per year. Earlier in January, state-owned Qatar Airways said it had acquired a 5 percent stake in China Southern Airlines , in a move to gain access to the fast-growing Chinese market. China has traditionally played little role in Middle East conflicts or diplomacy, despite its reliance on the region for oil, but it has been trying to raise its profile, especially in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman visited Beijing in 2017. However, China has had to walk a fine line, as it also has close ties with both Iran and Israel.

The LNG tanker Cape Ann, with a capacity of about 135,000 cubic metres, arrived at the floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) Excellence, offshore Bangladesh’s Moheshkhali island, on Jan. 29 after loading LNG from Nigeria earlier this month, according to an official from state-owned energy company Petrobangla and data from Refinitiv Eikon. Bangladesh’s 1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) deal with Oman had been expected to start later this year after a second FSRU started operations. The country also has an ongoing 2.5 mtpa deal with Qatar’s RasGas. “We had been looking for one more cargo after a pipeline was ready. We started discussions with Qatar and Oman Trading, but Qatar was unable to supply more for now while Oman Trading came forward to start supplying LNG,” said the official from Petrobangla, who asked to remain unidentified since he is not authorized to speak to the media. He added that the Excellence, with a regasification capacity of 500 million cubic feet per day, is now able to run at full capacity after construction of a 30-km (19-mile) gas transmission pipeline in southern Bangladesh was completed in late November. Bangladesh has a 10-year LNG import deal with Oman Trading International. That LNG will be priced at 11.9 percent of the three-month average price of Brent crude oil plus a constant price of 40 cents per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Under its 15-year deal with Qatar, Bangladesh agreed to pay 12.65 percent of the three-month average price of Brent oil plus a constant of 50 cents per mmBtu. Separately, the company is moving ahead with plans to import LNG by shortlisting about 30 companies out of a total of 42 for its spot tender process, said a second Petrobangla official, who also asked not to be identified. The companies include Trafigura, Gunvor, Vitol Asia, Itochu Corp, Royal Dutch Shell, Total SA, Chevron Corp, Woodside Petroleum Ltd, RasGas, AOT Energy and Engie SA, he said.

2019-01-31,"(Repeats Wednesday story with no changes to text) By Michelle Nichols and Lesley Wroughton UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Three days after proclaiming himself Venezuela’s head of state, Juan Guaido wrote to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asking for help in tackling the country’s urgent humanitarian crisis. But Venezuela’s seat at the 193-member world body is held by President Nicolas Maduro’s government and Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro’s approval or U.N. Security Council authorization. “The United Nations are ready to increase their activities in Venezuela in the areas of humanitarian assistance and development,” Guterres told Guaido in a letter dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. “For that, the United Nations need, however, the consent and cooperation of the Government.” The exchange illustrates how a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Guaido over Maduro has left the U.N. and other international organizations caught in the middle of global division over the issue. Most Latin American countries, Canada and European nations have recognized Guaido or are on the verge of doing so. But these rapid endorsements have triggered angry responses from Russia, China and a few left-leaning Latin American states, and wariness from some African and Caribbean nations. Guterres noted that in his relations with U.N. member states he respects “the decisions of the intergovernmental bodies, particularly the General Assembly and the Security Council.” The General Assembly allows each U.N. nation one vote, while the five permanent members of the Security Council, charged with maintaining international peace, include Russia and China. The international split is also hampering swift decisions at other multilateral groups like the Washington-headquartered International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, whose recognition of the Guaido government could eventually help get sorely-needed loans to Venezuela. Maduro’s government has denied that there is a humanitarian crisis in the country, blaming economic problems on sanctions. Venezuela is struggling with hunger, preventable diseases and hyperinflation forecast at 10 million percent in 2019. The quickest way for a country or countries to try and deprive Maduro’s government of Venezuela’s U.N. seat would be to present a draft resolution to the General Assembly for a vote. However, diplomats said that such a move could not currently garner the majority support needed to be successful. “We do think there will be appropriate resolutions when the time is right and we’ll certainly support those. They won’t come just from us, they’ll come from other nations who care deeply abut the Venezuelan people as well,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the U.N. on Saturday. Maduro was sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term in office after elections last year that were widely dubbed illegitimate, while Guaido took the helm of the elected National Assembly earlier this month and on Jan. 23 proclaimed himself the country’s rightful leader. A heated Security Council meeting on Saturday revealed the bitter divide over the crisis. When asked about the possibility of a showdown over Venezuela’s U.N. seat, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Maduro’s government was legitimate and there was no need to challenge its credentials. The U.N. has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body. In September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country’s interim government as Tripoli’s sole representatives at the world body, effectively recognizing the National Transitional Council. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized that council. So far, Guaido has named envoys to Washington and the Organization of American States regional bloc. If he decided to name a U.N. envoy, such a request would traditionally be sent to Guterres and then considered by a nine-member credentials committee, which includes the United States, Russia and China. The IMF and World Bank could eventually test support for Guaido through a straw poll of member countries that make up their respective executive boards, according to several bank and fund officials. The United States is the largest and most influential member country in both organizations. Latin America’s largest lender, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), could be the first financial institution to put the issue before its board - even as soon as next week, according to some officials. Several board officials, however, cautioned that the membership was divided and there was no consensus on how to proceed. Still, recognition by global lenders of Guaido will not automatically unlock multilateral funding any time soon, officials said. Venezuela is $212 million in arrears to the IADB and was censured by the IMF last year for failing to provide economic data to the fund. “It is not obvious what the U.N. is going to do, much less what the IMF would do,” said James Boughton, the IMF’s former historian, now at the Center for International Governance Innovation. “It would be up to a member country to request the acknowledgement of a new government, in this case it would come from the U.S.,” said Boughton. When that happens, “then it is just a question of a simple majority decision by the executive board,” citing IMF rules.

2019-01-31,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Airways has upgraded an existing order for 50 Airbus A321neo jets to include 10 long-range models, as a regional diplomatic rift has forced the airline to fly longer routes.   The airline said on Thursday that 10 of those 50 aircraft would now be the A321LR, to be delivered from 2020. A321s are the larger version of Airbus’ best-selling A320 narrow-body jet.  The airline said longer range A321s will help it launch flights to new markets where there is currently not enough demand for larger aircraft but which are out of reach of smaller A320s. State-owned Qatar Airways has been banned from the airspace of neighboring Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain since June 2017 after those countries cut ties with Qatar. It is also banned from Egypt’s airspace which also cut diplomatic relations with Qatar. The airline lost access to 18 cities in those countries that cut ties. It has had to increase costs by operating longer flights on some routes to avoid the airspace of the four countries. Qatar Airways made a $69 million loss in the year to March 2018, blaming the rift. Its order for 50 A321neos was made in 2017 when it upgraded an order for 50 A320neo family jets to the larger model.  An order for 50 A321neos would be valued at around $6.4 billion based on the average 2017 list price, according to Airbus’s website, but discounts are common, particularly on large orders.

2019-01-31,"JAKARTA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Indonesian insurance rules that come into effect on Feb. 1 are causing huge coal supply backlogs, with dozens of ships held up outside ports unable to load as authorities start checking to see if vessels are in compliance with the new policy. A regulation issued in August last year requires Indonesian exporters of coal and palm oil to use local insurers from Feb. 1, and also requires them to use local shipping companies from May 2020. Indonesia is the world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal, used mostly for power generation. The country exports between 25 million and 30 million tonnes of coal per month to its main customers in India, China, Japan and South Korea. Hendra Sinadia, executive director of Indonesian Coal Mining Association, told Reuters that during an initial month-long trial period beginning on Friday exporters without Indonesian insurers would not be penalised. Port surveyors, however, were checking which exporters have proper insurance, he said. Sinadia said “exports won’t be disrupted” and that the association was telling its members it was “business as usual”. Coal traders, though, said the new insurance rules were already causing a considerable backlog in Kalimantan, Indonesia’s biggest coal-mining region. “It is pretty chaotic at the moment. Some shippers haven’t prepared their new insurance, others have, but the authorities and insurers are slow to register,” said one trader who exports Kalimantan coal. There were not enough surveyors to handle the fleet of ships, he said, and insurers and port authorities were taking a long time to issue and recognise the new insurance documents. The main concern was the daily charter rate of a ship that sits idle for weeks running up a bill in the tens of thousands of dollar, he said. More than two dozen large dry-bulk ships are currently sitting outside the port of Samarinda in East Kalimantan, waiting to load coal, according to Refinitiv ship tracking data. The situation is similar in the South Kalimantan ports of Taboneo and Bunati. Indonesian coal prices have so far not been heavily affected, traders said, as Asian supplies are ample. Prices were hovering slightly above $90 per tonne for most of January. “Add the usual port and mining constraints in Kalimantan, and you have many ships that have been sitting outside its ports for many weeks,” the trader said. Most Indonesian coal is sold on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, where insurance is the responsibility of the buyer. PT Bukit Asam, a state-controlled coal miner that exports on an FOB basis, has recommended a number of Indonesian insurance companies to their buyers, said Director Adib Ubaidillah. Palm oil exporters, meanwhile, are still waiting for lists of insurers from the country’s Financial Service Authority, according to Togar Sitanggang, deputy chief of the Indonesia Palm Association.

2019-01-31,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI All-Country World Index set for best Jan since it began By Marc Jones LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Soothing sounds from the Federal Reserve propelled world stocks to their best January on record on Thursday, although having scored stellar gains this time last year only to flop spectacularly, traders were trying not to get too carried away. The Fed said it would pause its 3-year interest rate rise campaign while assessing the weakening of the economy. Crucially, it also said that the rundown of its balance sheet - or the stockpile of bonds it has accumulated over the past 10 years of quantitative easing - could slow too. That ticked all the boxes for financial markets, and saw Europe’s bulls push London, Frankfurt and Paris up 0.7 to 1 percent after Wall Street and then Asia had both charged overnight. Added together it lifted the $4 trillion MSCI world stocks index, which tracks 47 countries, up 0.5 percent and for the 20th day out of the last 23. For January it is up more than 7.2 percent which is its best January since the index began in 1988 and the best performance in any month since December 2015. “The rally really does lift all boats,” said Pictet emerging market portfolio manager Guido Chamorro. The gains were matched in bond markets. Benchmark U.S. Treasury yields, which tend to set the bar for global borrowing costs, had dived significantly and Europe’s big move saw Italian 2-year yields hit their lowest since May. But was all pain for the dollar. It was struggling near a three-week trough against its major peers and emerging market currencies rose almost in unison having been steamrollered by the greenback last year. “Risk assets are dancing in the streets and the dollar’s down in the dumps,” Societe Generale strategist Kit Juckes said. “We may yet get a (Fed) rate hike in June, but if what matters is where policy’s heading in the medium term, the FX market would overlook that and sell the dollar anyway.” U.S. stocks were also expected to open higher later after the Fed’s boost had dovetailed with reassuring tech earnings on Wednesday, and with Amazon due to report later. Apple shares had jumped almost 7 percent after it soothed its China worries. Facebook shares then leapt 11 percent after hours after it had reported better-than-expected profits following a year of high profile data scandals. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares then rose to its highest since October helped by a 1 percent jump on Japan’s Nikkei which shrugged off the normal headwind of a higher yen. The main emerging market index skipped to a more than 8 percent January gain. while the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent despite data showing China’s factory activity contracted for a second straight month. RE-EMERGING MARKETS With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks aimed at easing a months-long tariff war. The two-day talks which began in Washington on Wednesday are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to budge on trade practices and fully protect American intellectual property rights. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. In the commodity markets, oil prices rose for a third day, pushed up by lower imports into the United States amid OPEC efforts to tighten the market, and as Venezuela struggles to keep up its crude exports after Washington imposed sanctions on the nation. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.47 per barrel, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. Brent was up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $62.01 per barrel. Back in the currency markets, the pound was a shade higher at $1.3127, while gold held near an eight-month high of $1,323 an ounce hit in the previous session as its buyers also cheered the weak dollar. “The Fed dropped a commitment to gradual rate hikes from its policy statement ... U.S dollar’s plunge alongside treasury bond yields have burnished the relative appeal of gold,” said Ilya Spivak, senior currency strategist with DailyFx.

2019-01-31,"* Chalco says Shandong unit subject to ‘flexible production’ * Says is considering transformation, upgrade of plant * Company has closed 850kt of capacity since 2018 - consultancy By Tom Daly BEIJING, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Aluminum Corp of China , known as Chalco, said late on Wednesday it had stopped production at an aluminium smelting plant in eastern China’s Shandong province, citing high electricity costs. In a statement to the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, Chalco said it was implementing “flexible production” on all 200,000 tonnes per year of capacity at its Shandong Huayu facility due to “high electricity prices, regional environmental protection policies, market environment and other factors.” The closure, which equates to around 5 percent of Chalco’s total controlled operating capacity, underscores the financial pressure aluminium smelters in China, the world’s top producer of the metal, are facing with Chinese aluminium prices languishing near two-year lows and amid lacklustre domestic demand. Shandong, China’s top aluminium smelting province, last year introduced new fees for onsite coal-fired power plants, which are used by companies like Huayu to generate electricity for the power-intensive smelting process, causing an increase in costs. This is not the first time Chalco has announced production cuts this winter. On Nov. 30, the company said it was shutting 470,000 tonnes of production lines, including some at Huayu. Chinese consultancy Baiinfo estimates that 100,000 tonnes of that closed capacity came from Huayu. Despite the closures, China’s aluminium production rose to a record monthly high of over 3 million tonnes in December. Since 2018, Chalco has closed around 850,000 tonnes of primary aluminium production capacity and will close another 190,000 tonnes in the first quarter of 2019, according to Baiinfo manager Zhang Rufeng. Chalco did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the consultancy’s figures. Chalco is discussing “transformation, upgrading and development,” with other shareholders of Shandong Huayu, it said in a statement. Chalco owns a 55 percent stake in Huayu, according to its most recent annual report, which did not identify the other shareholders.

2019-01-31,"Jan 31 (Reuters) - The blast of arctic cold that hit the U.S. Midwest this week will linger on Thursday, but it’s pushing east and losing much of its bite. The cold has caused at least a dozen deaths since Saturday across the Midwest, according to official and media reports. Some died in weather-related traffic accidents, others from apparent exposure to the elements. Videos this week showed boiling water freezing as it was tossed in the air in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and transit workers in Chicago, Illinois, setting fire to train tracks to keep them from locking up. But by this weekend, Chicago, which had near-record cold of 23 degrees below zero Fahrenheit on Wednesday, will bask in snow-melting highs in the mid 40s to low 50s Fahrenheit. So will other parts of the Midwest. “It’s going to be at least a 60-degree swing for Chicago, from minus 20s to upper 40s by Sunday,” said David Hamrick, a forecaster with the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park Maryland. But some of the lowest temperatures in a generation could still arrive in parts of the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Thursday, forecasters warned. “It’s going to be minus 30 in parts of North Dakota today,” Hamrick said. “Minus 20 in Minnesota and upper Michigan.” The cold air had already hit Boston, Massachusetts, early Thursday. Temperatures dropped to about 5 degrees Fahrenheit and would struggle to get out of the mid-teens, Hamrick said. Even parts of the South, such as the mountains of Kentucky, Tennessee and upper Georgia, would be in the single digits, he said. The weather caused hundreds of traffic accidents, including a chain-reaction collision of about two dozen cars in Grand Rapids, Michigan, during a white-out on Wednesday, local media reported. More than 2,300 flights were canceled and more than 3,500 delayed, most of them out of Chicago’s O’Hare International and Midway International airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.com. General Motors Co said late on Wednesday it would temporarily suspend operations at 11 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center after a utility made an emergency appeal to users to conserve natural gas. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also said it had canceled a shift on Thursday at both its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants. It was considering whether to cancel additional shifts. It has been more than 20 years since a similar arctic blast covered a swath of the Midwest and Northeast, NWS forecaster Brian Hurley said. “You have to go back to the mid to early ‘90s for this,” he said. “Even still, we’re breaking records from then.” More than 30 record lows were shattered across the Midwest. The lowest was minus 40 degrees in International Falls, Minnesota. “But we’re not done with the cold yet,” Hurley cautioned early Thursday. “There’s still some kick left in this.” Reporting by Rich McKay in Atlanta, additional reporting by

2019-01-31,"(Adds more detail, background) AMSTERDAM, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Gas production at the Groningen field in the Netherlands can continue as planned this year, the Dutch High Court said on Thursday, dismissing calls by angry citizens for an immediate halt due to earthquake risks. The court, issuing a preliminary ruling, said it would reach a final verdict on production plans after it had heard 26 other complaints from local authorities and interest groups in April. Decades of extraction in Groningen, once Europe’s largest natural gas field, have led to dozens of minor tremors every year, damaging thousands of homes, sparking unrest among locals and prompting authorities to impose caps on activity. The Dutch government last year said it would end production by 2030 and lower it as quickly as possible in coming years. Output is set to drop to 19.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year that began in October, down from a 2013 peak of 54 bcm. The Groningen field is operated by a 50-50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil called NAM. Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Dale Hudson and Susan

2019-01-31,"LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s self-declared interim president Juan Guaido has asked European Union governments to keep up the pressure on President Nicolas Maduro. “I said to him, what is your message for myself and the other foreign ministers?” British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said. “He said two things: please keep up the pressure on Maduro who has done so much damage and remember this is about the humanitarian catastrophe that is going on at the moment.” The United States has recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state and denounced Maduro as a usurper. Maduro, sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term after disputed elections last year, accuses Guaido of staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. Maduro is backed by a number of countries, including Russia. Hunt criticised Britain’s opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for siding with Maduro. “Simply because they share Maduro’s anti-Western worldview is not a reason to turn a blind eye to someone who has driven his people into poverty where 70 percent of children in some areas are facing malnutrition.” Corbyn has said he condemns violence in Venezuela and has called for a negotiated settlement.

2019-01-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - PetroChina Co plans to drop Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) as a partner in a planned $10 billion oil refinery and petrochemical project in southern China, said three sources familiar with the matter this week.  The company’s decision adds to state-owned PDVSA’s woes after the United States imposed sanctions on the company on Jan. 28 to undermine the rule of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. However, dropping the company was not a reaction to the U.S. sanctions but follows the deteriorating financial status of PDVSA over the past few years, said two of the sources, both executives with China National Petroleum Corp, the parent of PetroChina.  “There will be no role of PDVSA as an equity partner. At least we don’t see that possibility in the near future given the situation the country has been through in recent years,” said one of the executives, asking to remain unidentified because he is not authorized to speak to the media.     The move illustrates the fading relationship between Venezuela and China, which has given $50 billion to the South American country in the form of loans-for-oil agreements. China, the world’s largest oil importer, is now the second-biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude in Asia, taking in 16.63 million tonnes, or about 332,000 barrels per day (bpd), in 2018.  That relationship began to fray in 2015 when Venezuela requested a change in the payment terms on the debt to ease the impact of its falling crude output and declining oil prices. Instead of handing out large fresh loans, Beijing has shifted to small investments or granting extensions in the grace periods for the outstanding loans. The sanctions were imposed at the same time the United States and other nations have backed opposition leader Juan Guaido as legitimate ruler instead of President Nicolas Maduro. During Maduro’s rule, oil production has plunged while millions have left amid hyperinflation and as consumer goods have vanished from market shelves.  PDVSA was originally a 40 percent equity partner in the refinery project, located the city of Jieyang in the southern province of Guangdong. PetroChina and PDVSA received environmental approval for the project in 2011.  Initial plans were for the refinery to process 400,000 bpd of strictly Venezuelan crude oil. The plans have now been expanded to focus on petrochemical production including a 1.2-million-tonnes-per-year ethylene plant and a 2.6-million tpy aromatics plant. The plant is expected to be operational by late 2021, Caixin reported on Dec. 5. Under the revised plan, the refinery will not be restricted to Venezuelan oil but could process other so-called heavy crude grades that could come from Middle Eastern producers such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, said the third official, a PetroChina trading executive. An e-mail response from PetroChina’s public relations company Hill+Knowlton Strategies only stated “China-Venezuela Guangdong Petrochemical Co Ltd is a joint venture company approved by the state,” referring to the formal name for the company set up by Petrochina and PDVSA to develop the refinery.  PDVSA and the Venezuelan Ministry of Petroleum did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

2019-01-31,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia intends to challenge an EU directive on renewable energy at the World Trade Organization, arguing the plan to curb the use of crops that cause deforestation will unfairly target palm oil, a senior Indonesian official told Reuters.  The world’s top producer of the oil is also reviewing its relations with the European Union over the issue and urging other Southeast Asian nations to defer plans to upgrade EU ties, said Mahendra Siregar, special staff at the foreign ministry.  The EU directive, known as RED II, aims to stop the use of  crops that cause deforestation in transportation fuel by 2030. Environmentalists blame a rapid expansion of Indonesian palm plantations for a massive clearance of forests that were home to endangered tigers, orang-utans and elephants.  A challenge from Indonesia on the policy would escalate its efforts to safeguard sales to its second-biggest palm oil market. The EU accounted for around 15 percent of Indonesia’s total palm exports of more than $15 billion last year.  Siregar said palm oil will be labelled a “high risk” crop - indicating its potential to result in deforestation - in an act attached to RED II due to be issued in early February. Indonesia will challenge both RED II and the act at the WTO’s dispute settlement body after it is issued, he said.  The WTO body can order members to remove any trade barriers if it finds that the policies breach free trade rules.  A government document outlining Indonesia’s stance on the EU policy and reviewed by Reuters said the method used to assess “Indirect Land Use Change” (ILUC), which aims to measure the risk of unintended carbon emissions, was not internationally recognized and not applicable in a tropical region.  “The criteria listed in ILUC gives advantages to local European Union commodities such as rapeseed oil,” it said.  Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said in a letter to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that developments in the EU hurting the interests of ASEAN palm oil-producing states have caused it to defer “elevation of ASEAN-EU dialogue relations to a strategic level.”  The Jan. 14 letter, also reviewed by Reuters, urged other members of ASEAN to follow suit.  “All Indonesia-EU relationships will be overviewed related to that discriminative policy by the EU,” Siregar said.  Asked about the letter, a spokesman at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta said: “It is up to the member states to decide.”  Rafael de Bustamante Tello, first counsellor at the EU embassy in Jakarta, said: “The EU considers the RED II to be in line with the EU’s international commitments, including its WTO obligations.”  The European Commission will make sure “achievement of the EU’s renewable energy goals goes hand in hand with the fair and rules-based international trade regime that we so strongly defend,” he said.  De Bustamante also said that during an EU-ASEAN ministerial meeting in Brussels last week the two blocs decided to form a new joint working group to address issues related to palm oil.  In January last year, the WTO ruled in favor of Indonesia on several challenges to anti-dumping duties that the EU had imposed on its biodiesel exports. The duties had effectively stopped the trade, but exporters were able to resume shipments to Europe around April.  Palm oil, mainly produced in Indonesia and Malaysia, is used as feedstock for biofuels as well as being used in a wide variety of goods, ranging from food to soap.

2019-01-31,"LONDON, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A new power cable between Britain and Belgium, which has the capacity to provide power for one million homes, began operations on Thursday, the UK’s National Grid said. The 560 million pound ($735 million) Nemo Link, a joint project between National Grid and Belgian transmission system operator Elia, is capable of transmitting a gigawatt (GW) of electricity and is one of a handful of new interconnectors being built between Britain and continental Europe to increase the UK’s power supply flexibility. “Interconnectors like Nemo Link are the perfect tool to move renewable energy from where it is produced to where it is needed most,” said John Pettigrew, chief executive of National Grid, which owns and operates much of Britain’s energy distribution network. “By connecting the UK and Belgian electricity markets, we will also ensure customers have access to different sources of generation and lower-priced electricity,” he said. Britain already runs a 2 GW interconnector with France and 1 GW connection with the Netherlands. A 1 GW link to France called IFA2 and the 1.4 GW North Sea Link to Norway are also under construction and due to begin operations as of next year. In addition a 1.4 GW cable to Denmark, the Viking Link, has been approved, National Grid said.

2019-01-31,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche expects sales and earnings to rise in 2019 as new drugs more than offset competition from copies of its $20 billion-plus per year trio of cancer medicines Rituxan, Herceptin and Avastin, the Swiss drugmaker said on Thursday.  Core operating profit last year climbed 9 percent to 20.5 billion Swiss francs ($20.65 billion), the company said. Sales rose 7 percent to 56.8 billion francs, just ahead of the 56.4 billion francs average estimate in a Reuters poll. CEO Severin Schwan forecast “low- to mid-single digit” growth in 2019 sales and earnings-per-share, spurred by new drugs including Ocrevus for multiple sclerosis, Hemlibra for hemophilia A and cancer medicines Alecensa and Tecentriq.  “Almost 90 percent of our growth comes from newly launched products, demonstrating we are successfully rejuvenating our portfolio,” Schwan said. Roche shares were indicated 1.2 percent higher. The company proposed a dividend increase to 8.70 francs per share, from 8.30 francs last year. Net profit rose 24 percent to 10.9 billion francs, as the company was helped by U.S. tax reform that lowered its tax rate. One drag continued to be InterMune, which Roche spent $8.3 billion on buying in 2014 but which resulted in more than half the 3.3 billion franc impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in 2018. Sales of Ocrevus more than doubled to 2.4 billion francs, while Hemlibra in its first full year on the market reached 224 million francs, which Schwan called “beyond expectations.” Tecentriq, Roche’s cancer immunotherapy, posted 772 million in sales, up nearly 60 percent but still dwarfed by rival medicines Keytruda from Merck and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Schwan said Bristol-Myers’s $74 billion offer for Celgene this month would not impact his strategy of focusing on smaller, bolt-on acquisitions. “We are not into the mega-mergers,” he said. The CEO said Roche continued to benefit from growing sales in China, which bought more older medicines whose sales have fallen elsewhere following patent expiries. “Volumes have really soared,” he said. “I would expect the momentum to continue in 2019.” Sales of Herceptin rose 1 percent to 6.98 billion francs, despite a 16 percent decline in Europe where biosimilar copies are impacting revenue. Avastin sales rose 3 percent, to 6.85 billion francs, while blood cancer medicine Rituxan - the hardest hit medicine, so far, from copies - slipped 8 percent to 6.75 billion.  Schwan is expecting biosimilar competition in the U.S. market to intensify from the second half of 2019. Roche and partner AC Immune SA on Wednesday delivered bad news for their Alzheimer’s medicine crenezumab, calling a halt to two late-stage clinical trials after hopes of success faded. Schwan called the result “disappointing”, but the consequence of taking risks on new medicines, saying that other work on Alzheimer’s would continue.

2019-01-31,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open slightly higher * Stocks lifted as Fed signals potential end to rate hike cycle * Prospect of rate hikes ending weighs on dollar and bond yields By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Asia stocks rose to a four-month high on Thursday after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing global growth. The dollar struggled near a three-week trough against its major peers and U.S. Treasury yields were significantly lower as investors reacted to the Fed’s change in tone. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Asia’s lead and open higher, with Britain’s FTSE edging up 0.05 percent and Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC each climbing 0.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to its highest since Oct. 4 and was last up 0.9 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent despite data showing China’s factory activity contracted for a second straight month amid weakening orders. South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.3 percent. The Fed on Wednesday held interest rates steady as expected, and also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates. The central bank said it would be “patient” before making any further moves amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth risks and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations. On Wall Street, the Dow and the Nasdaq rallied 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, on hopes the Fed’s pause would give the U.S. economy and corporate profits more room to run. Late in December the Dow had sunk to its lowest level since September 2017, dogged by factors including worries over cooling economic growth and trade tensions, adding pressure on the Fed to reassess its tightening bias. “The Fed’s statements firmly confirmed its dovish stance, which had already been on display at the start of the year. Market concerns towards the Fed’s rate hikes have now been put to rest,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The mention of the balance sheet by the Fed was a positive surprise. The focus now shifts immediately to U.S.-China trade talks, but the equity markets could have enough cushioning to withstand negative news from the talks.” The U.S. central bank also said on Wednesday that its balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected. However, while market expectations for Fed tightening may have waned significantly, some analysts suggested rate hikes still remained a near-term possibility. “While many of the risks to the U.S. outlook remain in place, there is little to suggest that the outlook has changed by as much as the Fed communication says it has,” wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “We worry that the Fed has traded near-term support for financial markets and the economy for another round of volatility later this year if it is forced to lift rates higher, which remains more likely than not, in our view.” With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks aimed at easing a months-long tariff war. The two-day talks which began in Washington on Wednesday are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Beijing is willing to address core U.S. demands to fully protect American intellectual property rights and end policies that Washington has said force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stretched the previous day’s losses and slipped to a three-week low of 95.204. A weaker dollar helped nudge the euro to $1.1509, its highest since Jan. 11. The greenback was slipped about 0.3 percent to a two-week low of 108.695 yen. The pound was a shade higher at $1.3127, given some reprieve after slipping earlier in the week when British lawmakers voted down a proposal in parliament that could have prevented a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit.

2019-01-31,"CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Citgo Petroleum Corp, the eighth largest U.S. refiner and Venezuela’s top foreign asset, is in the middle of a tug-of-war as the Trump administration tries to use the company as leverage to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Following the U.S. decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry this week, both sides have engaged in aggressive moves for control of Citgo, which has roots in the United States dating back 100 years, but has been owned by Venezuela’s state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, or PVDSA , for three decades. Washington, along with numerous nations in the Western Hemisphere, has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s president amid an economic crisis that has caused millions of people to flee the country. Maduro was re-elected last year in a contest widely seen as fraudulent. As Guaido this week worked with Washington to wrest control of the company, Venezuela responded by ordering dozens of Citgo’s expatriate staff in the United States to return to Caracas by the end of February, people familiar with the matter said. Earlier in the week, Citgo sent a team of executives to Washington amid efforts by Guaido and the U.S. government to appoint a new board of directors for Citgo, the people said. PDVSA also has said it would pursue legal efforts to block a Citgo takeover. White House national security adviser John Bolton on Wednesday tweeted photos confirming the meeting with Citgo executives. “The United States is continuing to work to make sure that the economic benefits of Venezuela’s resources are not pilfered by Maduro and his cronies,” he wrote. The company, which operates three refineries and distributes fuel to more than 5,500 gasoline stations across 29 U.S. states, recognizable by a red triangle logo, has become the largest potential casualty from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela. The Trump administration ordered Citgo profits to be retained to pressure Maduro to step down. It also barred U.S. customers from transferring payment to PDVSA, depriving the OPEC-member nation its largest source of cash. Citgo imports crude from PDVSA in exchange for refined products, which raises the possibility that Citgo would be without a third of its crude supplies after a grace period ends. Employees at the firms’ refineries say they have been advised by managers to ignore the furor. But the pressure is now threatening Citgo operations, from its oil-processing capacity and plant management to debt refinancing and commercial relationships, according to the people close to the matter. Venezuelan expats, whose numbers have increased in recent years, hold key jobs at the company, from running its finance operations to overseeing refineries. Citgo did not respond to a request for comment on the executives’ discussions with U.S. officials or oil supplies for its refineries. The seriousness of the situation was underscored by the hurried exchanges among Houston, Washington and Caracas and the recall notice to expats. Citgo Corporate Treasurer Gina Coon, assistant finance chief Curtis Rowe, strategy chief Rick Esser, and legislative affairs chief Larry Elizondo were among executives who met in Washington this week. Citgo President Asdrubal Chavez, a cousin of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, rushed to Caracas from his Bahamas office over the weekend, missing a contingent of Citgo executives who went to the Bahamas to discuss the sanctions, the people said. Chavez works from the Bahamas because he does not have a U.S. visa. The Houston-based company has accumulated cash and credit lines in recent months as dividends payments to Caracas have been blocked by U.S. sanctions imposed in 2017. Stephen Goltz, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings, projected Citgo would generate about $800 million in total cash from operations for the 12 months ending June 30, saying it was “performing fine.” That may allow it to continue to source the crude oil it needs to refine into gasoline and other fuels to meet U.S. demand. Citgo’s three refineries can process a combined 750,000 barrels of oil a day, or about 4 percent of total U.S. refining capacity. However, Citgo has been struggling to refinance a revolving line of credit, a task that must be completed by July, according to people close to the matter. PDVSA also faces a $72 million interest bond payment in April, though the sanctions could prevent a foreclosure sale of Citgo shares in event of a default, said Mark Weidemaier, a professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law. Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s congress and self-proclaimed president, has asked the United States to protect Citgo from creditors in event of a default while moving fast to appoint a new board loyal to his government. At least three former executives turned him down, the people said. “Discussions are happening right now between Venezuela’s new government and the U.S. government on what to do with Citgo,” said an adviser close to Guaido and the U.S. government. “The size of the task is huge, starting with obstacles to appointing a new board.” Last week, Citgo idled the smaller of two gasoline-producing units at its Corpus Christi refinery in Texas. The shutdown was due to weak margins for gasoline, exacerbated by higher costs for purchased crude, people familiar with the plant’s operations said. Still, company managers this week were telling employees their jobs are safe, according to staff at the Corpus Christi refinery. “We’ll still be here doing business as usual,” a refinery worker said.

2019-01-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co said late on Wednesday it will temporarily suspend operations at 11 Michigan plants and its Warren Tech Center after a utility made an emergency appeal to users to conserve natural gas during extreme winter cold. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also said it had canceled a shift on Thursday at both its Warren Truck and Sterling Heights Assembly plants and was considering whether it would need to cancel additional shifts. GM said it had been asked by Consumers Energy, a unit of CMS Energy Corp, to suspend operations to allow the utility to manage supply issues after extreme cold temperatures and a fire at a compressor station.  It said workers were told not to report for the shifts at its Orion Assembly, Flint Assembly, Lansing Delta Township Assembly and Lansing Grand River Assembly plants, as well as other stamping and transmission plants on Wednesday evening and early Thursday. GM said it was still assessing when employees could return to work.  Workers at its Warren Tech Center were also told to stay home on Thursday. In a video message posted on Facebook, CMS Energy Chief Executive Patricia Poppe said large companies, including Fiat Chrysler, Ford Motor Co and GM, had agreed to “interrupt” production schedules through Friday to tackle the issue prompted by a fire at a Michigan facility and the record-breaking cold. Poppe said the usage cuts by large businesses were not enough, and urged 1.8 million Michigan customers to turn down thermostats as much as they could to cut natural gas use in order to protect critical facilities like hospitals and nursing homes. “I need you to take action right now,” she said. Ford Motor said it had also taken steps to reduce energy use at its four Michigan plants supplied by Consumers Energy, but added the situation remained fluid. A spokeswoman said it had reduced heating levels at Livonia Transmission and Van Dyke Transmission, stopped heat treatment processes at Sterling Axle and shut down the paint process at Michigan Assembly. Consumers Energy sent an alert to mobile phones in Michigan asking residents to reduce natural gas use. In a Twitter message, Consumers Energy warned that “without additional reductions, we run the risk of not being able to deliver natural gas to families and critical facilities across Michigan – a scenario none of us want to encounter.” Consumers Energy said a fire at a gas compressor station in Michigan’s Macomb County Wednesday forced it to halt gas flow from the compressor station until safety and damage assessments could be completed.

2019-01-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Iranian crude oil imports by Asia’s top four buyers dropped to the lowest volume in three years in 2018 amid U.S. sanctions on Tehran, but China and India stepped up imports in December after getting waivers from Washington. Asia’s top four buyers of Iranian crude - China, India, Japan and South Korea - imported a total 1.31 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, down 21 percent from the previous year, data from the countries showed. That was the lowest since about 1 million bpd in 2015, when a previous round of sanctions on Iran led to a sharp drop in Asian imports, Reuters data showed. The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil exports last November as it wants to negotiate a new nuclear deal with the country. U.S. officials have said they intend to reduce the Islamic Republic’s oil exports to zero. On a monthly basis, Asia’s imports from Iran rebounded to a three-month high of 761,593 bpd in December as China and India stepped up purchases after Washington granted eight countries waivers from the Iranian sanctions for 180 days from the start of November. “We expect Iranian exports to Asia to remain stable at around 800,000 barrels per day until May, when the waivers expire,” said Energy Aspects analyst Riccardo Fabiani. In December, China’s imports climbed above 500,000 bpd for the first time in three months, while India’s imports rose above 302,000 bpd. Japan and South Korea did not import any Iranian crude that month because they were still sorting out payment and shipping issues, but the countries have resumed oil lifting from Iran this month. During the 180-day period, China can import up to 360,000 bpd of Iranian oil, while India’s imports are restricted to 300,000 bpd. South Korea can import up to 200,000 bpd of Iranian condensate. “After May, it will all depend on the U.S. administration’s decisions, which at the moment remain completely obscure. On balance, they are likely to extend the current waivers, although rumours are that there could be a significant cut in waivered volumes,” Fabiani said. As a precaution, Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, is looking for an annual deal to buy U.S. crude as it seeks to broaden its oil purchasing options, its chairman said on Wednesday.

2019-01-31,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia’s west coast is facing hot, dry weather over the next three months, the country’s bureau of meteorology said on Thursday, denting the outlook for wheat production in the world’s fourth-largest exporter. There is only a 20 percent chance that the state of Western Australia will receive average rainfall between Feb. 1 and April 30, Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology said in its latest three-month outlook. It also forecast a 70 percent chance that the majority of Australia will experience above average temperatures over the same period. Western Australia is the country’s largest wheat growing region, producing up to half of the total harvest, and farmers will begin sowing crops in early April. “There is plenty of downside risk to production,” said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness analyst, National Australia Bank. “Western Australia produced a great crop last year because it had good pre-season rains. If the outlook materializes, all soil moisture will be eradicated,” he said. Australia’s official commodity forecaster will publish its first forecast for 2019/20 wheat production in March. Wheat output has suffered in recent years from dry weather along the country’s east coast, with 2018/19 production hitting a 10-year low despite a good crop in Western Australia. While some growers could decide to sow later in the hope of a break in the dry weather, late planting would increase the susceptibility of crops to harsh weather further into the season. Australia has had a run of hot weather. A record-breaking heat-wave across the southeast earlier this month triggered power outages in some areas and sent power prices soaring, while bushfires have destroyed homes in the southern island state of Tasmania.

2019-01-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government secretly shipped a large amount of deadly plutonium from a South Carolina site that produced the radioactive metal for nuclear bombs during the Cold War to Nevada, the Trump administration revealed on Wednesday. The Justice Department, on behalf of the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration, said in a notice filed with a U.S. court in Nevada that it could reveal the shipment of half a metric ton (1,100 pounds) because sufficient time had elapsed after the transfer to protect national security. The shipment occurred before November 2018. The U.S. court in Nevada has been considering an effort by the state of Nevada to stop planned shipments of a metric ton of plutonium from South Carolina, that the Energy Department announced last August.   The plutonium was shipped from the K-Reactor at the Savannah River Site, the oldest reactor at the facility, to the Device Assembly Facility at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site, about 70 miles (112.65 km) north of Las Vegas. The revelation angered politicians from Nevada, a sparsely populated state where the federal government has long wanted to store nuclear waste.  U.S. Senator Jack Rosen, a Democrat, said the NNSA misled a federal court “in a deceitful and unethical move, jeopardizing the health and safety of thousands of Nevadans and Americans who live in close proximity to shipment routes.”  She said she and other state politicians were prepared to take action against the NNSA.  Representative Dina Titus, another Nevada Democrat, said the shipments would bolster opposition to the storage of spent fuel from nuclear power plant in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, a project on which billions of dollars has been spent that was closed by former President Barack Obama.  The NNSA said that due to security reasons no public notice was given ahead of the shipment and the highway route was not revealed. The department did not reveal when the shipment was made, other than it occurred before November 2018, before Nevada had sued to stop the proposed shipments.   The United States built the Savannah River Site during the 1950s to produce basic materials for nuclear weapons, mostly tritium and plutonium-239. In October the Trump administration killed plans to convert 34 tons of plutonium there into mixed oxide or MOX fuel for a specialised nuclear power reactor that has never been built in the United States. Like the Obama administration before it, the Trump administration wants to dilute and bury that plutonium, potentially in New Mexico.

2019-01-31,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Stocks lifted as Fed signals potential end to rate hike cycle * Prospect of rate hikes ending weighs on dollar and bond yields By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Asia stocks rose to a four-month high on Thursday after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing global growth. The dollar struggled near a three-week trough against its major peers and U.S. Treasury yields were significantly lower as investors reacted to the Fed’s change in tone. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to its highest since Oct. 4 and was last up 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.9 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.8 percent despite data showing China’s factory activity contracted for a second straight month amid weakening orders. Australian stocks edged up 0.1 percent. The Fed on Wednesday held interest rates steady as expected, and also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates. The central bank said it would be “patient” before making any further moves amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth risks and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations. On Wall Street, the Dow and the Nasdaq rallied 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, on hopes the Fed’s pause would give the U.S. economy and corporate profits more room to run. Late in December the Dow had sunk to its lowest level since September 2017, dogged by factors including worries over cooling economic growth and trade tensions, adding pressure on the Fed to reassess its tightening bias. “The Fed’s statements firmly confirmed its dovish stance, which had already been on display at the start of the year. Market concerns towards the Fed’s rate hikes have now been put to rest,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The mention of the balance sheet by the Fed was a positive surprise. The focus now shifts immediately to U.S.-China trade talks, but the equity markets could have enough cushioning to withstand negative news from the talks.” The U.S. central bank also said on Wednesday that its balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected. However, while market expectations for Fed tightening may have waned significantly, some analysts suggested rate hikes still remained a near-term possibility. “While many of the risks to the U.S. outlook remain in place, there is little to suggest that the outlook has changed by as much as the Fed communication says it has,” wrote Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays. “We worry that the Fed has traded near-term support for financial markets and the economy for another round of volatility later this year if it is forced to lift rates higher, which remains more likely than not, in our view.” With the Fed decision out of the way, investors focused their attention on a pivotal round of high-level U.S.-China trade talks which began on Wednesday aimed at easing a months-long tariff war. The two-day talks in Washington are expected to be tense, with little indication so far that Chinese officials are willing to address core U.S. demands to fully protect American intellectual property rights and end policies that Washington has said force U.S. companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies struggled near a three-week low of 95.253 brushed on Wednesday, when it had sunk 0.5 percent. A weaker dollar helped nudge the euro to $1.1501 on Wednesday, its highest since Jan. 11, and the common currency was last up 0.15 percent at $1.1493. The greenback was down 0.15 percent at 108.88 yen and close to a two-week low of 108.81 reached overnight. The pound was steady at $1.3117, given some reprieve after slipping earlier in the week when British lawmakers voted down a proposal in parliament that could have prevented a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield extended its decline to as far as 2.674 percent, its lowest since Jan. 14. Oil prices rose after U.S. government data showed signs of tightening supply and as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.7 percent at 54.59 per barrel.

2019-01-31,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A blast of icy polar air brought dangerously low temperatures to the U.S. Midwest on Wednesday, causing at least three more deaths while halting mail delivery and forcing residents who pride themselves on their winter hardiness to huddle indoors. Classes were cancelled for Wednesday and Thursday for students across the Midwest, including Chicago, home of the nation’s third-largest school system, and police warned of the heightened risk of accidents on icy highways. Michigan said all state offices would remain closed through Thursday. In a rare move, the U.S. Postal Service appeared to set aside its credo that “neither snow nor rain ... nor gloom of night” would stop its work as it suspended deliveries from parts of the Dakotas through Ohio. At least a dozen deaths related to extreme cold weather have been reported since Saturday in Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota, according to officials and media reports.  Illinois State Police officers rescued 21 people who were stranded in a charter bus that broke down in sub-zero temperatures along Interstate 55 near Auburn after the vehicle’s diesel fuel turned to gel in its engine, according to the agency.  In Detroit, a 70-year-old man was found dead on Wednesday on a residential street, a Detroit police spokeswoman said. About 15 miles (24 km) south in the community of Ecorse, a former city councilman in his 70s and dressed only in sleepwear was also found dead on Wednesday, police there said. A University of Iowa student was found dead outside a building at the campus early on Wednesday, the school said in a statement. The death of Gerald Belz, a pre-med student, was believed to be weather-related. Streets in Chicago were nearly empty, with few people walking outside in the painfully cold air as temperatures hovered around 18 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 28 Celsius). “It’s terrible!” Pasquale Cappellano, a 68-year-old waiter, said as he smoked a cigarette while waiting outside for a bus on Chicago’s North Side. “I gotta pick up my medication at Walgreens or else I wouldn’t be out the door.” In Minneapolis, chilled to minus 14 F (minus 26 C), Brian Pierce ventured out to “embrace the elements” and found himself watching cars slipping on the roads. “The roads sound really weird, it seems there’s a lack of grip,” he said. “And my teeth hurt.” Wind-chill temperatures in parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes plunged as low as minus 42 F (minus 41 C) in Park Rapids, Minnesota, and to 31 degrees below zero F (minus 35 C) in Fargo, North Dakota, according to the National Weather Service (NWS). The frigid winds began to blow into the U.S. East Coast later on Wednesday, sending temperatures plunging there. More than a thousand flights, close to two-thirds of those scheduled, were cancelled on Wednesday into or out of Chicago O’Hare and Chicago Midway international airports, according to the flight tracking site FlightAware.  The Amtrak passenger rail service cancelled all trains in and out of Chicago on Wednesday. At the Morning Joy Farm in Mercer, North Dakota, Annie Carlson said her horses and sheep were doing fine.  “They can go into the barn if they wish,” she said. “They’re snuggled in, warm and toasty.” Her chickens, ducks and guinea hens were enjoying the 70-degree F (21 C) climate inside their greenhouse-like hoop house, she said. Andrew Orrison, a meteorologist with the NWS, said some of the coldest wind chills were recorded in International Falls, Minnesota, at minus 55 F (minus 48 C). Even the South Pole in Antarctica was warmer, with an expected low of minus 24 F (minus 31 C) with wind chill. Temperatures in Chicago will drop again “quite precipitously” on Wednesday night, Orrison said, potentially breaking the record low of minus 27 F (minus 33 C) on Jan. 21, 1985, the day of Ronald Reagan’s second presidential inauguration.  Banks and stores closed for business. Waste Management Inc, a major trash collection company, said it cancelled pickups in counties across the Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday. The bitter cold was caused by a displacement of the polar vortex, a stream of air that normally spins around the stratosphere over the North Pole but whose current was disrupted and was now pushing south. Officials opened warming centres across the Midwest, and in Chicago, police stations were open to anyone seeking refuge. Five city buses were also deployed to serve as mobile warming centres for homeless people, while city police handed out hats, jackets and blankets. The Chicago Police Department said it was urging people to get out of the cold. “But we will never force someone,” police officer Michael Carroll said. U.S. homes and businesses will likely use record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday, according to energy analysts. Some residents just to the north and northwest of the Twin Cities in Minnesota were asked by Xcel Energy to dial down their thermostats to 60 F (16 C) because of the strains on its natural gas supply system. The Michigan Agency for Energy said the state’s utility companies had agreed not to shut off gas or electric supplies to delinquent customers for the rest of the week.

2019-01-31,"CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House warned traders on Wednesday not to deal in Venezuelan gold or oil following its imposition of stiff sanctions aimed at forcing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power. National security adviser John Bolton tweeted that traders should not deal in gold, oil or other commodities “being stolen” from the Venezuelan people, as opponents of Maduro’s government worried that a Russian-operated plane had shipped gold out of Caracas on Wednesday afternoon. The White House said U.S. President Donald Trump spoke to Venezuela’s self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, by phone on Wednesday, reiterating support for his “fight to regain democracy.” On one side of the tussle for control of Venezuela, an OPEC member that has the world’s largest oil reserves but is in dire financial straits, Guaido and Western backers led by the United States are insisting on an immediate transition and fresh elections. On the other, Maduro, with backing from Russia, China and Turkey, says he will remain for his second six-year term despite accusations of fraud in his re-election last year and the economic meltdown. Venezuela’s struggle to pay its debts even to allies Russia and China amid a sharp drop in oil output has been exacerbated by the new sanctions, which will make it very hard to sell oil to its main client, the United States.  In that context, the arrival in Caracas of a Boeing 777 plane from Moscow on Monday led to speculation Maduro’s government was shipping more gold reserves out of the country, following shipments of $900 million of gold to Turkey last year. That was part of a strategy to increase the central bank’s liquidity. The flight, operated by Russia’s Nordwind Airlines, left Venezuela at 4.52 pm local time (2152 GMT), a Reuters witness said. Another Russian-operated flight, a Boeing 757 cargo plane, arrived at the airport an hour earlier via Cape Verde, according to publicly-available flight data. There are no routine flights between the two countries. Venezuelan lawmaker Jose Guerra, a former central bank economist, told the opposition-run National Assembly his understanding was that the Nordwind plane would take some gold reserves to Russia. The bank did not respond to a request for comment. Sources told Reuters private military contractors who do secret missions for Moscow were in Venezuela last week. Elliott Abrams, the recently-appointed U.S. envoy for Venezuela, said Washington was looking around the world for more assets of the Maduro government, including gold holdings and bank accounts. The Kremlin said this week it expected Venezuela to pay its debts. Russia, which like China has loaned and invested billions of dollars to OPEC member Venezuela, called on Guaido to drop his demand for a snap election and instead accept mediation. But given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue between the government and opposition, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time. Guaido’s envoy to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, said the only dialogue they were interested in would be a negotiation for Maduro’s departure and new elections. Government officials insist the next presidential election will be in 2025. Responding to a call by Guaido, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Venezuela on Wednesday, some waving Venezuelan flags while drivers of cars and buses honked in support. “I want this government to go, it has been a total humiliation for the country,” said Lucy Cordoba, 51, a government worker in the poor hillside town of Petare at the edge of the capital, where she said trash had not been collected for a year and water was scarce.  Cordoba said her children were among the more than 3 million Venezuelans who have left the country in the past couple of years. One went to Peru, and another to the Dominican Republic.    More than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the U.N. human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump and Guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after Venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to Guaido’s arrest. Abrams said action against Guaido would be “foolish.”  Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions. Wills Rangel, a board member of state oil company PDVSA, told Reuters the company was having problems unloading fuel imports because the sanctions were complicating payments. Maduro, 56, says Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. He told Moscow’s RIA news agency on Wednesday that Trump ordered “the government of Colombia and the Colombian mafia to kill me,” reprising an accusation of plots he has made over the years and which Bogota and Washington routinely deny. Maduro is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers and has made daily visits to troops. “Do you want to be a coward?” he yelled in a call and response session with hundreds of soldiers on Wednesday. “No, president,” they shouted back.

As Australia swelters in a protracted heat wave which has lasted weeks, distribution company Ausgrid said emergency crews were investigating the cause of the widespread outage, which is rare in the eastern beachside suburbs. Power was lost to homes and businesses in suburbs from beachfront Bondi to the well-heeled areas of Double Bay and Woollahra. Police warned drivers to take care with dozens of traffic lights blacked out. Ausgrid, which provides power to more than over 1.7 million customers down the east coast, later said power had been restored to 10,000 homes around Double Bay. Australia’s bureau of meteorology on Thursday warned hot dry weather could persist to the end of April, with a 70 percent chance the majority of the country will experience above average temperatures.

2019-01-31,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador brushed off a credit downgrade to state oil company Pemex, arguing on Wednesday that corruption is being eliminated from its ranks and the firm is stronger than it has been in 30 years. Rating agency Fitch on Tuesday downgraded Petroleos Mexicanos, the official name of the state oil and gas producer, which holds some $106 billion in financial debt.  At a regular news conference, Lopez Obrador lashed out at the ratings agency, saying Fitch was hypocritical because in the past it gave the firm positive reviews despite its problems. “They kept quiet and were complicit, and now that Pemex is recovering they come out with their recommendations and try to grade Pemex’s performance,” said the veteran leftist, who vowed to revive Pemex during his 2018 election campaign. The Fitch downgrade sent the peso currency tumbling on Wednesday morning before it pared losses. Rival ratings agency Moody’s will maintain Pemex’s credit rating in the first half of the year, its Senior Vice President Nymia Almeida said on Wednesday, while monitoring how the company performs under Lopez Obrador. “This government is coming with a very strong mandate to reduce expenses ... and this is just what the company needs,” she said at an energy conference in Mexico City, according to local media reports. “We won’t take any action until seeing the first half-year.” Pemex’s total debt load is the highest of any national oil company in Latin America, and a former executive said the downgrade would put pressure on the firm for now. “Pemex will face higher financial costs and its projects will get a little more expensive,” Carlos Morales, who served as Pemex’s exploration and production chief for a decade through 2014, told an oil conference in Mexico City. Lopez Obrador has promised to reverse Pemex’s dwindling output, and is pushing to stamp out rampant gasoline theft from the firm’s pipeline network that has caused significant losses. His plan to raise output, currently at about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), is mostly built on plans to pump more government money into exploration and production. Lopez Obrador also wants to build what would be Mexico’s biggest oil refinery on the southern Gulf coast. He has not detailed how his government will finance the project that he has said will cost around $8 billion, and has been a staunch critic of a landmark 2013-14 energy reform that opened up the Mexican oil industry to private investment. The reform ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly by allowing private producers to operate projects on their own, as well as enter into partnerships with Pemex known as farmouts. Alberto de la Fuente, Mexico country manager for Royal Dutch Shell Plc , told the conference after the Fitch downgrade that Lopez Obrador should reconsider the role of private companies. “If (Mexico) were carrying out more oil auction rounds, more (Pemex) farmouts, that could give positive signals to financial sector investors,” he said. “Pemex doesn’t have the means to do everything it wants to do and (private) capital could help.” Reporting by Anthony Esposito, David Alire Garcia and Lizbeth Diaz; Editing by Daniel Flynn, Marguerita Choy and Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-pemex/update-2-mexican-president-rejects-pemex-downgrade-touts-anti-graft-push-idUKL1N1ZU1GK,31 Jan 2019,"Mexican President Andres

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.41 per barrel at 0052 GMT, up 19 cents from their last settlement. WTI futures closed up 1.7 percent on Wednesday, when prices touched their highest since Nov. 21 at $54.93 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing up 2.2 percent in the previous session. “Oil prices rallied after the (Energy Information Administration) weekly report showed crude stockpiles rose less than expected,” said Edward Moya, market analyst at OANDA. “U.S. stockpiles may continue to fall as Saudi Arabia continues to trim exports to the U.S.” U.S. crude oil stockpiles climbed less than expected last week due to a drop in imports, while gasoline and distillate inventories fell as refiners slowed production, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories rose 919,000 barrels in the week to Jan. 25, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels.

2019-01-31,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Stocks lifted as Fed signals potential end to rate hike cycle * Prospect of rate hikes ending weighs on dollar and bond yields By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Asia stocks rose to a four-month high on Thursday, tracking Wall Street, after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle amid signs of slowing global growth. The dollar struggled near a three-week trough against its major peers and U.S. Treasury yields were significantly lower as investors reacted to the Fed’s change in tone. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose to its highest since Oct. 4 and was last up 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei rose 1.4 percent. Australian stocks added 0.4 percent, while South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.7 percent. The Fed on Wednesday held interest rates steady as expected, and also discarded its promises of “further gradual increases” in interest rates. The central bank said it would be “patient” before making any further moves amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth risks and impasses over trade and government budget negotiations. On Wall Street, the Dow and the Nasdaq rallied 1.7 percent and 2.2 percent, respectively, on hopes the Fed’s pause would give the U.S. economy and corporate profits more room to run. “The Fed’s statements firmly confirmed its dovish stance, which had already been on display at the start of the year. Market concerns towards the Fed’s rate hikes have now been put to rest,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “The mention of the balance sheet by the Fed was a positive surprise. The focus now shifts immediately to U.S.-China trade talks, but the equity markets could have enough cushioning to withstand negative news from the talks.” The U.S. central bank also said on Wednesday that its balance sheet would remain larger than previously expected. The United States and China opened a pivotal round of high-level two-day talks on Wednesday aimed at bridging deep differences over China’s intellectual property and technology transfer practices and easing a months-long tariff war. If the two sides cannot reach a deal soon, Washington has threatened to more than double tariffs on Chinese goods on March 2. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies struggled near a three-week low of 95.253 brushed on Wednesday, when it had sunk 0.5 percent. A weaker dollar helped nudge the euro to $1.1501 on Wednesday, its highest since Jan. 11, and the common currency was last up 0.1 percent at $1.1488. The greenback was down 0.1 percent at 108.96 yen and close to a two-week low of 108.81 reached overnight. The pound was a shade higher at $1.3123, given some reprieve after slipping earlier in the week when British lawmakers voted down a proposal in parliament that could have prevented a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield stood at 2.681 percent after sliding to 2.676 percent overnight, its lowest since Jan. 14. Oil prices rose after U.S. government data showed signs of tightening supply and as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. U.S. crude oil futures were up 0.46 percent at 54.48 per barrel.

2019-01-31,"UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Three days after proclaiming himself Venezuela’s head of state, Juan Guaido wrote to the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asking for help in tackling the country’s urgent humanitarian crisis. But Venezuela’s seat at the 193-member world body is held by President Nicolas Maduro’s government and Guterres is unable to ramp up a humanitarian response in Venezuela without Maduro’s approval or U.N. Security Council authorization. “The United Nations are ready to increase their activities in Venezuela in the areas of humanitarian assistance and development,” Guterres told Guaido in a letter dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. “For that, the United Nations need, however, the consent and cooperation of the Government.” The exchange illustrates how a U.S.-led campaign for international recognition of Guaido over Maduro has left the U.N. and other international organizations caught in the middle of global division over the issue. Most Latin American countries, Canada and European nations have recognized Guaido or are on the verge of doing so. But these rapid endorsements have triggered angry responses from Russia, China and a few left-leaning Latin American states, and wariness from some African and Caribbean nations. Guterres noted that in his relations with U.N. member states he respects “the decisions of the intergovernmental bodies, particularly the General Assembly and the Security Council.” The General Assembly allows each U.N. nation one vote, while the five permanent members of the Security Council, charged with maintaining international peace, include Russia and China. The international split is also hampering swift decisions at other multilateral groups like the Washington-headquartered International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, whose recognition of the Guaido government could eventually help get sorely-needed loans to Venezuela. Maduro’s government has denied that there is a humanitarian crisis in the country, blaming economic problems on sanctions. Venezuela is struggling with hunger, preventable diseases and hyperinflation forecast at 10 million percent in 2019. The quickest way for a country or countries to try and deprive Maduro’s government of Venezuela’s U.N. seat would be to present a draft resolution to the General Assembly for a vote. However, diplomats said that such a move could not currently garner the majority support needed to be successful. “We do think there will be appropriate resolutions when the time is right and we’ll certainly support those. They won’t come just from us, they’ll come from other nations who care deeply abut the Venezuelan people as well,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at the U.N. on Saturday. Maduro was sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term in office after elections last year that were widely dubbed illegitimate, while Guaido took the helm of the elected National Assembly earlier this month and on Jan. 23 proclaimed himself the country’s rightful leader. A heated Security Council meeting on Saturday revealed the bitter divide over the crisis. When asked about the possibility of a showdown over Venezuela’s U.N. seat, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Maduro’s government was legitimate and there was no need to challenge its credentials. The U.N. has previously had to address competing claims for representation at the world body. In September 2011, the General Assembly approved a Libyan request to accredit envoys of the country’s interim government as Tripoli’s sole representatives at the world body, effectively recognizing the National Transitional Council. The move came after the United States, Russia, China and European nations had all recognized that council. So far, Guaido has named envoys to Washington and the Organization of American States regional bloc. If he decided to name a U.N. envoy, such a request would traditionally be sent to Guterres and then considered by a nine-member credentials committee, which includes the United States, Russia and China. The IMF and World Bank could eventually test support for Guaido through a straw poll of member countries that make up their respective executive boards, according to several bank and fund officials. The United States is the largest and most influential member country in both organizations. Latin America’s largest lender, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), could be the first financial institution to put the issue before its board - even as soon as next week, according to some officials. Several board officials, however, cautioned that the membership was divided and there was no consensus on how to proceed. Still, recognition by global lenders of Guaido will not automatically unlock multilateral funding any time soon, officials said. Venezuela is $212 million in arrears to the IADB and was censured by the IMF last year for failing to provide economic data to the fund. “It is not obvious what the U.N. is going to do, much less what the IMF would do,” said James Boughton, the IMF’s former historian, now at the Center for International Governance Innovation. “It would be up to a member country to request the acknowledgement of a new government, in this case it would come from the U.S.,” said Boughton. When that happens, “then it is just a question of a simple majority decision by the executive board,” citing IMF rules.

2019-01-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - British car production fell by 9 percent last year, the biggest drop since the 2008-9 recession, and investment slumped by nearly half due to fears about Brexit, an industry body said on Thursday. The once runaway autos sector, which employs some 850,000 people in Britain and has been lauded by politicians as a rare manufacturing success story, has seen sales, company spending and output slump since 2016, the year of the Brexit referendum. Volumes have also been hit by a crackdown on diesel, stricter emissions rules disrupting supply and a slowdown in China, the world’s no. 1 autos market, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said.   Britain, the world’s fifth-largest economy, is due to leave the EU, the globe’s biggest trading bloc, without an agreement on March 29 after lawmakers rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal, prompting fears of major disruption. Last year saw the biggest drop in production since a slump of nearly a third in 2009 following the financial crisis and the fall in investment to 589 million pounds leaves it at the lowest level since the SMMT started compiling figures in 2012.  “Brexit uncertainty has already done enormous damage to output, investment and jobs,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes, calling on the government to avoid a no-deal exit. “Yet this is nothing compared with the permanent devastation caused by severing our frictionless trade links overnight, not just with the EU but with the many other global markets with which we currently trade freely.”  Output is expected to fall another 3 percent this year based on Britain leaving the EU with a deal followed by a transitional period.  Britain’s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover, which has been hit by a slump in demand from China and for diesel models, recorded a 15.6 percent drop in domestic output, while Nissan, which runs Britain’s largest car factory, fell by 10.7 percent. A series of investment decisions are coming up, including whether Peugeot’s parent company PSA will keep its Ellesmere Port plant open, where staffing will fall to just 850 people by the end of 2019 after a series of job cuts.  Output there fell by 15.9 percent last year, the biggest decline of any of Britain’s six big carmakers.  PSA will also decide later this year on whether to build electric vans at its southern English Luton facility and petrochemicals firm Ineos is choosing the location for its off-roader.  The Chinese Geely-owned London Electric Vehicle Company, which builds the famous London black taxi, is cutting 70 agency staff at its central English plant, around 20 percent of its line-side workforce. “Given the global headwinds, the challenges to the sector are immense,” said Hawes.

2019-01-31,"(Adds earlier Bolton tweet, background) WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - White House national security adviser John Bolton said he had a “very productive meeting” on Wednesday with Citgo’s executive team, two days after Washington slapped sanctions on the company’s parent, Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. “The United States is continuing to work to make sure that the economic benefits of Venezuela’s resources are not pilfered by (President Nicolas) Maduro and his cronies.
