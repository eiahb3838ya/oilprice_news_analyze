2018-08-24,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean government on Friday said it had closed some facilities at state-run energy firm ENAP’s port on the country’s central coastline after hundreds of people were treated with symptoms of intoxication following a gas leak. The leak occurred on Thursday close to the port of Ventanas, 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Santiago, the government said in a statement. Residents, including children at a nearby school, sought medical attention for nausea and vomiting, according to media reports, prompting an investigation. “We have been able to determine that ENAP was conducting some work that could have resulted in the emission of these toxic gases,” Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt said in a statement.  The ministry earlier said it had shut down operations at ENAP. In a later statement, it clarified that it had shut down facilities only at ENAP’s port suspected of potentially leaking gas. ENAP said in a statement it had conducted an investigation but thus far found no evidence it was responsible for the gas leak. “We will continue doing the investigations necessary to eliminate any doubts,” ENAP said.

2018-08-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices gained more than 1 percent on Friday, ending a run of weekly declines on signs that Iran sanctions may limit global supply and that a trade war may not curb China’s appetite for U.S. crude.  Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled up $1.09 a barrel, or 1.5 percent, at $75.82 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 was up 89 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $68.72.  U.S. crude rose more than 4 percent on the week, after seven consecutive declines, and Brent rose 5.3 percent after three weeks of falling prices.  “Both crude markers are on track to end a steady run of weekly declines. This is largely due to a tightening fundamental outlook on the back of looming Iranian supply shortages,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. Concerns that an escalating trade war between China and the U.S. could slow economic growth and weigh on crude purchases  eased slightly after sources told Reuters that China’s Unipec will resume purchases of U.S. crude oil in October, after a two-month halt due to the fight. Worries that Mexico’s incoming administration would not strike a bilateral agreement over NAFTA with the U.S. also weighed on the market, traders said. A dispute over opening up the oil and gas sector is weighing on the talks, Bloomberg reported, citing two people familiar with negotiations.  At the same time, concerns about global crude supply intensified with signs that U.S. sanctions on Iran are curbing shipments. The U.S. government reimposed sanctions on Iran this month after withdrawing from a 2015 international nuclear deal, which Washington saw as inadequate for curbing Tehran’s activities in the Middle East and denying it the means to make an atomic bomb. Tehran says it has no ambitions to make such a weapon. Iran is the third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, supplying around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude and condensate to markets this year, equivalent to about 2.5 percent of global consumption. “Third-party reports indicate that Iranian tanker loadings are already down by around 700,000 bpd in the first half of August relative to July, which if it holds will exceed most expectations,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday. “We expect that by Q4 the market will be dealing with either undersupply, dwindling spare capacity - or both,” it added. Energy consultancy FGE says it expects Iran’s crude and condensate exports to drop below 1 million bpd by mid-2019.

2018-08-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose on Friday after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank’s policies are best to keep the economy humming, spurring new highs on Wall Street, while oil surged on signs Iran sanctions may crimp worldwide supply.

2018-08-24,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A vessel hauling a shipment of coal from the United States switched its destination on Friday to South Korea from China, according to ship tracking data, a day after China imposed 25 percent tariffs on the U.S. fuel.  The Underdog was loaded with 63,000 metric tonnes of coal on July 23 in Long Beach, California, and sailed to China, where it arrived off the coast of Nanshan on Aug. 17. It spent a week idling off the Chinese coast before departing for Yeosu, South Korea, where it is expected to arrive on Aug. 28, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data.  The Underdog was one of several U.S. cargoes that have rerouted amid the U.S. trade dispute with China. Last month, a coal cargo on the Navios Taurus shifted to Singapore after originally heading to China.  On Thursday, the U.S. levied 25 percent tariffs on Chinese goods including semiconductors, plastics and railway equipment. China responded with tariffs on goods valued at a similar $16 billion, including oil, coal and steel products and medical equipment.     U.S. coal exports to China dropped in July, with only two other tankers, the Navios Altair I and Glory, departing from California to China, and carrying a combined 128,000 metric tonnes of coal. No ship with U.S. coal departed for China in August, Thomson Reuters data show.  The United States shipped 3.2 million tonnes of coal to China last year, up from less than 700 tonnes in 2016, making it China’s seventh largest supplier.

2018-08-24,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will scrap import controls on solar panels and cells from China in September, rejecting a request from EU producers who argue that the bloc will be opening its doors to a flood of dumped products. The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, proposed dismissing the request for an “expiry review” and received backing from a majority of the EU’s 28 countries, according to EU sources familiar with the discussions. The European Union first imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures for Chinese solar panels, wafers and cells in 2013 and extended them in March 2017 by 18 months, signalling that they should then end. Chinese manufacturers are allowed to sell solar products in Europe free of duties if they do so at or above a minimum price that has progressively declined. If sold for less than that price, they are subject to duties of up to 64.9 percent. The European Union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of EU manufacturers and those such as importers and installers pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation. It has also been concerned about the response from Beijing given the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in 2013. EU ProSun, the grouping of EU producers that launched the initial complaint in 2012, had said there were good reasons for measures to be prolonged. Beijing’s decision to limit installations meant Chinese producers had some 30 gigawatts of excess capacity to shift with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the United States and planned by India, the second and third largest markets behind China. The total EU market is some 7 gigawatts. “Only the EU is at the same time irresponsibly dropping all measures and inviting Chinese producers to eliminate European and third-country competition in the EU market,” EU ProSun president Milan Nitzschke said, adding some companies were considering a legal challenge at the European Court of Justice.  SolarPower Europe, which represents those in the solar industry opposed to duties, has referred to Commission and EY studies indicating demand could increase by up to 30 percent, creating about 45,000 jobs if the measures were removed.

2018-08-24,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore-listed Noble Group Ltd (NOBG.SI) faces a make-or-break shareholders’ meeting on Monday as investors vote on a $3.5 billion debt restructuring plan that its creditors and board say is vital to prevent insolvency. The company, once a global commodity trader with ambitions to rival Glencore (GLEN.L) or Vitol, has shrunk to an Asian-centric business focused on coal and freight trading after it slashed hundreds of jobs and sold prized assets to cut debt. Noble, whose market value has been nearly wiped out from $6 billion in February 2015, is expected to win the required simple majority of voters in attendance at the meeting, said multiple sources familiar with the matter. Equity owners include China Investment Corp and Abu Dhabi fund Goldilocks Investment Co Ltd. Noble did not immediately respond to a request for a comment on the vote.      Noble already has majority support from its creditors and the backing of 30 percent of its shareholders such as founder Richard Elman, who stepped down as chairman last year. Under the debt-for-equity swap, it plans to halve its debt after surrendering 70 percent of control to its senior creditors, mainly made up of hedge funds, while existing shareholders’ stakes will dwindle to 20 percent and its management would get 10 percent. “The expectation is for the restructuring to be passed as Noble needs a simple majority at the meeting,” said Neel Gopalakrishnan, credit strategist at DBS Group. “It would come as a big surprise if it doesn’t come through.”  Noble’s accounting came under scrutiny in February 2015 when a former employee, Arnaud Vagner, started to publish reports anonymously under the name of Iceberg Research, alleging Noble inflated the prices of derivative contracts the company held to appear more profitable. Noble has always stood by its accounts. As Noble’s shares and bonds plunged after the allegations, the company lost its investment grade rating, took billions of dollars in impairment losses and lost access to funding. It also changed its chief executive officers. (GRAPHIC: The rise & fall of Noble Group  - tmsnrt.rs/2P2OQZm) Desperate to slash debt, Noble sold a string of assets but this was not enough to run a trading business where profit margins are tiny. It posted a record $4.9 billion loss for 2018 and then defaulted on its debt in March. “It’s just impossible in commodity trading to operate with so high interest costs. It is what people are once again going to realise,” Vagner told Reuters, referring to the restructured Noble. “Is the new team more competent than the previous one? No: It’s the same. The share price is down 99 percent with this management,” he said by email. Noble’s restructuring plan gained ground in June 2018 after it won over a key shareholder with a sweetened offer. If Noble does not obtain shareholders’ approval, it will seek to implement a similar restructuring to keep the firm as a going concern but that plan does not provide for shareholders to receive any equity in the new company. Analysts are still wary of the new company’s prospects. “While its current debt problems will be temporarily fixed post-restructuring, it will need ready access to trade financing which is critical to its business,” said Brayan Lai, analyst at Bondcritic, who publishes on independent research platform Smartkarma. Noble’s ability to make profits on a sustainable basis would be the main challenge for its remaining business, said Annisa Lee, head of Asia ex-Japan’s flow credit analysis at Nomura.

2018-08-24,"* Maintenance at Wheatstone, disruption at Sakhalin curb supply * New buyers from Bangladesh, Thailand boost demand * Japan still buying spot cargoes By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices rose for the second straight week to their highest in over two months, buoyed by stable demand ahead of winter and as some producers curbed supply due to maintenance or disruption at plants. Spot prices for October LNG-AS delivery in Asia rose to $11.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) this week, up 30 cents from the week before, industry sources said. Prices for November delivery are pegged at about $12.15 per mmBtu, widening the inter-month spread, they added. Planned maintenance at Australia’s Wheatstone LNG plant and a disruption at the Sakhalin-2 LNG project in the far east of Russia are expected to tighten supply in the coming week, traders said. Sakhalin Energy halted a production line at Sakhalin-2 on Saturday, but expects output to be restored in the coming days. While the issue is not expected to have any serious impact on exports as some supply can be replaced with volumes in storage, the loading of some cargoes could be delayed, said a source close to the matter. Demand from new buyers is also supporting LNG prices in the region. State-run Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) is looking to directly import LNG for the first time, as part of a government plan to boost competition in the power sector, while Bangladesh has started operations at the country’s first LNG terminal. Elsewhere, Japanese importers are continuing to buy in the spot market, though purchases have slowed from previous weeks when scorching weather had bolstered imports, a second trader said. Japan’s Kyushu Electric Power Co may have purchased a spot cargo for August or September at $11.20 to $11.30 per mmBtu, traders said, though this could not immediately be confirmed. “It seems that Japanese buyers have almost completed their procurement until October,” said a Japan-based industry source. “Although the heat came back again for a few days, because the summer is almost over, I think Japanese buyers will be not so active for a while.” All sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. Energy companies do not typically comment on commercial deals. Angola LNG has offered a cargo for the first-half of October in a tender that closed on Thursday, but results were not immediately available, traders said. Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (Kufpec), a unit of Kuwait’s state-run oil group, has sold a September-loading cargo from Wheatstone LNG to Japan’s JERA at $10.50 to $11 per mmBtu, traders said, though this could not be confirmed. Meanwhile, Indian Oil Corp is seeking two cargoes for delivery in March and June next year, with Gail India looking for a cargo for delivery in the second-half of September, traders said.

2018-08-24,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Unipec will resume purchases of U.S. crude oil in October after a two-month halt due to the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies, three sources with knowledge of the matter said.  The decision to start buying crude oil again from the United States comes after Beijing earlier in August excluded it from its import tariff list.  A source with knowledge of the matter said Unipec will “buy some U.S. crude, loading in October, following the change in Beijing’s policy.”  “Unipec’s imports shrunk when China retaliated by putting crude oil on the tariff list but now it is coming back to normal business with import volumes recovering,” a second source said.  The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss commercial deals with media.  Unipec did not respond to a request for comment.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil exports to China - tmsnrt.rs/2P4zVOn) Unipec, the trading arm of Asia’s biggest refiner Sinopec (600028.SS) and also one of the largest buyers of U.S. oil, stopped loading American crude in August and September after Beijing announced in June that it plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on crude oil imports from the United States.  Following lobbying by Sinopec, crude was dropped from China’s final tariff list earlier in August, allowing Unipec to resume importing U.S. oil, the sources said.  It was not clear how much U.S. oil Unipec would buy. U.S oil takes about 1-1/2 months to reach China, which means cargoes loaded in October would arrive in November or December.  It also was not clear, however, whether all of the U.S. crude bought by Sinopec would end up in China.  A third source said the October cargoes were meant for third-party trading, meaning they may be sold on and end up in other countries.  Before the trade dispute broke out, China overtook Canada as the largest importer of U.S. crude in the first five months this year, importing an average of nearly 350,000 barrels per day, data from U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.  The resumption of U.S. oil purchases may not last long, however.  U.S. and Chinese talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute ended on Thursday with no breakthrough, and both countries instead activated another round of tariffs on $16 billion worth of each other’s goods.  Many analysts expect U.S. crude to be hit with tariffs eventually should no solution be found.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open mixed, with Britain’s FTSE dipping 0.15 percent, Germany’s DAX rising 0.1 percent and France’s CAC edging up 0.05 percent. U.S. and Chinese officials ended two days of talks on Thursday with no major breakthrough. At the same time, their trade war escalated with another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country’s goods taking effect. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.25 percent. It was still up about 1 percent on the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.55 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.35 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.15 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.65 percent, lifted by a weaker yen. “Global risk sentiment remains somewhat jittery ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech with U.S.-Sino trade talks failing to yield any immediate progress,” strategists at OCBC Bank wrote. The S&P 500 shed 0.17 percent overnight to pull back slightly from a record high scaled midweek, with industrial shares sagging after the United States and China imposed a fresh round of trade tariffs on each other. Shares of industrial giants Caterpillar Inc and Boeing Co, bellwethers of trade confidence, were among the biggest drags on the Dow, which lost about 0.3 percent. Caterpillar shares fell 2.0 percent, and Boeing shares fell 0.7 percent. In immediate focus was the speech by the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to be given later on Friday at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, meeting of central bankers. Where Powell stands on the pace of interest rate hikes will be scrutinised after minutes from the Fed’s most recent policy meeting indicated the central bank would tighten monetary policy soon. “For equities, the key point will be whether Powell indicates that the Fed is poised to hike rates two more times this year. That would fall in line with expectations and not cause much of a stir,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “Any mention of recent turbulence in the emerging markets may also provide the risk asset markets with some relief.” U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his displeasure with the Fed’s rate hikes earlier this week and investors waited to see whether Powell would respond to such criticism. The Fed should raise rates further this year and probably next year as well, despite Trump’s opposition to tighter policy, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in interviews aired on Thursday. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also said Trump’s comments would not affect the central bank’s decision making. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 95.567, holding most of its gains after rising 0.55 percent overnight to snap a six-day losing run. The greenback extended its overnight surge to touch a two-week high of 111.49 yen. The euro was 0.15 percent higher at $1.1553 after retreating 0.5 percent the previous day. The Australian dollar received some respite after Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison won a ruling party leadership vote, paving the way for him to become the country’s next prime minister and ending a week of political uncertainty. The Aussie was up 0.4 percent at $0.7277. On Thursday, it slumped 1.4 percent as Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull faced challenges to his leadership. Onshore Chinese yuan slipped 0.2 percent to 6.8916 per dollar, its weakest in a week. Oil prices edged higher. While the trade conflict between Washington and Beijing darkens the economic outlook, the supply versus demand position in oil markets remains relatively tight -especially because of the looming U.S. sanctions against Iran. Brent crude futures rose 0.45 percent to $75.07 per barrel , while U.S. crude added 0.6 percent to $68.25. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-08-24,"Aug 23 (Reuters) - Federal emergency managers got an unusual head start preparing for Hurricane Lane, with key personnel and supplies deployed well ahead of the storm in response to a flurry of disaster threats to Hawaii in recent months, officials said on Thursday. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had already established an operational presence on Oahu and Kauai after widespread flooding across those islands in April, and on Hawaii’s Big Island during the eruption of Kilauea Volcano that began in May. FEMA started moving additional supplies to Hawaii again in advance of Hurricane Hector, which skirted past the Pacific U.S. archipelago state more than a week ago, agency spokeswoman Veronica Verde told Reuters by phone from Honolulu. “We have already shipped meals-ready-to-eat, and also water and generators to all four (Hawaii) counties and prepositioned them for Hector” in distribution centers, with more provisions set to arrive ahead of Lane, she said. FEMA is also following a revised play book in the aftermath of catastrophic damage and loss of life wreaked by Hurricane Maria last year in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, according to FEMA chief Brock Long. The strategy calls for getting generators in place before the storm hits so they can immediately restore electricity for basic needs, including power to restart local water systems, Long told reporters at a briefing in Washington. “It’s not just providing food and water. If you fix the power first, you solve 90 percent of the problems,” Long said. Verde said FEMA has also “pushed more of our commodities forward in preparation for this hurricane” than it has in the past. FEMA was harshly criticized in the wake of Maria as having been too slow to recognize the gravity of the devastation to Puerto Rico and too sluggish in providing disaster relief to the Caribbean island. For Lane, which had threatened for days to become the first major hurricane to plow directly through the Hawaiian islands since 1992, FEMA “embedded” its own liaison officers in the emergency operations centers of state and local authorities for close coordination. FEMA has also sent in urban search-and-rescue teams, along with two disaster medical teams, personnel from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other specialists for transportation, communications and hazardous waste management, she said. In one other change since the Hurricane Maria calamity in Puerto Rico, Verde said FEMA has worked more closely with private-sector suppliers - such as big-box retail outlets - to arrange for emergency distribution of food, communications equipment and other provisions that might be needed.

2018-08-24,"HONOLULU, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Hurricane Lane, a powerful Category 3 storm, spun slowly north out of the Pacific toward Hawaii on Friday, causing torrential downpours and catastrophic flooding on the Big Island. The greatest threat from wind and rain shifted to Maui overnight and then to Oahu, the U.S. state’s most populous island, through Friday, the National Weather Service said. Hurricane conditions were possible over Kauai into Saturday, according to forecasts. More than 2 feet (60 cm) of rain had already fallen on a few areas on the windward side of the Big Island, the weather service said, and peak gusts of up to 67 miles (108 km) per hour were recorded there. “There’s lots and lots of rain, torrential rain, with a lot of moisture in the atmosphere,” weather service meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said early on Friday. “We’re in it now.” There were no reports of injuries on the Hawaiian Islands, but flash floods and landslides closed some roads. “Life threatening flash floods. This is a very dangerous situation. Avoid unnecessary travel,” Hawaii Governor David Ige warned on Twitter. While Lane has been downgraded to Category 3 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, but out at sea it still packed maximum sustained winds of 120 mph (195 kph), the service said in an advisory early on Friday. As of 2 a.m. Hawaii time (8 a.m. EDT/1200 GMT), Lane was moving north at 5 mph (8 kph) and was about 200 miles (320 km) south of Honolulu, the service said. It was forecast to turn west on Saturday, lose some of its punch but move more quickly. Evacuations were underway on parts of Molokai and Maui islands, and some social media users reported power outages. On the island of Maui, tourists were advised to avoid a popular attraction called the Seven Sacred Pools, a scenic cluster of waterfalls and grottos. The latest predictions from the weather service’s National Hurricane Center showed the eye of the storm glancing past Maui and several other islands later on Friday on its way to Oahu. But authorities warned the islands could still expect to be hit hard. “We’re telling everybody to take the storm seriously, make your final preparations, and be prepared to ride out what is going to be a prolonged rain event,” said Andrew Pereira, communications director for the city and county of the state capital, Honolulu. In Maui, video footage showed whipping palm trees and darkening skies. In Honolulu’s Manoa Valley neighborhood, sidewalks typically full of joggers and dog walkers were empty late on Thursday as residents stood outside their homes watching the skies, and businesses closed early for the day. In addition to “life-threatening and damaging surf,” the weather service has warned that storm surges could raise water levels 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 metres) above normal along the western shores of the Big Island and that extreme rainfall could mean numerous evacuations and rescues. Governor Ige has urged residents to set aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicine. All public schools, University of Hawaii campuses and nonessential government offices on the islands of Oahu and Kauai were closed at least through Friday. Oil company Par Pacific Holdings Inc said it had shut its 93,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Kapolei due to the storm. The Coast Guard had ordered all harbors to close to incoming vessels and the Navy moved most of its fleet out of Pearl Harbor, where ships could provide aid after the storm. In the event of outages, Hawaii’s power company, Hawaiian Electric Co, will largely be in charge of restoring power, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Brock Long told reporters on Friday, adding that the company is well prepared to fix any problems to the energy grid. The federal government will have the responsibility of facilitating “mutual aid agreements,” he said, including jobs like getting equipment and teams from the continental United States to locations where they are needed. “They’re called disasters because stuff is broken after the fact, Long said. “And citizens need to realize we’re looking at major hurricane impacts. “And we need to set the expectations that the power could go off for quite some time, and the infrastructure’s going to be heavily impacted.” (Reporting by Jolyn Rosa; additional reporting by Brendan O’Brien in Milwaukee and Makini Brice in Washington; writing by Daniel Wallis; editing by Jonathan Oatis)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/storm-lane/torrential-rain-howling-winds-as-hurricane-lane-nears-hawaii-idUKL2N1VF09O,24 Aug 2018,"Hurricane Lane, a powerful

2018-08-24,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov said on Friday he would like major Russian firms to invest in social projects rather than pay higher taxes, weeks after he proposed raising 500 billion rubles ($7.5 billion) a year from metal and mining firms. President Vladimir Putin ordered the government to discuss Belousov’s proposal to levy a windfall tax. Putin has himself not taken a public stance on it, but the proposal triggered a sell-off in metal and mining shares. Russia needs extra budget revenue to meet economic goals set out by Putin when he began a new six-year term in the Kremlin in May. The government has already announced plans to raise value-added tax from 2019 and increase the retirement age. Speaking after government talks with business leaders on the proposals on Friday, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said the tax burden on businesses would remain unchanged, in line with levels discussed and agreed earlier this year. Siluanov and the economy and industry ministers have opposed a windfall tax.  Belousov, who also attended the meeting, said top firms have benefited from a weak rouble, which has been falling under pressure from new U.S. sanctions imposed in April.  These firms “understand that they have to support social projects without harming themselves, their employees and shareholders”, Belousov said.  He said the idea of “extracting” (revenues) from companies is now off the table, adding that firms should invest in “infrastructure, environmental issues, the cyber economy, and the creation of technologies”. Asked about the amount of funds major firms could invest in such projects, Belousov said it would be a “very good achievement” if businesses could spend up to 200 billion or 300 billion rubles.  “The funds we discussed today ... will be invested by firms in projects they are interested in. The government will support, help and tell them which directions for investment are interesting,” Siluanov said.

2018-08-24,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors bought back into U.S. stocks this week which set their longest-ever market rally, although risks ahead spurred anxiety over how much longer the ageing bull can last, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday. They also declared the end of a “tsunami” of tech fund inflows which have driven the market higher, noting tiny inflows of $0.1 billion this week after a huge $22 billion plowed into tech year-to-date.  Some $2.6 billion flowed into equities funds and $0.5 billion left bond funds as investors’ risk appetite recovered slightly, while $1.2 billion flooded out of gold funds, strategists said, using figures from flows data provider EPFR. The S&P 500 .SPX extended its bull run to 3,453 days on Wednesday, the longest such streak in history by calculations which set the rally's birth at March 9, 2009. BAML strategists, however, weren’t particularly impressed, dubbing it an “old, deflationary, polarized U.S. bull” in a note titled “The Old Bull and the Sea” in a nod to Ernest Hemingway’s classic.  They argued the S&P 500 is narrow, dominated by Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google whose total market cap of around $4.1 trillion is greater than the combined market cap of the smallest 283 stocks in the index. Still, overall inflows this week indicated a hesitant return to risk and BAML’s “Bull & Bear” indicator of market sentiment drifted up to 3.3 this week from 3 last week.  “Late summer sentiment slowly drifts from bearish toward neutral,” strategists noted.  U.S. equity funds drew in $4.1 billion, leading other regions by far as outstanding earnings growth, spurred by tax cuts, set U.S. stocks apart. European equity funds suffered a 24th straight week of outflows, losing $1.1 billion. Since March they have given back all $51 billion of the inflows of 2016 to 2018, strategists noted.  Emerging markets, in contrast, have not seen outflows as severe as that, with less than 20 percent of EM debt and equity inflows over 2016-2018 redeemed in the past four months, BAML strategists found.  This week investors pulled just $0.1 billion from EM stocks, while EM debt saw its biggest outflows in eight weeks ($1.6 billion).  Outside tech, sector flows showed a distinct preference for “defensive” high dividend, strong earning sectors with inflows to real estate, healthcare and utilities. Cycle-sensitive financials, energy and materials sectors saw outflows. In debt markets, flows into investment-grade bond funds picked up again with $0.5 billion, while high-yield bond outflows lessened, losing just $0.5 billion.  Gold is a contrarian buy, strategists suggested, after funds invested in the precious metal saw their biggest outflows since December 2016 this week, bringing outflows over the past three months to $7 billion. This autumn presents a fork in the road for markets - with the possibility of severe negative shocks as well as a more positive path.  Credit contagion caused by monetary tightening, excess debt and a peak in the profit cycle could cause widening spreads in EM debt to hit European high yield and U.S. investment grade, strategists said, recommending a short in high-yield bonds in this scenario. A second possible shock could come from an autumn of “hardball politics”, they said, with Brexit developments, Italy’s budget, and China-U.S. trade disputes weighing on global purchasing managers’ surveys and earnings forecasts.  A sweep by Democrats in mid-term elections could spur a switch to “populist redistribution”, they predicted, for example tightening stock buyback regulation. The best trade in that eventuality would be to short U.S. tech, they said.  Among positive catalysts a peak in U.S. inflation, the U.S. 10-year bond yield edging below 2.5 percent, and China stimulus could help drive EM and European earnings estimates higher, in which case investors should hold EM and European banks.  An acceleration in U.S. stock buybacks would also help spur markets, providing a new injection of liquidity akin to quantitative easing, strategists said.  In 2018 so far 35 percent of U.S. profits are being spent on buybacks - not far from the peak of 38 percent in 2007.

2018-08-24,"MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - On a scorching August afternoon, an angry crowd besieged a mini-truck loaded with meat of two slaughtered cows amidst the ruins of what was the last Islamic State (IS) bastion in Mosul. In a desperate scramble, they grabbed beef from a man standing in the open back of the truck and, after it pulled away, some stayed on to descend on the next one to arrive. Part of an annual ritual of Eid al-Adha celebrations, the deliveries did little to satisfy people living in the rubble of Mosul’s Old City more than a year after IS was ousted in a final battle reduced many inhabitants to homeless beggars. “There are many residents who need aid in getting food and rebuilding their houses,” 24-year-old Ali Sharif said on Thursday after taking a plastic bag with meat from one of the cars. “Everyone here was affected by war.”  Since Iraqi forces celebrated victory over IS, life for the Sunni Muslim inhabitants of ancient west Mosul, some of whom welcomed IS’s arrival in 2014, has hardly improved. That has left them no happier with the Shi’ite-led government in Baghdad they long accused of treating them like second-class citizens. “We will give this to the poor people here to help them and we ask God to bless us. Our government doesn’t do anything (to help them),” Ali Aga, a local logistics specialist, said as he headed into a labyrinth of alleyways in Mosul’s ancient Old City to knock on doors and hand over packets of fresh beef. Many of the Old City’s narrow streets remain inundated by wreckage left by the air strikes of U.S.-led coalition forces that helped Iraqi government forces drive out IS after nine months of devastating urban warfare. The remains of some walls look like they are about to collapse. Decayed body parts can still be seen, and smelled, amidst the debris where the most severe fighting raged west of the River Tigris that bisects Iraq’s second city. To help towns laid to waste in fighting that broke IS’s grip on a third of Iraq, Baghdad set up the Reconstruction Fund for Areas Affected by Terroristic Operations (ReFAATO).  The reconstruction plan for Mosul and the whole of surrounding Nineveh governorate targeted 78 projects for 2017-2018 worth 75.5 billion Iraqi dinars (£49.2 million), supplemented by a 135-million-euro (£121.8 million) loan from Germany, according to ReFAATO figures published on Aug. 20. But experts say rebuilding Mosul alone - which had a pre-war population of 2 million and now has 646,000 homeless - is expected to cost billions of dollars.  “Low budgets compared to size of damage” pose a major challenge, ReFAATO said in a statement this month. In early August, Hazem Mohammed, 52, and his family returned to a heap of debris that used to be his home next to a heavily damaged former football field, a few minutes’ walk from deserted ruins still reeking of unrecovered human remains. Mohammed settled down in a tent pitched outside his old house, affording his family a little shade in the 43 Celsius summer heat. On Thursday, his wife boiled water on an open fire outside the tent with small children playing inside. “I decided to live with my family in this tent to encourage the Iraqi government and humanitarian organizations to rebuild my house and other destroyed houses in the Old City,” he said. “We are a poor family. We don’t have money to live in dignity. We suffer from lack of food and we don’t have enough furniture because it is under the ruins of our house now.” A passing car stopped at the tent and the driver, who gave his name as Mohammed Saleh, handed out a bag of Eid meat. “I’m afraid that the government’s failure to rebuild infrastructure could bring a return of extremism,” Saleh said. Mosul municipal officials and Western donors are concerned that the slowness of reconstruction might rekindle Sunni-Shi’ite sectarian grievances that Islamic State exploited. Even a walk through an upscale district of eastern Mosul, which escaped the worst fighting and where life has largely returned to bustling normality, can be dangerous. An explosion on Tuesday night in the Hay al-Arabi neighbourhood injured no one but left a roadside crater next to what residents said was the makeshift grave of an IS militant killed in battle. The blast might have been an old grenade or part of the militant’s suicide vest, one resident suggested.

The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up by 0.1 percent. Shares in Europe rose, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up 0.2 percent on the day. Futures indicated Wall Street was set to open higher. Against a basket of six major currencies, the dollar stood at 95.516, down 0.3 percent on the day. The U.S. currency took a hit this week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates. Analysts said growing U.S. political uncertainty, reinforced by the criminal conviction of one of Trump’s ex-advisors this week, was keeping the dollar under pressure, despite the United States embarking on greater monetary tightening than elsewhere. Another of Trump’s former advisers has pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, bank fraud and tax evasion. “In the current state of the U.S. political system, that is dominated by doubts in the system of checks and balances, remnants of U.S. dollar negativity remain,” said Commerzbank analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann. Powell is due to give a speech later in the day at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference of central bankers. Where he stands on the pace of interest rate hikes will be scrutinised after minutes from the Fed’s most recent policy meeting indicated the central bank would tighten monetary policy soon. Powell is due to speak at 1400 GMT. The Fed should raise rates further this year and probably next year as well, despite Trump’s opposition to tighter policy, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in interviews aired on Thursday. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also said Trump’s comments would not affect the central bank’s decision making. The dollar was 0.1 percent higher against the yen, at 111.360 yen per dollar. It was 0.4 percent lower to the euro at $1.15830. Elsewhere in the group of G10 currencies, the Australian dollar was the biggest mover, gaining 0.6 percent on the day after the ruling Liberal party voted in a new leader. Italian bond yields matched their highest level over Spain since 2012 as the economic and fiscal trajectories of the two countries diverge, and as investors ignored supportive comments for Italy from Trump. Europe’s oil and gas stocks index rose 0.7 percent on the day, after a government-appointed commission in Norway recommended the country’s trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund continue to invest in the sector. Earlier in Asia, stocks fell after U.S.-China trade talks ended without any progress. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.43 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.05 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI advanced half a percent. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.85 percent, lifted by a weaker yen. The S&P 500 shed 0.17 percent overnight to pull back slightly from a record high scaled midweek, with industrial shares sagging after the United States and China imposed a fresh round of trade tariffs on each other. Shares of industrial giants Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Boeing Co BA.N, bellwethers of trade confidence, were among the biggest drags on the Dow, which lost about 0.3 percent. Caterpillar shares fell 2.0 percent, and Boeing shares fell 0.7 percent. “Global risk sentiment remains somewhat jittery ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech with U.S.-Sino trade talks failing to yield any immediate progress,” strategists at OCBC Bank wrote.

2018-08-24,"CHARAGUA, Bolivia (Reuters) - In 12 years as president of South America’s poorest country, Evo Morales has accomplished many of the goals he set forth when he became the first indigenous person to lead Bolivia. The 58-year-old leftist and former coca farmer has presided over an economy that has grown by an annual average of 4.6 percent since he took office, more than twice the rate for all of Latin America. After nationalizing the country’s bounteous natural gas reserves, he pursued market-friendly economic policies and invested export revenue in social programs that helped lift more than two million people, nearly a fifth of the population, from poverty.  With a new constitution in 2009, he even changed the name of the country from the Republic of Bolivia to the Plurinational State of Bolivia, reflecting diverse ethnicities that for centuries had felt like second-class citizens.  For Bolivia’s more than 4 million indigenous people, support for Morales appeared to pay off. The poverty rate dropped from 59.9 percent in 2006 to 36.4 percent last year. Access for indigenous communities to electricity, sewerage and water service all grew, according to the World Bank.   Here in Charagua, in the country’s remote southern lowlands, Guarani people recently dissolved the local municipality and launched Bolivia’s first experiment in autonomous government. The move, made possible by the new constitution, is meant to replace distant, homogenous rule with policies tailored to the local, indigenous reality.  Yet here and across Bolivia, indigenous people are increasingly turning against Evo, as the poncho-wearing Morales is known. The dissatisfaction – over everything from proposed development of indigenous lands to his successful gambit to end term limits – is marring what had been widespread acclaim for a leader emblematic to first peoples’ movements worldwide.     “His way of thinking and his actions aren’t indigenous,” said Gualberto Cusi, a former judge and ethnic Aymara, an influential Andean tribe from which Morales himself also hails. Cusi, who was barred from the Constitutional Court by Congress last year after disagreements with the government, now leads a group of indigenous dissidents.    Many Aymara have flourished under Morales’ rule. Building upon a long history selling textiles along Lake Titicaca, they now thrive in commerce, like importing Chinese electronics they sell as far afield as the Amazon rainforest.  But even they are increasingly fed up.   “He should go,” said Joaquin Quispe, a cook whose Aymara family moved from Bolivia’s interior to El Alto, a city where a swelling indigenous influx in recent years made it outgrow nearby La Paz, the country’s administrative centre.  What particularly bothers some are moves by Morales, using supporters in Congress and the judiciary, to consolidate power.  Although his own 2009 constitution set a limit of two five-year terms, Morales asked voters in a 2016 referendum to let him run again in 2019. When they said no, Morales convinced the Constitutional Court to let him anyway. The court, consisting of jurists nominated by Congressional allies, ruled that term limits are a violation of his “human rights.”   Morales’ spokeswoman, Gisela Lopez, declined to make the president available for an interview and didn’t respond to requests for comment for this story. A close ally, former Senate President Jose “Gringo” Gonzales, said Morales hasn’t abandoned indigenous peoples, but has evolved as president to represent and work with everyone.    “He can sit for one minute with a businessman and the next with a worker,” said Gonzales, who stepped down from the Senate last week for undisclosed reasons. “He still has the humility and simplicity that were highlighted when he took office.”  Morales is now the longest consecutively serving head of state in the Americas. He is the sole leader remaining from a wave of leftists, including Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil, who dominated Latin American politics early this century.  His name, which graces schools, stadiums, and cultural centres, is increasingly voiced in street protests and scrawled in graffiti. All over the divided country, “Bolivia said no!” sprayings compete with “Evo Yes!” signs painted by supporters of his party, Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS.  Morales won’t go before voters again until late next year. And the opposition remains fragmented, meaning no other leader in Bolivia as yet compares in political stature.  Still, in a July poll commissioned by newspaper Pagina Siete, support for the president among likely voters fell to 27 percent from 31 percent last November. A survey by pollster Ipsos this week showed a similar level of support, at 29 percent of likely voters, with a six-point drop over the past year in his approval rating, now at 43 percent.  Over the past eight months, Reuters travelled across Bolivia to better understand the waning support for the president among indigenous peoples. From his native Altiplano, the high, arid plateau home to the Aymara, to gas-rich lowlands, where the government has authorized extraction on indigenous lands, many native Bolivians say they no longer feel represented by Morales. For many, the years following Morales’s 2005 election were marked by jubilation and hope.  Before his official inauguration in January 2006, Aymara “maestros,” or ritual leaders, held their own ceremony at the pre-Incan site of Tiwanaku, west of La Paz. Morales, in a traditional red tunic, climbed the Akapana pyramid, where shamans presided over a fire ritual and presented him with a staff symbolizing his right to lead the assembled tribes. “Today begins a new era for the native peoples of the world,” Morales said. Tens of thousands of indigenous activists, along with native delegations from as far away as Chile and the United States, cheered.   Within months, he began asserting his plans to “decolonize” Bolivia and give locals more voice in government and a greater share of national wealth. On May 1, Labor Day, he ordered troops to occupy natural gas fields and nationalized all hydrocarbons.   “The time has come, the longed-for day, a historic day for Bolivia to retake absolute control of our natural resources,” he said in a speech while surrounded by soldiers at an oil field operated by Petroleo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, the Brazilian energy company.  Morales began renegotiating energy contracts for a bigger share of the profits, a move that ultimately many companies agreed to. The negotiations earned him plaudits from supporters and boosted government revenues at a time when gas prices were soaring.  With the windfalls, Morales enacted measures including school vouchers for kids and pensions for workers who had never held formal employment.   For the day-to-day business of governance, Morales appointed women, indigenous peoples and labour leaders to his cabinet. He embraced grass-roots organizations and forged a so-called “Unity Pact,” comprising leaders of Andean, lowland and Amazon tribes. Together, they helped draft the new constitution, approved by 60 percent of Bolivians in a 2009 referendum.   That year, in a landslide, Morales won a second term. Tensions with indigenous groups first emerged in 2011.    Enjoying what by then was steadily improving economic growth, Morales proposed a 300-kilometer road through the Isiboro Secure Indigenous Territory, or Tipnis, a Jamaica-sized refuge in the Amazon. The highway, Morales argued, was necessary to bring basic services to remote tribes.   But native groups and environmentalists were enraged. The road, they argued, more likely would facilitate drug trafficking, illegal logging and other unwanted activity. Protesters marched for more than a month, during which police and demonstrators clashed in clouds of tear gas and flurries of rubber bullets.   “When Evo took office we thought indigenous people would never have to march again,” said Adolfo Chavez, a native Tacana and former president of The Confederation of Indigenous People of Bolivia, or Cidob, a grouping of 34 lowland tribes.   The marching succeeded, at least for a time. That September, Morales halted work on the road for further study.    But relations with some native groups were damaged.  Two major indigenous rights organizations, Cidob and The National Council of Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu, left the Unity Pact. Since then, the split has widened into divisions that fall along political lines, not rivalries among Bolivia’s three dozen ethnicities.  Soon, government supporters began to pressure both groups, using MAS loyalists to stage what some members described as coups within the organizations. Politics and loyalty to Morales began to matter more than the indigenous cause, they said.  Cidob leader Chavez was voted out in 2012.   Chavez, who left Bolivia and now lives in Peru, says he was a victim of political persecution for leading the Tipnis demonstrations. Pedro Vare, Cidob’s current leader, in local media has continued to back Morales and criticise the protesters. Reuters was unable to reach Vare for an interview. One rainy evening in December 2013, MAS activists broke down the door of the two-story La Paz headquarters of Conamaq, as the other indigenous rights group is known. Once inside, they forced members, some of whom were visiting La Paz from remote regions and living there during their stay, to leave.  “We had nowhere to go,” recalls Cristobal Salles, an Aymara and Quechua speaker who was a Conamaq councilman and now farms potatoes.    Dissent at both groups vanished. Hilarion Mamani, a 41-year-old  Quechua who led the Conamaq takeover, told Reuters a purge had been necessary. Using a charge long wielded against opponents by some leftists in Latin America, Mamani said previous leaders were acting on behalf of “North American imperialists.” Now, he added, “there are no divisions.”  That’s because most of the previous members went on to form  dissident indigenous groups. Those groups have campaigned to enforce presidential term limits and against renewed efforts to build the Tipnis road and other projects on native lands.    In 2014, Morales began his sustained effort to stay in power. Despite the constitutional limit of two terms, Morales argued that his first administration shouldn’t be counted because he had been elected under a previous constitution. In the Constitutional Court, by then composed mostly of judges nominated by allies of Morales in Congress, he found a sympathetic audience.  Except for one justice – Cusi, the fellow Aymara who at that time sat on the court. Cusi sought a strict interpretation of the charter and argued against another term.   But the other judges prevailed. Morales ran for re-election and, with 60 percent of the vote, won a third term starting in January 2015.   Before long, relations with native groups grew worse still.    In February 2015, a government comptroller discovered a $10 million (£7.7 million) shortfall in a state fund for indigenous projects, finding records of initiatives that had been funded, but never carried out.  Two of Morales’ former rural development ministers were convicted of misusing public funds and served brief jail terms. Some onetime Morales supporters were outraged. “It seems corruption has been institutionalized,” Edwin Prada, a lawyer and former advisor to Conamaq, said in an interview. Morales in public comments has said the fund was poorly run. Reuters couldn’t reach either of the two former ministers for comment.   That year, natural gas prices fell from a peak in 2014. The country’s economy, while still healthier than that of many neighbours, cooled.  Criticism of Morales and his party grew.     In  March 2015, residents of El Alto, formerly a bastion of Morales support, handed MAS its first big electoral defeat. They voted out the city’s MAS mayor, who had polarized local voters because of municipal spending, and elected Soledad Chapeton, an Aymara from a centre-right party who became the city’s first female mayor. Morales, meanwhile, kept working to prolong his own mandate – first through the failed referendum and then through another plea to the Constitutional Court. By last year, the court was firmly allied with Morales. After opposing other government initiatives, Cusi, the Aymara judge, was impeached by the Senate. The day before the May 2017 ruling, Cusi donned chains in front of government headquarters and scoffed at what he considered his foregone ouster.   “Lord King Evo Morales,” he said before television cameras, “order your puppet senators to condemn me.”    Officially, Cusi was accused of failing to fulfil duties. But many government critics called his removal political.  “They found a pretext to oust me,” Cusi told Reuters. Now the head of a Conamaq breakaway group, Cusi recently announced he would seek the office of attorney general.  With the go-ahead to pursue a fourth term, Morales stoked even more ire.   Early last year, students at the Public University of El Alto, a bastion of political activism, began demonstrating for more educational funding. The ruling on term limits sparked further discontent, fuelling demonstrations that continued into this year.    In a clash with police, one student died. Police said the student, Jonathan Quispe, was killed when students hurled marbles. University officials said he was shot by police. Reuters couldn’t independently determine what led to Quispe’s death.   Last August, Congress approved a project to restart the Tipnis highway. Other construction projects are also drawing fire.   At a cost to taxpayers of $7 million, Morales last year inaugurated a three-wing museum with large modern windows in Orinoca, the remote Altiplano town where he grew up herding llamas. The “Museum of the Democratic and Cultural Revolution” tells Bolivia’s recent history through Morales’ own achievements.  This month, Morales presided over the opening of a new 28-floor presidential palace in La Paz. He calls the $34 million building “the big house of the people.”  The projects, some critics say, are further proof Morales lost touch. “He always said he would consult the people,” said Salles, the former Conamaq leader. “Now he doesn’t.”   In Charagua, the lowland Guarani region, residents are struggling with autonomy. One recent afternoon, locals at a school auditorium hashed through problems now plaguing their experiment, the first of three autonomous regions approved by voters recently.   Charagua, roughly the size of Panama, in the 1930s was the site of successful resistance against Paraguayan invaders who sought to seize area gas reserves. Despite having gas, however, Charagua remains poor, accessible only by dirt roads.   The regional budget, financed in part by La Paz, remains the roughly $4.5 million it was before autonomy. But locals say the national government has all but abandoned them otherwise.  “We are worse than before,” said one resident who identified himself as Victor before storming out of the auditorium. “I want a recall on this autonomy.”  Reuters was unable to reach the Morales cabinet official in charge of indigenous autonomy.   Guarani leaders there said they, too, are unhappy. Ramiro Lucas, a 44-year-old leader of a southern portion of Charagua, lamented that the region recently had to halt school breakfasts because money was needed for health centres.   “Now we have land, but what good is that if we don’t have resources?” he told Reuters.  Editing by Paulo Prada",https://uk.reuters.com/article/bolivia-indigenous/special-report-morales-indigenous-icon-loses-support-among-bolivias-native-people-idUKL2N1VC1SP,24 Aug 2018,"In 12 years as

2018-08-24,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund should continue to invest in oil and gas companies, a government-appointed commission recommended on Friday, contradicting earlier advice from the central bank, and boosting the shares of oil firms. A decision on whether to drop energy shares from the fund’s benchmark index, and thus divest tens of billions of dollars from oil and gas stocks over time, is expected this autumn. Shares of European oil and gas companies fell last November when the fund’s manager, the Norwegian central bank, announced its proposal to cut the exposure of the fund - and thus the Norwegian government - to oil price fluctuations. On Friday shares of European oil firms, including Shell (RDSa.AS) and BP (BP.L), rose on the news of the commission’s advice. “To get that small insurance (against the fluctuation of the oil price by removing energy stocks), it would cost the fund a lot, as it would be less diversified,” commission chair Oeystein Thoegersen told Reuters. “Second, you would change an institution that has worked very well. And third, as the years go by, we have less and less oil risk,” he said, referring to Norway’s declining oil reserves.   The fund, the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund, invests Norway’s revenues from oil and gas production for future generations in stocks, bonds and real estate abroad. Energy stocks amounted to about 4 percent of the value of the fund, or about 315 billion crowns ($37 billion), at the end of 2017, the commission said. Finance Minister Siv Jensen, who will present the government’s decision this autumn, did not signal on Friday which way a decision would go. “I look forward to reading the assessment,” she said in a statement. The fund is among the largest investors in a wide range of oil companies, holding stakes at the end of 2017 of 2.19 percent in Shell, 2.17 percent of BP, 0.94 percent of Chevron (CVX.N) and 0.87 percent of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N). The fund also held 1.42 percent of Eni (ENI.MI), 1.79 percent of  Total (TOTF.PA) and 0.22 percent of Lundin Petroleum (LUPE.ST), among others. “We have given our advice and we are now awaiting the government’s decision,” deputy central bank governor Egil Matsen said in an emailed statement to Reuters. In a scenario with sustained lower oil prices, the reduction of the government’s net cash flow from petroleum activities would be substantial, according to the commission. A sale of energy stocks would also challenge the investment strategy of the fund, with broad diversification of investments and a high threshold for exclusion, it added.  “Should the owner seek any additional reduction in oil price risk, it is likely to be more effective to reduce the Norwegian state’s direct ownership in Equinor (EQNR.OL) or the state’s Direct Financial Interest (state-owned oil firm Petoro),” the commission said. The Norwegian state owns 67 percent of Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, and 100 percent of Petoro. Successive Norwegian governments have ruled out reducing the state’s stakes in those companies. Some observers of the fund did not welcome the commission’s findings.  “This recommendation will prove to be a failure and the Norwegian Government will be forced to change this as fossil fuel investments continue to drag down global investment indexes and the Norwegian economy,” Tom Sanzillo, Director of Finance for US energy finance think-tank, IEEFA, told Reuters.

2018-08-24,"HONOLULU (Reuters) - Hurricane Lane, a powerful Category 3 storm, lashed Hawaii on Thursday with high winds and torrential rain, causing flash floods, landslides and raging surf as residents hunkered down to ride out the storm. The storm spun in the Pacific Ocean about 165 miles (260 km) southwest of Kailua-Kona and nearly 20 inches (51 cm) of rain had fallen on the eastern side of the Big Island of Hawaii, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. “There’s lots and lots of rain, torrential rain, with a lot of moisture in the atmosphere,” NWS meteorologist Chevy Chevalier said, noting there were reports of 50 miles per hour (80 km/h) wind gusts. “We’re in it now.” There were no reports of injuries, but roads were closed because of flash floods and landslides in the Pacific island state. Tourists were advised to stay away from a popular attraction on the island of Maui called the Seven Sacred Pools, a scenic cluster of waterfalls and grottos. “Life threatening flash floods. This is a very dangerous situation. Avoid unnecessary travel,” Governor David Ige said on Twitter. Evacuations were underway on parts of Molokai and Maui islands while power outages were being reported on social media.  The latest predictions showed the eye of the storm twisting west of the Big Island on Friday morning before glancing past Maui and several other islands later in the day on its way to Oahu. But authorities warned the islands could still expect to be hit hard. Lane shifted from heading northwest and was headed north at 6 miles per hour as the Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale was packing winds of 120 mph (195 kph), the service said in an evening advisory.           “We’re telling everybody to take the storm seriously, make your final preparations, and be prepared to ride out what is going to be a prolonged rain event,” said Andrew Pereira, communications director for the city and county of the state capital Honolulu. The National Hurricane Center warned storm surges could raise water levels 3 to 5 feet (1 to 1.5 meters) above normal along the western shores of the Big Island and that extreme rainfall could mean “numerous evacuations and rescues.”  Ige has urged residents to set aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicine. All public schools, University of Hawaii campuses and non-essential government offices on the islands of Oahu and Kauai were closed at least through Friday. “We are in our room at Alohilani Resort waiting for Hurricane Lane to arrive,” said Janina Ballali on Twitter. “Hopefully, the hurricane will have mercy with our beloved Oahu.” Par Pacific Holdings Inc said it had shut its 93,500 barrel-per-day refinery in Kapolei due to the storm. In Hanalei on Kauai, rain fell Thursday as residents and businesses prepared for the hurricane while tourists continued to shop and dine in places that were still open. Dave Stewart, owner of Kayak Hanalei, had boarded up the windows on his shop by mid-afternoon and moved the company’s rental kayaks to high ground.  He said he wasn’t taking any chances, having lived through severe flooding on Kauai’s North Shore in April and through Hurricane Iniki in 1992. “That was total destruction,” he said of Iniki. “Seven out of 10 telephone poles were down, so even if your house was OK, you couldn’t get out.” Iniki was the most powerful hurricane on record to hit Hawaii, making landfall on Kauai island on Sept. 11, 1992, as a Category 4. It killed six people and damaged or destroyed more than 14,000 homes. The shelves of a downtown Honolulu Walmart were stripped of items ranging from canned tuna to dog food, bottled water and coolers full of ice.  Video footage showed whipping palm trees and darkening skies in Maui. In the Manoa Valley neighborhood in Honolulu, sidewalks typically full of joggers and dog walkers were empty as residents stood outside their homes watching the skies and businesses closed early for the day.  President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Hawaii and ordered federal authorities to help supplement state and local responses, the White House said on Thursday. The Coast Guard has ordered all harbors to close to incoming vessels and the U.S. Navy moved most of its fleet out of Pearl Harbor, where ships could provide aid after the storm. Since Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico last year, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made changes to how it works, FEMA Administrator Brock Long said at a briefing in Washington, making sure generators are in place so they can provide power to residents and quickly restart the water system. “It’s not just providing food and water. If you fix the power first, you solve 90 percent of the problems,” he said.

2018-08-24,"DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s decision to shelve what was billed as the biggest share sale ever is a major blow to the credibility of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman but there are other ways to finance reforms to strengthen the economy, bankers and investors say. The initial public offering (IPO) of 5 percent of state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco was a centrepiece of the crown prince’s plan to diversify the kingdom’s economy beyond oil by raising $100 billion (£78.4 billion) for investment in other sectors. The 32-year-old ruler, widely known as MbS, also promised that listing Saudi Aramco on international stock markets would help create a culture of openness in the secretive kingdom and make it more appealing to foreign investors.  The decision to shelve the IPO raises doubts about the management of the process as well as the broader reform agenda, sapping the momentum generated by Prince Mohammed’s dramatic 2030 Vision announcement in 2016 that helped propel him to power in the world’s top oil exporter. “The problem is: the more it gets delayed and the more there’s not clarity on why it’s getting delayed and what the issues are, the more it undermines confidence,” said James Dorsey, a senior fellow at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.     “He’s been very good at creating expectations but not as good at managing expectations,” said Dorsey. Industry sources told Reuters this week that both the international and domestic legs of the IPO had been postponed indefinitely. Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the government remained committed to conducting the IPO at an unspecified date in the future. “The reform process has to be judged on its entirety and over a period of years but this will negatively affect perceptions of its credibility overall, considering that the IPO was promised in such high-profile terms,” said Richard Segal, senior analyst at Manulife Asset Management in London. (GRAPHIC: Saudi finances and oil price - tmsnrt.rs/2qaFbqM)  Prince Mohammed launched his Vision 2030 programme with promises to fundamentally transform Saudi Arabia’s economy and open up its people’s cloistered lifestyles. He has implemented a series of high-profile reforms, including ending a ban on women driving and opening cinemas in the conservative kingdom. But those moves have been accompanied by a harsh crackdown on dissent, a purge of top royals and businessmen on corruption charges, and a costly war in Yemen now in its fourth year. The crown prince’s increasingly aggressive stance towards arch-rival Iran and in relations with supposed friends such as Canada and Germany has unnerved allies and investors alike. “The Aramco IPO was supposed to be an example of a new global level of transparency. Perhaps because there’s so much going on and so little explained, it looks like they’ve gotten worse at transparency,” said a former senior Western diplomat. But some bankers said the reform programme was far bigger than the Aramco IPO and, despite the possible political fallout, many changes could still go ahead, or even accelerate, now that senior officials are no longer preoccupied by listing Aramco. “The reality is there is a lot of other stuff that the authorities could do before doing this huge move of the Aramco IPO,” said a senior banker whose institution pitched to help arrange the sale. Riyadh’s circumstances have improved greatly since plans for the IPO were first announced in 2016. Oil was about $35 a barrel at the time and the government was desperate for cash. Oil prices have more than doubled since and the state budget deficit has narrowed sharply, so Riyadh has more room to find other ways to finance projects. MSCI and FTSE Russell decided this year to add Saudi Arabia to their emerging market equity indexes, so even without the IPO the kingdom can expect an inflow of $20 billion (£15.7 billion) or more of foreign funds next year. Meanwhile, the authorities are proceeding, slowly, with other reforms to attract foreign direct investment (FDI). In July, Riyadh published draft rules for partnerships between the state and private firms to build infrastructure. Last week, the kingdom’s water utility said it was talking to international companies about involving them in water distribution and treatment. In addition to Aramco, authorities have said they aim to sell another $200 billion (£156.8 billion) worth of state assets in the coming years. While many analysts say this looks ambitious, freezing the Aramco IPO may clear the way for smaller sales to go ahead. “The IPO always had important symbolic value but would not have affected the rest of the Saudi economy very much,” said Steffen Hertog, associate professor at the London School Economics and Political Science and a leading scholar on Saudi Arabia. “Challenges like private job creation for Saudis and improving the legal and regulatory environment for local and foreign investors are more important for kingdom’s long-term economic health,” he said. (GRAPHIC: Saudi economic growth - tmsnrt.rs/2eU10F9)  While Prince Mohammed put the value of a 5 percent stake in Saudi Aramco at about $100 billion, analysts reckon the IPO would have only raised some $50 billion to $75 billion as the prince’s valuation was over-optimistic. The money would have gone to the government’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), largely to fund projects creating jobs. With unemployment among Saudi citizens officially at a record 12.9 percent, finding ways to boost employment is seen as vital. But even without the IPO, those projects could still go ahead because Aramco said in July it may buy a strategic stake in petrochemicals maker Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) 2010.SE from PIF - potentially giving the fund as much money as the IPO. At market prices, the sale of the PIF’s entire 70 percent stake in SABIC to Saudi Aramco would raise about $70 billion. If the PIF can create jobs, suspending the Aramco sale may even prove politically positive for Prince Mohammed because some Saudis were uncomfortable with the IPO. “The average citizen saw it as a misguided sell-off of the national patrimony. Many Saudi royals worried it would expose their source of wealth and privilege,” said Jim Krane, fellow for energy studies at Rice University’s Baker Institute. “So there is probably some level of relief in Saudi Arabia that the state is backing away from the plan.” Additional reporting by Rania El Gamal; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/saudi-aramco-ipo-reforms/shelved-aramco-ipo-hits-at-heart-of-saudi-princes-reforms-idUKL8N1VE3Z3,24 Aug 2018,* GRAPHIC-Saudi finances and oil price: http://tmsnrt.rs/2qaFbqM,Shelved Aramco IPO hits at heart of Saudi prince's reforms
2018-08-24,"TREUENBRIETZEN, Germany (Reuters) - Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as around 600 firefighters battled a blaze in a forest strewn with unexploded ammunition south of Berlin on Friday and a pall of acrid smoke hung over the city. Attempts to fight the fire were complicated by the presence of the ammunition thought to date from the Soviet Army’s activities in former East Germany. The blaze, about 50 km (30 miles) southeast of Berlin, spread rapidly overnight to cover an area the size of 500 football fields, aided by the parched conditions after one of Europe’s hottest summers in living memory. “I have huge respect for the firefighters who are out there right now, risking their lives. We know there is ammunition lying around in the forest,” said local politician Guenther Baaske, adding that some explosions had been heard. The summer has seen forest fires across much of eastern Germany, but this blaze, so close to its largest city, led authorities to activate emergency alert systems in the early hours of Friday telling Berliners to shut their windows. Helicopters dropped water on flames near the village of Treuenbrietzen and a Reuters photographer saw firefighters spraying water in a blackened landscape thick with smoke. Flames came within 100 metres of houses in some places. Authorities said 540 people had to leave their homes, with many forced into emergency accommodation. In many places flames reached as high as the forest canopy in the ordinarily swampy, heavily-wooded region that surrounds Berlin.

2018-08-24,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Dollar index down 0.2 pct * Powell speech at Jackson Hole awaited * MSCI All-Country World index flat By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Aug 24 (Reuters) - The dollar fell on Friday, set for its biggest weekly decline since March as markets braced for a speech by Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell for hints on the direction of monetary policy, while a gauge of global stocks barely budged. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, barely managed to keep in the black, as markets in Europe opened mixed. Most major bourses in Europe registered gains of 0.1 percent apiece, although the exception was Britain’s FTSE100 index, which fell 0.1 percent. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 95.516, down 0.2 percent on the day. The U.S. currency took a hit this week after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates. Analysts said growing U.S. political uncertainty, reinforced by the criminal convictions of two of Trump’s ex-advisors this week, was keeping the dollar under pressure, despite the United States embarking on greater monetary tightening than elsewhere. “In the current state of the U.S. political system, that is dominated by doubts in the system of checks and balances, remnants of U.S. dollar negativity remain,” said Commerzbank analyst Ulrich Leuchtmann. Powell is due to give a speech later in the day at the Jackson Hole, Wyoming, conference of central bankers. Where he stands on the pace of interest rate hikes will be scrutinised after minutes from the Fed’s most recent policy meeting indicated the central bank would tighten monetary policy soon. The Fed should raise rates further this year and probably next year as well, despite Trump’s opposition to tighter policy, Kansas City Fed President Esther George said in interviews aired on Thursday. Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan also said Trump’s comments would not affect the central bank’s decision making. The greenback was 0.1 percent higher against the yen, at 111.405 yen per dollar. It was 0.2 percent lower to the euro at $1.15605. Elsewhere in currencies, the Australian dollar was the biggest mover, gaining half a percent on the day after the ruling Liberal party voted in a new leader. Earlier in Asia, stocks fell after U.S.-China trade talks ended without any progress. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.25 percent. It was still up about 1 percent on the week. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 0.55 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index gained 0.2 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.15 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI advanced half a percent. Japan’s Nikkei climbed 0.85 percent, lifted by a weaker yen. The S&P 500 shed 0.17 percent overnight to pull back slightly from a record high scaled midweek, with industrial shares sagging after the United States and China imposed a fresh round of trade tariffs on each other. Shares of industrial giants Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Boeing Co BA.N, bellwethers of trade confidence, were among the biggest drags on the Dow, which lost about 0.3 percent. Caterpillar shares fell 2.0 percent, and Boeing shares fell 0.7 percent. “Global risk sentiment remains somewhat jittery ahead of Fed Chair Powell’s speech with U.S.-Sino trade talks failing to yield any immediate progress,” strategists at OCBC Bank wrote. Oil price rose. Brent crude futures rose 1 percent to $75.42 per barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.9 percent to $68.46. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho; additional reporting by Tom Finn

2018-08-24,"WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese officials ended two days of talks on Thursday with no major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with activation of another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion worth of each country’s goods. “We concluded two days of discussions with counterparts from China and exchanged views on how to achieve fairness, balance, and reciprocity in the economic relationship,” White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a brief emailed statement. The discussions included “addressing structural issues in China,” including its intellectual property and technology transfer policies, Walters said. The mid-level Trump administration officials participating in the talks would brief the heads of their agencies on the discussions, she added. Implementation of the latest 25 percent tariffs on Thursday did not derail the talks, led by U.S. Treasury Under Secretary David Malpass and Chinese Commerce Vice Minister Wang Shouwen. They were the first face-to-face U.S.-China meetings since early June to try to find a way out of a deepening trade conflict and escalating tariffs. (GRAPHIC: U.S. trade with China - tmsnrt.rs/2KAT34a) Earlier, a senior Trump administration official downplayed chances for success, saying China had yet to address U.S. complaints about alleged misappropriation of U.S. intellectual property and industrial subsidies. “In order for us to get a positive result out of these engagements, it’s really critical that they (China) address the fundamental concerns that we have raised,” the official said on a press call on the new U.S. security review law for foreign acquisitions. “We haven’t seen that yet, but we are going to continue to encourage them to address problems that we have raised.” In a brief statement on Friday, the Chinese commerce ministry said both sides had a “constructive” and “candid” exchange over trade issues, and will stay in touch on the next steps. Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China did not like providing a running commentary while talks were under way, and preferred to quietly do the work. “This round of trade negotiations is the same. If you want to seriously talk for a good outcome then you should do so earnestly, there’s no need to speak out loudly,” he told a daily news briefing. China’s Commerce Ministry said in Beijing that it has filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the latest round of U.S. tariffs. The two countries have now targeted $50 billion of each other’s goods and threatened duties on most of the rest of their bilateral trade, raising concerns that the conflict could dent global economic growth. Trump administration officials have been divided over how hard to press Beijing, but the White House appears to believe it is winning the trade war as China’s economy slows and its stock markets tumble. Economists reckon that every $100 billion of imports hit by tariffs would reduce global trade by around 0.5 percent. They have assumed a direct impact on China’s economic growth in 2018 of 0.1 to 0.3 percentage point, and somewhat less for the United States, but the impact will be bigger next year, along with collateral damage for other countries and companies tied into China’s global supply chains. Business groups expressed hope that the meeting would mark the start of serious negotiations over Chinese trade and economic policy changes demanded by Trump. However, Trump on Monday told Reuters in an interview he did not “anticipate much” from this week’s talks. His hard line has rattled Beijing and spurred rare criticism within the highest levels of China’s ruling Communist Party over its handling of the trade dispute, sources have said. Beijing has denied U.S. allegations it systematically forces the unfair transfer of U.S. technology and has said it adheres to World Trade Organization rules. Washington’s latest tariffs apply to 279 product categories, including semiconductors, plastics, chemicals and railway equipment, that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has said benefit from Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” industrial plan to make China competitive in high-tech industries. China’s list of 333 U.S. product categories hit with duties includes coal, copper scrap, fuel, steel products, buses and medical equipment. Though it is too early for trade damage to show up in much economic data, tariffs are beginning to increase costs for consumers and businesses on both sides of the Pacific, forcing companies to adjust supply chains and pricing, with some U.S. companies looking to decrease reliance on China.  John Neuffer, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the tariffs would hurt U.S. companies more than Chinese firms, since most semiconductor products imported from China started out as chips fabricated in the United States. “Putting tariffs on semiconductors specifically doesn’t give the administration additional leverage. The Chinese don’t sell their own semiconductors to America so Chinese enterprises won’t be hurt by this,” Neuffer said.

2018-08-24,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will scrap import controls on solar panels and cells from China in September, rejecting a request from EU producers who argue that the bloc will be opening its doors to a flood of dumped products. The European Commission, which coordinates EU trade policy, proposed dismissing the request for an “expiry review” and received backing from a majority of the EU’s 28 countries, according to EU sources familiar with the discussions. The European Union first imposed anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures for Chinese solar panels, wafers and cells in 2013 and extended them in March 2017 by 18 months, signalling that they should then end. Chinese manufacturers are allowed to sell solar products in Europe free of duties if they do so at or above a minimum price that has progressively declined. If sold for less than that price, they are subject to duties of up to 64.9 percent. The European Union has faced a delicate balancing act between the interests of EU manufacturers and those such as importers and installers pressing for a reduction in the cost of solar power generation. It has also been concerned about the response from Beijing given the two sides were on the verge of a trade war over the issue in 2013. EU ProSun, the grouping of EU producers that launched the initial complaint in 2012, had said there were good reasons for measures to be prolonged. Beijing’s decision to limit installations meant Chinese producers had some 30 gigawatts of excess capacity to shift with few markets to sell into after tariffs imposed by the United States and planned by India, the second and third largest markets behind China. The total EU market is some 7 gigawatts. “Only the EU is at the same time irresponsibly dropping all measures and inviting Chinese producers to eliminate European and third-country competition in the EU market,” EU ProSun president Milan Nitzschke said, adding some companies were considering a legal challenge at the European Court of Justice.  SolarPower Europe, which represents those in the solar industry opposed to duties, has referred to Commission and EY studies indicating demand could increase by up to 30 percent, creating about 45,000 jobs if the measures were removed.
