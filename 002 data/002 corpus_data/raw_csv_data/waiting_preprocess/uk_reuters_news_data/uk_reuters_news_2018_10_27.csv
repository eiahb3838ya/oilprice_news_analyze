ADNOC has so far filled two-thirds of the 5.86 million barrels of tank capacity at the Mangalore Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) facility with Das crude, they said. “The third VLCC (Very Large Crude Carrier) will arrive next week,” Sunjay Sudhir, joint secretary of international cooperation at India’s Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas, told reporters. ADNOC is able to access the storage and sell a portion of the crude to Indian refiners under a 7-year deal with the Indian government, he said. However, the oil cannot be re-exported unless the agreement has been terminated, Sudhir said, adding that the government also has the first right to buy the oil in times of emergency. The Mangalore SPR facility has a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes (10.95 million barrels). The remaining capacity is solely for SPR and it has been filled up with Iranian crude, Sudhir said. An ADNOC spokesman confirmed that the company had already sent two shipments to the Mangalore storage facility and that a third was expected to be sent before year-end. India has completed building its first phase of SPR at Vishakhapatnam, Mangalore and Padur with a total capacity of 5.33 million tonnes. The Indian government is in talks with two Middle Eastern oil producers, including Saudi Aramco, to fill up tanks at Padur, Sudhir said. The first phase of Padur SPR was completed in September this year and has a capacity of 2.5 million tonnes. The officials were in Singapore to seek private investors to build, operate and fill the second phase of its SPR with crude. Construction of phase 2 is estimated to cost $1.6 billion, while the cost of filling it with crude would be three times the investment at today’s oil price, Sudhir said. When completed, the two phases of SPR combined with commercial storage at refineries would hold oil equivalent to about 64 days of India’s needs, he said. Reporting by Florence Tan

2018-10-27,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s parliament approved a government economic reshuffle on Saturday, days before new U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil exports take effect, after President Hassan Rouhani said Washington was isolated among its allies in its confrontation with Iran. “It does not happen often that the U.S. makes a decision and its traditional allies abandon it,” Rouhani told parliament before the vote to approve the new appointments. Academic Farhad Dejpasand, widely seen as a technocrat, received a vote of confidence by a wide margin as the new minister of economics and finance. The reshuffle, approved in a  parliamentary session carried live on state TV, also brought in new industry, labour and roads ministers. Washington reintroduced sanctions against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August after it pulled out from a multinational 2015 deal that lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme. European countries have criticised the United States for withdrawing from the accord and have been putting together a package of economic measures to help offset the impact of U.S. pressures on Tehran’s economy. Diplomats told Reuters that a new European Union mechanism to facilitate payments for Iranian exports should be legally in place by Nov. 4, when the next phase of U.S. sanctions targeting Iran’s vital oil exports take effect, although it will not be operational until early next year. “Our main enemy, America, faces us with a drawn sword and we have to fight it and we have to unite. Regardless of factions ... we are all part of the Iranian nation,” Rouhani said earlier, urging MPs to vote for his proposed ministers. “Part of our economic problems has to do with the (high) rate of exchange of hard currencies, but our foreign exchange reserves are better than in any of the past five years,” he said, without giving figures.      The cabinet changes come as the government faces intense pressure over the economic instability mostly caused by the U.S. sanctions.  The economy has markedly deteriorated in the past year, suffering rising inflation and unemployment, a 70-percent fall in the value of the rial currency so far this year and state corruption.     “A year ago no one would have believed ... that Europe would stand with Iran and against America,” Rouhani said.  “Russia, China, India, the European Union, and some African and Latin American countries are our friends. We have to work with them and attract investments,” he added. Mohammad Shariatmadari, the outgoing industries minister, was approved to head the Labour, Cooperatives and Social Affairs Ministry. Parliament also approved the appointment of Mohammad Eslami to head the Urban Development and Roads Ministry, while Reza Rahmani, who previously headed a parliamentary commission on mining and industry, became the new industry, mines and trade minister.

2018-10-27,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Saturday there was no reason for Russia to freeze or cut its oil production levels, noting that there were risks that global oil markets could be facing a deficit. OPEC and its partners led by Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Russia agreed in June to lift oil supplies, but OPEC then signalled last week that it may have to reimpose output cuts as global inventories rise. Asked if there was a need to freeze oil production at current levels or even cut it, however, Novak said: “For now, there are no grounds or reasons for it. Quite the opposite, as you see, there are now risks of the oil deficit.” He added that the OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing group of countries needs to wait to see the risks emerging in November before deciding on any further joint steps. OPEC and its allies hold their next policy meeting in December.

2018-10-27,"FLORENCE, Italy, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Khalifa Haftar, a military commander who controls eastern Libya, has said he will attend a conference in Sicily next month aimed at reconciling rival factions in the north African nation, Italy’s foreign minister said on Saturday. The meeting will be held in the Sicilian capital, Palermo, on Nov. 12 and 13, with key players from both within Libya and abroad set to take part, Enzo Moavero told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Florence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is among foreign leaders slated to attend, while the United States, Russia and France have also promised to send high-level representatives, Moavero said. Italy is particularly anxious to ensure that Haftar turns up, fearing a no-show on his part would kill off any hopes of finding a political settlement to end years of violence in the oil-rich nation. “He should be there (in Palermo). He gave us his assurance that he would be, so we count on the fact that he will be there,” Moavero said. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) last year seized the country’s second-largest city, Benghazi, by expelling Islamist and other fighters. He is the main rival of Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who leads a U.N.-brokered transitional government based in Tripoli, the capital. While Seraj is firmly backed by Italy, Libya’s former colonial ruler, Haftar has the support of Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. Libya slid into lawlessness after the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. Haftar launched a campaign in May 2014 in Benghazi that lasted three years, styling himself as a military leader capable of restoring order. He has the official title of “field marshal”.
