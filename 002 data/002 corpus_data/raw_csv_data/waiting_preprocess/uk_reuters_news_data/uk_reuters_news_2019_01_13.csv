2019-01-13,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * MSCI ex-Japan mostly flat, Tokyo on public holiday * Chinese trade data due later in the day * Investors expect volatility to increase this week By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares camped near 1-1/2 month highs on Monday as  investors kept a wary eye on looming Chinese trade data on increasing signs a slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy is dragging on global growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed at 490.97 points after climbing to the highest since early December on Friday. Liquidity was expected to be light during Asian hours as Japan was on public holiday. Australian shares ticked up 0.3 percent while New Zealand’s benchmark index <.nZ50 was off 0.2 percent. Investors expect volatility to rise this week, “as some key issues that have been affecting market sentiment approach decision points,” said Nick Twidale, analyst at Rakuten Securities. On the earnings front, U.S. banks are in sharp focus with quarterly results from Citigroup due Monday followed by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley later in the week. Expectations are dour with profits for U.S. companies forecast to rise 6.4 percent, down from an Oct. 1 estimate of 10.2 percent and a big drop from 2018’s tax cut-fueled gain of more than 20 percent. Investor focus was also on the U.S. government shutdown, now in its 24th day, and with no resolution in sight. Further clouding the outlook for markets, Britain faces a hugely uncertain path with a vote for a deal for its exit from the European Union due in the U.K. parliament on Tuesday. All these factors were at play last week when the main U.S. indices ended Friday little changed as investors reset positions ahead of key risk events. Of more immediate concern was trade data from China later in the day, with recent signs Asia’s largest economy was losing momentum and the government planning to lower its 2019 economic growth target. The Sino-U.S. tariff war has already disrupted trade flows for hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and roiled global markets. While the two countries have been talks for months, few details have been provided of any progress made. “It’s a relatively quiet day in terms of economic data releases with probably the Chinese Trade Balance the only tier 1 data set to trouble the scorers,” Twidale added. “Expect sentiment to continue to dominate market direction with trades focussing closely on the news channels for the next twist in the various issues that are influencing the market.” The Australian dollar, a key gauge of global risk sentiment, dipped 0.2 percent from a one-month top of $0.7235 set on Friday. Elsewhere, the euro slipped again as it hit key technical levels following data from Italy on Friday that showed the euro zone’s third-largest economy was at risk of recession. The single currency was last at $1.1458. The dollar’s index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was mostly flat at 95.645 after two straight days of gains. In commodities, oil prices declined on Friday as investors worried about a global slowdown.

2019-01-13,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s foreign ministry summoned a senior Polish diplomat to protest at Poland jointly hosting a global summit with the United States focused on the Middle East, particularly Iran, state news agency IRNA reported on Sunday. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday said the summit — to be held in Warsaw over Feb. 13-14 - would focus on stability and security in the Middle East, including the “important element of making sure that Iran is not a destabilising influence”. An Iranian foreign ministry official told Poland’s charge d’affaires in Tehran that Iran saw the decision to host the meeting as a “hostile act against Iran” and warned that Tehran could reciprocate, IRNA added. “Poland’s charge d’affaires provided explanations about the conference and said it was not anti-Iran,” the agency added.  The Polish foreign ministry confirmed that the meeting took place on Saturday.  “The international community has the right to discuss various regional and global problems,” it said in a statement on Sunday, adding that Poland has the right to co-host a conference that aims to develop a platform for action for the stability and prosperity of the Middle East. Relations between Tehran and Washington are highly fraught after the decision in May by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and to reimpose sanctions, including on Iran’s oil sector.  Speaking in Qatar on Sunday, Pompeo said the aims of the summit will include changing the “behaviour” of Iran, which Washington accuses of destabilising the region and supporting terrorism. Tehran denies the accusations and says U.S. military presence in the Middle East causes tensions and instability.     “We will gather around a number of different topics ... fighting ISIS is part of that ... and address how we can get the Islamic Republic of Iran to behave like a normal nation,” Pompeo told reporters in Doha. “There will be countries from Asia, Africa and all across the world. It won’t be confined to the U.S., Europe and the Middle East.” The United States and its regional ally Saudi Arabia back opposing sides in the conflicts in Yemen and Syria as well as rival political groups in Iraq and Lebanon.  On Friday Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif criticised Poland for hosting the meeting and wrote on Twitter: “Polish Govt can’t wash the shame: while Iran saved Poles in WWII, it now hosts desperate anti-Iran circus.” Zarif was referring to Iran hosting more that 100,000 Polish refugees during the Second World War. Iranian Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri said the summit was being held because U.S. sanctions had failed to bring Iran to its knees. “Americans thought pressures would break down our economy. They wanted to bring our oil exports to zero but failed ... Now they’ve decided to hold an anti-Iran conference in Europe,” the semi-official news agency Fars quoted Jahangiri as saying.      Meanwhile, a cultural official said that a planned Polish Film Week in Iran would be cancelled if the summit plans are not dropped. “Iranians have hosted various nations and ethnic groups with open arms, especially the Poles,” Hossein Entezami, head of the Cinema Organization of Iran, said on Twitter.  “To protect the honour of Iran and Iranians, the holding of the Polish Film Week will depend on Warsaw’s appropriate behaviour.”  Reporting by Dubai newsroom, additional reporting by Anna Koper in Warsaw and Erik Knecht in Doha; Editing by Kim Coghill, Raissa Kasolowsky and David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-usa-summit-poland/update-4-iran-protests-to-poland-over-iran-focused-summit-idUKL8N1ZD0AL,13 Jan 2019,"* Tehran to cancel Polish Film Week

2019-01-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The United States has warned German companies involved in the Russian-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline that they could face sanctions if they stick with the project. U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a “captive” of Moscow because of its reliance on Russian energy and urged it to halt work on the $11 billion gas pipeline. The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, has also been criticized in some quarters because it would deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees, potentially making Kiev more vulnerable in the future. U.S. Ambassador Richard Grenell addressed the issue in a letter sent to several companies, the U.S. Embassy said on Sunday. “The letter reminds that any company operating in the Russian energy export pipeline sector is in danger under CAATSA of U.S. sanctions,” the embassy spokesman said, adding that other European states also opposed the planned pipeline. Germany and European allies accuse Washington of using its Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) to meddle in their foreign and energy policies. Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) is implementing the project jointly with Western partners Uniper (UN01.DE), Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Engie (ENGIE.PA), OMV (OMVV.VI) and Shell (RDSa.AS). The letter raised eyebrows within Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government. One German diplomat said the ambassador’s approach did not follow common diplomatic practice and that Berlin would address the issue in direct talks with officials in Washington. Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Merkel’s conservatives in parliament, was scathing in his criticism of the U.S. move. “That the U.S. ambassador is now turning to German companies with direct threats is a new and unacceptable one-sided tightening of the tone in the transatlantic relationship,” Hardt said. “If the U.S. president thinks he has to publicly show he is getting tough on Russia in view of the many question marks regarding his relationship with Moscow, he should not thereby impair the relationship with his most important ally.” There was no comment on Sunday from the German companies involved in the project. A Uniper spokesman declined to comment and Wintershall did respond immediately to a request for comment. Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. However, both have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which is expected to double capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route. German newspaper Bild am Sonntag, which was first to report news of the letter, said that Grenell was trying to blackmail German companies, drawing a sharp denial from the U.S. Embassy. “The only thing that could be considered blackmail in this situation would be the Kremlin having leverage over future gas supplies,” the embassy spokesman said. The letter was coordinated in Washington by several U.S. government agencies and “is not meant to be a threat but a clear message of U.S. policy”, the spokesman added. German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Thursday said that any U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute and that questions of European energy policy had to be decided in Europe, not in the United States.

2019-01-13,"HARARE, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A drastic 150 percent overnight rise in Zimbabwe’s fuel prices failed on Sunday to ease a nationwide petrol and diesel shortage caused by a lack of hard currency. Most service stations still had no fuel to sell to motorists who have been sleeping in their vehicles to queue. Some said they were awaiting an official notice from the regulatory authority (ZERA). Deputy Information Minister Energy Mutodi tweeted that commodity price volatility “will be temporary before goods prices normalise”. The acute shortage of U.S. dollars has made it hard for President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s government to import not only fuel but also drugs and other goods. Mnangagwa himself was on Sunday setting off on a five-nation tour that starts in Russia and ends at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Zimbabwe abandoned its own currency in 2009 after it was wrecked by hyperinflation, and adopted the greenback and other hard currencies such as sterling and the South African rand. But now there is not enough hard currency to back up more than $10 billion in electronic funds trapped in local bank accounts, prompting demands from businesses and civil servants for cash that can be deposited and used to make payments. Mnangagwa has said his government will not let businesses raise prices but they have been doing so anyway, arguing that they have no choice but to buy dollars at a premium on the black market. Inflation is already at a 10-year high of 31 percent and, in the past two weeks, public transport firms have tripled fares citing a shortage of fuel, which some have been buying on the black market. An assistant at a service station owned by Zuva Petroleum said: “We have not received any supplies since Thursday evening but we are hoping we will get a delivery before end of the day.” A ZERA spokesman said all fuel companies had been notified of the new prices. The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) said it planned a national strike from Monday in protest at the “insensitive and provocative” fuel price increase, although such calls have in the past not been widely followed. Teachers, who are not represented by ZCTU, are planning a nationwide strike from Jan. 22, and civil servants have threatened to join them.

2019-01-13,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) is considering recalling more Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) cars due to its emissions, scandal, the Bild am Sonntag newspaper reported on Sunday. The KBA has opened an investigation into whether a software update for 1.2-litre engine cars, including the popular Polo, enabled them to cheat emissions tests, the newspaper said, without naming its sources. The Bild am Sonntag said prosecutors were preparing charges against unnamed Volkswagen managers for suspected fraud, noting that the company had given assurances in 2016 that the 1.2 liter engines did not use illegal emissions cheating defeat devices. VW has had to recall hundreds of thousands of cars around the world since it admitted in Sept. 2015 to installing illegal software in diesel engines to cheat strict U.S. anti-pollution tests. The KBA was considering forcing 30,000 affected cars in Germany off the road, although it was more likely just to order further remedial work, the newspaper said. There are 370,000 of the models under investigation in Europe in total. Germany’s Transport Ministry, which oversees the KBA, said it was aware of the allegations, but noted that the KBA’s investigation was not yet concluded. A Volkswagen spokesman said internal quality controls for diesel cars with 1.2 liter engines, model EA189, had revealed irregularities which were now being analyzed. He said Volkswagen had informed the authorities and the company was in continuous dialogue with them.
