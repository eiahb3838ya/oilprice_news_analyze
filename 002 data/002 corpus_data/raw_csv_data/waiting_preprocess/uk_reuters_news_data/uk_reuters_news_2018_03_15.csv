2018-03-15,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday blamed the Russian government for a campaign of cyber attacks stretching back at least two years that targeted the U.S. power grid, marking the first time the United States has publicly accused Moscow of hacking into American energy infrastructure. Beginning in March 2016, or possibly earlier, Russian government hackers sought to penetrate multiple U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, including energy, nuclear, commercial facilities, water, aviation and manufacturing, according to a U.S. security alert published Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security and FBI said in the alert that a “multi-stage intrusion campaign by Russian government cyber actors” had targeted the networks of small commercial facilities “where they staged malware, conducted spear phishing, and gained remote access into energy sector networks.” The alert did not name facilities or companies targeted. The direct condemnation of Moscow represented an escalation in the Trump administration’s attempts to deter Russia’s aggression in cyberspace, after senior U.S. intelligence officials said in recent weeks the Kremlin believes it can launch hacking operations against the West with impunity. It coincided with a decision Thursday by the U.S. Treasury Department to impose sanctions on 19 Russian people and five groups, including Moscow’s intelligence services, for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other malicious cyber attacks. Russia in the past has denied it has tried to hack into other countries’ infrastructure, and vowed on Thursday to retaliate for the new sanctions. U.S. security officials have long warned that the United States may be vulnerable to debilitating cyber attacks from hostile adversaries. It was not clear what impact the attacks had on the firms that were targeted. But Thursday’s alert provided a link to an analysis by the U.S. cyber security firm Symantec last fall that said a group it had dubbed Dragonfly had targeted energy companies in the United States and Europe and in some cases broke into the core systems that control the companies’ operations.  Malicious email campaigns dating back to late 2015 were  used to gain entry into organizations in the United States, Turkey and Switzerland, and likely other countries, Symantec said at the time, though it did not name Russia as the culprit. The decision by the United States to publicly attribute hacking attempts of American critical infrastructure was “unprecedented and extraordinary,” said Amit Yoran, a former U.S. official who founded DHS’s Computer Emergency Response Team. “I have never seen anything like this,” said Yoran, now chief executive of the cyber firm Tenable, said. A White House National Security Council spokesman did not respond when asked what specifically prompted the public blaming of Russia. U.S. officials have historically been reluctant to call out such activity in part because the United States also spies on infrastructure in other parts of the world. News of the hacking campaign targeting U.S. power companies first surfaced in June in a confidential alert to industry that described attacks on industrial firms, including nuclear plants, but did not attribute blame.  “People sort of suspected Russia was behind it, but today’s statement from the U.S. government carries a lot of weight,”  said Ben Read, manager for cyber espionage analysis with cyber security company FireEye Inc. The campaign targeted engineers and technical staff with access to industrial controls, suggesting the hackers were interested in disrupting operations, though FireEye has seen no evidence that they actually took that step, Read said. A former senior DHS official familiar with the government response to the campaign said that Russia’s targeting of infrastructure networks dropped off after the publication in the fall of Symantec’s research and an October government alert, which detailed technical forensics about the hacking attempts but did not name Russia. The official declined to say whether the campaign was still ongoing or provide specifics on which targets were breached, or how close hackers may have gotten to operational control systems. “We did not see them cross into the control networks,” DHS cyber security official Rick Driggers told reporters at a dinner on Thursday evening. Driggers said he was unaware of any cases of control networks being compromised in the United States and that the breaches were limited to business networks. But, he added, “We know that there is intent there.” It was not clear what Russia’s motive was. Many cyber security experts and former U.S. officials say such behaviour is generally espionage-oriented with the potential, if needed, for sabotage. Russia has shown a willingness to leverage access into energy networks for damaging effect in the past. Kremlin-linked hackers were widely blamed for two attacks on the Ukrainian energy grid in 2015 and 2016, that caused temporary blackouts for hundreds of thousands of customers and were considered first-of-their-kind assaults.  Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asked the Trump administration earlier this month to provide a threat assessment gauging Russian capabilities to breach the U.S. electric grid. It was the third time Cantwell and other senators had asked for such a review. The administration has not yet responded, a spokesman for Cantwell’s office said on Thursday. Last July, there were news reports that the Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp, which operates a nuclear plant in Kansas, had been targeted by hackers from an unknown origin. Spokeswoman Jenny Hageman declined to say at the time if the plant had been hacked but said that there had been no operational impact to the plant because operational computer systems were separate from the corporate network. Hageman on Thursday said the company does not comment on security matters.  John Keeley, a spokesman for the industry group the Nuclear Energy Institute, said: “There has been no successful cyber attack against any U.S. nuclear facility, including Wolf Creek.” Reporting by Dustin Volz and Timothy Gardner, additional reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tom Brown, Alistair Bell and Cynthia Osterman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-sanctions-energygrid/update-5-in-a-first-u-s-blames-russia-for-cyber-attacks-on-energy-grid-idUKL1N1QX1CN,15 Mar 2018,"The Trump administration on

2018-03-15,"(Reuters) - Colonial Pipeline Co will pay $3.3 million to the state of Alabama to cover damages and penalties from an explosion and a spill on its gasoline line in 2016, the state’s attorney general said on Thursday.  A combined 11,800 barrels of gasoline were spilled in rural Shelby County, causing pump prices to soar in much of the southeastern United States, which depends heavily for supplies on the Colonial pipeline system, the largest refined product pipeline system in the country. The settlement includes a $1.3 million civil penalty and $1.8 million in projects for the state. “This agreement first and foremost addresses the environmental damage to land and water caused by significant gasoline spills in Shelby County during 2016,” Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall said in a statement. A nine-man crew was working on the Colonial pipeline system at the time of the Oct. 31 explosion, killing a worker and sending five to the hospital. More than 4,400 barrels spilled.  The explosion was caused by an accidental strike to the pipeline by excavating equipment, the statement said. In the September incident, nearly 7,400 barrels leaked below ground, and was discovered by a mining inspector who was nearby doing unrelated work. Reports indicate the leak was caused by pipe fatigue that resulted from improper compaction of soil below that portion of the pipeline, the attorney general’s office said. The 5,500-mile (8,850-km) Colonial Pipeline transports more than 3 million barrels per day of fuel including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from the U.S. Gulf Coast to the New York Harbor area. The pipelines that were shut run from Houston to Greensboro, North Carolina. “The events that contributed to this settlement are regretful,” a spokesman for Colonial Pipeline said in an emailed statement.  “However, we have learned from these events and have implemented a number of system-wide programs as a result of the incidents.” Colonial also has to complete the cleanup of fuel released into the soil and waters of the state.

2018-03-15,"SYDNEY, March 16 (Reuters) - Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said she will raise human rights concerns with Myanmar and Cambodian leaders during a three-day summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) that begins in Sydney on Friday. Australia is hosting the special meeting, despite not being a member of the 10-nation bloc, as it seeks to tighten political and trade ties in the region amid China’s rising influence. Bishop said that Australia would “very seriously” consider any formal invitation to join the grouping, a move advocated by Indonesian President Joko Widodo. Asked whether the meeting was a direct counter to China’s growing interest in the region, Bishop said Australia believed the bloc brought it “peace, stability and security”. “We don’t see it as having a role to balance the powers in the Indo-Pacific but rather be at the heart of the engagement collaboration with other countries,” she told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio ahead of the opening of the summit. China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route and which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas, and has been building artificial islands on reefs, some with ports and air strips. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines, all of which are members of ASEAN, and Taiwan also have claims in the sea. The inclusion of Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi and Cambodia Prime Minister Hun Sen in the meeting has drawn criticism, and large protests are planned against both. Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is under pressure to publicly condemn the deaths and expulsion of thousands of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar’s Rakhine State in recent months. “It is in our interest to engage all ASEAN members including Aung San Suu Kyi at this summit because it gives us the best chance of influencing outcomes and making our concerns known, so these are matters that we would be discussing with the Myanmar delegation,” Bishop said. Hun Sen, meanwhile, stirred anger in the local Cambodian expat community when he warned potential protesters against burning effigies of him in Sydney, saying: “I will follow you all the way to your doorstep and beat you right there ... I can use violence against you.” Asked about the threat, Bishop said Australia was “certainly going to raise our concerns with the Cambodian delegation.” Officially, the summit will focus on fostering closer economic ties among the 10 members of ASEAN and Australia, and countering the threat of Islamist militants returning to the region from the Middle East.

2018-03-15,"* President urges ministers to boost living standards * Biya has ruled virtually by decree for 35 years * Facing election this year, Anglophone insurgency (Adds excerpts from Biya’s speech, writes through) By Tim Cocks DAKAR, March 15 (Reuters) - Cameroon’s octogenarian President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central African country with an iron grip for decades, held his first cabinet meeting since 2015 on Thursday, using it to urge better economic policy and touting successes against insurgents. Biya very rarely convenes his cabinet, and past meetings have resembled lectures more than discussions. It was not clear if anyone else spoke on Thursday. The letter calling his council of ministers to the Unity Palace did not reveal the agenda, but unusually, later in the day, the President’s office published his speech. “Despite an unfavourable global economic context ... the improvement of our people’s living conditions and the fight against unemployment must remain the government’s core priorities,” Biya told them. Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking over from a retiring predecessor in 1982 and then winning an election by 99.98 percent a year later. The meeting came as Cameroon, which is mostly French-speaking, faces a violent separatist movement in its western Anglophone region and a much more deadly threat from Islamist militant group Boko Haram in the north. “Thanks to the firm action of our defence and security forces, we have been able to drastically curb the atrocities perpetrated by criminal groups in the Far North, North-West and South-West Regions,” Biya said. The economy has been sluggish because of low prices for its main exports of oil and cocoa, and falling crude oil production. It was not by helped a shutdown in the economy of its restive Western region, which, before a crackdown began in 2016, had been emerging as an unlikely hub for start-up tech firms. Cameroon currently ranks 153rd on the U.N. Human Development Index, and average life expectancy is 56. Biya urged his cabinet to “provide concrete answers to the legitimate concerns of our people”. As in the last cabinet meeting in October 2015, he urged ministers to make extra efforts to prepare for Cameroon’s hosting of the soccer Africa Cup of Nations next year. “I strongly reiterate my instructions on the need for judicious use of public resources, reduction of public spending and the fight against corruption,” he told the council. Outside of such meetings, Biya often meets his ministers at the airport between private trips abroad on chartered flights with his wife Chantal, famed locally for her luxurious dresses and bouffant hairdo. Their favourite destination is Switzerland.

2018-03-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 edged slightly lower on Thursday, in its first four-day losing streak of 2018, while global political tensions kept demand high for safe-haven government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic. It was a choppy day overall for stocks, with MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shedding 0.07 percent.    European indexes closed in the black. The S&P was modestly higher until a late-afternoon report that U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller had subpoenaed documents from the Trump Organization, which President Donald Trump ran with his family before entering the White House. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 115.54 points, or 0.47 percent, to 24,873.66, the S&P 500 lost 2.15 points, or 0.08 percent, to 2,747.33, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.07 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,481.74. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.53 percent. Concerns about moves by Trump viewed as protectionist, including his seeking to impose duties of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports, had pressured equities this week, particularly shares of manufacturers.  Before the disclosure of the Mueller subpoena, those concerns showed signs of easing after Peter Navarro, Trump’s top adviser on international economic exchanges, said on CNBC that the tariffs would not necessarily provoke a trade war.  That helped buoy companies like heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc, which rose 1.3 percent, while S&P’s industrial index rose 0.4 percent. In Europe, a strong showing by insurance companies like Munich Re and Generali, both up more than 2.5 percent, offset political concerns over creeping far-right influence in Italy and growing tensions between Russia and the U.K.. The U.S. dollar gained against a basket of six other currencies. The dollar index rose 0.47 percent, with the euro up 0.01 percent to $1.2305. But the dollar remained down against the safe-haven Japanese yen, a sign investors remain concerned about political and economic instability. Bond yields, too, reflected an increased appetite for government assets viewed as less risky.  Many yields in the euro zone fell to their lowest levels since late January, pushed down by both political uncertainty and expectations for a slow exit from the European Central Bank’s stimulus. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell to 0.57 percent, its lowest level in seven weeks. French and Dutch 10-year bond yields also fell to their lowest levels since January. “It’s the backdrop that’s leading yields to drop, with ... concerns from investors about the U.S. trade war and Trump rebuilding his cabinet, as well as political reports from Italy about populist party negotiation,” said ING rates strategist Benjamin Schroeder. The U.S. Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, with the spread between the 2- and 10-year yields shrinking to 53.40 basis points, a fourth straight day of contraction, reapproaching the decade low hit in January.  The spread between 5- and 30-year yields was down to 43.70 basis points, also approaching decade lows hit in early February. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.8262 percent, from 2.817 percent late on Wednesday.

2018-03-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher in choppy trade on Thursday after the International Energy Agency said global oil demand is expected to pick up this year, but warned supply is growing at a faster pace. Prices notched their second consecutive day of gains, as West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 23 cents to settle at $61.19 a barrel, a 0.4 percent gain. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 23 cents to settle at $65.12 a barrel. Rising global oil demand, along with supply constraints from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has helped keep oil above $60 a barrel.  The IEA said global crude demand would pick up this year, which was “reassuring” to investors, said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. However, the IEA also noted rising supply, limiting crude gains. The IEA believes non-OPEC supply, led by the United States, will grow by 1.8 million bpd this year, while demand will grow by about 1.5 million bpd. The relentless climb in U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA has loomed over markets, as production hit another record last week at 10.38 million bpd. OPEC on Wednesday raised its forecast for non-member oil supply this year to almost double the growth predicted four months ago. [OPEC/M]  OPEC and other producers led by Russia began cutting supply in January 2017 to erase a global crude glut that had built up since 2014. This has been somewhat offset by surging U.S. crude production.   (For a graphic on 'U.S. oil production and inventories' click reut.rs/2FDIkrC) Prices bounced around after the United States announced new sanctions against Russian individuals and groups, including Moscow’s intelligence services and a Russian propaganda organization. “The rising tensions between the West and Russia raise the potential for reduced trade flows and economic activity, which would diminish energy demand growth,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York. Prices were supported in the morning by a pickup on Wall Street, but U.S. stocks retreated throughout the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was still up about 0.5 percent, but the S&P 500 edged lower. Recently, crude futures have moved in sync with equities.

2018-03-15,"(Adds company response) AMSTERDAM, March 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch shipping company Seatrade and two of its directors were found guilty by a Dutch court on Thursday of illegally sailing ships to India to have them demolished, the first criminal case of its kind in the Netherlands. The company and the directors were fined up to 750,000 euros ($925,275). The directors were also banned from executive roles at any shipping company for a year. They did escape the prison sentences prosecutors had asked for. The court said Seatrade had violated European Union rules by sending four ships to India for demolition in 2012. The ships ultimately ended up on beaches in India, Bangladesh and Turkey, where their dismantling polluted the environment and endangered the lives of the workers involved. “It is common knowledge that beaching a ship and demolishing it at the spot pollutes water and air, while untrained workers lack the expertise to deal with dangerous materials”, the court said. “These practices cause multiple deaths each year.” With demolition as their only destination, the ships were waste from the moment they left port at Rotterdam and Hamburg, the judges concluded. Their journey thereby violated rules banning the transport of waste from the EU to India. Seatrade said it was disappointed with the verdict and indicated it would consider an appeal. “There is surprise and disbelief over the fines and professional ban of two directors,” spokesman Cor Radings said in a statement. “Seatrade would like to stress that recycling is an extremely challenging area for the international community as a whole.” Hundreds of ships end up on the beaches of India and other countries in the region each year. They are demolished by untrained workers who have no way to safely deal with the toxic waste the ships contain, like bunker fuels, acids and asbestos. Rules adopted by the EU in 2013 mandate that ships registered in the EU must be recycled through approved facilities. But the rules contain loopholes, and the South Asian yards continue to dismantle old ships. Activist group Shipbreaking Platform estimates 543 ships were broken down by hand on beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, amounting to 80 percent of all tonnage dismantled globally. Dutch environmental group North Sea Foundation welcomed the verdict. “It makes sense and we are especially happy with the precedent it sets, not only in the Netherlands but the whole of Europe”, spokesman Merijn Hougee said.

2018-03-15,"(Updates with afternoon trading) * Trump official downplays concerns about a global trade war * U.S. stocks mixed in afternoon trading * U.S., Euro bond yields lower By Nick Brown NEW YORK, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stock indexes wavered between gains and losses on Thursday as short-term concerns eased over a global trade war, but fears of longer-term instability kept demand high for safe-haven government bonds on both sides of the Atlantic. U.S. industrial stocks climbed after a White House trade adviser sought to downplay the chances of a trade war in the wake of recent protectionist policies from U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Trump’s tough approach to global trade, including new tariffs on metals imports, will not necessarily provoke retaliation from trading partners, Peter Navarro, the top adviser on international economic exchanges, said on CNBC. Caterpillar was up more than 1 percent, while GE and 3M had made similar gains earlier before losing some ground. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.06 points, or 0.32 percent, to 24,838.18, the S&P 500 lost 5.64 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,743.84 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 28.67 points, or 0.38 percent, to 7,468.14. Wall Street is trying to avoid its first four-day losing streak of 2018. Equities, especially shares of manufacturers, have been under pressure from Trump’s tariff plans, including a move to impose duties of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports while pushing for $100 billion cut in its trade surplus. In Europe, a strong showing by insurance companies like Munich Re and Generali, both up more than 2.5 percent, offset political concerns over creeping far-right influence in Italy and growing tensions between Russia and the U.K.. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.53 percent, while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.21 percent. The U.S. dollar, meanwhile, gained against a basket of six other currencies. The dollar index rose 0.48 percent, with the euro down 0.52 percent to $1.2301. Fears over political uncertainty did not disappear altogether. The dollar remained down against the Japanese yen, which is often a sign that investors are uncertain about the U.S. political and economic climates. Bond yields, too, reflected an increased appetite for government bonds viewed as less risky. Many yields in the euro zone fell to their lowest level since late January, pushed down by both political uncertainty and expectations for a slow exit from the European Central Bank’s stimulus.

2018-03-15,"TRIPOLI, March 15 (Reuters) - Libya’s naval forces seized a Togo-flagged fuel tanker and arrested its Greek crew on suspicion they planned to smuggle oil out of the North African country, a spokesman for the forces said on Thursday. Libya’s western coast is a departure point for the smuggling of heavily subsidised gasoline to neighbours such as Tunisia and Malta, where retail prices are much higher. “The naval forces seized a Togo-flagged oil tanker in the territorial waters without permissions from the state of Libya. It has the name LAMAR,” naval forces spokesman Ayoub Qassem told Reuters. “It was captured (late on Wednesday) about 8 miles off Abu Kamash town, near the border with Tunisia,” he said. He said LAMAR was owned by a Greek company, and that its eight Greek crew members had been arrested and their case referred to the general prosecutor. A U.N.-backed Government of National Accord has been struggling since 2016 to restore stability in Libya, which descended into turmoil after long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011. Officials have vowed to clamp down on fuel smuggling but seizures of tankers and arrests of crew members are rare, given the small Libyan naval forces’ limited capacities. Reuters shipping tracking data showed the LAMAR had been in Tunisian waters before switching off its transponder on March 7, a usual tactic of smugglers. Western Libya is also the departure point for human traffickers smuggling mainly sub-Saharan Africans by boat to Italy.

2018-03-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ian Taylor, who helped build Vitol into the world’s biggest oil trader, will step down as chief executive and continue as chairman, the company said on Friday, naming a long-time ally and insider, Russell Hardy, as the new group CEO. Taylor said two years ago he was battling cancer although he continued to travel the world, chasing deals from Africa to the United States and Australia while also working as chairman of the board of trustees for London’s Royal Opera House. Hardy, who started his career at BP and traded fuel oil, was long seen as one of two front-runners to succeed Taylor alongside another Vitol veteran Chris Bake. Vitol said in a statement that Hardy joined the firm in 1993 and held a number of trading and management roles in Singapore and London. He has been a member of Vitol’s executive committee since 2007 and was named CEO of the Europe, Middle-East and Africa region in 2017. He has a Master of Engineering from Imperial College, London.  An Oxford graduate, Taylor began his career at Shell in 1978 working in South America and southeast Asia. He joined Vitol in 1985 and became group President and CEO in 1995. Taylor turned the modest Dutch fuel dealer into a global giant that poached top talent from majors such as BP and Shell and ultimately became their biggest trading competitor.  Taylor executed dozens of deals with countries viewed a politically risky by lending money to governments in exchange  for oil in places ranging from Iraq’s Kurdish region and Nigeria to Kazakhstan, and most recently OPEC member Algeria. Vitol also played a key role during the 2011 uprising that toppled Libya’s Muammar Ghaddafi by providing fuel to rebel groups, supported by Britain and its allies, to be later repaid with crude cargoes.  For many years, Taylor has also been one of the most active donors of the Conservative party.  The company’s ability and appetite for deals with elevated political risks has often brought challenges — in 2012 Vitol admitted it was trading Iranian fuel oil despite international sanctions. It pledged to stop dealing with the material.  After international sanctions on Iran were lifted, Vitol agreed a major oil-backed loan with Tehran. Trading over 7 million barrels of oil per day, Vitol remains a privately held company and is a sought-after place to work. In a good year, traders receive huge compensation amounting to millions of dollars per trader, according to insiders.  The company paid over $6 billion (£4.3 billion) in dividends to its staff between 2010 and 2016.  Taylor has previously said there was no plan to turn Vitol into a public company but this year the firm will launch initial public offerings for two of its downstream joint-venture subsidiaries — Vivo Energy and Varo Energy.

2018-03-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - The French nuclear industry is considering developing Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), but will have to ensure these miniaturised generators are not only technically feasible but also financially viable, executives said.  EDF-owned Framatome, formerly called Areva, builds the world’s largest nuclear reactor model - the 1,650-megawatt EPR - but is now also conducting research into small 150- to 170-MW reactors with state nuclear agency CEA.  “In France we have always preferred big-capacity reactors ... but we need to also consider smaller models,” said Xavier Ursat, EDF’s head of new nuclear, at an innovation seminar organised by French nuclear industry lobby SFEN. SFEN says small reactors could be suitable for countries, regions or islands that are isolated from the main regional power grids and could also be useful for urban heating networks or seawater desalination.  CEA head of nuclear energy François Gauché said the agency would study the technical and financial feasibility of SMRs in the coming 18 months.  He said some organisations - notably NuScale, majority-owned by U.S. Fluor Corp - had submitted SMR models to their nuclear regulators for design approval.  Philippe Knoche, chief executive of French nuclear fuel group Orano, said factory production - as opposed to construction on-site for big reactors - could lower the cost of SMRs, making them competitive if manufacturers built dozens.  Critics say SMR economies of scale will be limited because each reactor will need its own control and safety systems. They also point at the danger of spreading radioactive material more widely, increasing radiation and security risks.  The British government said in December it would provide funding for research into mini nuclear plants. Rolls-Royce is part of a consortium of UK firms developing SMR technology.

2018-03-15,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) posted a deep fourth-quarter loss on Thursday, missing estimates due to a massive payout to shareholders in a class action settlement. Petrobras, as the state-controlled company is known, posted a net loss of 5.48 billion reais ($1.68 billion), according to a securities filing, down from a 2.51 billion real profit during the same period last year. The average estimate in a Thomson Reuters survey of analysts was for a 294 million reais profit. Petrobras shares fell 2 percent in Sao Paulo, as the stock retreated from a more than three-year high last week. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) slid 32 percent from a year earlier to 12.986 billion reais in the final three months of the year. Free cash flow in the quarter was 6.608 billion reais, well below the 14.734 billion reais achieved in the July to September period. Net debt at the world’s most indebted oil company was stable from the third to the fourth quarter.  Low cash flow generation “illustrates Petrobras’ limited ability to deliver a steeper deleveraging process in a $50-55 per barrel Brent price environment, assuming no further asset divestments,” Goldman Sachs said in a client note, describing its view of the results as neutral.   Petrobras narrowed its 12-month net loss to 446 million reais in 2017 from the 14.824 billion hole in 2016, but still posted its fourth straight annual net loss. The world’s most indebted oil company said that without the extraordinary expenses, it would have reached a net profit of 7.089 billion reais in the year. “The class action impacted results, but it was important to eliminate the uncertainty that this could have had on our results...we have worked very hard to solve contingent liabilities,” Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente said. The settlement, announced in January, was a milestone for the oil company as it seeks to emerge from a scandal over a massive corruption scheme, in which Petrobras executives and contractors conspired to inflate prices and bilk the company of billions.    Petrobras has denied wrongdoing. The bribery scheme has entangled two former Brazilian presidents and dozens of the country’s corporate executives. Executives reported on the company’s efforts to recover fuel market share. Petrobras’s share of the gasoline market slid to 77 percent in February, from 83 percent last year and 90 percent in 2016. However, its share of the diesel market rose slightly to 79 percent from 74 percent last year but remained down from 83 percent in 2016. In January, Petrobras said it was developing a new gasoline and diesel contract model to improve its relationship with customers and boost sales, but it did not provide details.

2018-03-15,"LONGYEARBYEN, Norway, March 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - O n a damp winter’s afternoon in February, a bus driver taking visitors to the local airport grumbled that this small Arctic town, halfway between mainland Norway and the North Pole, was the warmest place in the country. His comment followed two days of rain and above-freezing temperatures in Longyearbyen, a town of about 2,000 people, even as the mainland was struggling with frigid weather and snow. Relatively warm weather inside the Arctic Circle ought to be highly unusual for February; increasingly, that is not the case. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, something Norway’s Svalbard archipelago - where Longyearbyen is located - is seeing firsthand, said Kim Holmen, international director of the state-funded Norwegian Polar Institute (NPI). “It has been 86 consecutive months where every month has been above normal (temperatures),” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in his office at the University Centre in Svalbard (UNIS). “This type of weather was highly unusual,” the scientist said, gesturing at the rain lashing his office window. “Now we have it every winter and several times a winter.” Svalbard’s winter temperatures have increased by 2 to 2.3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979, said Ketil Isaksen, Oslo-based senior scientist for the Norwegian Meteorological Institute (MET Norway). The increased temperatures have brought avalanches, thinning sea ice and thawing permafrost. The fjords no longer freeze completely and the glaciers are retreating, scientists said. Arctic regions are losing land ice, and losses from Greenland and Arctic glaciers are “a big contributor to sea level rise globally”, Isaksen said by phone. And while higher temperatures might make it easier to grow food in northern Norway, researchers have said the appearance of species new to such climes could threaten existing ecosystems. Longyearbyen, the administrative centre of Norway’s Svalbard archipelago, was established little over a century ago as a coal-mining company town. The decline of mining meant it had to rebrand itself to lure tourists eager to visit the most northerly town in the world that can be reached on a scheduled flight. Scientists and students have also been drawn here to research the Arctic. Despite its harsh climate and lack of social security benefits, Longyearbyen boasts residents from mainland Norway and 40 other countries including Ukraine, Germany, Thailand and the Philippines. That is a legacy of its status: although part of Norway, it is governed by an international treaty signed in 1920 that gives citizens and companies from treaty nations the same right of access to and residence in Svalbard. Homes and buildings are low-rise, made with wood and built on the permafrost. Hanne Hvidtfeldt Christiansen, a Danish professor at UNIS, said temperatures in the frozen soil have been slowly increasing. In addition, the permafrost’s active layer - the surface that freezes and thaws each year - is “increasing by approximately half a centimetre to a centimetre on an annual basis,” she said. This means the frozen layer is decreasing correspondingly, said Christiansen, who is also president of the International Permafrost Association. That would require strengthening buildings’ foundations, researchers have said; additionally, thawing permafrost could release harmful greenhouse gases and cause landslides and subsidence, threatening buildings, roads and pipelines. In late 2016, for instance, an unexpected thawing of permafrost caused water to enter the entrance tunnel of the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a safehouse here that guards seed samples of the world’s food crops. Scientists fear that the situation will get worse in the coming decades. A study co-authored by MET Norway’s Isaksen said that in the worst-case scenario Svalbard could by 2100 see a rise in the annual average temperature from minus 5.9C (21F) to as much as plus 3.3C (38F), and 40 percent more rain. The study was commissioned by the state’s construction group Statsbygg - which, starting this year, plans to build 100 residential units in Svalbard - in response to avalanche fears. It is not clear what other adaptation plans the local authorities have - the mayor of Longyearbyen declined a phone interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, preferring to speak face-to-face. Meanwhile, climate change is being felt across Svalbard’s ecosystem, scientists said. Warmer waters are bringing Atlantic cod, which could threaten native polar cod. And warmer winters mean more rain, which freezes on the ground trapping the plants under ice, and making it hard for grazing animals to feed. The locals are anxious, NPI’s Holmen said. “Windy nights like last night when houses are shaking used to be cosy. The sort of feeling that, ‘We live in the High Arctic, we know what a storm is like’,” he said. “That sort of pride has turned into worry and fear.” He said the only way to prepare for the unknown was to keep as many options open as possible. “That requires the biodiversity, the diversity in people, the diversity in economy, in technology,” Holmen said. The consequences of a warming Arctic would be felt far beyond this tiny settlement, he said. “The oceans and the atmosphere are connected. So whatever you do, wherever you are on the planet, influences the Arctic, and the Arctic will undoubtedly also influence you,” he said. “You and I are part of the problem. You and I are part of the solution.” (Reporting By Thin Lei Win @thinink, Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2018-03-15,"AMSTERDAM, March 15 (Reuters) - The Dutch shipping company Seatrade and two of its directors were found guilty by a Dutch court on Thursday of illegally sailing ships to India to have them demolished, the first criminal case of its kind in the Netherlands. The company and the directors were fined up to 750,000 euros ($925,275). The directors were also banned from executive roles at any shipping company for a year. They did escape the prison sentences prosecutors had asked for. The court said Seatrade had violated European Union rules by sending four ships to India for demolition in 2012. The ships ultimately ended up on beaches in India, Bangladesh and Turkey, where their dismantling polluted the environment and endangered the lives of the workers involved. “It is common knowledge that beaching a ship and demolishing it at the spot pollutes water and air, while untrained workers lack the expertise to deal with dangerous materials”, the court said. “These practices cause multiple deaths each year.” With demolition as their only destination, the ships were waste from the moment they left port at Rotterdam and Hamburg, the judges concluded. Their journey thereby violated rules banning the transport of waste from the EU to India. Hundreds of ships end up on the beaches of India and other countries in the region each year. They are demolished by untrained workers who have no way to safely deal with the toxic waste the ships contain, like bunker fuels, acids and asbestos. Rules adopted by the EU in 2013 mandate that ships registered in the EU must be recycled through approved facilities. But the rules contain loopholes, and the South Asian yards continue to dismantle old ships. Activist group Shipbreaking Platform estimates 543 ships were broken down by hand on beaches in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh last year, amounting to 80 percent of all tonnage dismantled globally. Dutch affiliate North Sea Foundation welcomed the verdict. “It makes sense and we are especially happy with the precedent it sets, not only in the Netherlands but the whole of Europe”, spokesman Merijn Hougee said. $1 = 0.8106 euros

2018-03-15,"* Three tankers booked for floating storage * European gasoline refining margins drop * Stored gasoline highest since July 2016 By Ron Bousso and Libby George LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Traders are storing gasoline on tankers off Europe’s coast as they struggle to contain a steady rise in supplies since the start of the year that has weighed on prices. The unusual move reflects a recent weakening in the margin refiners make from converting crude oil into the road fuel as stocks in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp refining and storage hub in recent weeks reached their highest level since July 2016, according to data from PJK International. At least three 90,000 tonne tankers have been booked in recent weeks to store gasoline for up to 60 days off the Dutch coasts - Maersk Producer, Phoenix Dream and Maersk Promise, according to traders and shipping data. Gunvor had booked the three cargoes, the sources said. Traders said the drop in current gasoline prices had tipped the northwest European market into a contango that made it worthwhile to put cargoes of summer-grade gasoline into storage. Medium-range tanker freight rates have also fallen, making it cheaper to book these ships, ship brokers said. The stored fuel is believed to be summer-grade gasoline which will be kept until demand revives in the United States, which switches from winter-grade on May 1, traders said. “Typically, imports of summer grade product rise from mid-March onwards, with the vast majority of product heading into the Atlantic Coast originating from Europe,” Alphatanker said in a note. Northwest European gasoline refining margins, or cracks, fell to $1.67 a barrel on March 9, the lowest since December 2014, according to Reuters calculations amid a big selloff in winter grade gasoline prices. The selloff triggered strong demand for buying the motor fuel in the barge market with daily trading volumes hitting a record high of 66,000 tonnes on an Argus basis on Monday.

2018-03-15,"WASHINGTON/OSLO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has bashed international efforts to combat climate change and questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is dangerous and driven by human consumption of fossil fuels. But there is a disconnect between what Trump says at home and what his government does abroad. While attention has been focused on Trump’s rhetoric, State Department envoys, federal agencies, and government scientists remain active participants in international efforts to both research and fight climate change, according to U.S. and foreign representatives involved in those efforts. “We really don’t detect any change with the Americans,” said one of the officials, Aleksi Härkönen of Finland, who chairs the eight-nation Arctic Council’s key group of senior officials, who are charged with protecting a region warming faster than any other on Earth. Over the past year, the United States has helped draft the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate accord, signed international memoranda calling for global action to fight climate change, boosted funding for overseas clean energy projects, and contributed to global research on the dangers and causes of the Earth’s warming. While the United States’ participation in international forums – including the Paris accord and the Arctic Council - has been reported, its continued, broad and constructive support for climate change efforts in these gatherings has not. This business-as-usual approach has surprised some of America’s foreign partners, along with some of Trump’s allies, who had expected the new administration to match its rhetoric with an obstructionist approach to combating climate change. “I am concerned that much of our climate policy remains on autopilot,” complained Trump’s former energy adviser Myron Ebell, now a research director at the right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, who said it reflects a failure by the administration to fill key positions and replace staffers who oppose the president’s agenda. The U.S. efforts abroad to tackle climate change have been counter-balanced by Trump’s aggressive push at home to increase production of the fossil fuels scientists blame for global warming. He has also ordered a wide-ranging rollback of Obama-era climate regulations and appointed a self-described climate skeptic, Scott Pruitt, as the nation’s chief environmental regulator. And to be sure, none of the U.S. dealings in international climate efforts since last year have committed the United States to any emissions cuts that would undermine Trump’s domestic energy agenda. The State Department – which handles the bulk of U.S. climate policy abroad - told Reuters it was still developing its global warming policy under Trump. “In the meantime, we will continue to participate ... to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests, and to keep all options open for the President,” State Department spokesman Ambrose Sayles said in a statement before Trump sacked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday. Tillerson’s departure leaves a question mark over the future of U.S. climate policy abroad. Tillerson was in favor of the Paris accord, while his successor, Mike Pompeo, has expressed doubts about the science of climate change. Climate advocates say they hope Pompeo will be too distracted by tensions with Iran and North Korea to change the State Department’s approach to climate change. White House spokesman Raj Shah did not respond to specific questions about how the U.S. was conducting its climate policy overseas, but said the administration sought to balance economic and environmental concerns. “The climate has changed and is always changing,” Shah said. “To address climate change as well as other risks, the United States will continue to promote access to the affordable and reliable energy needed to grow economically, and to support technology, innovation and the development of modern and efficient infrastructure that will reduce emissions and enable us to address future risks.”  Trump announced last year that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement to fight global warming, raising concerns among other parties to the deal that Washington might attempt to torpedo the accord or disengage from it completely. That hasn’t happened. Washington sent a 40-strong delegation to talks in Bonn in November to help draft rules of the road for the 200 participating nations. It was a smaller delegation than Washington had sent to past meetings, but it still won praise from fellow delegates for its work. For example, Andrew Rakestraw – a climate negotiator for the State Department since 2013 - co-chaired discussions on how to ensure that the pledges by signatories are comparable and use the same accounting standards - a point seen as critical to the success of the accord. Nazhat Shameem Khan, chief negotiator for Fiji, which presided over the talks, said the United States delegation was “constructive and helpful.”  The U.N.’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, also called the U.S. role constructive.  Thomas Shannon, the State Department’s chief climate negotiator in Bonn, did not respond to requests for comment. Rakestraw also did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. A U.S. source familiar with the U.S. position at the talks, who asked not to be named, said that U.S. delegates in Bonn were pushing an agenda that resembled those of past administrations – stressing that emerging economies like China follow the same rules as developed nations and meet international standards for monitoring and reporting emissions. There was one jarring note: Washington sponsored a side event to promote “clean coal.” Some other delegates said they were unhappy with this, as they wanted the talks to focus on renewable energies. Under the details of the accord, the United States cannot formally withdraw until 2020. The State Department’s delegations to the Arctic Council are  continuing their work in much the same way they did under President Barack Obama - acknowledging that warming is real and should be countered in planning everything from new shipping routes to the protection of indigenous peoples. Some U.S. agencies are also still bolstering international efforts to fight climate change. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which seeks to advance U.S. policy by financing foreign business ventures, doubled its support for solar projects in 2017 under a climate-friendly policy last updated by the Obama administration. And NASA, the U.S. space agency, continues to research climate change, publish climate change data, and contribute to international reports, spokesman Stephen Cole said.     Both OPIC and NASA are independent of the State Department, so would not be under Pompeo’s sway.     Scientists representing the United States in international research say they have also been unfettered by the Trump administration, despite concerns early in the Trump presidency that the White House would seek to silence them or restrict their work. “There has been no pressure on U.S. authors,” said one U.S. scientist, who is now helping to write a United Nations report that will call for coal to be “phased out rapidly” to limit global warming -  a direct clash with Trump’s pro-coal agenda. The scientist asked not to be named because the draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), due to be released in October, is confidential. “Our U.S. colleagues know that climate change is not a hoax,” said one of the non-U.S. authors of the same report, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Christopher Field, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University who co-chaired a 2014 IPCC report on the impacts of climate change, agreed: “I’ve not seen any indication that the climate denialism from Trump and other members of the administration has had any influence ... on the alignment of the U.S. scientific community with the scientific consensus around the world.” Still, scientists worry that while the Trump administration is not interfering with their research it is ignoring it. The Trump administration made no move to block an assessment by 300 experts last year that outlined the threats and causes of warming in the United States and concluded there is “no convincing alternative explanation” for climate change than human activity. “But then they haven’t acknowledged the findings, nor changed their climate science denying stance,” said the U.S. scientist involved in drafting the U.N. coal report.

2018-03-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. trading arm of Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) urged regulators to stick to their ruling denying Magellan Midstream Partners permission to form a marketing affiliate, saying the move would undercut other oil shippers. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in November denied a proposal by Magellan (MMP.N) to create a marketing affiliate to buy, sell and ship crude oil, on grounds it would essentially be offering pipeline space “below cost” which is against the law. Magellan requested a rehearing on Dec. 22, in a filing that rivals have criticized. The companies contend that the request raised broader issues that could jeopardise the existing structure of oil trading on pipelines. Most of the top 10 largest U.S. pipeline operators have already established their own marketing or trading arms. Shell U.S. Trading Co, or STUSCO, said in a filing to FERC late on Wednesday that it was concerned about “the negative impact to the market when affiliated marketing and pipeline companies act in a coordinated fashion,” because it gives pipeline companies ways to get around federally-set rates.  Shell also asked FERC to hold a generic proceeding, instead of a rehearing of Magellan’s proposal, to review marketing and oil trading issues broadly and receive comments from all interested parties. Last month, Airlines for America and the National Propane Gas Association separately asked FERC to prevent unlawful coordination between pipelines and marketing affiliates and promote transparency.

2018-03-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - A nuclear plant project in southwest England has made good progress in supply chain management but some improvements are needed before construction accelerates, an inspection has found. Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) examined the supply chain arrangements for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C project in light of falsification issues at one of the plant’s key suppliers – Fromatome’s Creusot Forge in France. The Creusot Forge foundry stopped production last year following the discovery of manufacturing flaws and the falsification of manufacturing tracking documentation. Inspectors scrutinised how robust the site licensee NNB GenCo’s arrangements are for ensuring the quality of Hinkley Point’s structures, systems and components. The inspection took place in the early stages of construction. “Overall, ONR is broadly satisfied with the enhanced management system arrangements at Areva Creusot Forge,” it said in a report. “The inspection team concluded that Areva and NNB GenCo had made good progress in deploying their improvement programme and had enhanced their manufacturing processes, management system arrangements and the facility’s nuclear safety and quality culture,” it added. However, the inspection was rated “amber”, meaning some arrangements are below standard and improvements need to be made. For example, evidence was not provided to demonstrate how NNB GenCo had learnt from the failings at Creusot Forge and communicated to contractors. NNB GenCo’s own supply chain improvement programme needs further development to make sure it is prioritised and better aligned to the project’s schedule, the ONR said. “Robust independent inspection by the regulator helps to ensure that we and our suppliers maintain the highest standards of safety and quality,” an EDF Energy spokesman said. “EDF Energy is already implementing measures where improvement is required ahead of an increase in construction and manufacturing activities,” he added.

After three straight days of losses triggered by political uncertainty, equities on Wall Street opened higher on Thursday, encouraged by economic data showing the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell last week. Big drivers of the gains included Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, which jumped more than 4.3 percent on news that it was planning to list in China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.83 points, or 1.12 percent, to 25,034.95, the S&P 500 gained 11.95 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,761.43 and the Nasdaq Composite added 22.31 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,519.12. Stock markets across the globe got jitters this week as U.S. President Donald Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, seen as more supportive of free trade than his replacement, then sought to impose tariffs of up to $60 billion on Chinese imports. In Europe, there were also concerns that a pair of radical political groups in Italy could join forces to put control of the government in the hands of far-right leaders. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.70 percent and MSCI’s gauge of global stocks gained 0.30 percent. The Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim with Trump’s recent claims of trade imbalances. Larry Kudlow, incoming director of the White House national economic council, said on Wednesday China had earned a tough response on trade, even though he has previously criticized “blanket” tariffs. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against several major currencies, rose 0.22 percent, with the euro down 0.2 percent to $1.234. But the Japanese yen, a safe haven currency that often rises when investors fear uncertainty in global markets, strengthened 0.19 percent versus the greenback, at 106.15 per dollar. Looming political anxiety has also been boosting yields all week on long-term government bonds, as investors seek safer securities. Thursday was no different, with the premium investors demand to hold Italian 10-year bonds over benchmark German debt widening 2 basis points to 144 bps. The U.S. Treasury bond yield curve continued to flatten, with spread between the two- and 10-year yields shrinking to 54.00 basis points on its fourth straight day of contraction, reapproaching the decade low hit in January. The spread between five- and 30-year yields was down to 44.40 basis points, also approaching decade lows. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.8243 percent, from 2.817 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.0584 percent, from 3.058 percent Wednesday. Oil prices held steady, tracking the equities market.

2018-03-15,"(Adds details and background) ALGIERS, March 15 (Reuters) - Algeria’s economy grew by 2.2 percent in 2017, down from 3.3 percent the previous year, due to a decline in the performance of the energy sector, the central bank said in a document seen by Reuters. It said inflation last year stood at 5.6 percent against 6.4 percent in 2016. The balance of payments deficit declined by $3 billion to $23.3 billion. Algeria, aiming to cut spending after a fall in energy earnings, last year tightened restrictions on imports, resulting in a $1 billion reduction in their total value. But the country’s foreign exchange reserves declined by $16.8 billion to $97.3 billion in 2017, from $114.1 billion at the end of the previous year. OPEC member Algeria relies heavily on oil and gas, which account for 60 percent of the budget and 95 percent of total export revenue. State finances have been hit by a fall in crude oil prices since mid-2014. The North African nation’s energy sector grew by 7.7 percent in 2016 but its performance declined in 2017, the document said, without elaborating. Algeria aims for overall growth of 4 percent this year and expects the energy sector to grow by 6.5 percent, as it sees some oil and gas fields coming online before the end of 2018.

2018-03-15,"HOUSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s crude exports to the United States declined in February to a 15-year low as oil production continues falling and President Donald Trump’s administration weighs new sanctions on the OPEC country, according to Thomson Reuters data. Financial sanctions imposed by the United States in August on Venezuela and state-run oil firm PDVSA have created obstacles for selling crude cargoes to U.S. refiners, shrinking the number of customers PDVSA has in the U.S. In February, PDVSA and its joint ventures sent 21 cargoes to the United States - half the number it exported in recent years - with a total of 378,643 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, according to Reuters’ Trade Flows data. The exports were 21 percent lower than in January and 43 percent below the volume shipped in February of 2017. The largest receiver of Venezuelan crude last month was PDVSA’s refining unit in the United States, Citgo Petroleum, followed by refiner Valero Energy Corp and oil firm Chevron Corp. Refining firms Phillips 66 and PBF Energy Inc , usually large buyers of Venezuelan crude, did not purchase cargoes from PDVSA last month, according to the data. Venezuela’s crude output fell almost 10 percent in February versus the previous month to 1.586 million bpd, its lowest volume since the 1950s, according to official figures reported to OPEC. In 2017, Venezuela’s average oil production declined to a 28-year low, pointing to a deepening economic crisis and increased chances of a debt default. Lack of investment and financing, mismanagement, sanctions, and a brain drain are among the causes of the steep decline, which has particularly affected shipments to the United States. Washington is closer to deciding whether to impose sanctions on Venezuelan oil, U.S. former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last month at the end of a five-nation tour of Latin America.

2018-03-15,"SOFIA, March 15 (Reuters) - Bulgaria, which has ambitions to transform from a transit country for Russian gas to an energy trading centre, said it would start a feasibility study on creating a natural gas hub at the Black Sea port of Varna. Sofia’s plans for the hub are backed by the European Commission. They followed the cancellation in 2014 of Russian Gazprom’s South Stream gas pipeline project, which would have shipped Russian gas under the Black Sea via Bulgaria to central Europe. State gas company Bulgartransgaz signed a 2.3 million levs ($1.5 million) contract on Thursday with a Bulgarian-Swiss consortium, AF-EMG Consult, to conduct the feasibility study and complete it by early July, the Bulgarian energy ministry said in a statement. The European Union has also committed to provide 920,000 euros for the feasibility study. The cancellation of South Stream was a blow to Bulgaria, which relies almost exclusively on Russian gas, and Sofia hopes the Balkan gas hub project would keep Russian gas flowing through its territory on its way to central Europe. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic reiterated Brussels’ support for the plan, which will help boost gas liquidity and energy security in the southeastern Europe. “We in the European Commission very much support the plans of Bulgaria to be transformed from a transit country into a gas trading country,” Sefcovic told reporters at an energy forum in Sofia. “We want the Balkan gas hub to be efficient... to be the hub where the gas supplies are coming from different directions but the gas should be traded here, should be sold to the partner and shouldn’t be just rushed through the territory to other countries,” he said. At present, Bulgaria transports about 12 billion cubic metres of Russian gas to Turkey a year, but these shipments may stop in 2019 if Russia delivers on its plan to complete TurkStream pipeline. Bulgaria also hopes to attract Azeri natural gas, as well as LNG supplies from Greece, Qatar and elsewhere. The cost of building a hub is estimated at between 1.4 billion euros ($1.73 billion) and 2.4 billion euros ($2.96 billion). It would use existing and new pipelines in Bulgaria as well as interconnector links it is building with Romania, Serbia and Turkey and eventually an undersea pipeline from Russia. Russia has made no commitments to provide gas for Bulgaria’s hub project and its scope would be limited it if failed to attract any gas from Russia. Moscow has said it would consider the hub only if it has guarantees that the project would not run counter to EU energy rules.

2018-03-15,"* Saudis in Oman talk to Houthi spokesman-sources * Both sides seek comprehensive solution to the war * Proposed first step would be a truce * War has led to severe civilian suffering By Mohammed Ghobari and Noah Browning ADEN/DUBAI, March 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and its adversaries in Yemen’s armed Houthi movement are holding secret talks to try to end a three-year-old war that has unleashed the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, diplomats and Yemeni political sources said. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting to counter the influence of Riyadh’s arch-foe Iran, an ally of the Houthis, who deny any help from Tehran and say they are fighting a revolution against corrupt politicians and Gulf powers in thrall to the West. Speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, two diplomats and two Yemeni officials said the Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdul-Salam had been in direct communication with Saudi officials in Oman on a comprehensive solution to the conflict. “There are consultations between the Houthis and the Saudis, without a representative of the internationally recognized government, and it is clear that there is a desire of the Houthis and the coalition to go toward a comprehensive agreement,” one diplomat told Reuters. Neither Saudi nor Houthi officials provided an official comment. Hailing from Yemen’s Zaydi Shi’ite sect, the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa and drove the internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi into Saudi exile. Fearing the advance was part of a regional power grab by Tehran, Riyadh and other mostly Sunni Muslim Gulf Arab states armed and supported by the United States and Britain intervened to restore his rule. The hoped for accord would begin with a truce to pause fighting on nationwide battlefronts and culminate in the signing of a peace deal addressing the political interests of the warring parties, the sources added. Thousands of Saudi-led air strikes have killed hundreds of Yemeni civilians while Houthi-led cross-border rocket attacks on Saudi Arabia have led to hundreds of casualties. Coalition forces have made modest territorial gains but appear far from seizing back the capital from seasoned Houthi fighters. With no victory in sight, and as the war pushes the country towards famine, Saudi officials including the powerful Crown Prince and Defence Minister Mohammed bin Salman have expressed a desire to wrap up the conflict. Diplomats said the Saudi-Houthi dialogue had been going on for about two months and appeared aimed at providing a framework for a resolution to coincide with the arrival of a new U.N. envoy to Yemen, former British diplomat Martin Griffiths, who began his term on Sunday. But it was not immediately clear how much progress has been achieved. U.N.-backed peace talks between the Houthis and the Yemeni government were last held in Kuwait in August 2016. That round of dialogue and two previous ones in Switzerland, where there was no Saudi presence, ended without success. The current talks appear to have bypassed Yemen’s Riyadh-based government, whose restoration was the justification for the Saudi-led intervention, underlining a series of deepening Yemeni squabbles which have hobbled the coalition war effort. Two Hadi government officials contacted by Reuters were unaware of the dialogue, and their criticism of the coalition has mounted in recent days, accusing them of barring Hadi and other Riyadh-based officials from returning to the country. Hadi has mostly resided in Riyadh while government-held areas in Yemen suffered a series of deadly attacks by Islamic State militants. He last visited in February 2017.

2018-03-15,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The Trump administration is seeking to sell leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as quickly as possible – drawing fire from opponents of drilling in the sensitive area, who are warning against a rushed process. A top Department of Interior official who traveled to Alaska last week promised an imminent start to the leasing process, saying he wanted to wrap up environmental studies within a year, more quickly than such documents have been completed in the past. The department will “move very, very quickly on that project,” David Bernhardt, deputy secretary, said in a speech in Anchorage, one of several stops he made in an Alaska trip that included visits to the North Slope and to Fairbanks. Bernhardt said in the future he wants environmental impact statements to be finished in a year, not just for ANWR, calling the study process as unproductive and “just nuts.” “These documents that are written today, when they’re 8,000, 10,000, 13,000, 20,000 pages with appendices and everything, I can tell you no one on the planet reads,” he said. But Anchorage attorney Erik Grafe said environmental studies can be especially time-consuming in Alaska, because federal law requires consultation with Native tribes and public meetings in affected communities, many of which are remote. “None of that can be rushed and done adequately,” said Grafe, of the environmental organization Earthjustice. “Doing this in a year is an extraordinarily fast timeline for a complicated process – a rightfully complicated process.” Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan, a staunch drilling supporter, said at an industry conference in Houston last week that “we’re hoping to have a lease sale as early as 2019 on that.” The prospect of a sped-up process for environmental review drew fire from critics, who said it risks the climate and habitat of wildlife and inadequate input from local communities. “It’s really insulting,” said Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, which represents the Gwich’in Athabascan people of Alaska and Canada. “You can’t open up a place with such little time. What about regulations? What about laws?” Demientieff said the Gwich’in oppose ANWR oil development because it threatens the caribou herd that is central to their diet and culture. “We’re going to fight them every step of the way,” she said. Grafe represented opponents to the 2008 Chukchi Sea offshore lease sale in which Royal Dutch Shell spent over $2 billion to acquire exploration rights.  A pre-lease sale environmental analysis, which took two years to complete, was found by federal courts to be too rushed. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management had to produce two separate revisions, forcing delays in exploration work. Shell ultimately abandoned the multibillion-dollar program in 2015 after failing to find commercial quantities of oil. Grafe said history could be repeated with the ANWR. “If the Trump administration takes shortcuts, we won’t hesitate to go to court,” he said.

2018-03-15,"OSLO (Reuters) - Three solar plants planned by Norway’s Scatec Solar were among 27 energy deals blocked by a South African court on Tuesday when it agreed to hear a legal challenge by a group loyal to ousted President Jacob Zuma, the firm said on Thursday. State utility Eskom had been due to sign the 27 deals, mostly for wind and solar from independent power producers. It would have been the first major investment package under President Cyril Ramaphosa, who replaced Zuma last month. The court’s decision to block the renewable energy deals, worth a total of $4.7 billion, was a blow to Ramaphosa. The move also hit Scatec Solar, as South Africa is one of its key markets. “We have three solar plant projects that are awaiting signature from the government,” Scatec Chief Financial Officer Mikkel Toerud told Reuters in an email, adding that the three projects had combined capacity of 258 megawatts (MW). He declined to comment on the potential outcome of the court challenge or when Scatec expected the deals to be signed. Scatec Solar said this month that the new government would benefit renewable energy deals in South Africa. South Africa’s North Gauteng High Court agreed to hold a full hearing on the challenge on March 27 after the National Union of Metalworkers (NUMSA) and pro-Zuma Transform RSA said the deals would lead to coal industry job losses and should be scrapped.

2018-03-15,"* European shares rise 0.2 pct as traders take a trade war break * Wall Street seen inching higher, unemployment claims fall * U.S. and German bonds could extend winning streak * Gold slips, oil steady * Dollar firms but yen stays higher amid depressed risk appetite By Marc Jones LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - A brief break in global trade squalls helped to nudge stocks and the dollar higher on Thursday, though the risk they could return at any time also meant investors were sticking close to ultra-safe government bonds. Upbeat results from insurance heavyweights Munich Re , Generali and Old Mutual also helped Europe’s mood. But it was mainly relief that, for now at least, Donald Trump’s trade war drum wasn’t beating any louder. Wall Street was pointing modestly higher as well after a bumpy session on Wednesday and the dollar managed a small bounce after three days of losses, though not against the safe-haven yen. “The big questions the market has are about politics in the United States at the moment and about trade policy,” said Julien-Pierre Nouen, Chief Economic Strategist at Lazard Frères Gestion. “Exporters have been a bit weak and you can see there are some worries about whether other countries will retaliate ... but you really have to stick to the economic outlook and, in fact, we think the economic outlook remains very good.” The trade tensions hadn’t gone off the boil completely. China’s widely read state-run tabloid the Global Times said the United States was trying to play the victim with its claims of trade imbalances while Europe’s export powerhouse Germany warned that a trade war could “cause tangible damage”. The big bond market safety plays — U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds — steadied after a brief early European sell-off. If they manage a fourth day of gains it will be the longest winning streak since November. Larry Kudlow, incoming director of the White House national economic council, had said on Wednesday that China had earned a tough response on trade, even though he has previously criticised “blanket” tariffs. He also said he would like to see the dollar a “wee bit stronger than it is currently”. In an ominous sign for Trump’s Republicans eight months before national mid-term elections, a moderate Democrat candidate looked to have won what should have been a shoo-in congressional election for Republicans in Pennsylvania. The dollar index, which measures the grrenback against a basket of six other major currencies, was up 0.2 percent at 89.698 ahead of U.S. trading and at $1.2345 against the euro, having fallen almost 1.5 percent this month. Just before the U.S. opened, data showed another fall in the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits. For inflation watchers such as the Federal Reserve, U.S. import prices also rose more than expected in February. Asian trading had been mixed. Shanghai lost 0.3 percent whereas Hong Kong’s Hang Seng ended flat and Japan’s Nikkei erased early losses to finish just about up despite a stronger yen and an ongoing scandal surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso. Abe has denied wrongdoing by himself or his wife, and Aso has denied instructing any cover-up in a row over the discounted sale of state-owned land to a school operator. Japan’s equity market “has been holding up relatively well” but will have to decline if U.S. shares deepen their losses, said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. There was brighter news elsewhere in the region as China’s President Xi Jinping offered encouragement for South Korea’s initiative to nurture peaceful engagement with North Korea, and Russia also expressed support. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has also begun a rare two-day visit to Sweden, which represents the United States diplomatically in the isolated country, the Swedish Foreign Ministry said on Thursday. The Norwegian crown rose to its highest in four months after the country’s central bank signalled that its first rate rise in seven years will come earlier than previously expected. Sterling, though, was back below $1.40 as Britain and Russia continued to trade barbs a day after the UK said it would expel 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of a former Russian spy living in Britain. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accused London of behaving in a “boorish” way with the expulsions and that Moscow’s response would come “very soon”. There was also more Brexit stress for the pound. France’s markets watchdog said the European Union’s system for granting financial market access would have to be toughened up after Brexit. Britain’s third-biggest company Unilever, meanwhile, said it was scrapping its London corporate headquarters. In metals markets, safe-haven gold lost some of its appeal, with spot prices dipping 0.1 percent to $1,326.16 an ounce . Oil prices held steady, though, with Brent crude futures at $64.91 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fractionally higher at $61.05. The market is being supported by healthy global demand, but that is being offset by a relentless rise in U.S. production that is undermining OPEC-led efforts to cut supplies and prop up prices.

2018-03-15,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Labour unions want to move quickly to commit energy groups E.ON (EONGn.DE) and RWE (RWEG.DE) to avoiding forced redundancies in the planned break-up of RWE’s networks and renewables unit Innogy (IGY.DE), a board member of the Verdi union said. “We will now call for the ban of forced layoffs,” Andreas Scheidt, who also serves as deputy chairman of E.ON’s supervisory board, told Reuters. “We know that employees are worried. We will make sure they’re safe.” E.ON and RWE earlier this week announced the plans that will see them beef up their own businesses with parts of Innogy in one of Germany’s largest-ever utility deals. E.ON has flagged as many as 5,000 job cuts, about 7 percent of the future entity, and Chief Executive Johannes Teyssen said he was confident this could be done without forced layoffs. RWE, meanwhile, does not expect cuts due to the deal. Through the transaction, E.ON will become Europe’s largest network and retail energy player, with about 70,000 employees, while RWE will turn into the continent’s third-largest renewables player with a workforce of about 23,000. E.ON has said it expects synergies of 600 to 800 million euros  ($740-987 million) as part of the deal, mostly in its retail segment, while RWE has put savings from the integration of E.ON’s and Innogy’s renewable operations at about 50 million.

2018-03-15,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 15 (Reuters) - The tug-of-war between fundamentals and sentiment appears to be getting stronger for many commodities as the market tries to reconcile factors such as robust demand numbers from China and increasingly worrying rhetoric and actions from the United States. Iron ore, steel and copper all performed well on Wednesday after Chinese data showed real estate investment and industrial output rising at a faster than expected pace. Spot iron ore prices in China .IO62-CNO=MB rose 2.7 percent to close at $71.64 a tonne, while London-traded copper futures gained 0.6 percent to $6,988.50 a tonne. China’s real estate investment over the first two months of the year grew 9.9 percent from the same period a year ago, marking the fastest pace since 2015. Industrial output in the January to February period gained 7.2 percent from the same period in 2017, beating the market consensus forecast of a rise of 6.1 percent and coming in well above December’s 6.2 percent growth rate. Given that property and industry are among the major consumers of commodities like steel and copper, the price gains aren’t that surprising as they seem to indicate that China’s economy remains in a healthy state and likely to support strength in commodity imports in coming months. Indeed, China’s imports of major commodities were solid in the first two months of the year, with customs data last week showing iron ore imports up 5.4 percent from the January to February period last year, crude oil up by 10.8 percent, copper by 9.8 percent and coal by 14.4 percent. But despite the strength in China’s commodity demand, prices have at best meandered so far in 2018, with iron ore down 1.3 percent from the end of 2017 to Wednesday’s close, LME copper lower by 3.6 percent and Brent crude oil down by almost 3 percent. While China isn’t the sole factor driving commodity prices, it’s clear that the current positive demand picture isn’t enough to spark, or even sustain, a rally. Instead market participants seem once again focused on the mounting risks posed by geopolitics, particularly in the form of the agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump. The imposition of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium spooked markets far more than the positive China data supported them. Trump first announced he planned to impose the tariffs on March 1, and iron ore prices fell 11 percent between March 2 and 12, before recovering slightly on the Chinese economic data. China’s exports of steel to the United States are a miniscule 0.1 percent of its total production, so in theory the U.S. tariffs are inconsequential and should have zero to minimal impact on the country’s demand for seaborne iron ore. Yet iron ore prices slumped on the news of Trump’s tariffs, not because of the expected immediate impact on demand, but rather on the concern that the U.S. government is prepared to wage a beggar-thy-neighbour trade war than runs the risk of sparking the next global recession. The potential for Trump’s policies to impact other commodities is also looming large, with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his planned with replacement with Central Intelligence Agency head Mike Pompeo raising concerns over the future of Iran’s crude exports. Pompeo is believed to be more aligned to Trump’s view that the deal between Western powers Iran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme was bad, and needs to be re-negotiated. This raises the chance of the U.S. administration de-certifying the nuclear deal, a move that could lead to restrictions on Iran’s crude exports, an eventuality that could tighten the market and raise prices. Brent crude futures didn’t show much reaction to Tillerson’s sacking, gaining a mere 0.4 percent on Wednesday. But what Trump has done for crude oil, and for other commodities, is put geopolitical risk back on the agenda. While it may not yet have displaced the interplay between supply and demand as the main driver of markets, a focus on geopolitics has to be on the radar screen of producers, traders, investors and buyers. Commodity markets with deep and liquid markets, such as crude oil and natural gas, are more at risk of sharp increases in geopolitically-driven volatility, but even those where futures contracts are limited, such as coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas, will be affected.

2018-03-15,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - A nuclear plant project in southwest England has made good progress in supply chain management but some improvements are needed before construction accelerates, an inspection has found. Britain’s Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) examined the supply chain arrangements for EDF Energy’s Hinkley Point C project in light of falsification issues at one of the plant’s key suppliers – Fromatome’s Creusot Forge in France. The Creusot Forge foundry stopped production last year following the discovery of manufacturing flaws and the falsification of manufacturing tracking documentation. Inspectors scrutinised how robust the site licensee NNB GenCo’s arrangements are for ensuring the quality of Hinkley Point’s structures, systems and components. The inspection took place in the early stages of construction. “Overall, ONR is broadly satisfied with the enhanced management system arrangements at Areva Creusot Forge,” it said in a report. “The inspection team concluded that Areva and NNB GenCo had made good progress in deploying their improvement programme and had enhanced their manufacturing processes, management system arrangements and the facility’s nuclear safety and quality culture,” it added. However, the inspection was rated “amber”, meaning some arrangements are below standard and improvements need to be made. For example, evidence was not provided to demonstrate how NNB GenCo had learnt from the failings at Creusot Forge and communicated to contractors. NNB GenCo’s own supply chain improvement programme needs further development to make sure it is prioritised and better aligned to the project’s schedule, the ONR said.

In a video posted on social media, Statoil presented the switch as a way to show its determination to develop investments in renewable energy. Reactions by various social media users were mixed. “Equinor sounds like a princess on a horse in Game of Thrones,” one Twitter user said. “Equi” is the genitive singular in Latin for “horse”. Others liked the change. “Congratulations on an exciting name change. The green shift is happening faster and faster. Norway must be a part of it. Good luck with the process,” tweeted Norwegian Culture Minister Trine Skei Grande. Equinor is a combination of “equi”, the starting point for words like equal, equality and equilibrium, and “nor” for Norway, the company said. “Reflecting on the global energy transition and how we are developing as a broad energy company, it has become natural to change our name,” Statoil CEO Eldar Saetre said in a statement. Rebranding would cost up to 250 million Norwegian crowns ($32.5 million), he later told a news conference. Statoil, which is headquartered in the port city and oil industry hub of Stavanger, has come to symbolise Norway’s rise in the past half-century to one of the world’s richest nations. Local newspaper Stavanger Aftenblad ran a straw poll asking readers whether they liked the name change, with 4,730 people saying “no” and 809 saying “yes”. The proposal will be put to the annual general meeting on May 15, but Statoil said it already had the backing of the Norwegian state, which has a 67 percent stake in the company. “The decision reflects that Statoil is developing itself into a broad energy company in line with global developments in the energy sector,” Oil and Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes told Reuters. Statoil said it expects to invest 15-20 percent of capital spending by 2030 in what it calls new energy solutions, up from about 5 percent last year. Saetre declined to say how much Statoil was planning to spend on renewables in 2018, but the company has said previously that spending for renewable and low-carbon solutions are expected to total $500 million to $750 million from 2017 to 2020 and $750 million to $1.5 billion for the 2020-2025 period. Statoil developed the world’s first floating offshore wind park off Scotland and is looking to install others off countries including the United States and Japan.

2018-03-15,"(Adds details, quotes, context) MOSCOW, March 15 (Reuters) - Russia’s En+ Group, which manages tycoon Oleg Deripaska’s aluminium and hydropower assets, said on Thursday its core earnings rose 32 percent in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to higher aluminium prices, beating analysts’ estimates. En+ Group, the largest shareholder of Russian aluminium giant Rusal, raised $1.5 billion in an initial public offering (IPO) in November, and has said that trading firm Glencore would swap its 8.75 percent stake in Rusal for shares in En+ by the end of March. The share conversion with Glencore is currently expected to be completed by the end of April, En+ said in a statement on Thursday. It did not explain the reason for the one month delay but said that the deal remains subject to governmental and regulatory approvals. Following the swap, En+’s stake in Rusal will rise to 56.88 percent from 48.13 percent, while Glencore will hold new global depositary receipts (GDRs) representing 10.55 percent of En+’s shares. On Thursday, En+’s GDR was at $12.6, up 0.8 percent from the previous day. It priced its IPO at $14 per GDR in November. En+ said its adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 32 percent to $907 million, beating $892 million predicted by analysts in a Reuters poll. Its fourth-quarter net profit fell 37 percent year on year to $505 million because of a high base effect a year ago when Rusal recorded a $299 million gain from the sale of its Alpart alumina refinery in Jamaica to China’s state-owned Jiuquan Iron & Steel Group. En+ spent part of the proceeds from the IPO on deleveraging and in its results it said net debt fell 13 percent from a year ago to $12.2 billion at the end of 2017. Its board of directors has also recommended a dividend payment for 2017 of $68 million per share (or $0.1190 per GDR), the group added.

2018-03-15," (This version of the Feb 15 story corrects deal value to $2.25 billion from $2.24 billion) By Ahmed Farhatha (Reuters) - Chemicals maker LyondellBasell Industries NV (LYB.N) said it will buy smaller rival A. Schulman Inc SHLM.O for $2.25 billion, doubling the size of its business that supplies plastic compounds to the packaging, electronics and building markets. LyondellBasell’s plastic compounding business - blending molten plastic with additives - now largely caters to the automobile parts market. “What we like about this transaction is that it diversifies our compounding business and gives us access to the full range of markets rather than just automotive where we had a very strong position,” LyondellBasell’s Chief Executive Bhavesh Patel said on a call with analysts. Auto-end markets currently account for about 90 percent of LyondellBasell’s plastic compounding revenue and that will drop to just over 50 percent after the deal closes. The deal, worth $2.25 billion including debt, is expected to close in the second half of 2018, the companies said. Shares of A. Schulman were up 10.3 percent at $42.65 in afternoon trading, above the offer price of $42. LyondellBasell’s shares dipped 1.7 percent at $110.42 The deal will also marginally boost LyondellBasell’s exposure to the agricultural sector, which has been the focus of mega-deals among chemicals makers. Dow Chemical and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger last year to form DowDuPont (DWDP.N), while ChemChina [CNCC.UL] bought Swiss seeds group Syngenta SYNN.S for $43 billion. A combined LyondellBasell-A. Schulman had $4.6 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins of 9.5 percent over the last 12 months, the companies said. The combined company is expected to hit $150 million in run-rate cost savings in two years. After closing, the deal will add to earnings within the first full year, the companies said. A. Schulman shareholders will also get one contingent value right per share that will give them net proceeds, if any, from the ongoing litigation and government probes related to Schulman’s Citadel and Lucent acquisitions. J.P. Morgan and Dyal Co are LyondellBasell’s financial advisers and Citigroup is A. Schulman’s adviser.

2018-03-15,"DAKAR, March 15 (Reuters) - Cameroon’s octogenarian President Paul Biya, who has ruled the central African country with zero tolerance for dissent for a third of a century, will hold his first cabinet meeting since 2015 on Thursday, his office announced. Little discussion is expected at the gathering, which is behind closed doors. A brief letter calling his council of ministers to the Unity Palace did not reveal the agenda and officials were not permitted to speak to journalists, government spokesman Issa Tchiroma Bakary said. “The only person authorised to speak is the communication minister, and that’s me, but unfortunately I’m currently in France for medical treatment,” he told Reuters by telephone, adding that Prime Minister Philemon Yang would give a statement afterwards. Biya has ruled virtually by decree since taking over from a retired predecessor in 1982 and then winning an election by 99.98 percent a year later. The meeting comes as Cameroon faces an election scheduled for October, in which 85-year-old Biya is expected to run again, and a violent separatist movement in its western Anglophone region that a military crackdown has failed to quell. The economy has been sluggish because of low prices for its main exports oil and cocoa and falling crude oil production. It was not by helped a shutdown in the economy of its restive Western region, which before the first crackdown in 2016 was becoming an unlikely hub for start-up tech firms. If past cabinet meetings — often two or three years apart — are anything to go by, there could be just be one man talking. One in 2011 lasted ten minutes in which Biya entered, read out a speech, then left. At the last council in October 2015, shortly after a sweeping reshuffle, local press reported that Biya had ordered ministers to “accelerate preparations for the important sports celebrations” that Cameroon was to host, namely the women’s and men’s African Cup of Nations soccer matches scheduled, respectively, for 2016 and 2019. Outside of such meetings, Biya often meets his ministers at the airport between private trips abroad with his wife Chantal, famed locally for her luxurious dresses and bouffant hairdo. Their favourite destination is Switzerland.

OPEC also can change its decision but I doubt they will do it,” Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Press TV. Members of OPEC and non-OPEC players including Russia have reduced their output since January 2017 under a pact aimed at supporting prices and reducing oversupply. The pact currently runs until the end of 2018. Iran is allowed to pump up to 3.8 million bpd under the deal. Zanganeh told the Wall Street Journal newspaper that OPEC when it meets in June could agree to begin easing current curbs in 2019. Zanganeh also told the WSJ that Iran wanted OPEC to work to keep oil prices at around $60 per barrel to contain U.S. shale oil production, adding that Iran could produce about 100,000 bpd more.

2018-03-15,"* European shares rise 0.2 pct as traders take a trade war break * U.S. German bonds sell off for first time in four days * Gold slips, oil steady * Dollar firms but yen stays higher amid depressed risk appetite By Marc Jones LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - A break in the recent global trade war squalls helped lift European stocks on Thursday and cooled demand for the markets’ traditional safety plays of government bonds and gold. Good-looking results from insurance heavyweights Munich Re , Generali and Old Mutual also helped Europe’s mood. But it was mainly relief that, for now at least, Donald Trump’s trade war drum wasn’t beating any harder. The dollar consolidated a modest bounce following three days of losses, while the big credit market benchmarks of U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds both saw selling for the first time in four days. China’s widely-read and state-run tabloid the Global Times had added to the trade war talk overnight saying the U.S. was trying to play the victim. Germany’s economic ministry then said a trade war could “cause tangible damage”. In an ominous sign for Trump’s Republicans eight months before national mid-term elections meanwhile, a moderate Democrat candidate looked to have won what should have been a shoo-in congressional election for Republicans in Pennsylvania. “The big questions the market has is about politics in the United States at the moment and about trade policy,” said Julien-Pierre Nouen, Chief Economic Strategist at Lazard Frères Gestion. “Exporters have been a bit weak and you can see there are some worries about whether other countries will retaliate... but you really have to stick to the economic outlook and in fact we think the economic outlook remains very good.” The 0.2 percent bounce in European stocks came after a subdued Asian session which itself had followed another bumpy day on Wall Street during which global planemaker Boeing was hit particularly hard. Shanghai lost 0.3 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat and Australian stocks fell 0.25 percent. Japan’s Nikkei though erased early losses to finish up 0.12 percent despite a stronger yen and an ongoing scandal surrounding Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Finance Minister Taro Aso. Abe has denied wrongdoing by himself or his wife and Aso has denied instructing any cover-up. Japan’s equity market “has been holding up relatively well, but it will have to decline some more if U.S. shares deepen their losses,” said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. There was bright news elsewhere in the region too. China’s President Xi Jinping offered encouragement for South Korea’s initiative to nurture peaceful engagement with North Korea, and Russia also expressed support. North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho will begin a rare two-day visit on Thursday to Sweden, which represents the United States diplomatically in the isolated country, the Swedish Foreign Ministry also said. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of six other major currencies, barely budged at 89.698 and at $1.2354 per euro in European trading, having fallen almost 1.5 percent so far this month. Sterling was at a day’s low at just under $1.40 the day after Britain said it was expelling 23 Russian diplomats over the poisoning of former Russian spy living in Britain last week. Russia’s foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told a news briefing that Moscow would soon retaliate. In metals markets, safe-haven gold lost some of its appeal, with spot prices dipping 0.1 percent to $1,326.16 an ounce . Oil prices held steady though with Brent crude futures at $64.91 per barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fractionally higher $61.05 a barrel. The market is being supported by healthy global demand but that is being offset by a relentless rise in U.S. production that is undermining efforts led by OPEC to cut supplies and prop up prices.

2018-03-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should introduce new, more ambitious legislation to tackle poor air quality after failing to deal with the problem, lawmakers said on Thursday. In a joint report, four parliamentary committees said air pollution was a national health emergency and the government has still not produced a plan which adequately addresses it. Under the European Union’s Air Quality Directive, member states were supposed to comply with nitrogen dioxide emission limits in 2010 - or by 2015 if they delivered plans to deal with high levels of the gas, which is produced mainly by diesel engines. The European Commission is reviewing whether to take legal action against nine member states, including Britain, for breaching the rules after they submitted plans to address the issue. “The government’s latest plan does not present an effective response to the scale of the air quality catastrophe in the UK,” said Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. “We are concerned that the government is treating air quality as a box-ticking exercise. Real change will require bold, meaningful action.”  Parish’s committee issued the report along with the parliamentary environmental audit, health and social care, and transport committees. Last month, the High Court ruled that the government plan was inadequate, following a legal complaint from environmental lawyers Client Earth. The report said the government should introduce a new Clean Air Act which improves existing legislation and enshrines the right to clean air in law. It should also establish a fund for clean air initiatives, to be partially financed by the private sector, by the end of this year.  The committees also said that although the government has promised to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, the target is too late to bring about changes in industry and local government planning, and should be brought forward. The government said it will consider the report and respond in due course. “Air pollution has improved significantly since 2010, but we recognise there is more to do which is why we have a 3.5 billion pound ($4.9 billion) plan to reduce harmful emissions. We will set out further actions through a comprehensive clean air strategy later this year,” a government spokesman said.  editing by David Stamp; Editing by Adrian Croft",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-pollution/update-1-britain-needs-tougher-law-to-tackle-air-quality-catastrophe-lawmakers-idUKL8N1QX2Q4,15 Mar 2018,"Britain should introduce new,

2018-03-15,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) is close to bagging a deal to supply Hong Kong with liquefied natural gas (LNG), beating out major competitors for the right to be the first company to supply LNG to the city.  Shell has edged out companies such as Malaysia’s Petronas [PETR.UL] to supply LNG through a long-term contract to Hong Kong utility CLP Power [CLPHKF.UL], two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Hong Kong is undertaking a massive shift to using more natural gas to fuel its electric power generation from coal, potentially creating a steady and lucrative demand source in the Asian LNG market.  Under the deal, Shell will supply about 1.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for about 10 years starting after 2020, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.  However, the supply agreement will be subject to a final investment decision (FID) for an offshore LNG import terminal that will include a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), one of the sources said.  It was not immediately clear if the deal was binding or a memorandum of understanding. CLP and Petronas did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Shell declined to comment on the specific deal and said it “continuously seeks opportunities to grow and improve profitability”. “This may include talking with third parties from time to time, any conversations are confidential,” a spokeswoman said.   As part of its commitment to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, Hong Kong is aiming to increase the use of natural gas in its total fuel mix for power generation to about 50 percent by 2020 from 22 percent as of 2012. Hong Kong currently produces power using imported fuel in domestic power plants or from imported natural gas from the mainland. The country’s coal-fired plants will reach the end of their useful life in the next decade.  Hong Kong’s gas demand is expected to grow after 2020 as a result of efforts to meet environmental targets, said Edmund Siau, an LNG analyst with consultancy FGE. “A mixture of LNG imports and increased pipeline gas imports from China will likely help to meet this demand growth,” he said.      CLP Power is building a new gas-fired generation unit at its  Black Point Power station at a cost of HK$5.5 billion ($701.42 million) which will start operations by 2020, according to the company’s 2017 annual report. It is also planning to develop an offshore import terminal using the FSRU that will be located in the southern waters of Hong Kong, according to the report.  CLP is now undertaking an environmental impact assessment of the Hong Kong Offshore LNG Terminal project, which involves the FSRU, said a spokeswoman from the country’s Environmental Protection Department.      Apart from CLP Power, privately-owned Hong Kong Electric Company is also looking to import LNG, a source familiar with the matter said. Hong Kong Electric did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.  In 2008, CLP scrapped a $1-billion LNG plant after China signed an agreement with Hong Kong to guarantee a steady supply of energy to the city for a further 20 years.

2018-03-15,"(Repeats with no changes to text, headline) By Timothy Gardner and Alister Doyle WASHINGTON/OSLO, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has bashed international efforts to combat climate change and questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is dangerous and driven by human consumption of fossil fuels. But there is a disconnect between what Trump says at home and what his government does abroad. While attention has been focused on Trump’s rhetoric, State Department envoys, federal agencies, and government scientists remain active participants in international efforts to both research and fight climate change, according to U.S. and foreign representatives involved in those efforts. “We really don’t detect any change with the Americans,” said one of the officials, Aleksi Härkönen of Finland, who chairs the eight-nation Arctic Council’s key group of senior officials, who are charged with protecting a region warming faster than any other on Earth. Over the past year, the United States has helped draft the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate accord, signed international memoranda calling for global action to fight climate change, boosted funding for overseas clean energy projects, and contributed to global research on the dangers and causes of the Earth’s warming. While the United States’ participation in international forums – including the Paris accord and the Arctic Council - has been reported, its continued, broad and constructive support for climate change efforts in these gatherings has not. This business-as-usual approach has surprised some of America’s foreign partners, along with some of Trump’s allies, who had expected the new administration to match its rhetoric with an obstructionist approach to combating climate change. “I am concerned that much of our climate policy remains on autopilot,” complained Trump’s former energy adviser Myron Ebell, now a research director at the right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, who said it reflects a failure by the administration to fill key positions and replace staffers who oppose the president’s agenda. The U.S. efforts abroad to tackle climate change have been counter-balanced by Trump’s aggressive push at home to increase production of the fossil fuels scientists blame for global warming. He has also ordered a wide-ranging rollback of Obama-era climate regulations and appointed a self-described climate skeptic, Scott Pruitt, as the nation’s chief environmental regulator. And to be sure, none of the U.S. dealings in international climate efforts since last year have committed the United States to any emissions cuts that would undermine Trump’s domestic energy agenda. The State Department – which handles the bulk of U.S. climate policy abroad - told Reuters it was still developing its global warming policy under Trump. “The State Department is working with the White House and the interagency to further develop our approach to international climate change diplomacy,” State Department spokesman Ambrose Sayles said in a statement before Trump sacked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday. “In the meantime, we will continue to participate ... to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests, and to keep all options open for the President,” Sayles said. Tillerson’s departure leaves a question mark over the future of U.S. climate policy abroad. Tillerson was in favor of the Paris accord, while his successor, Mike Pompeo, has expressed doubts about the science of climate change. Climate advocates say they hope Pompeo will be too distracted by tensions with Iran and North Korea to change the State Department’s approach to climate change. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love declined to comment. Trump announced last year that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement to fight global warming, raising concerns among other parties to the deal that Washington might attempt to torpedo the accord or disengage from it completely. That hasn’t happened. Washington sent a 40-strong delegation to talks in Bonn in November to help draft a new rulebook that will provide rules of the road for the 200 participating nations. It was a smaller delegation than Washington had sent to past meetings, but it still won praise from fellow delegates for its work. For example, Andrew Rakestraw – a climate negotiator for the State Department since 2013 - co-chaired discussions on how to ensure that the pledges by signatories are comparable and use the same accounting standards - a point seen as critical to the success of the accord. Nazhat Shameem Khan, chief negotiator for Fiji, which presided over the talks, said the United States delegation was “constructive and helpful.”  The U.N.’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, also called the U.S. role constructive. Thomas Shannon, the State Department’s chief climate negotiator in Bonn, did not respond to requests for comment. Rakestraw also did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. A U.S. source familiar with the U.S. position at the talks, who asked not to be named, said that U.S. delegates in Bonn were pushing an agenda that resembled those of past administrations – stressing that emerging economies like China follow the same rules as developed nations and meet international standards for monitoring and reporting emissions. There was one jarring note: Washington sponsored a side event to promote “clean coal.” Some other delegates said they were unhappy with this, as they wanted the talks to focus on renewable energies. Under the details of the accord, the United States cannot formally withdraw until 2020. The State Department’s delegations to the Arctic Council are also continuing their work in much the same way they did under President Barack Obama - acknowledging that warming is real and should be countered in planning everything from new shipping routes to the protection of indigenous peoples. Some U.S. agencies are also still bolstering international efforts to fight climate change. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which seeks to advance U.S. policy by financing foreign business ventures, doubled its support for solar projects in 2017 under a climate-friendly policy last updated by the Obama administration. And NASA, the U.S. space agency, continues to research climate change, publish climate change data, and contribute to international reports, spokesman Stephen Cole said. Both OPIC and NASA are independent of the State Department, so would not be under Pompeo’s sway. Scientists representing the United States in international research say they have also been unfettered by the Trump administration, despite concerns early in the Trump presidency that the White House would seek to silence them or restrict their work. “There has been no pressure on U.S. authors,” said one U.S. scientist, who is now helping to write a United Nations report that will call for coal to be “phased out rapidly” to limit global warming -  a direct clash with Trump’s pro-coal agenda. The scientist asked not to be named because the draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), due to be released in October, is confidential. “Our U.S. colleagues know that climate change is not a hoax,” said one of the non-U.S. authors of the same report, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Christopher Field, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University who co-chaired a 2014 IPCC report on the impacts of climate change, agreed: “I’ve not seen any indication that the climate denialism from Trump and other members of the administration has had any influence ... on the alignment of the U.S. scientific community with the scientific consensus around the world.” Still, scientists worry that while the Trump administration is not interfering with their research it is ignoring it. The Trump administration made no move to block an assessment by 300 experts last year that outlined the threats and causes of warming in the United States and concluded there is “no convincing alternative explanation” for climate change than human activity. “But then they haven’t acknowledged the findings, nor changed their climate science denying stance,” said the U.S. scientist involved in drafting the U.N. coal report.

2018-03-15,"(Adds details, quotes, background) By Denis Pinchuk MOSCOW, March 15 (Reuters) - Any move by Britain to cut its gas imports from Russia would be “politically motivated”, the Russian energy minister said on Thursday, amid a worsening rift between Moscow and London over the poisoning of a former Russian double agent in England. Prime Minister Theresa May announced on Wednesday that Britain would kick out 23 Russian diplomats, the biggest such expulsion since the Cold War, over the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter with a nerve agent. May has squarely blamed Russia for the attack and also said Britain was looking to reduce its gas imports from the country. Moscow denies any involvement in the attack and has vowed to retaliate against the measures announced by London. “Every country has the right to choose its own energy policy... Any decision (by Britain to cut Russian gas imports would be) politically motivated and not aimed at developing competition on the European (gas) market,” Alexander Novak told reporters. Gazprom, which holds a monopoly on Russia’s gas pipeline exports, supplied a total of 16.3 billion cubic metres of gas to Britain last year, slightly less than a year earlier, but still accounting for a fifth of the country’s total gas consumption. Gas exports to Britain represent only 10 percent of Gazprom’s total exports to western Europe. Germany remains its biggest buyer in Europe, taking a third of overall Russian gas exports. Last year Novatek, Russia’s largest private gas producer, started liquefied natural gas exports, which could be shipped to any point globally depending on cost.

2018-03-15,"DUBAI, March 15 (Reuters) - Qatar’s government will restrain current spending to achieve small budget surpluses and transfer less money to its sovereign wealth fund in coming years if oil and gas prices do not rise, according to the country’s new five-year development plan. The National Development Strategy for 2018-2022, released by Prime Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser al-Thani on Wednesday, calls for the economy to become more self-reliant in food production and efficient in energy use as it faces a boycott by Saudi Arabia and three other Arab states. The plan says the government will continue spending heavily on infrastructure, including projects related to Qatar’s hosting of the World Cup soccer tournament in 2022. But as the government seeks to become more efficient, its current spending — recurring expenditure on goods and services — will average about 21.2 percent of gross domestic product in 2018-2022, down from 32.6 percent in 2015, the plan says. The government would run small fiscal surpluses during the period and GDP growth would average between 2.1 and 3.0 percent, with higher private sector investment in response to regulatory reforms compensating for slower growth in the energy sector. The projections assume that average oil and gas prices in 2018-2022 will be in line with their levels in January 2017, when Brent oil was trading around $55 a barrel. That implies there is room for more strength in the economy and state finances than expected; Brent is currently around $65. But the plan says there is no reason to expect noticeable rises above $55 in the medium term, so “rationalisation in public spending will continue until fiscal balance is achieved.” The government ran moderate fiscal deficits in 2016 and 2017 and GDP growth averaged 3.3 percent between 2013 and 2017, according to International Monetary Fund data. The plan predicts Qatar’s current account surpluses will shrink in 2018-2022 as the government and private sector import goods and services for investment projects. This will lead to lower net transfers of money to the sovereign fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, and a fall in the national savings rate to 45.8 percent from 53.5 percent between 2011 and 2016, the plan predicts.

Spreadbetters expected European equities to fare slightly better at the open, with Britain’s FTSE starting unchanged, Germany’s DAX gaining 0.3 percent and France’s CAC rising 0.25 percent.. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.13 percent. The Asian markets took their cues from Wall Street shares, which fell for the third straight session overnight after U.S. President Donald Trump sought to impose fresh tariffs on China, intensifying fears of a trade war. “While U.S. and Chinese officials could be negotiating behind the scenes in an attempt to prevent the situation from worsening, the markets will remain concerned as long as President Trump seems to be going his own way on the matter,” wrote Xiao Minjie, China-focused senior economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. Boeing Co, seen as particularly vulnerable to retaliation from U.S. trade partners, fell 2.5 percent, leading the losers on the Dow. Shanghai lost 0.3 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was flat and Australian stocks fell 0.25 percent. Japan’s Nikkei erased earlier losses and crawled up 0.12 percent. Japan’s equity market “has been holding up relatively well, but it will have to decline some more if U.S. shares deepen their losses,” said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “Bargain hunters buy steadily at price dips, but most participants are wary of chasing highs amid lingering uncertainty about trade and politics.” The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.806 percent and headed for a fourth day of declines amid rising diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia, soft U.S. retail sales data and concerns over Washington’s political and trade issues. The spectre of a trade war also boosted demand for European debt. The German 10-year bund yield was at 0.594 percent after falling to a 1-1/2-month low of 0.583 percent. Yields on British gilts and French government bonds were also lower. In the currency market, the dollar came under pressure again after the greenback managed a modest bounce overnight following three days of losses. The dollar index, which measures it against a basket of six major currencies, was a shade lower at 89.698. So far this week, it has fallen about 0.5 percent, dogged by trade tensions and perceived political turmoil in Washington. The euro edged up 0.05 percent to $1.2373 after being pulled back from a six-day high of $1.2413 when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Wednesday struck a dovish tone on monetary policy. The yen, often sought in times of risk aversion, gained against a variety of peers. The dollar slipped 0.35 percent to 105.960 yen after taking a hit the previous day on Trump’s firing of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The euro fell 0.4 percent to 131.045 yen and the Australian dollar shed 0.5 percent to 83.36 yen. Oil prices held steady, supported by healthy global demand but capped by a relentless rise in U.S. production that is undermining efforts led by producer cartel OPEC to cut supplies and prop up markets. Brent crude futures were flat at $64.89 per barrel. Safe-haven gold rose, with spot prices gaining 0.1 percent to $1,326.16 an ounce.

2018-03-15,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 15 (Reuters) - The tug-of-war between fundamentals and sentiment appears to be getting stronger for many commodities as the market tries to reconcile factors such as robust demand numbers from China and increasingly worrying rhetoric and actions from the United States. Iron ore, steel and copper all performed well on Wednesday after Chinese data showed real estate investment and industrial output rising at a faster than expected pace. Spot iron ore prices in China .IO62-CNO=MB rose 2.7 percent to close at $71.64 a tonne, while London-traded copper futures gained 0.6 percent to $6,988.50 a tonne. China’s real estate investment over the first two months of the year grew 9.9 percent from the same period a year ago, marking the fastest pace since 2015. Industrial output in the January to February period gained 7.2 percent from the same period in 2017, beating the market consensus forecast of a rise of 6.1 percent and coming in well above December’s 6.2 percent growth rate. Given that property and industry are among the major consumers of commodities like steel and copper, the price gains aren’t that surprising as they seem to indicate that China’s economy remains in a healthy state and likely to support strength in commodity imports in coming months. Indeed, China’s imports of major commodities were solid in the first two months of the year, with customs data last week showing iron ore imports up 5.4 percent from the January to February period last year, crude oil up by 10.8 percent, copper by 9.8 percent and coal by 14.4 percent. But despite the strength in China’s commodity demand, prices have at best meandered so far in 2018, with iron ore down 1.3 percent from the end of 2017 to Wednesday’s close, LME copper lower by 3.6 percent and Brent crude oil down by almost 3 percent. While China isn’t the sole factor driving commodity prices, it’s clear that the current positive demand picture isn’t enough to spark, or even sustain, a rally. Instead market participants seem once again focused on the mounting risks posed by geopolitics, particularly in the form of the agenda of U.S. President Donald Trump. The imposition of a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium spooked markets far more than the positive China data supported them. Trump first announced he planned to impose the tariffs on March 1, and iron ore prices fell 11 percent between March 2 and 12, before recovering slightly on the Chinese economic data. China’s exports of steel to the United States are a miniscule 0.1 percent of its total production, so in theory the U.S. tariffs are inconsequential and should have zero to minimal impact on the country’s demand for seaborne iron ore. Yet iron ore prices slumped on the news of Trump’s tariffs, not because of the expected immediate impact on demand, but rather on the concern that the U.S. government is prepared to wage a beggar-thy-neighbour trade war than runs the risk of sparking the next global recession. The potential for Trump’s policies to impact other commodities is also looming large, with the firing of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and his planned with replacement with Central Intelligence Agency head Mike Pompeo raising concerns over the future of Iran’s crude exports. Pompeo is believed to be more aligned to Trump’s view that the deal between Western powers Iran over the Islamic Republic’s nuclear programme was bad, and needs to be re-negotiated. This raises the chance of the U.S. administration de-certifying the nuclear deal, a move that could lead to restrictions on Iran’s crude exports, an eventuality that could tighten the market and raise prices. Brent crude futures didn’t show much reaction to Tillerson’s sacking, gaining a mere 0.4 percent on Wednesday. But what Trump has done for crude oil, and for other commodities, is put geopolitical risk back on the agenda. While it may not yet have displaced the interplay between supply and demand as the main driver of markets, a focus on geopolitics has to be on the radar screen of producers, traders, investors and buyers. Commodity markets with deep and liquid markets, such as crude oil and natural gas, are more at risk of sharp increases in geopolitically-driven volatility, but even those where futures contracts are limited, such as coal, iron ore and liquefied natural gas, will be affected.

2018-03-15,"(Reuters) - Australian rail operator Aurizon Holdings (AZJ.AX) said on Thursday said it was committed to completing the proposed sale of its freight business by July, after the country’s competition watchdog raised concerns about the plan. Aurizon said it would make detailed submissions to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) about the matter, and reiterated that it would close the business if the sale did not go through, with the loss of up to 350 jobs. The regulator said it was concerned the sale, which would combine the only two railway haulers in the state of Queensland, could lead to increased prices and reduced service for freight hauled between the capital Brisbane and the state’s far north. “We are concerned about the impact on competition in the freight industry,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement earlier on Thursday. Aurizon said in August last year that it had decided to quit the loss-making freight business, selling two units for A$220 million ($174 million) and closing a third arm, allowing it to focus on coal haulage. It planned to sell its Queensland rail and road freight business to a consortium of Linfox and Pacific National and its Acacia Ridge intermodal rail terminal separately to Pacific National.  The company said on Thursday that the regulator’s statement was based on the assumption that the freight business could be sold to a third party, but reiterated that was not the case. As well as a loss of jobs, a closure of the business would also be likely to affect rail services and rail line haul capacity in Queensland, potentially disrupting freight supply chains, it said.  The regulator is expected to make a final decision on May 24. Aurizon shares slipped as much as 2.1 percent in early trade before largely recovering in a slightly weaker overall market. .

2018-03-15,"WASHINGTON/OSLO, March 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has bashed international efforts to combat climate change and questioned the scientific consensus that global warming is dangerous and driven by human consumption of fossil fuels. But there is a disconnect between what Trump says at home and what his government does abroad. While attention has been focused on Trump’s rhetoric, State Department envoys, federal agencies, and government scientists remain active participants in international efforts to both research and fight climate change, according to U.S. and foreign representatives involved in those efforts. “We really don’t detect any change with the Americans,” said one of the officials, Aleksi Härkönen of Finland, who chairs the eight-nation Arctic Council’s key group of senior officials, who are charged with protecting a region warming faster than any other on Earth. Over the past year, the United States has helped draft the rulebook for implementing the Paris climate accord, signed international memoranda calling for global action to fight climate change, boosted funding for overseas clean energy projects, and contributed to global research on the dangers and causes of the Earth’s warming. While the United States’ participation in international forums – including the Paris accord and the Arctic Council - has been reported, its continued, broad and constructive support for climate change efforts in these gatherings has not. This business-as-usual approach has surprised some of America’s foreign partners, along with some of Trump’s allies, who had expected the new administration to match its rhetoric with an obstructionist approach to combating climate change. “I am concerned that much of our climate policy remains on autopilot,” complained Trump’s former energy adviser Myron Ebell, now a research director at the right-leaning Competitive Enterprise Institute, who said it reflects a failure by the administration to fill key positions and replace staffers who oppose the president’s agenda. The U.S. efforts abroad to tackle climate change have been counter-balanced by Trump’s aggressive push at home to increase production of the fossil fuels scientists blame for global warming. He has also ordered a wide-ranging rollback of Obama-era climate regulations and appointed a self-described climate skeptic, Scott Pruitt, as the nation’s chief environmental regulator. And to be sure, none of the U.S. dealings in international climate efforts since last year have committed the United States to any emissions cuts that would undermine Trump’s domestic energy agenda. The State Department – which handles the bulk of U.S. climate policy abroad - told Reuters it was still developing its global warming policy under Trump. “The State Department is working with the White House and the interagency to further develop our approach to international climate change diplomacy,” State Department spokesman Ambrose Sayles said in a statement before Trump sacked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Tuesday. “In the meantime, we will continue to participate ... to ensure a level playing field that benefits and protects U.S. interests, and to keep all options open for the President,” Sayles said. Tillerson’s departure leaves a question mark over the future of U.S. climate policy abroad. Tillerson was in favor of the Paris accord, while his successor, Mike Pompeo, has expressed doubts about the science of climate change. Climate advocates say they hope Pompeo will be too distracted by tensions with Iran and North Korea to change the State Department’s approach to climate change. White House spokeswoman Kelly Love declined to comment. Trump announced last year that he was withdrawing the United States from the Paris Agreement to fight global warming, raising concerns among other parties to the deal that Washington might attempt to torpedo the accord or disengage from it completely. That hasn’t happened. Washington sent a 40-strong delegation to talks in Bonn in November to help draft a new rulebook that will provide rules of the road for the 200 participating nations. It was a smaller delegation than Washington had sent to past meetings, but it still won praise from fellow delegates for its work. For example, Andrew Rakestraw – a climate negotiator for the State Department since 2013 - co-chaired discussions on how to ensure that the pledges by signatories are comparable and use the same accounting standards - a point seen as critical to the success of the accord. Nazhat Shameem Khan, chief negotiator for Fiji, which presided over the talks, said the United States delegation was “constructive and helpful.”  The U.N.’s climate chief, Patricia Espinosa, also called the U.S. role constructive. Thomas Shannon, the State Department’s chief climate negotiator in Bonn, did not respond to requests for comment. Rakestraw also did not respond to calls and emails requesting comment. A U.S. source familiar with the U.S. position at the talks, who asked not to be named, said that U.S. delegates in Bonn were pushing an agenda that resembled those of past administrations – stressing that emerging economies like China follow the same rules as developed nations and meet international standards for monitoring and reporting emissions. There was one jarring note: Washington sponsored a side event to promote “clean coal.” Some other delegates said they were unhappy with this, as they wanted the talks to focus on renewable energies. Under the details of the accord, the United States cannot formally withdraw until 2020. The State Department’s delegations to the Arctic Council are also continuing their work in much the same way they did under President Barack Obama - acknowledging that warming is real and should be countered in planning everything from new shipping routes to the protection of indigenous peoples. Some U.S. agencies are also still bolstering international efforts to fight climate change. The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which seeks to advance U.S. policy by financing foreign business ventures, doubled its support for solar projects in 2017 under a climate-friendly policy last updated by the Obama administration. And NASA, the U.S. space agency, continues to research climate change, publish climate change data, and contribute to international reports, spokesman Stephen Cole said. Both OPIC and NASA are independent of the State Department, so would not be under Pompeo’s sway. Scientists representing the United States in international research say they have also been unfettered by the Trump administration, despite concerns early in the Trump presidency that the White House would seek to silence them or restrict their work. “There has been no pressure on U.S. authors,” said one U.S. scientist, who is now helping to write a United Nations report that will call for coal to be “phased out rapidly” to limit global warming -  a direct clash with Trump’s pro-coal agenda. The scientist asked not to be named because the draft report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), due to be released in October, is confidential. “Our U.S. colleagues know that climate change is not a hoax,” said one of the non-U.S. authors of the same report, who also spoke on condition of anonymity. Christopher Field, a professor of environmental studies at Stanford University who co-chaired a 2014 IPCC report on the impacts of climate change, agreed: “I’ve not seen any indication that the climate denialism from Trump and other members of the administration has had any influence ... on the alignment of the U.S. scientific community with the scientific consensus around the world.” Still, scientists worry that while the Trump administration is not interfering with their research it is ignoring it. The Trump administration made no move to block an assessment by 300 experts last year that outlined the threats and causes of warming in the United States and concluded there is “no convincing alternative explanation” for climate change than human activity. “But then they haven’t acknowledged the findings, nor changed their climate science denying stance,” said the U.S. scientist involved in drafting the U.N. coal report.

2018-03-15,"* Deal subject to FID on import terminal - source * Deal is to supply about 1.2 mtpa LNG for about 10 yrs * Hong Kong looks to increase gas in fuel mix to 50 pct by 2020 (Adds details, company comments) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, March 15 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is close to bagging a deal to supply Hong Kong with liquefied natural gas (LNG), beating out major competitors for the right to be the first company to supply LNG to the city. Shell has edged out companies such as Malaysia’s Petronas to supply LNG through a long-term contract to Hong Kong utility CLP Power, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Hong Kong is undertaking a massive shift to using more natural gas to fuel its electric power generation from coal, potentially creating a steady and lucrative demand source in the Asian LNG market. Under the deal, Shell will supply about 1.2 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG for about 10 years starting after 2020, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media. However, the supply agreement will be subject to a final investment decision (FID) for an offshore LNG import terminal that will include a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU), one of the sources said. It was not immediately clear if the deal was binding or a memorandum of understanding. CLP and Petronas did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Shell declined to comment on the specific deal and said it “continuously seeks opportunities to grow and improve profitability”. “This may include talking with third parties from time to time, any conversations are confidential,” a spokeswoman said. As part of its commitment to the Paris Climate Change Agreement, Hong Kong is aiming to increase the use of natural gas in its total fuel mix for power generation to about 50 percent by 2020 from 22 percent as of 2012. Hong Kong currently produces power using imported fuel in domestic power plants or from imported natural gas from the mainland. The country’s coal-fired plants will reach the end of their useful life in the next decade.

2018-03-15,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar energy installations will grow slower than previously expected in the coming years due to the Trump administration’s tariffs on panel imports and new federal tax laws that will restrict investment in the clean energy source, according to a report published on Thursday. Installations between 2018 and 2022 will be 13 percent lower than originally forecast, GTM Research said in the quarterly solar market report it conducts for industry trade group the Solar Energy Industries Association.  It will be years before U.S. solar installations again hit the peak level of 2016, GTM said. The market is not expected to return to the 15.2 gigawatts installed that year at least through 2023. In 2017, the United States installed 10.6 GW of solar, and 2018 is expected to be similar. The slowdown marks a major shift for the solar industry, which has experienced runaway gains in the last decade thanks to government policies that support renewable energy and a sharp fall in the price of the technology.  In 2017, the market fell 30 percent. The decline was widely anticipated because in 2016 developers completed a slew of projects ahead of what was supposed to be an expiration of a key tax credit. Ultimately, the credit was extended. But in January, U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a 30 percent tariff on solar panel imports in a move billed as a way to protect American jobs, but which the solar industry said would raise prices and hurt investment. Large solar projects for utilities are the most vulnerable to the tariffs as panels can account for up to half the cost of their projects. That market is expected to grow this year and in 2019, but remain largely flat between 2020 and 2022 as more projects are procured purely for economic reasons and outside of mandates. “When you increase the price for modules, they are either going to be pushed out to when the tariff expires or shelved for the time being,” Austin Perea, senior solar analyst at GTM, said in an interview. Lower corporate tax rates resulting from the tax overhaul passed by Congress last year will also crimp demand for so-called tax equity financing, a mechanism by which banks and others invest in solar projects to claim the associated 30 percent tax credits and offset their large tax bills.  The tax equity market is a key way solar projects are financed.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.45 percent. The Asian markets took their cues from Wall Street shares, which fell for the third straight session overnight after U.S. President Donald Trump sought to impose fresh tariffs on China, intensifying fears of a trade war. Boeing Co, seen as particularly vulnerable to retaliation from U.S. trade partners, fell 2.5 percent, leading the losers on the Dow. Equity market losses were widespread, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index shedding 0.14 percent overnight and MSCI’s global stock index losing 0.46 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.75 percent, Australian stocks fell 0.4 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.45 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.85 percent but still up roughly 0.6 percent on the week. “The equity market has been holding up relatively well, but it will have to decline some more if U.S. shares deepen their losses,” said Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. “Bargain hunters buy steadily at price dips, but most participants are wary of chasing highs amid lingering uncertainty about trade and politics.” The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 2.806 percent and headed for its fourth day of declines amid rising diplomatic tension between Britain and Russia, soft U.S. retail sales data and concerns over Washington’s political and trade issues. The spectre of a trade war also boosted demand for European debt, with the German 10-year bund yield falling to a 1-1/2-month low of 0.583 percent. Yields on British gilts and French government bonds also fell. In the currency market, the dollar came under pressure again after the greenback managed a modest bounce overnight following three days of losses. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies lost 0.05 percent to 89.655. It was on track to fall about 0.5 percent this week, dogged by trade tensions and perceived political turmoil in Washington. The euro edged up 0.1 percent to $1.2379 after being pulled back from a six-day high of $1.2413 when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi on Wednesday struck a dovish tone regarding monetary policy. The yen, often sought in times of risk aversion, gained against a variety of peers. The dollar slipped 0.4 percent to 105.895 yen after taking a hit the previous day on Trump’s firing of U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. The euro fell 0.3 percent to 131.115 yen and the Australian dollar shed 0.35 percent to 83.46 yen. U.S. crude futures extended gains to rise 0.1 percent to $61.04 per barrel. Brent added 0.05 percent to $64.92 per barrel. Crude was lifted the previous day after data showed a bigger-than-expected fall in U.S. refined product inventories with gasoline demand rising to a seven-month high.

2018-03-15,"* World oil demand to grow by 1.62 million bpd in 2018 -OPEC * But OPEC expects new supply to outpace demand-growth in 2018 * U.S. oil output hits another record, at 10.38 million bpd -EIA * OPEC expects to lose market share as non-OPEC output soars By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Thursday, supported by healthy global demand but held back by the relentless rise in U.S. production that is undermining efforts led by producer cartel OPEC to cut supplies and prop up markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.05 a barrel at 0129 GMT, up 9 cents, or 0.15 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $64.95 per barrel, up 8 cents, or 0.1 percent. Prices were receiving some support from healthy demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Wednesday that oil consumption was expected to grow by 1.62 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018. But looming over markets has been a relentless climb in U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA, which hit another record last week by rising to 10.38 million bpd, up by more than 23 percent since mid-2016. Commercial crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA were up by 5 million barrels, at 430.93 million barrels. U.S. crude production, which has already overtaken that of top exporter Saudi Arabia, is expected to rise above 11 million bpd later this year, taking the top spot from Russia, according to the International Energy Agency. Soaring U.S. output, as well as rising output in Canada and Brazil, is undermining efforts by Middle East dominated OPEC to withhold supplies in order to bolster prices. OPEC on Wednesday raised its forecast for non-member oil supply to almost double the growth predicted four months ago. The group said non-OPEC producers would boost supply by 1.66 million bpd in 2018. But since OPEC expects demand this year to grow by only 1.62 million bpd, that would leave the market slightly oversupplied and may require more or longer supply restraint. OPEC and several other non-OPEC producers led by Russia began cutting supply in January, 2017 to erase a global glut of crude that had built up since 2014. OPEC said its combined output dropped by 77,000 bpd to 32.186 million bpd in February, led by declines in Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela. These cuts and rising U.S. output mean that OPEC is losing market share. “In 2018, demand for OPEC crude is forecast at 32.6 million bpd, down by 0.2 million bpd from the previous assessment and 0.2 million bpd lower than a year earlier,” OPEC said.

2018-03-15,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HyJ1yX By John Kemp LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s decision to replace his secretary of state with a more hawkish figure should have been bullish for oil prices since it increases the probability the nuclear deal with Iran will be abandoned in May. Failure to recertify the deal could lead to the re-imposition of secondary sanctions and pressure from the United States on other countries to reduce their purchases of Iranian crude again. But the decision to replace the secretary of state barely registered on the spot price of Brent crude and the six-month calendar spread continued to soften, suggesting that traders see little impact for the moment. In theory, failure to recertify could remove hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude from the market and cause a significant tightening of the supply-demand balance. For the time being, however, the Trump administration’s increasingly hawkish position on Iran has not been enough to offset the impact of increasing supply from shale. Crude traders may be under-estimating the president’s determination to end what he has termed a “terrible” deal and ratchet up the pressure on Iran. But the president and his new secretary of state, assuming the nominee is confirmed by the U.S. Senate, will still face the same diplomatic constraints in ending the deal and renewing the boycott of Iranian oil. European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, are no more eager than before to abandon the nuclear deal or re-impose broad economic sanctions. Russia is also unlikely to cooperate since relations and cooperation with the United States are at the lowest ebb since the end of the Cold War. And the United States has embarked on a trade war with China, which is further complicating a relationship already beset by multiple other disputes. In the circumstances, traders may have concluded even a failure to recertify the deal will not lead to the removal of a significant amount of crude from the market. They may also have concluded any loss of crude from Iran would be made up by increased production and exports from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Iraq and Russia. Compliance with the OPEC/non-OPEC output curbs has left all these countries with actual or potential spare capacity to increase production to offset any loss from Iran. Corporate tax cuts approved by the U.S. Congress and the president at the end of 2017 have been broadly welcomed by investors and the business community. Tax reductions for businesses and many individual taxpayers should increase the economy’s productive potential as well as stimulating short-term consumption and investment. Overall, the tax reductions should have a positive impact on economic growth and oil consumption in the short term, which should be bullish for oil prices. But the medium term impact is more uncertain because tax reductions are boosting the economy at a time when the business cycle already appears relatively mature. The fiscal stimulus may be accelerating the final stages of the economic cycle and bringing forward the date of the next recession. The current expansion is already the third-longest on record and it will become the second-longest in May 2018 and the longest in July 2019. The business and financial community has broadly welcomed the tax cuts even if it has doubts about other elements of the president’s programme. But the departure of the president’s chief economic adviser and the secretary of state have unsettled the same business leaders who have vocally supported the administration on tax. Most business leaders are opposed to the president’s more populist and nationalist policies even as they support his tax cutting. There is little enthusiasm among business leaders and investors for increased tariffs, tougher restrictions on investment and “de-globalisation”. The administration’s more hawkish and nationalist turn in recent weeks may therefore be fuelling increased concern about the medium-term economic outlook with negative implications for oil demand and prices. Benchmark crude oil prices and calendar spreads have been softening slowly but steadily for the last two months. Global oil consumption is growing rapidly and inventories have fallen, but supply is now expected to increase by more than 2 million barrels per day in 2018. Production from the U.S. shale fields is surging in response to the increase in prices and drilling since the middle of last year. Coupled with extra oil from Canada, Brazil and Norway, production should be more than enough to meet the rise in demand in 2018. Brent spot prices and calendar spreads had been rallying strongly since the end of June 2017 in the expectation the market would move into a sustained supply deficit. But the surge in shale production has made that much less likely and traders have started to revise their expectations for a deficit in the second half of the year. The shift has flowed through into spot prices and more importantly into spreads, which track the supply-demand balance closely. Brent spot prices and spreads have essentially shown no net increase since the middle of December as the earlier rally has stalled (tmsnrt.rs/2HyJ1yX). For the moment, traders see the enormous increase in non-OPEC oil supply this year outweighing any threat from the failure to recertify the Iran deal in May. Hedge fund managers had accumulated a record bullish position in futures and options contracts linked to the price of crude and refined fuels by the middle of January. Some of those positions amounting to around 250 million barrels have been gradually liquidated over the last six weeks, which has kept oil prices under pressure. But hedge funds and other money managers still hold an overall bullish position in crude and fuels amounting to more than 1.2 billion barrels. Bullish positions outnumber bearish ones by a ratio of 10:1. With so many bullish positions overhanging the market, it is proving hard for prices to rally, despite the Trump administration’s increasingly hard-line position on Iran.

The nation’s imports of Iranian oil have faltered in the wake of a technical problem at Iran’s South Pars field last year and after an Iranian oil tanker sank en route to South Korea in January. However, February imports were up 18.3 percent from January. In the first two months of 2018, South Korea’s Iranian oil shipments fell 39.5 percent to 2.07 million tonnes, compared to 3.43 million tonnes over the same period last year, according to the data. South Korea is one of Asia’s major Iranian oil importers and mainly buys condensate, or an utlra-light oil, from the Middle Eastern country. Iran has ramped up its crude and condensate exports since sanctions over its nuclear programme were lifted in 2016. In recent months, Tehran has stepped up efforts to retain its Asian customers amid uncertainties over a potential renewal of U.S. sanctions. Iran’s crude and condensate exports in March were expected to drop to a two-year low as Asia’s demand for its oil softens, according to a person with knowledge of the country’s tanker loading schedule. South Korea’s total February crude oil imports were 12.55 million tonnes, or 3.29 million bpd, up 6.2 percent from 11.81 million tonnes last year, according to the data. South Korea’s oil imports from Kuwait jumped 21.2 percent to 2.19 million tonnes, or 572,947 bpd, from 1.81 million tonnes in 2017. Oil imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude oil supplier, rose 14.5 percent to 4.13 million tonnes in February, or 1.08 million bpd, from 3.61 million tonnes last year. In January-February, South Korea’s crude imports increased 6.7 percent to nearly 25.8 million tonnes, or 3.20 million bpd, versus 24.18 million tonnes at the same time last year.

2018-03-15,"(Updates with World Bank comments in par 12-14) By Nellie Peyton DAKAR, March 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A large-scale United Nations programme to halt deforestation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, home to the world’s second-largest rainforest, is harming local communities and failing to protect forests, land rights researchers said on Wednesday. The U.S.-based group Rights and Resources Initiative (RRI) called on the World Bank to withhold funding from 20 current or pending projects in the province of Mai-Ndombe, which has been a test case for a U.N.-backed conservation scheme known as REDD+. In an area rife with land conflict, an RRI report said the forest protection projects in this western province threatened the rights and incomes of rural women and indigenous groups, including about 73,000 pygmies. “REDD+ was created to both halt deforestation and benefit local communities - yet the current projects in Mai-Ndombe fail to address both objectives,” said Marine Gauthier, the report’s author. A spokesman for the U.N.’s REDD+ programme did not respond to requests for comment. One of the focal cases involves U.S. company Wildlife Works Carbon (WWC), which denied the accusations. The company obtained a large land concession in order to protect a forest from loggers, and uses a share of the money earned from selling carbon credits to benefit people living there, said president Mike Korchinsky. “Millions of dollars of benefits have gone to the communities,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. He said WWC had built schools, invested in medical clinics, and provided years of agricultural support. But Gauthier said local communities, which signed agreements with the company, were not properly consulted, and claimed the project had hindered their farming and other activities. “These communities actually bear the burden of reducing deforestation,” she said. The World Bank said the funding provided by REDD+ and its partners supported some of the poorest Congolese citizens, while contributing to meeting climate goals. “We will review the report’s findings and have no plans to withhold funding at this time,” a World Bank spokesperson said in emailed comments. “The work improves livelihoods, lessens pressure on native forests and reduces emissions of greenhouse gases from deforestation and forest degradation,” the World Bank said. RRI said women and minorities had been worst affected by the REDD+ projects that were up and running, because they often lack formal land rights and are not consulted about decisions. REDD+, or reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation, was one of the solutions to climate change laid out in the 2015 Paris accord. It offers monetary incentives to scale back deforestation. Congo could become the first country to sign a REDD+ deal with the World Bank this year, setting an example for more than 50 developing countries that plan to follow suit, said RRI. However, it warned that deal could exacerbate conflict and set a dangerous global precedent if changes were not made. RRI said it had shared the results and that discussions with donors were underway. (Reporting by Nellie Peyton. Additional reporting by Carey L. Biron in Washington.

2018-03-15,"LONDON, March 15 (Reuters) - Britain should introduce new, more ambitious legislation to tackle poor air quality after failing to deal with the problem, lawmakers said on Thursday. In a joint report, four parliamentary committees said air pollution was a national health emergency and the government has still not produced a plan which adequately addresses it. Under the European Union’s Air Quality Directive, member states were supposed to comply with nitrogen dioxide emission limits in 2010 - or by 2015 if they delivered plans to deal with high levels of the gas, which is produced mainly by diesel engines. The European Commission is reviewing whether to take legal action against nine member states, including Britain, for breaching the rules after they submitted plans to address the issue. “The government’s latest plan does not present an effective response to the scale of the air quality catastrophe in the UK,” said Neil Parish, chairman of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. “We are concerned that the government is treating air quality as a box-ticking exercise. Real change will require bold, meaningful action.” Parish’s committee issued the report along with the parliamentary environmental audit, health and social care, and transport committees. Last month, the High Court ruled that the government plan was inadequate, following a legal complaint from environmental lawyers Client Earth. The report said the government should introduce a new Clean Air Act which improves existing legislation and enshrines the right to clean air in law. It should also establish a fund for clean air initiatives, to be partially financed by the private sector, by the end of this year. The committees also said that although the government has promised to end the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2040, the target is too late to bring about changes in industry and local government planning, and should be brought forward.
