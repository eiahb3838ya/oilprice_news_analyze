2018-05-30,"RIO DE JANEIRO, May 30 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government on Wednesday received no bids for three year-long contracts to buy oil cargo it received from companies producing in deepwater pre-salt fields, after a recent change in rules makes it illegal to buy the oil below reference prices. The auction was supposed to mark the inaugural sale of oil pledged to the government by companies producing in the pre-salt, where billions of barrels of crude are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. The first cargoes from the three areas total some 1.63 million barrels. Royal Dutch Shell was the only company that registered to participate, Reuters reported last week. The company, which has stakes in all three offshore fields from which the oil at auction was produced, declined to comment. A law approved last week eliminated the possibility of selling oil at a discount from reference prices set by oil regulator ANP. As production increases from Brazil’s offshore fields, the government will receive increasing volumes of oil it will need to sell. Brazil produces nearly 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd), with pre-salt production, currently at about 1.4 million bpd, expected to rise to more than 5 million bpd by 2026. The world’s top international oil firms have bid aggressively for rights to develop pre-salt fields in the past year. Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell and BP Plc have all taken big stakes in offshore oilfields in the past year. The oil would have been sold by Pre-sal Petroleo SA, the state company managing contracts to develop the pre-salt layer. The winner of the three oil contracts at auction would have been required to purchase all the government’s share of output from the three fields for a year, paying the government for each load. About 1.63 million barrels of oil up for auction were from the Mero area which is located in the Libra field of the Santos basin. It is being developed by a consortium that includes Petrobras with 40 percent, Shell and France’s Total SA each with 20 percent, and Chinese state oil companies CNOOC Ltd and China National Petroleum Corp each holding 10 percent. The Sapinhoa field in the Campos basin accounted for 120,000 barrels. Petrobras has a 40 percent stake, Repsol Sinopec has 25 percent, and Royal Dutch Shell holds 30 percent. Some 600,000 barrels came from the Lula field in the Santos basin, operated by Petrobras, with a 65 percent stake. Shell has a 25 percent stake there while Petrogal has 10 percent. Brazilian rules dictate that companies vying for stakes in the prolific pre-salt must bid by promising a share of oil production to the government.

2018-05-30,"(Recasts with efforts to resume operations; adds Paranaguá information) By Ana Mano and José Roberto Gomes SAO PAULO, May 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian commodities exporters were scrambling to resume operations after striking truckers protesting high fuel prices slowly returned to work in Latin America’s largest economy. Terminal operators at Santos port said on Wednesday that truckers had not yet resumed loading and unloading goods after the movement started to unwind following an agreement to cut fuel taxes and lower diesel prices at the pump. “Truckers are parked at many points, apparently awaiting orders or better conditions to continue their journeys,” said Sopesp, an association representing port operators at Santos, the country’s busiest port. Paranaguá port administrators, Brazil’s second busiest hub for exports of commodities like soybeans, estimated 643,000 tonnes of products had not been shipped during the protests, which started on May 21. The port said 280,000 tonnes of soybeans and soymeal that should have been loaded onto six vessels during the last days had not arrived at the terminals. The situation underscores the shortcomings of Brazil’s logistical system, which relies mainly on trucks to move about 60 percent of the country’s cargo. The world’s largest soy exporter, Brazil is forecast to sell 72 million tonnes of the oilseeds in global markets this year, according to projections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Some 63 soy crushing units had ground to a halt as a result of the protests and remained shut pending deliveries of raw materials, said Abiove, the trade group representing processors and grain handlers like Bunge Inc and Cargill Ltd. Abiove said operations would gradually return to normal as truckers were expected to resume deliveries of raw materials in the next few hours. “A week, maybe 10 days will be needed for grain shipments to resume at the ports,” Lucas Trindade, a spokesperson for exporting group Anec, said. Anec said soybean exporters may declare “force majeure”  on shipments, a contractual clause that releases them from obligations because of events beyond their control. Coffee exports from Brazil, the world’s largest producer, in May are likely to be 900,000 60-kg bags below expectations due to the protests, according to exporters association Cecafé. A manager for a leading coffee exporter at Santos, who asked not to be named, said there were hardly any coffee deliveries at exporting terminals during the last 10 days. Coffee is exported on containers, which are carried by trucks from warehouses to the port.

2018-05-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged on Wednesday, shrugging off an unexpected build in U.S. crude stockpiles and rebounding from a four-day slump as Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply. Brent LCOc1 settled up $2.11, or 2.8 percent, at $77.50 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 gained $1.48, or 2.2 percent, to $68.21. Data from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) showed that U.S. crude inventories rose unexpectedly last week, increasing by 1 million barrels against analyst expectations of a 525,000-barrel decline. [API/S] Prices were little changed in post-settlement trading despite the surprise stock build.  Oil has been pressured by reports that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia may ease up on output cuts in place since January 2017. The cuts have driven down global inventories and boosted prices, with global benchmark Brent reaching a 3-1/2-year high of $80.50 a barrel on May 17. On May 25, sources told Reuters that Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising oil output from OPEC and allied non-OPEC countries by around 1 million bpd.  On Wednesday, however, the Russian central bank said falling oil prices would pose a risk to the country’s financial sector. “It seems that somebody in the central bank is taking notice of the big drop in oil prices and sending a signal of, ‘Hey, wait a second. We don’t want these prices to fall too far,’” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 rose to as much as $9.31, with Brent supported as investors worried that U.S. sanctions could be cutting crude supplies from Iran. “There’s more concern on the Brent side that supply losses from Iran are harder to be made up,” Flynn said. India’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said. In Brazil, the FUP oil workers union said workers had joined the call for a nationwide strike on at least 20 oil rigs in the lucrative Campos basin and other areas of the country. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente and a change to company fuel pricing policies. The company said production was not affected. Last week there was a strike by Brazilian truckers over high diesel prices. Ongoing unrest could threaten demand for fuels in Brazil, which U.S. data showed was the No. 8 energy consumer in 2016.

2018-05-30,"DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s chief executive said on Wednesday he hopes the new attorney general in New York “comes to a different conclusion” than predecessor Eric Schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. Schneiderman, who resigned earlier this month here after allegations of physical abuse by four women that he denied, had alleged Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew. Exxon has long denied the charges here The investigation has spread to other states, including Massachusetts, and has put Exxon squarely in the middle of the ongoing debate about fossil fuels and climate change. CEO Darren Woods, who spoke at Exxon’s annual shareholder meeting in Dallas, said he was “committed to being part of the solution on climate change.” Woods added he had not reached out to Barbara Underwood, who was appointed to replace Schneiderman. He said he was not sure if Exxon attorneys have talked to Underwood or her office. “I’m real confident on where we stand. I hope whoever comes in steps back and takes an objective look ... and comes to a different conclusion,” Woods said. Underwood, a Democrat appointed by the New York State Legislature, has said she would not run for election to a full term this November. At least six candidates of various political backgrounds have announced their candidacies. “Let’s see what that election brings,” Woods said. Underwood’s office said on Wednesday that the Exxon climate probe was ongoing. “Our office’s work has continued without interruption, and that certainly includes the Exxon investigation,” said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for the New York attorney general. New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who oversees state pension funds that hold about 11.5 million Exxon shares, has also long criticized the company’s response to climate change and voted against a slate of 10 board nominees at the company’s annual meeting.  ""The fund cannot support board directors who refuse to acknowledge substantial risks to Exxon's bottom line and fail to help it transition to a lower carbon future,"" DiNapoli said in a statement.

2018-05-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks staged a recovery on Wednesday, buoyed by optimism that Italy may avoid a potentially damaging general election. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.67 percent, lifted by a rebound in both Europe and the United States. The recovery was partly driven by news that Italy’s two anti-establishment parties were renewing efforts to form a government, rather than force the country to the polls for the second time this year. The prospect that no government would be formed, leading to elections that could be a referendum on Italy’s euro membership, had sent short-term Italian bond yields up by the most in nearly 26 years. Yet investors were in a buying mood on Wednesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 306.33 points, or 1.26 percent, to 24,667.78, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 34.15 points, or 1.27 percent, to 2,724.01 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 65.86 points, or 0.89 percent, to 7,462.45. [.N] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.23 percent. “The political problems in Italy heighten the risk of a systematic problem within the euro zone and within the euro zone financial system, but that is still a risk rather than a probability,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Another positive was a smooth auction of Italian debt that raised 5.57 billion euros, easing concerns about Rome’s ability to finance itself. Japan’s biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen (£33.1 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings. Milan-listed equities snapped a five-day losing streak and bounced 2 percent .FTMIB while short-dated Italian bond yields IT2YT=RR - a sensitive gauge of political risk - fell more than four-tenths a percent from half-decade highs. Jason Browne, chief investment strategist at FundX Investment Group LLC, said investors were on the look out for news such as the Italian volatility that could point to an end to a bull market led by large tech stocks. But betting against the market usually ended up painfully. “The bigger picture over the last eight years has really been large-cap U.S. growth dominated, and I think everybody’s always looking for a change,” he said. “Then we get some news that comes out and we start to see evidence of that change, but each and every time those have tended to be a bit of a pain trade.” Browne said he expects volatility to continue. The Italian election risk had also sent investors scurrying for safer German and U.S. government bonds, as well as currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, at the expense of the euro. That safe-haven trend receded on Wednesday, with the euro bouncing nearly one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its Tuesday losses, which had taken it down to 10-month lows EUR=EBS. It also rose against the Swiss franc EUFCHF= and yen EURJPY=. Safe-haven bonds lost some of their appeal, too, after posting the best total returns in about seven years in massive trading the day prior. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 21/32 in price to yield 2.8423 percent, from 2.768 percent late on Tuesday. U.S. economic growth slowed slightly more than initially thought, with gross domestic product at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, and consumer spending rising at its weakest pace in nearly five years. Yet U.S. stock investors ignored that and ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict. Energy shares rose as oil prices rebounded after Russia’s central bank expressed caution on plans to boost oil supply and analysts forecast a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories. U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 2.41 percent to $68.34 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $77.89, up 3.18 percent on the day. The S&P energy index .SPNY rose 3.11 percent. The celebratory mood did little to support Asian and emerging markets. Emerging market stocks lost 1.03 percent. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.11 percent lower, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.52 percent.

2018-05-30,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s decision to buy Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd’s Trans Mountain pipeline was brought about by a “particularly problematic” situation and is not a symbol of how things get done in the country, the finance minister said on Wednesday. Canada on Tuesday agreed to buy the pipeline for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in an effort to save a project that faces formidable opposition from environmentalists and British Columbia officials worried the pipeline could spill its tar-like heavy oil. Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the decision was exceptional and that the rule of law needs to be seen as a business advantage to investing in Canada. “We don’t see this as a symbol of the way to get things done in this country,” Morneau told a business audience in Calgary, home to Canada’s energy industry. He was briefly interrupted by several anti-pipeline protesters. But Perrin Beatty, chief executive of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said the government needs to revamp the “badly broken” regulatory system for major energy projects. He said the Liberal government’s planned reforms are not sufficient to preclude the repeat of another situation like Trans Mountain. “We have to have a system where it’s possible to get an answer and where it’s possible to act on that answer,” Beatty said. “What we’ve been getting in Canada is decision by delay.” Morneau said that while the government will listen to bidders for the pipeline in the short-term, its sale will depend on being certain that it will get built. Ottawa has said it does not intend to own the project in the long-term. Morneau reiterated that multiple potential investors have approached the government. He gave no specifics, though he said pension funds and aboriginal groups have approached him personally.  The planned expansion of Trans Mountain would nearly triple the capacity, running from Alberta’s oil sands to the Pacific province of British Columbia, which is opposed to the project. The federal government has repeatedly said the project is in the national interest. But opposition in British Columbia threaten to further delay the project, which was approved by the federal government in 2016. British Columbia’s Premier John Horgan told broadcaster Global News on Wednesday that he “rejected” the idea that his relationship with the federal government has deteriorated over the dispute. “We disagree on one issue,” Horgan said.

2018-05-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has asked OPEC to support it against new U.S. sanctions and signalled it is not yet in agreement with Saudi Arabia’s views on the possible need to increase global oil supplies, creating potential problems for OPEC at its meeting next month. Iran, the arch-rival of Saudi Arabia, has a history of being difficult at OPEC meetings including in 2015 when the country refused to sign up to OPEC policies, saying it needed to raise output due to the easing of sanctions following Tehran’s accord with major world powers. U.S. President Donald Trump earlier this month pulled out of that nuclear deal with Iran and announced the “highest level” of sanctions against the OPEC member. Iran is the third-largest oil producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. “I would like to ... seek OPEC’s support in accordance with Article 2 of the OPEC Statute, which emphasises safeguarding the interests of member countries individually and collectively,” Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said in a letter seen by Reuters.  Zanganeh also suggested in the letter that Iran was not in agreement with some OPEC ministers’ recent comments on the oil market. He said some OPEC ministers “have implicitly or unwittingly spoken for the organisation, expressing views that might be perceived as the official position of the OPEC.” The energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said last week they were prepared to ease output cuts to calm consumer worries about supply. Raising output would bring an end to about 18 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that oil price have risen too far. Oil price have hit their highest since late 2014, rising above $80.50 a barrel this month, but have since eased.[O/R] Since the original sanctions were lifted, Iran has struggled to raise production above 4 million barrels per day due to a lack of new projects and the caution of Western investors. So if OPEC decides to increase supplies, Iran is likely to benefit less than Saudi Arabia because it would struggle to raise output while it would also be hit by lower oil prices. Zanganeh’s letter was addressed to the United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds OPEC presidency in 2018. Zanganeh also said that if the latest U.S. sanctions threat was resolved “Iran reserves the right to return to its oil market share in the shortest possible time and resumes its normal production-level and will not accept any limitations in this regard.” Zanganeh asked Mazrouei to include a separate agenda item for the June OPEC meeting entitled “OPEC Ministerial Conference support to the Member Countries that are under illegal, unilateral and extraterritorial sanctions.” In a separate letter, Mazrouei replied that there were two options available to discuss this issue.  The first is for the OPEC governors to review the request and include it for discussion in OPEC’s meeting later this year, which could be held in November, according to the letter seen by Reuters.  The second option is to include it in the June meeting under “any other business” as a “Request from the Islamic Republic of Iran”, Mazrouei said, suggesting it will not be on the main agenda for the ministers.  OPEC governors meet next in October.

2018-05-30,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department is repealing a rule, finalized in the closing days of the Obama administration as part of the fight against global warming, requiring states to track greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles on the nation’s highways. In a notice posted Wednesday in the Federal Register, the Federal Highway Administration, which is part of the Transportation Department, said it was repealing the rule. The repeal becomes effective at the end of June. A coalition of states in 2017, including California, Massachusetts, Iowa and Washington, had sued to force the Trump administration to continue to enforce the rule, which they agreed to do, pending a formal process to rescind it. The administration said it was reversing the Obama rule because it “imposed costs with no predictable level of benefits.” The Natural Resources Defense Council had said the rule was a “common-sense tool to curb carbon pollution from transportation.” The group said the administration should work with “planners nationwide to clean up the air, protect our health and provide smarter transportation options for Americans such as more public transit, bikeways and pedestrian walkways.” Under the Obama rule, roughly 400 state transportation departments and metropolitan planning organizations were required to track the annual number of tons of carbon dioxide emitted from on-road vehicles traveling on the national highway system and assess traffic congestion — with initial reports due by October 2018. The move was aimed at states considering greenhouse gas emissions as it used federal funds for highway improvements. States were also directed to set two or four-year emissions-reduction targets, although no binding emissions targets were set under the rule. The American Road & Transportation Builders Association on Wednesday praised the decision. The group had raised concerns about the system and “what exactly it will measure and how it will measure it.” The transportation sector accounted for just over a third of all U.S. carbon emissions in 2016. The Trump administration plans to recommend in the coming weeks freezing vehicle greenhouse gas emission requirements at 2020 levels through 2026, a proposal that has drawn outrage from Democrats and environmental groups. [nL1N1S41Z2] President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, in June 2017 said the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement. The United States, under former President Barack Obama, had pledged as part of the Paris accord to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2025 to help slow global warming.

2018-05-30,"MILAN/MADRID, May 30 (Reuters) - Gas Natural has given up on a long-standing project to build a liquefied natural gas facility in northern Italy after years of slow progress and the sale of its Italian businesses, the company said on Wednesday. A Gas Natural spokeswoman said it made no sense to keep the LNG project on the company’s books when it no longer had a network and assets in Italy. Last year, Gas Natural sold its gas distribution and retail businesses in Italy in a deal worth more than 1 billion euros ($1.16 billion). The spokeswoman also said there had been no advances made in the project since environmental clearance had been obtained in 2009. Red tape and grass root opposition in Italy have chased off several foreign investors in recent years seeking to build infrastructure in Italy, including BG Group which had tried to build an LNG terminal in the southern city of Brindisi. Local opposition is currently holding up work to construct the Italian end of the Trans Adriatic Pipeline that is scheduled to bring Azeri gas to Italy in 2020. The environment manager of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region, where the terminal would have been built, said in comments on the region’s website he was satisfied with the Spanish group’s decision. “The decision of Gas Natural is perfectly in line with the strategic programme of the region’s current governor in the election campaign,” Fabio Scoccimarro said. “It is a position shared also by all the political parties in recent years,” he said. The LNG project, first presented in 2004, had envisaged the building of a regasification terminal in the port of Zaule in Trieste with a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres of gas per year. The 5-Star Movement, the biggest party in Italy’s recent inconclusive elections, has said it sees gas playing a gradually smaller role as renewable energy and energy efficiency come to the fore.

2018-05-30,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece has received five expressions of interest for a majority stake in its biggest oil refiner Hellenic Petroleum (HEPr.AT), the country’s privatizations agency said on Wednesday. Greece last month launched a tender to sell at least 50.1 percent of Hellenic in one of the biggest asset sales under Athens’ three international bailouts since 2010.  Initial interest was submitted by Alrai Group Holdings Limited, a consortium comprising Carbon Asset Management DWC-LLC and Alshaheen Group, Gupta Family Group Alliance, Glencore Energy UK (GLEN.L) and Vitol Holding B.V., the agency said. Greece and Paneuropean Oil and Industrial Holding are jointly selling a stake of at least 50.1 percent in the refiner. Hellenic is Europe’s third biggest oil refiner based on its market value of 2.2 billion euros. Paneuropean Oil owns 45.5 percent and the Greek government holds a 35.5 percent stake.   The deadline for making submissions expired at 1400 GMT on Wednesday. Sources have said that Greece and Paneuropean Oil want to maintain a stake of about 15 percent each in Hellenic. The exact size of the holding to be sold will not be disclosed until short-listed investors are invited to submit binding offers. The agency said its advisers would evaluate the expressions of interest and make recommendations to its board of directors on the companies qualifying for the next phase of the tender.

2018-05-30,"COLOMBO, May 30 (Reuters) - Sri Lanka on Wednesday signed an agreement with a subsidiary of U.S. firm Schlumberger for a $50 million seismic study off the country’s east coast to evaluate any prospective oil resources, a senior government official said. Sri Lanka signed the agreement with Eastern Echo DMCC, a subsidiary of Schlumberger, to carry out seismic data acquisition surveys, advance data processing and interpretation work or modelling of petroleum systems. “The main objective of entering into this agreement is to acquire more petroleum data using modern acquisition and processing techniques,” Arjuna Ranatunga, Minister of Petroleum Resources Development told reporters after signing the agreement in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo. Ranatunga also said that the company would invest at least $50 million for several data acquisition projects, including 2D and 3D seismic, in selected offshore areas around Sri Lanka and would recover the investment from sales proceeds to multiple investors. This agreement follows comments on May 4 from the Director general at Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat (PRDS) Vajira Dassanayake, who said Sri Lanka would sign agreements with French oil company Total and Eastern Echo DMCC for a seismic study off its east coast. Sri Lanka first signed a deal with Total in 2016 to conduct a study off the eastern coast but this did not take place. Total had earlier signed a two-year agreement with PRDS to survey around 50,000 sq km off the east coast from the air, at a cost of $25 million to acquire data on unexplored areas. Dassanayake earlier in May said Total would invest $3 million to $10 million for the seismic study, while Eastern Echo DMCC would carry out the marine survey. Officials from Total and Schlumberger did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Sri Lanka produces no oil and is dependent on imports for all of its fuel requirements, despite trying to reinvigorate oil and gas exploration after its 25-year civil war with Tamil separatists ended nine years ago.

Schneiderman, who resigned earlier this month here after allegations of physical abuse by four women that he denied, had alleged Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew. Exxon has long denied the charges here The investigation has spread to other states, including Massachusetts, and has put Exxon squarely in the middle of the ongoing debate about fossil fuels and climate change. CEO Darren Woods, who spoke at Exxon’s annual shareholder meeting in Dallas, said he was “committed to being part of the solution on climate change.” Woods added he has not reached out to Barbara Underwood, who was appointed to replace Schneiderman. He said he was not sure if Exxon attorneys have talked to Underwood or her office. “I’m real confident on where we stand. I hope whoever comes in steps back and takes an objective look ... and comes to a different conclusion,” Woods said. Underwood, a Democrat appointed by the New York State Legislature, has said she will not run for election to a full term this November. At least six candidates of various political backgrounds have announced their candidacies. “Let’s see what that election brings,” Woods said.

2018-05-30,"(Recasts, adds detail) MOSCOW/SOFIA, May 30 (Reuters) - The second line of the TurkStream gas pipeline, intended to ship Russian gas to southern European countries, will be directed to Bulgaria, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov announced on Wednesday after talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. The gas pipeline is part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, currently the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe, and strengthen its foothold on European gas markets. The proposed second line of the existing Nord Stream pipeline via the Baltic Sea is also part of these efforts, which would deprive Ukraine of most of its transit revenues. Russian gas giant Gazprom, which supplies around 34 percent of the European gas market, built the first line of the TurkStream pipeline to Turkey for local gas consumption. “The second fork of TurkStream will reach Bulgaria and through it Russian gas will come from Russia,” Borissov said on his Facebook page, ending speculation that the pipeline might have headed to Greece. “I am thankful that we are returning to the gas distribution role that we had in the Balkans,” he said. The two lines of TurkStream will each have an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres. Gazprom has completed the first line of TurkStream and Putin said about half of the second line had been built. Bulgaria would like a portion of the gas to go to its gas hub project at the Black Sea port of Varna, Borissov said. Sofia’s plans for the hub are backed by the European Commission. They followed the cancellation in 2014 of Gazprom’s South Stream gas pipeline project, which would have shipped Russian gas under the Black Sea via Bulgaria to central Europe. “Gas will be used through the gas hub in Varna. The market and demand will define the quantities and prices. Our aim is to...be on the map for gas distribution,” Borissov said.

2018-05-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - A robust bounceback in Italian stocks helped lift European equities on Wednesday as investors recovered from the previous day’s sharp selloff and digested the possibility of a new Italian election as early as July.     Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB index came back from the previous day's losses with a 2.1 percent rise, but the market was still down 2.7 percent so far this week and had given up all the gains made in 2018.   Major Italian parties called for a new election in July as last-minute efforts to form a government showed little sign of succeeding on Wednesday. [nL5N1T11FL] Worries that a repeat election could become a de facto referendum on the euro have hit European stocks this week, with Italy's benchmark FTSE MIB .FTMIB touching its lowest level since July 2017 on Tuesday. “It’s taken the shine off markets which had been going very well recently, but at the moment I would say the sell-off looks to be of a smaller order than we’ve seen in previous incarnations of the euro zone crisis,” Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. Italian banks .FTIT8300, which dropped 4.7 percent in the previous session, rose 2.7 percent following five straight days of losses. Big lenders Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and Unicredit (CRDI.MI) delivered the strongest boosts to Italian stocks, while Mediobanca MDMI.MI and Finecobank (FBK.MI) led the index with 7.1 and 6.4 percent gains. The pan-European STOXX 600  index ended the day up 0.3 percent, while Germany's DAX .GDAXI jumped 0.9 percent. Atif Latif, director of trading at Guardian Stockbrokers, said that while he did not see a risk of contagion to other markets, volatility could remain as Italy seeks a resolution to its political crisis. “Risk off remains so (we) would use this as an opportunity to buy good quality names caught in the crossfire,” Latif added.     Volatility on Italy’s FTSE MIB index climbed to its highest premium over Eurostoxx 50 volatility as a result of the sell-off, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note.  Spanish banks, which had fallen in concert with Italian lenders on Tuesday as investors dumped peripheral financials, also staged a recovery on Wednesday. Santander (SAN.MC) and BBVA (BBVA.MC) rose 0.6 to 1.1 percent. Euro zone financials .SX7E overall fell 0.1 percent however, in their sixth straight day of losses as investors remained wary of bank stocks which would be worst hit by any systemic risks to the euro zone. While the focus remained firmly on politics, Vivendi (VIV.PA) was the biggest faller, down nearly 4 percent after its subsidiary Canal+ was left empty-handed in a crucial soccer broadcasting rights auction in France on Tuesday. Bayer (BAYGn.DE) meanwhile drove gains on Germany’s DAX, rising 3.9 percent after winning U.S. approval for its takeover of Monsanto, set to create by far the largest seeds and pesticides maker in the world. A recovery in crude prices helped buoy the oil sector .SXEP up to lead Europe with a 2 percent gain, supporting the STOXX. Oil majors BP (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) were the top boosts, up 1.7 to 2.6 percent.

2018-05-30,"NEW DELHI/LONDON (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran, two sources familiar with the matter said, in a sign that new U.S. sanctions are forcing buyers to shun oil purchases from Tehran. Reliance’s move, expected to take effect in October or November, came after U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned a 2015 nuclear agreement this month and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Tehran. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. India has said it does not follow U.S. sanctions but companies with links to the U.S. financial system could be liable to penalties if they do not comply. Reliance, an Indian conglomerate controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has significant exposure to the financial system of the United States, where it operates some subsidiaries that are linked to its oil and telecom businesses among others. Reliance, whose modern refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat can process about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, has told officials of the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) that the firm would stop oil imports from Tehran in October or November, one of the sources said. A second source said the company could halt imports from Iran earlier than that if European nations and Tehran failed to salvage the nuclear deal. This source said that some insurance companies have asked Reliance to end exposure to Iran before November. Global insurers have already warned about doing business with Iran while some shipping lines have said they would not take new bookings for Iran. The United States has threatened to impose sanctions on European companies that do business with Iran. In the interim period until it stops buying Iranian oil, Reliance has asked NIOC to supply Iranian oil in vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC), the sources said. The sources did not wish to be identified as the matter is sensitive. Reliance did not respond to an email from Reuters seeking comment. In 2017, Reliance’s oil imports from Iran surged by about 45 percent to 67,000 bpd, according to ship tracking data. In Jan-April 2018, the company has imported about 96,000 bpd. Washington’s withdrawal from the nuclear deal has spurred global insurers and other companies to rethink their dealings in Iran as they await further guidance from the United States and European Union.  Earlier this month French energy giant Total (TOTF.PA) said it might quit a multi-billion-dollar gas project if it could not secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), which last June signed a provisional agreement with Tehran to conduct oil and gas feasibility studies, has said it had no plans for new projects in Iran. Reliance, which deals with some of the top-notch foreign bankers with huge exposure to the U.S. financial system, exports fuel to the United States and imports ethane from there for its petrochemical plants. Trade sources have said Reliance recently bought up to 8 million barrels of U.S. crude. After a gap of six years, Reliance resumed purchases from Iran in 2016 when Western powers eased restrictions on trade with Iran in return for the OPEC member agreeing to end its disputed nuclear programme. During previous sanctions NIOC waived a condition for its oil buyers to open letters of credit.  Since the lifting of sanctions, it has been selling oil in euros, a move that has allowed companies to temporarily continue dealing with Iran, despite the U.S. move to reimpose sanctions. Iran is also offering deep discounts on sales to recoup market share in Asia, lost to key rivals Saudi Arabia and Iraq. The company’s global depository receipts are traded in the U.S. market. It is also the first Asian company to float 50- and 100-year bonds on the U.S. debt market, according to its annual report.

2018-05-30,"(Repeats without changes) LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - French oil major Total has two months to seek exemption from U.S. sanctions after Washington’s withdrawal from the international nuclear deal, Iran’s oil minister told state news agency SHANA on Wednesday. The minister, Bijan Zanganeh, added that failure to secure an exemption would mean that China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the South Pars gas project, lifting its own interest from 30 percent to more than 80 percent. The United States this month said it would impose new sanctions against oil and gas producer Iran after abandoning the 2015 agreement that limited Tehran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for sanctions relief. “Total has 60 days to negotiate with the U.S. government,” Zanganeh said, adding that the French government could also lobby Washington. Total signed a contract in 2017 to develop phase 11 of the South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion - a contract Tehran repeatedly hailed as a symbol of the nuclear deal’s success. A spokesman for Total told Reuters: “On May 16, we said that in accordance with our contractual commitments vis a vis the Iranian authorities, Total was engaging with the French and U.S. authorities to examine the possibility of a project waiver.” “It is the process and timing that was agreed upon in the SP 11 contract in case there would be sanctions. We activated the process planned in the contract,” he added. He did not give any further details. Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanne said last week that the only way for the company to continue their project in Iran would be to have a special waiver, but added that “it’s quite unlikely.” European powers still see the nuclear accord as the best chance of stopping Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon and have intensified efforts to save the pact. Zanganeh also said on state television that an agreement with Europe would inspire other potential buyers of Iranian oil. “Europe is buying only one third of Iranian oil, but an agreement with Europe is important to guarantee our sales, and find insurance for the ships ferrying the crude. Other buyers would also be inspired by this,” he said.

2018-05-30,"(Reuters) - MidAmerican Energy Co will become the first U.S. investor-owned utility to source 100 percent of its customers’ electricity needs from renewable energy when it completes a $922 million wind farm in 2020, the company said on Wednesday. The utility owned by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc began investing in wind power about 15 years ago to both hedge against volatile fuel prices and generate more pollutant-free power, its chief executive said, adding that federal tax credits for renewable projects have kept costs low. “We have not had to raise customers’ rates, and that’s a big part of the way we evaluate these projects,” MidAmerican CEO Adam Wright said in an interview. “We’re not building wind just for the sake of building wind.” The company, based in Des Moines, Iowa, serves 770,000 electric customers. With the completion of the utility’s twelfth wind project, MidAmerican will generate enough renewable energy to equal the amount consumed by customers in its Iowa service territory. Because of the intermittency of electricity generated by wind, the utility will continue to use its existing natural gas, nuclear and coal-fired power plants, MidAmerican said, adding that it is seeking sites to add more wind farms. Wind power accounts for more than 35 percent of the electricity generated in Iowa, more than any other U.S. state.

2018-05-30,"DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) shareholders rejected a proposal on Wednesday that would have split the roles of chairman and chief executive, securing CEO Darren Woods’s role as he looks to improve results at the world’s largest publicly traded oil producer. Woods, who became chairman and CEO in January 2017, has struggled to recover from failed bets taken by his predecessor Rex Tillerson, the former U.S. secretary of state, that resulted in billions of dollars in write-downs and a stock price that has lagged peers. Exxon under Woods has moved aggressively to launch major expansion programs to find and produce new reserves of oil and natural gas, as well as expand the company’s refining and chemical footprint. Woods in March told Wall Street investors that the expansions should help double Exxon’s earnings by 2025 to about $31 billion (23.3 billion pounds).  Still, Exxon’s first-quarter earnings fell short of expectations as weakness in its chemical and refining operations offset a boost from higher crude prices CLc1. By voting to keep the roles combined, shareholders effectively gave support to Woods to lead the board and employees as they jointly try to meet those goals.      “No one in our industry can match our opportunity set today,” Woods told fellow shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in Dallas.  Shares of Exxon rose 3.4 percent to $81.13 on Wednesday after an analyst upgraded the company’s stock, saying its low valuation relative to peers presented a buying opportunity. Woods vowed that he would continue to work to address climate change, especially through biofuels research. But outside the Dallas meeting, about 30 people gathered to protest what they said was Exxon’s lack of accountability for its impact on global climate change. There were no climate-related proposals for Exxon’s shareholders to consider at this year’s meeting after one was approved last year requiring an annual carbon report. Protesters on Wednesday said they were biding their time this year. “There’s not a lot of optimism they’ll (Exxon executives) will make good on it, but if they don’t, we’ll be back next year with an even stronger shareholder proposal,” said Molly Rooke, a former Exxon employee who now volunteers with the environmental group 350.org. Rooke’s fellow protesters held a bevy of signs outside the meeting emblazoned with such slogans as “Exxon Mobil, Climate Criminal” and “Arrest Exxon.” Shareholders also rejected a proposal that would have forced Exxon to provide greater disclosure on its lobbying expenditures and change its bylaws to how special meetings are called.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.21 points, or 0.82 percent, to 24,560.66, the S&P 500 gained 25.37 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,715.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.50 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,457.09. The recovery was partly driven by news that Italy’s two anti-establishment parties were renewing efforts to form a government, rather than force the country to the polls for the second time this year. Another positive was a smooth auction of Italian debt that raised 5.57 billion euros, easing concerns about Rome’s ability to finance itself. “(The auction) clearly indicates that investors still have faith in the Italian economy, if not the government,” said Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors. But she warned that political uncertainty would remain elevated. Japan’s biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings. Milan-listed equities snapped a five-day losing streak and bounced almost 2 percent while short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - fell more than half a percent from half-decade highs. They had suffered their worst day in nearly 26 years on Tuesday. Ten-year Italian yields slipped 0.18 percentage points. The risk for investors is that eurosceptic political parties are further boosted, with any election viewed as a de facto referendum on Italy’s euro membership. The events have evoked memories of the 2011-2012 euro debt crisis, with potentially huge implications for the single currency. The risks had sent investors scurrying for safer German and U.S. government bonds as well as currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, at the expense of the euro. That safe-haven trend receded on Wednesday, with the euro bouncing nearly one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its Tuesday losses, which had taken it down to 10-month lows . It also rose against the Swiss franc and yen respectively. “The political problems in Italy heighten the risk of a systematic problem within the euro zone and within the euro zone financial system, but that is still a risk rather than a probability,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The improved mood encouraged investors to sell U.S. and German bonds, reversing some of the 0.15-0.20 percentage point yield rises seen on Tuesday. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 19/32 in price to yield 2.835 percent, from 2.768 percent late on Tuesday. The German bund benchmark last fell 19/32 in price to yield 0.337 percent. Most investors remain cautious though, with Goldman Sachs cutting its forecast for the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar due to Italian political developments. It said it now expected the euro to trade at $1.25 in 12 months’ time versus its previous $1.30 prediction. With brewing trade conflicts, world growth is another concern. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in its latest report that a trade war was threatening the growth outlook. That is likely to weigh especially hard on the developing world - emerging equities were down more than one percent to 5-1/2 month lows while Shanghai shares dropped 1.4 percent. Emerging markets are also suffering from the dollar’s surge since mid-April, with Indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency. “Italian politics mask the underlying growing risks of a U.S.-China trade war,” ING Bank analysts told clients.

2018-05-30,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, other OPEC states and non-OPEC allies aim to stick to a global pact on cutting oil supplies until the end of 2018 but are ready to make gradual adjustments to offset any supply shortage, a Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking said. The oil producers participating in the output reduction deal are satisfied with the result of their agreement, which was due to end at the end of 2018, the Gulf source told Reuters. The deal could be extended to achieve its objectives of keeping a balanced oil market, the source said, adding that, when needed, any rise in output would be “in a gradual and deliberate fashion.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with Russia and several other producers agreed to cut output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) starting from January 2017. The curbs have driven down inventories and pushed up prices. The oil market is moving towards balancing and fundamentals are better than last year, “but the group is not ready yet to fully lift controls,” the Gulf source said.  The source added that the market was driven by “a fear of shortage” triggered by a steep decline in Venezuela’s output and worries about the impact of U.S. sanctions on Iranian production, rather than an actual lack of supply. “Saudi Arabia, OPEC and non-OPEC... are continuing their cooperation this year and beyond, it is not something temporary, it is going to be a long-term cooperation for the sake of a stable oil market,” the Gulf source said. “However, if any shortage takes place, the producers will coordinate closely and promptly take necessary actions. The OPEC and non-OPEC agreement will remain in place. But the level of the cut may be adjusted if a physical shortage arises.” The energy ministers of Saudi Arabia and Russia said last week they were prepared to ease output cuts to calm consumer worries about supply adequacy. Raising output would ease about 18 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far, with oil hitting its highest since late 2014, rising above $80.50 a barrel this month. Prices have since eased. LCOc1 Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia and Russia were discussing the possibility of raising output by about 1 million bpd. OPEC meets next on June 22 to decide on policy. The Gulf source said no decision has been taken about the timing of any increase or the amount, and said Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s biggest producer, favoured “a gradual increase” in output if there was a need. The source said any decision to increase output in June would coincide with anticipated higher demand in the second half of the year. “Saudi Arabia favours a gradual approach to increase output to compensate for any unplanned outages. The decision about the timing and amount of oil to raise will be decided when the ministers meet in June,” the Gulf source said.  “The increase in output will be dictated by market conditions and all the numbers circulated about size of the increase or the timing are mere speculation,” the source said, adding that any move would be “a collective action.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-saudi/update-1-opec-non-opec-sticking-to-oil-pact-but-may-raise-output-if-needed-gulf-source-idUKL5N1T15XW,30 May 2018,"* Source says market driven by ""fear of shortage""

2018-05-30,"CARACAS, May 30 (Reuters) - Cuba’s President Miguel Diaz-Canel arrived in Venezuela for his first foreign visit as head of state on Wednesday in a show of solidarity for counterpart Nicolas Maduro who is under fire in the West after a controversial re-election. “We bring a message of fraternity and solidarity ... for the people and Bolivarian government of Venezuela, for President Nicolas Maduro,” Diaz-Canel said on arrival, congratulating Maduro for his “resounding success” at the May 20 vote. The United States, the European Union and major Latin American nations condemned Maduro’s re-election as not meeting democratic standards. For example, two of his rivals were barred from standing and the election board is run by loyalists. But China and Russia have warned against meddling in the socialist-run nation, and fellow leftist governments in the region from Cuba to Bolivia have offered warm support. Maduro was the first foreign leader to meet with Diaz-Canel last month after he succeeded Raul Castro to become president of the communist-run island. Venezuela, which holds the world’s largest oil reserves, exchanges crude for Cuban medical and other technical services, though deliveries have dropped over the past few years during an economic implosion in the OPEC member of 30 million people. Diaz-Canel flew to Venezuela with his wife Liz Cuesta as first lady, in a break with custom during the nearly 60 years that the Castro brothers Fidel and Raul led Cuba. They generally traveled without their wives. His visit came as Cuban authorities faced the chaos of flooding in the wake of subtropical storm Alberto that has killed four people and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands..

2018-05-30,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian financial sector lived through shocks caused by the latest U.S. sanctions and now faces risks of higher global market volatility along with lower oil prices, the Russian central bank said on Wednesday. Washington imposed sweeping sanctions in April on some of Russia’s biggest companies and businessmen to punish Moscow for “malign activities”, battering the Russian markets and sending the rouble weakening. The central bank said the Russian market showed “maturity” of thinking in its reaction to the sanctions. “Foreign investors’ interest in Russia assets remain in place,” the central bank said. In a semi-annual report on financial stability the central bank warned that it now sees risks coming from tighter monetary policies worldwide. “Changes in expectations toward a more rapid monetary tightening by the leading central banks (USA, Europe, Japan) amid a quicker economic growth could be the main factor for higher volatility on the global financial markets in the future,” the Bank of Russia said. Higher borrowing costs in dollars will lead to countries’ higher expenditures on servicing debt in national currencies, the central bank said. “A significant factor for the Russian market remains the risk of a decline in oil prices, for instance in case of a further substantial increase in oil output by the United States,” the central bank said. A further escalation of geopolitical tensions also represent risks, although their probability has decreased recently, the central bank said.

2018-05-30,"* Morocco has won praise from IMF for economic reforms * But many people complain about tough conditions * Campaign calls for boycott for milk, water and fuel brands By Ahmed Eljechtimi RABAT, May 30 (Reuters) - A consumer boycott aimed at major suppliers of milk, bottled water and petrol in Morocco has prompted the government to call for lower prices and forced one firm to scale down operations. The secretly organised campaign is the first such mass online protest in Morocco, which escaped the “Arab spring” uprisings of 2011 but where demonstrations have erupted in impoverished areas over jobs and economic neglect. The International Monetary Fund has praised Morocco for opening up its economy, which has helped attract investment by major international firms such as Renault, Boeing and Bombardier. But the campaign, launched on April 20 and calling for a boycott of Morocco’s main milk, water and petrol brands, has struck a raw nerve with many, who complain they have been left out of the business boom. Facebook pages with more than 2 million users have backed the campaign, which no political or civil society group has claimed, but which aims to express the frustration many Moroccans feel about their circumstances. “The goal of this boycott is to unite the Moroccan people and speak with one voice against expensive prices, poverty, unemployment, injustice, corruption and despotism,” one of the boycott pages said. The campaign targets Afriquia fuel stations owned by the Akwa group of Agriculture Minister Aziz Akhanouch, one of Morocco’s richest men, French dairy firm Centrale Danone and the Sidi Ali water brand. The three firms have not detailed the impact on their businesses but several grocery shops in the capital Rabat said they had sold less milk and water from the firms under fire. “Since the boycott started my customers are opting for other milk products,” said a Rabat grocery owner who gave his name as Younes. Sidi Ali and Afriquia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A survey in the L’Economiste daily showed 42 percent support for the boycott. Among those who backed the campaign, milk was targeted by 95 percent, mineral water by 78 percent and Afriquia by 52 percent. Energy Minister Aziz Rebbah said the government might introduce price caps for fuel. Prime Minister Saad Eddine El Othmani urged companies to lower prices of popular goods, while distancing himself from other officials who had described the boycotters as deluded. A spokesman for Centrale Danone, speaking on national television, acknowledged an impact on sales without giving details. For the holy month of Ramadan, the company lowered the retail price of milk by one dirham a litre. The company told Reuters by email that because of the boycott, and despite its temporary price cut, it had decided on Wednesday to reduce by 30 percent the amount of milk it collects from the 120,000 farmers who supply it. This would also affect its own staff as the company said it would end short-term contracts of temporary workers, without giving the exact number. Les Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès, the maker of Sidi Ali, has been bussing about 80 people a week to its spring in the Atlas mountains in an attempt to convince consumers its prices are fair, while calling on the government to lower taxes. Morocco saw some protests in 2011, which led King Mohammed VI to agree limited constitutional reforms, included devolving some powers to an elected government, but it has escaped the major uprisings seen elsewhere in the region. Officials have been promoting the kingdom as a stable investment destination, at a time when Tunisia has been unable to fix an economic crisis, and there is uncertainty in Algeria over the health of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who suffered a stroke in 2013. But protests in a poor mining town in Morocco’s northeast at the start of the year and in Hoceima in the Rif region in 2016 over corruption and poverty are signs of lingering dissent. The boycott call has targeted the three firms as symbols of an economy dominated by large groups linked to a business and political elite, or foreign brands. “The boycott goes beyond lowering prices to express an outcry at the feeble purchasing power of citizens as a result of the marriage between power and business,” said Fouad Abdelmoumni, an activist backing the campaign. Market share for their products are 37 percent for Afriquia, 60 percent for Central Danone and 70 percent for Les Eaux Minérales d’Oulmès, analysts say. They were targeted “because they are perceived as market leaders who engage in anti-competitive price fixing, creating an oligopoly,” said Rachid Aourraz, economist at the Moroccan Institute for Policy Analysis. A bottle of mineral water costs six dirhams (63 U.S. cents), more than in some European countries although the purchasing power of Moroccans is much lower. The boycott call has prompted a parliamentary inquiry into fuel prices, which found that since fuel subsidies ended in 2015 - a move praised by the IMF - petrol distributors’ profits have risen. Total Maroc, the country’s third largest distributor, reported profits rose to 879 million dirhams in 2016 from 289 million dirhams the previous year. All distributors “sell at the same consumer prices in different Moroccan regions”, said Idris Azami, head of the Islamist PJD party, which is part of the coalition government. “This is detrimental to competition,” he said, adding that an active competition regulator was needed. The competition council has been idle because authorities have not appointed a new board after the old one’s term ended in 2015, its head Abdelali Benamour said, blaming unspecified business groups for the lack of action. “Nature abhors a vacuum. In the absence of an active competition council, citizens reacted with the boycott,” said Benamour. Opposition lawmakers from a coalition of leftist parties have called on fuel distributors to return what they called “unethical” profits worth 17 billion dirhams. $1 = 9.5227 Moroccan dirham

2018-05-30,"(Adds quotes, background) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, May 30 (Reuters) - Norway’s gas production in 2018 is expected to match or just lag last year’s record, the chief executive of pipeline system operator Gassco told Reuters on Wednesday. “For the total of 2018, we will be approximately at the same level as 2017, or maybe it could come slightly below,” said CEO Frode Leversund, adding the final outcome would depend on the delivered volumes of July as well as the demand from Oct. 1. Norway last year produced 124.2 billion standard cubic metres of gas, of which 117.4 billion was exported via pipelines to Europe and 5.6 billion was shipped as liquefied natural gas (LNG). In 2019, production was also seen at around 2017-2018 levels, Leversund said. Gassco’s yearly maintenance schedule, which started in April, is so far on track, and any additional needs that may arise will be handled during the summer window, the CEO said. Gassco will also conduct preventive maintenance at its Kollsnes processing plant to avoid a recurrence of last winter’s outage, when the ‘Beast from the East’ cold snap shut the plant for days just as demand spiked. At Nyhamna, a major processing plant that will start receiving additional gas from the new Aasta Hansteen field in late 2018, Gassco is in final negotiations with electricity grid operators to boost the security of its power supply. “We are in very tight dialogue with Statnett and other local grid operators ... There is work ongoing. There are several options, we are running a project now to conclude on the option we will decide to take on,” said Leversund. Separately, Gassco has also been contacted by companies that want to transport natural gas from the Arctic Barents Sea, and is currently making an infrastructure plan for the remote region, he added.

2018-05-30,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Michel Temer may scrap a market-based pricing mechanism used by state-run oil firm Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and revert to selling all fuel below costs after a trucking strike that almost paralysed the nation, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday. Talk of temporarily lowering prices on just diesel to end the havoc the nine-day strike brought on Latin America’s largest economy sent Petrobras shares plunging 15 percent on Monday. Truckers are protesting a 50 percent increase in diesel prices under the nearly one-year-old Petrobras policy of almost daily adjustments following international prices. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the pricing policy worked well when oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 held steady for years at $40-50 a barrel, and the Brazilian currency BRBY BRL= remained stable against the dollar. But oil has recently surged to $70-80 a barrel boosted by plummeting Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile Brazil’s currency has weakened 11 percent this year on political uncertainty. “Without that (stability), we have a problem. We need to study alternatives,” the official said. He said talks on the issue have already begun between the government and Petrobras. A spokeswoman for Petrobras chief executive officer Pedro Parente declined to comment. Temer acknowledged in a television interview on Tuesday that he was open to reviewing the pricing policy. “Petrobras has recovered in these two years. It had been in a disastrous situation for a long time, and we did not want to change the company’s policy,” Temer told government broadcaster TV Brasil. “We can re-examine the policy, though with great care.” On Sunday, moving to settle the truckers strike, Temer announced tax cuts and subsidies to reduce domestic diesel prices by 0.46 real per litre, or about 13 percent of the current price at the pump, freezing them at that level for 60 days. The prospect of government interference in Petrobras pricing policy sent its share prices plummeting on Monday. That slide added to losses a week earlier that reduced the stock price by nearly one third, though shares rebounded 14 percent on Tuesday to close at 19.30 reais.        The government official said initial talks had begun between Mines and Energy Minister Moreira Franco and Parente, architect of the company’s recovery.  Parente has resisted change, but has appreciated the need for greater predictability in price adjustments, the official said.

2018-05-30,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A Danish court on Wednesday sentenced the former manager of OW Bunker’s Singapore subsidiary to 18 months in prison after he was found guilty of granting credit outside his mandate, which contributed to the bankruptcy of the marine fuel oil supplier. The city court of Aalborg said it found Lars Moller, head of Dynamic Oil Trading in Singapore, guilty of giving Tankoil Marine a credit worth $90.2 million (68 million pounds) without having the authority to do so from the management in Denmark. The prosecutor had sought a sentence of five years in prison. OW Bunker, once the leading supplier of marine fuel oil with a 7 percent market share, filed for bankruptcy in Denmark in November 2014 after revealing losses at Dynamic Oil Trading as well as hedging losses of almost $300 million at its Danish headquarters. The bankruptcy sent shockwaves through the global shipping and oil trading industry and was a marked change of fortunes for a firm valued at $1 billion when it listed in March that year.

2018-05-30,"LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Iran’s crude oil exports have declined slightly in May, according to estimates from a leading tanker-tracking company, in the first sign that the threat of U.S. sanctions may be deterring buyers. The estimates from Geneva-based Petro-Logistics also suggest Iranian oil buyers are not rushing to cut volumes from OPEC’s third-largest producer. The U.S. sanctions have a 180-day period during which buyers should “wind down” purchases. U.S. President Donald Trump on May 8 said the United States was exiting a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and would impose new sanctions that seek to reduce the country’s oil shipments. “Exports are down by more than 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) from the very high levels seen in April, but there is no sign of a mass exodus at this time,” Daniel Gerber, chief executive of Petro-Logistics, told Reuters. Supply and demand in large parts of the oil market is opaque and Petro-Logistics is among a number of consultancies that estimate supply from OPEC countries by tracking tanker shipments and other methods. Petro-Logistics did not specify the absolute volume of Iran’s exports in May or April. Iran said it exported 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in April, a record since the lifting of international sanctions on Tehran in January 2016. Reuters shipping data also suggests Iranian crude exports have dropped since Trump’s sanctions announcement, falling to around 2.5 million bpd in May, a drop of about 100,000 bpd from April. The bulk of Iran’s crude exports, at least 1.8 million bpd, goes to Asia. Most of the rest goes to Europe and these volumes are seen by analysts and traders as the more vulnerable to being curbed by U.S. sanctions. Petro-Logistics said the overall rate of Iran’s exports remained strong in May compared with recent months and companies in Europe were still buying. “In fact, May exports remain significantly higher than the previous 12-month average, with European refiners continuing to load cargoes throughout the month,” Gerber said. Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said on May 19 Tehran’s oil exports would not change if the EU could salvage the nuclear pact, as it is trying to do. But trading sources expect financing issues to hinder Iranian oil trade as banks grow wary.

2018-05-30,"* World stocks hit by trade war fears * Italian bonds, stocks bounce on hope vote may be averted * Euro rises off 10-month lows vs dlr; bounces vs yen, franc (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Hopes that Italy might avoid a potentially damaging general election lifted European markets on Wednesday, bringing Italian bond yields off multi-year highs and dampening some of the recent buying interest for German and U.S. government bonds. The backdrop for world markets remained sombre, however, as the United States revived trade war fears with an announcement that it would press ahead with tariffs and restrictions on Chinese investments, and Beijing threatened to retaliate. The prospect of acrimony between the world’s biggest two economies added to fears for the global economy, already feeling the hit from the risk of an Italy-driven crisis in the euro zone. However, equity futures signalled Wall Street indexes would open around half a percent higher, after the previous day’s harsh session and losses across Asia earlier on Wednesday, where a key equity index shed more than 1 percent. World stocks slipped 0.2 percent, heading for their sixth day in the red, but European shares made tentative gains after falling almost 4 percent in the past five days. The recovery was partly driven by news that Italy’s two anti-establishment parties were again renewing efforts to form a government, rather than force the country back to the polls for the second time this year. Another positive was a smooth auction of Italian debt that raised 5.57 billion euros, easing concerns about Rome’s ability to finance itself. “(The auction) clearly indicates that investors still have faith in the Italian economy, if not the government,” said Seema Shah, global investment strategist at Principal Global Investors. But she warned that political uncertainty would remain elevated. Japan’s biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings. Milan-listed equities snapped a five-day losing streak and bounced almost 2 percent while short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - fell more than half a percent from half-decade highs. They had suffered their worst day in nearly 26 years on Tuesday. Ten-year Italian yields slipped 18 bps. The risk for investors is that eurosceptic political parties are further boosted, with any election viewed as a de facto referendum on Italy’s euro membership. The events have evoked memories of the 2011-2012 euro debt crisis, with potentially huge implications for the single currency. The risks had sent investors scurrying for safer German and U.S. governmment bonds as well as currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc, at the expense of the euro. That safe-haven trend receded on Wednesday, with the euro bouncing almost one percent versus the dollar and recouping all its Tuesday losses, which had taken it down to 10-month lows . It also rose between 0.7 percent and one percent against the Swiss franc and yen respectively. “The political problems in Italy heighten the risk of a systematic problem within the euro zone and within the euro zone financial system, but that is still a risk rather than a probability,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The improved mood encouraged investors to sell U.S. and German bonds, reversing some of the 15-20 bps yield rises seen on Tuesday. U.S. 10-year yields jumped more than 10 basis points to 2.87 percent while their German counterparts were up 8.5 basis points. Most investors remain cautious though, with Goldman Sachs cutting its forecast for the euro’s exchange rate against the dollar due to Italian political developments. It said it now expected the euro to trade at $1.25 in 12 months’ time versus its previous $1.30 prediction. With brewing trade conflicts, world growth is another concern. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development warned in its latest report that a trade war was threatening the growth outlook. That is likely to weigh especially hard on the developing world - emerging equities were down more than one percent to 5-1/2 month lows while Shanghai shares dropped 1.4 percent. Emerging markets are also suffering from the dollar’s surge since mid-April, with Indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency. “Italian politics mask the underlying growing risks of a U.S.-China trade war,” ING Bank analysts told clients.

2018-05-30,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 30 (Reuters) - Next month’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is being touted as key to the outlook for crude oil prices, but a strong indication of what’s likely will come next week. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned producer of the world’s largest crude exporter, will release its official selling prices (OSPs) for July-loading cargoes, and these in turn largely set the prices for much of the exports from the Middle East. The problem with set-piece meetings like the OPEC gathering on June 22 in Vienna is that they focus tremendously on what is said, rather than what is actually done. The OSPs, on the other hand, show exactly what the Saudis are doing in the oil market, and in some ways are a more important signal. The Saudis have an opportunity with the July OSPs, likely to be released next week, to show they are serious about two issues currently dominating crude oil markets. These are concerns about the tightness of global supply, especially in light of Venezuela’s woes and the possible curtailment of Iranian exports, and the rising importance of the United States as an exporter, particularly to the major consuming region of Asia. In recent months, Saudi Aramco has been lifting its OSPs to Asia, with the price for its benchmark Arab Light grade being set for June cargoes at a premium of $1.90 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, the highest since August 2014. This increase was viewed by several refining customers as unexpectedly large, with Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, showing its displeasure by cutting the volumes of Saudi crude it would lift in June, the second month in a row it decided against taking its normal allocation. If Saudi Arabia is serious about raising crude output and boosting supply, one sure way of signalling this would be a sharp lowering in the OSP for July cargoes, with the cut being bigger than what would be justified by market fundamentals. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak met last week in St. Petersburg and discussed a gradual easing of the output curbs OPEC and its allies agreed to in November 2016, according to sources. This led to crude prices stumbling, with Brent dropping 4.3 percent from $78.79 a barrel at the close on May 24 to $75.39 at the finish on Tuesday. The trick for the Saudis, the rest of OPEC and their Russian allies, is to ensure that crude prices remain anchored as close to $80 a barrel as possible, which seems to be a level that is a good compromise between meeting the fiscal needs of the producers without being high enough to prompt too much demand destruction. The Saudis also have to balance the geopolitics of oil, striking a balance between their need for relatively high prices against the support of U.S. President Donald Trump in their struggle against regional rival Iran. In some ways the wild card for the oil markets currently is the United States, which is becoming an increasingly important player in Asian markets. Record U.S. crude shipments to Asia are expected in the coming months, with a senior executive at a U.S. oil company estimating that the country will ship some 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, of which 1.3 million bpd will head to Asia. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts show that about 620,000 bpd of U.S. crude headed to Asia in the first five months of 2018, up from just 259,000 bpd in the same period last year. However, if U.S. crude exports to Asia do surge to more than 1 million bpd in coming months, this could provide the Saudis and the Russians with an added incentive to make more oil available to the market, and at a more competitive price. Again, there is a geopolitical angle, with China, the world’s biggest crude importer, under political pressure by President Trump pressure to buy more from the United States in order to lower the U.S. trade deficit with China. At the same time the Chinese have made their unhappiness with the recent Saudi price increases quite clear, meaning they would most likely want to see a substantial reduction before boosting their volumes from the kingdom.

2018-05-30,"OTTAWA/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Kinder Morgan’s C$4.5 billion sale of an oil pipeline to Canada’s government marked an extraordinary escape from months of fraught negotiations among warring camps of Canadian officials. But even before the bailout, the company had little to lose - despite the C$1.1 billion it has spent so far on a plan to add a second pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to British Columbia’s coast, according to a Reuters review of the project’s bank financing and oil-shipping contracts with producers reserving space on the proposed line. The documents show Kinder Morgan cut creative deals with lenders and oil producers to shield itself from massive write-downs like the ones taken recently by rivals TransCanada Corp and Enbridge Inc in canceling controversial pipeline projects. The arrangements, which have not been previously reported, gave Kinder Morgan unique leverage in threatening last month to walk away from the project by May 31 unless Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government guaranteed a path to construction over the objections of British Columbia officials, environmentalists and some aboriginal bands. The company’s cautious financial planning and hard-ball politicking combined to create a no-lose bet on what might have been one of the oil industry’s riskiest plays, given the volatility of Canadian pipeline politics. The firm’s ultimatum made rescuing its Trans Mountain pipeline expansion a national emergency for Trudeau, thrusting the prime minister into a constitutional crisis over the limits of federal power and a political crisis in refereeing a feud between Alberta and British Columbia. Trudeau argued the project must go forward to alleviate a crude transportation bottleneck that costs Canadian oil producers C$15 billion annually in forgone export revenue. The expansion would nearly triple the flow of crude through Trans Mountain pipelines, to 890,000 barrels per day. Now, in a deal announced Tuesday, Canada will pay Kinder Morgan the C$1.1 billion it has spent and another C$3.4 billion for the existing pipeline and to compensate the firm for giving up the expansion’s potential profits. “Kinder Morgan wins,” said Brian Kessens, managing director at Leawood, Kansas-based investment firm Tortoise, which holds shares in Kinder Morgan Inc. “That’s a very fair price.” The rising costs of the pipeline expansion, he said, had cut its profit potential to “just a little north of their cost of capital.” The firm’s Chief Executive Steve Kean celebrated its exit from the troubled project. “This is a great day, not only for our company but for Canada,” he said. Canadian Finance Minister Bill Morneau said the government took the drastic step to resolve an “exceptional” problem, calling the deal “the best way to protect thousands of good, well-paying jobs while delivering a solid return on investment for Canadians.”  Kinder Morgan’s leverage in the deal stemmed in part from careful risk management in earlier negotiations with the 13 oil producers who reserved capacity in the proposed line. The shippers agreed to cover about 80 percent of Kinder Morgan’s capital costs – even if the second pipeline never gets built, the contracts show. The shippers promised to pay those costs over time through tolls on shipments through the existing pipeline, and the contracts included an “early termination” clause to ensure the producers paid even if regulatory problems blocked the project. The firm also negotiated with 26 lenders led by Royal Bank of Canada and TD Bank for a clause exempting the firm from paying a 2 percent penalty on funds drawn from up to C$5 billion in construction loans if it halted the project because of political problems, the documents show. Another roughly C$220 million in financing, CEO Kean told analysts last month, came from assessments on oil producers shipping through Kinder Morgan’s Westridge export terminal in Burnaby, British Columbia, which is targeted for expansion to accommodate the second pipeline. Twelve of the 13 oil producers - including BP Canada, Teck Energy Sales, Andeavor and Canadian Natural Resources - did not respond to Reuters inquiries or declined to comment on their contracts with Kinder Morgan. Canadian oil producer Cenovus Energy did not comment directly on the contracts but issued a statement saying Canada’s oil industry would continue to suffer from low prices and exports without new pipelines. Kinder Morgan’s threat to abandon the project forced Trudeau to back up his assertion that the federal government had the authority to approve the pipeline over a provincial effort to regulate it out of existence, said Bob Prasad, senior director at Allnorth, a Vancouver-based energy engineering and consulting firm that has worked on the project. The ultimatum was a “genius move on Kinder Morgan’s part to move this project along - and put a date to it,” Prasad said. In response, federal and Alberta officials scrambled to rescue the project, promising to indemnify Kinder Morgan against further cost overruns from political roadblocks in British Columbia. Alberta officials went so far as to threaten cutting off oil supplies to British Columbia in retaliation. At the same time, inside Kinder Morgan, one of the primary architects of its political and financial strategy, 43-year-old Dax Sanders, got a battlefield promotion last month - just as the pipeline’s construction prospects never looked more bleak. Sanders, finance chief of Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd, now also serves as head of overall strategy for the Houston-based parent company, North America’s second-largest energy infrastructure firm. Sanders was unavailable for an interview Tuesday, a company spokesman said. Robyn Allen - a vocal pipeline opponent and retired chief executive of an auto insurance firm - has long predicted the expansion would end in a government bailout. She opposed it specifically for that reason, unlike most other opponents who have cited fear of oil spills. The Trudeau administration, she said, is paying C$4.5 billion “for a pipeline that is more than 65 years old” and assuming expansion costs she estimated could run as much as C$12 billion - far more than the firm’s latest estimate of C$7.4 billion. By using assets of the existing Trans Mountain pipeline to finance its expansion, Kinder Morgan made the two inseparable in the bailout, Allen said. “Now Kinder Morgan’s U.S. shareholders will be made whole,” she said. “They have offloaded all of these costs onto Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.” Finance Minister Morneau declined to comment in a morning news conference on the costs to complete the project. Finance Ministry spokesman Dan Lauzon, asked later on Tuesday about Allen’s C$12 billion estimate, said the government’s pipeline purchase was “commercially viable and has the potential to add value” for new investors. Buying the pipeline hardly solves Trudeau’s political problems. It merely buys him time, at the cost of a massive investment of taxpayer money into the nation’s dicey oil transportation industry. The government hopes to quickly resell the project to energy firms, a task made much harder by its tortured political history. Though Trudeau asserts federal authority to approve the project, British Columbia officials could effectively bog it down for years in environmental studies, lawsuits and regulations that undercut its profit potential. Trudeau could theoretically nullify any provincial law that effectively kills a federally approved project under a constitutional provision that hasn’t been used since the 1940s. But that’s unlikely given that his Liberal party relies far more on electoral support from British Columbia than from conservative Alberta. The prime minister is already paying the political price. “Those of us who knocked on doors for him will not forget that he took billions of dollars from Canadian families to buy out an oil pipeline,” said Tzeporah Berman, deputy director of Stand.earth, an environmental advocacy organization with offices in Vancouver. The flack is flying from opponents on the right, too, including from Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, head of the largest opposition party. Trudeau’s pipeline deal, Scheer said, does nothing to solidify federal authority or settle constitutional questions.  “All he has done is force Canadian taxpayers to pay for his failure,” Scheer said. “He is trying to buy his way out of a problem.” Reporting by David Ljunggren in Ottawa and Liz Hampton and Gary McWilliams in Houston; Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by Denny Thomas and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-strategy/insight-how-kinder-morgan-won-a-billion-dollar-bailout-on-canada-pipeline-idUKL1N1RX0TS,30 May 2018,"U.S. energy firm Kinder

2018-05-30," LONDON (Reuters) - Pay attention to what traders actually do, not what they say, is one of the most important principles for successful oil market analysis. Despite all the bullish commentary around oil prices in recent weeks, there was plenty of forewarning prices were primed for a setback. By the middle of April, hedge funds had accumulated a near-record net long position in crude and products futures and options equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels. Bullish long positions outnumbered bearish short positions by an unprecedented ratio of almost 14:1, according to regulatory and exchange data. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2JcJGL7) Front-month Brent futures prices continued to climb by another $8 per barrel over the next five weeks, with the focus on declining oil exports from Venezuela and new sanctions on Iran. But a closer look at the market revealed plenty of signs the rally might be running out of momentum and was becoming increasingly vulnerable to a correction. Hedge funds and other money managers were net sellers of petroleum futures and options in each of the five weeks between April 17 and May 22. Bullish long positions were trimmed by 52 million barrels while the number of bearish short positions rose by 57 million. The shift was even more pronounced in crude, where long positions were trimmed by 107 million barrels while shorts were boosted by 62 million. Front-month Brent futures slumped from backwardation into contango, in part because so many hedge fund positions are concentrated at the front-end of the futures curve. The physical Brent market too displayed increasing signs of weakness, with dated Brent prices falling into contango and reports of unsold cargoes. Weakness spread along the futures curve, with the six-month Brent calendar spread easing from a sharp backwardation of $3.50 per barrel on April 26 to just $1.49 on May 29. Since the start of 2015, large concentrations of long or short positions by hedge funds in the oil market have usually heralded an imminent reversal in the recent price trend. Lopsided positioning can cause a reversal even in the absence of significant new information about production or consumption (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems”, Sornette, 2003). But in recent weeks several new pieces of information suggested the rally might run out of momentum and be thrown into reverse, at least temporarily. Rapidly rising prices put the issue of demand destruction back on the agenda, with major forecasters starting to revise down their predictions for consumption growth in the second half of 2018 and 2019. Rising crude prices have already pushed up pump prices in the United States and other oil-consuming countries to sensitive levels. Average U.S. gasoline prices approached the politically sensitive $3 per gallon in recent weeks and began to draw increased attention from politicians. On April 20, U.S. President Donald Trump blamed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for raising prices to unacceptably high levels with a message on Twitter. On May 23, U.S. Senate Democrats, sensing a political opportunity, wrote to the president blaming OPEC for the rise in prices and calling on him to put pressure on the organisation and particularly Saudi Arabia to boost oil supplies. Elsewhere, India’s gasoline and diesel prices have surged to record levels, prompting the country’s oil minister to blame OPEC for restricting production. Brazil has seen a widespread truckers’ strike blockading highways, after diesel prices hit record levels, forcing the government to cut fuel taxes. OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, are increasingly blamed for the increase in oil prices by restricting their production despite strong growth in consumption. Falling output from Venezuela and the prospective reduction in exports from Iran have highlighted how far OPEC and its allies are in danger of undershooting their collective production target for 2018. Saudi Arabia is in a particularly delicate position because it has urged the United States to impose sanctions on Iran but does not want to be blamed for increasing motorists’ fuel costs in a U.S. election year. In response, OPEC sources have started to signal their willingness to increase output to compensate for losses from Venezuela and Iran, reversing their earlier position that output would be unchanged until the end of 2018. Communications from OPEC about a possible production increase in the second half of 2018 seem to have provided the trigger for the sharp sell-off in oil prices that started on May 24. But the pressure for a change of OPEC strategy had been intensifying for several weeks, and at least some traders had already begun to anticipate the shift by adjusting their positions well beforehand.

2018-05-30,"* World stocks fall further on Italy, US trade move on China * Italy bonds, stocks bounce on hope vote may be averted * Euro rises off 10-month lows vs dlr; bounces vs yen, franc (Updates throughout, changes dateline and byline) By Sujata Rao LONDON, May 30 (Reuters) - Italy’s political crisis and renewed trade war fears sent world stocks lower for the sixth day in a row, though hopes that Italy could avoid a new election helped European markets stage a mini-bounce from one of their worst selloffs in years. Investors have in recent days scurried for assets such as U.S. and German bonds or the Japanese yen, spooked by the possibility that Italy, the third-biggest euro zone economy, could deliver a bigger boost to eurosceptic parties in a snap election that sources said could be held by end-July. An election at this point would also be a de facto referendum on Italy’s euro membership, evoking memories of the 2011-2012 euro debt crisis and carrying huge implications for the single currency, whatever its outcome. However, reports that the two anti-establishment parties were again renewing efforts to form a government rather than force the country back to the polls, helped Milan-listed equities snap a five-day losing streak. Similarly, short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - fell almost half a percent from half-decade highs after suffering their worst day in nearly 26 years on Tuesday. A pan-European equity index was flat on the day after falling almost 4 percent in the past five days. Barclays investment strategist Hao Ran Wee said that while risks from Italy for world markets had certainly risen, there were significant hurdles for the country to sharply increase spending or exit the euro zone. “It’s questionable how credible Italy’s threat of leaving the EU actually is, if push comes to shove ... As a result, we think the repeat of a 2012-style euro crisis remains a small possibility,” Wee said, adding he remained optimistic on euro zone economic growth and regional equity markets. Japan’s biggest private life insurance firm, Nippon Life, which holds some 4.8 trillion yen ($44.21 billion) worth of euro zone bonds, also said it had no plans for now to buy or sell its Italian debt holdings. Equity futures signalled a stronger open on Wall Street , after Tuesday’s harsh session which saw all three U.S. indexes lose between 0.5-1.2 percent  , led by financial sector stocks. Asian markets however remained under pressure, with an index of non-Japanese Asian stocks, hurt also by news that the United States was pressing ahead with tariffs and restrictions on investments by Chinese companies. Beijing meanwhile said it was ready to fight back if Washington ignited a trade war. Japan’s Nikkei sold off 1.5 percent to a six-week low while Shanghai shares also dropped 1.4 percent. Trade-sensitive emerging equities fell 1.2 percent to 5-1/2-month lows. “Overall, this (U.S.) move puts a trade war scenario back on the agenda,” Rabobank analysts told clients. Emerging markets are also suffering from the dollar’s renewed surge since mid-April, with Indonesia raising interest rates for the second time in two weeks to support the rupiah currency . The politics and fears of an economic hit across the euro zone has driven investors into U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds pushing yields 15-20 basis points lower They have also fuelled a sharp rise in the yen and Swiss franc, especially against the euro. The euro attempted to bounce off 10-month lows against the dollar rising 0.5 percent to $1.160, while against the Swiss franc and yen it firmed around 0.3 percent. “The risk to the euro is predominantly political in the near term,” Alvin Tan, a currency strategist at Societe Generale, said, adding the euro would likely stay capped at $1.15 or $1.16 until the Italian political crisis was resolved. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose 6.5 basis points to 2.83 percent while German yields rose around 5 basis points Oil prices meanwhile struggled as expectations grew that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years.

2018-05-30,"* Petronas Q1 profit boosted by higher oil prices * Expects overall year-end performance to be “satisfactory” * Finmin official: Petronas may contribute more to govt revenue * Petronas may pay up to $2.3 bln more in taxes, dividends (Adds comment from finance ministry official, background) By A. Ananthalakshmi KUALA LUMPUR, May 30 (Reuters) - Malaysia may collect up to $2.3 billion more in taxes and  dividends from Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas, this year, a finance ministry official said on Wednesday, as firmer oil prices boost profits at the state energy firm. The new administration led by Mahathir Mohamad is relying more on Petronas - a significant contributor to government revenue and the country’s largest employer - to offset a revenue shortfall from the government’s plan to scrap a consumption tax. Oil prices were trading close to 3-1/2-year highs on Wednesday as Petronas reported a 26-percent surge in first quarter profit. With oil prices improving, Malaysia may collect 8-9 billion ringgit ($2-$2.26 billion) more in revenue from Petronas this year, Ong Kian Ming, a special officer to the finance minister, told Reuters. He said the increase would come through corporate taxes and dividends to the government, but discussions are still ongoing. Petronas said it was unable to comment on the matter. Petronas paid 17.4 billion ringgit in taxes and 16 billion ringgit in dividends to the government in 2017. Its contribution to government revenue typically increases with the company’s profitability. Last year, Petronas paid 5.8 billion ringgit more to federal and state governments as profits and oil prices rose. A higher contribution from Petronas this year will help narrow the government’s revenue shortfall from effectively scrapping the goods and services tax, Ong told BFM radio station on Wednesday. Aside from Petronas, the government was also looking at higher dividends from the central bank and sovereign fund Khazanah Nasional, Ong told BFM. “These are all the options on the table,” he said. Petronas said its January-March quarter profit totalled 13 billion ringgit ($3.26 billion), up from 10.3 billion ringgit in the same period last year. Revenue rose 2.5 percent to 57.9 billion ringgit. Petronas said it expected overall year-end performance to be “satisfactory” subject to the volatility of oil prices and foreign exchange rates. The company is known to be conservative with its outlook. Petronas had said it was budgeting for an oil price of $52 per barrel in 2018. Brent crude was trading at around $75 per barrel on Wednesday. Petronas, like other oil majors, has taken a hit from lower oil prices, but sharp cost cuts - along with some recent stability in oil prices - helped the company’s profits and margins. The company said in 2016 that it would reduce expenses by $12 billion over a four-year period, and has cut thousands of jobs to save costs amid low oil prices. Its total production volume for the quarter rose to 2,461 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day compared to 2,387 tboe/day in the same period last year. Petronas also said its Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor is on track for a 2019 start up. The company said that the development was 90 percent completed at the end of April. ($1 = 3.9900 ringgit) (Reporting by A.

2018-05-30,"May 30 (Reuters) - Some of Britain’s biggest energy companies have announced price increases this year, citing higher wholesale prices and the cost of government policies to support renewable energy generation. More are expected to follow suit and the moves come after similar rises last year. Britain’s dominant energy companies have been under scrutiny by the government, which is putting a price cap on standard variable tariffs to combat what it has called “rip off” energy prices. Below are tariff changes so far this year (in alphabetical order): Npower, owned by Germany’s Innogy, will raise its variable dual fuel bill by 5.3 percent as of June 17, impacting about 1 million customers. The rise represents a 64 pound increase on annual bills and a direct debit customer on the tariff will typically pay 1230 pounds  ($1,633) a year. The hike is made up of average rises of 4.4 percent on gas and 6.2 percent on electricity. Centrica-owned British Gas is increasing its standard variable tariff for electricity and gas by an average of 5.5 percent from May 29. The move will add 60 pounds to annual bills for 4.1 million customers on the tariff, raising them to an average of 1,161 pounds, the company said. EDF Energy, a unit of French utility EDF, said it will increase the cost of its standard dual fuel energy bills by 1.4 percent (or 16 pounds) to 1,158 pounds a year from June 7. Iberdrola-owned Scottish Power said it will raise standard variable domestic gas and electricity prices from June 1 by an average 5.5 percent, or 63 pounds on a typical annual dual fuel bill. The move will affect around a third of homes supplied by Scottish Power, around 960,000. SSE said it would raise the price of its standard dual fuel bill by 6.7 percent from July 11 to reflect sustained increases in wholesale and policy costs. The rise equates to a typical annual bill increase of 76 pounds and will affect 2.36 million customer of SSE and M&S Energy, which is supplied by SSE. $1 = 0.7534 pounds

2018-05-30,"(Adds detail) MOSCOW, May 30 (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Wednesday its first-quarter net income rose 11 percent to 371.6 billion roubles ($6 billion), thanks to higher gas prices and sales volumes, beating analysts’ expectations. Analysts polled by Reuters had on average expected Gazprom’s net income to come in at 338.3 billion roubles. Gazprom generates almost two thirds of its gas sales in Europe, where it has a market share of around 34 percent. The Kremlin-controlled company emerged largely unscathed from a seven-year investigation by the European Commission into its selling practices, making some concessions in pricing structure and allowing rivals a foothold in eastern Europe. Gazprom said its revenues from gas sales to Europe jumped by 28 percent in January-March as prices rose by 17 percent, while sales volumes increased by 9 percent. The company plans to further strengthen its exposure to Europe this year, reaching an all-time high in gas exports of almost 200 billion cubic metres. In a sign of Russia’s rising energy might, Gazprom signed a deal last week with Turkey over the on-land portion of the TurkStream pipeline, which will run into southern Europe.

2018-05-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of electric vehicles on roads worldwide rose to a record high of 3.1 million in 2017, but more research, policies and incentives are needed to drive further uptake, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said. The number of electric cars, including battery-electric, plug-in hybrid electric and fuel cell electric passenger light-duty vehicles, increased by 57 percent compared with 2016, the IEA said in a report. China accounted for 40 percent of the global total last year. Research and development, policy support, charging infrastructure investment and production improvements are resulting in lower battery costs and higher electric vehicle (EV) uptake. Battery costs, however, are still a major component of EV costs, so financial incentives such as rebates, tax breaks or exemptions will be needed to support electric car deployment. “Dynamic market uptake of electric vehicles has occurred in recent years,” the IEA said in a report. “Ongoing support and commitments for increased deployment of EVs from policy makers and the automotive industry suggest that this trend is not going to abate in the coming decade,” it added. By 2030, the IEA estimates there will be 125 million EVs on the road, based on existing and announced policies. That could rise to 220 million if policies become more ambitious to meet global climate goals and other sustainability targets. The shift to EVs will increase demand for some materials, especially cobalt and lithium used in lithium-ion batteries. Cobalt demand is expected to be ten times higher than current levels by 2030 at 101 kilotonnes (kt) per year under current policies and could be as much as 25 times higher at 291 kt/year with more ambitious government policies, the IEA estimates. Lithium demand is forecast to be 91 kt/year by 2030 based on current policies and 263 kt/year if more ambitious polices are implemented.  So far, rising numbers of EVs on the road have had a limited impact on electricity demand.

2018-05-30,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese solar developer Renesola is banking on the growing appetite for small projects on city rooftops after hiving off its struggling manufacturing business last year, a senior executive told Reuters. The strategy underscores how many industry officials see solar projects on roofs and in car parks as the best available option, with chronic land shortages forcing conventional renewable power developers to take steps such as building on depleted mining areas.  China’s solar sector has seen rapid growth, with newly installed capacity reaching a record 53 gigawatts last year, but manufacturers are now coming under pressure from the land constraints, falling subsidies and a decline in project approvals. “There is still a lot of room for growth - every year, there are lots of new buildings and factories, and throughout the regions there are buildings that still have no solar,” said Liang Xiaoliang, Renesola’s chief financial officer. While central government subsidies for smaller ‘distributed generation’ (DG) projects fell to 0.37 yuan per kilowatt-hour this year from 0.42 yuan, regions like Shanghai and Zhejiang are offering additional support to meet targets, he added. China’s DG capacity nearly tripled to 29.66 GW last year, spurred by growing demand from building owners, who pay zero construction costs and receive discounted power. Renesola is targeting around 400 MW of capacity in China by year-end, and does not plan to get involved in larger-scale plants.     “There are land issues, (grid) interconnection issues, curtailment issues, as well as the postponed payment of subsidies,” he said, adding that a distributed project needed only two permits, compared to 11 for a large-scale plant. Though solar still struggles to compete with conventional energy sources, some expect it to achieve cost parity within just a few years. China itself has cut solar costs by 90 percent in the last decade, offsetting the subsidy declines. Liang said a project built in Xinjiang in 2011 cost about 10-11 yuan per watt, while some industry estimates now say prices could fall to as low as 1.5 yuan by 2020. The government is also offering alternative means of support, including a scheme compelling regions to ensure a fixed proportion of their power comes from renewables. Renesola, formerly a polysilicon wafer producer, last year transferred its manufacturing assets and debts to chairman Li Xianshou in exchange for additional equity, switching its business model to downstream generation projects in the process.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tumbled 1.4 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei average sold off 1.5 percent to a six-week low. Chinese shares also headed south, with the Shanghai Composite index down 1.4 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI and Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 slipped 2.0 percent and 0.5 percent, respectively. Financial spread-betters expected a mixed opening in Europe, with London’s FTSE to open 5 points lower at 7,627, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 5 points higher at 12,671 and Paris CAC to open down 3 points at 5,435. The sharp downturn in Asia followed from an equally harsh session on Wall Street on Tuesday, where the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.6 percent, the S&P 500 lost 1.2 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5 percent. The financial sector took the hardest hit. Investors fear that repeat elections in the euro zone’s third-largest economy - which could come as soon as July - may become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and its role in the European Union. “The way Italy’s short-term debt yields are spiking makes you think default risk is on radar in the market. It tells how grave the situation is,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. “What the markets are starting to factor-in is not a default per se but an early election leading to a victory of eurosceptics and an exit from the euro.” Short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared 1.5 percentage points from Monday to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in nearly 26 years. Safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds and German bunds rallied, as did the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar and gold. The euro fell against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, nearing $1.15 and touching its lowest point since July. U.S. 10-year Treasuries were yielding 2.817 percent in the Asian afternoon, edging up from the U.S. close of 2.768 percent, while S&P futures rose 0.2 percent. Earlier this week, there was talk that a new vote in Italy would not be held until late this year or early 2019, prolonging the uncertainty. Kerry Craig, a global market analyst at JPMorgan Asset Management, noted that Italy’s economy is in better shape that it was in 2011 when the euro zone was mired in a debt crisis. But, he added, “Completely dismissing the risk that Italy poses would be an unwise move, especially given how the next election may play out and the prospect of a stronger eurosceptic position.” In Asia, traders also fretted over the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship. The United States said on Tuesday that it would continue pursuing actions on trade with China, prompting Chinese state media to slam the U.S. announcement. Emerging market stocks lost 1.2 percent, marking a new low point for the year, under continued pressure from a rising U.S. dollar for countries that often borrow in that currency. Indonesia’s central bank is holding an out-of-cycle policy meeting on Wednesday, and is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate for the second time in two weeks, according to a Reuters poll. Oil struggled under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years. U.S. crude futures retreated 0.2 percent to $66.58 per barrel, extending losses into a sixth consecutive sessions. Reporting by Tomo Uetake; Additional reporting by Hideyuki

2018-05-30,"SAO PAULO, May 30 (Reuters) - Brazilian oil workers planned a 72-hour strike starting on Wednesday, despite a court order, in a new blow to President Michel Temer and an economy reeling from a truckers’ protest that has strangled Latin America’s largest economy for over a week. The planned oil strike was declared illegal by Brazil’s top labor court on Tuesday. The FUP, Brazil’s largest oil workers union, said it had not been informed of the ruling and planned to go ahead with the stoppage. State-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA said any such disruption would not have an immediate major impact on its production or overall operations. But the planned strike raised the specter of stoppages and protests spreading to other sectors as Brazilians vent frustrations with a deeply unpopular government and a still-sputtering economy. Petrobras, as the oil company is known, along with the federal government’s solicitor general’s office on Tuesday, had asked the country’s top labor court to rule that any oil strike would be illegal, arguing it was being carried out mainly for political and not labor-related reasons. Unions representing oil workers said they were demanding the resignation of Chief Executive Pedro Parente. They also want the reversal of market-based changes to pricing and other policies Petrobras has taken since Temer took power in 2016. FUP union leader José Maria Rangel said on Tuesday the Temer government and Parente’s policies were delivering Petrobras up to foreign investors, while “the shipyards of Rio de Janeiro are closed” amid a jobless rate that remains near all-time highs. Parente, on a Tuesday conference call with analysts, said Petrobras was taking action so that any strike would have minimal or no impact on production and operations. The 10-day trucker demonstration against diesel price hikes has emptied roads and left major cities running short on food, gasoline and medical supplies, despite significantly easing on Tuesday night. Officials warned it would take days to restore supply lines disrupted by the crippling stoppage that at its height saw over 1,000 roadblocks on key highways across the country. Temer’s political situation has grown so tenuous as Brazil barrels toward a general election in October that he was forced to bat away concerns that a coup could topple his government. “There is zero chance of military intervention,” Temer told a small group of journalists during a roundtable at an investment conference in Sao Paulo. “What I see is a rejection both in the Ministry of Defense and throughout the military forces to any kind of military intervention.” (Reporting by Brad Brooks; Editing by Peter Cooney)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-transportation/brazil-oil-workers-plan-strike-in-new-blow-to-government-economy-idUKL5N1T06SK,30 May 2018,"Brazilian oil workers planned

2018-05-30,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, May 30 (Reuters) - Next month’s meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is being touted as key to the outlook for crude oil prices, but a strong indication of what’s likely will come next week. Saudi Aramco, the state-owned producer of the world’s largest crude exporter, will release its official selling prices (OSPs) for July-loading cargoes, and these in turn largely set the prices for much of the exports from the Middle East. The problem with set-piece meetings like the OPEC gathering on June 22 in Vienna is that they focus tremendously on what is said, rather than what is actually done. The OSPs, on the other hand, show exactly what the Saudis are doing in the oil market, and in some ways are a more important signal. The Saudis have an opportunity with the July OSPs, likely to be released next week, to show they are serious about two issues currently dominating crude oil markets. These are concerns about the tightness of global supply, especially in light of Venezuela’s woes and the possible curtailment of Iranian exports, and the rising importance of the United States as an exporter, particularly to the major consuming region of Asia. In recent months, Saudi Aramco has been lifting its OSPs to Asia, with the price for its benchmark Arab Light grade being set for June cargoes at a premium of $1.90 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, the highest since August 2014. This increase was viewed by several refining customers as unexpectedly large, with Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, showing its displeasure by cutting the volumes of Saudi crude it would lift in June, the second month in a row it decided against taking its normal allocation. If Saudi Arabia is serious about raising crude output and boosting supply, one sure way of signalling this would be a sharp lowering in the OSP for July cargoes, with the cut being bigger than what would be justified by market fundamentals. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak met last week in St. Petersburg and discussed a gradual easing of the output curbs OPEC and its allies agreed to in November 2016, according to sources. This led to crude prices stumbling, with Brent dropping 4.3 percent from $78.79 a barrel at the close on May 24 to $75.39 at the finish on Tuesday. The trick for the Saudis, the rest of OPEC and their Russian allies, is to ensure that crude prices remain anchored as close to $80 a barrel as possible, which seems to be a level that is a good compromise between meeting the fiscal needs of the producers without being high enough to prompt too much demand destruction. The Saudis also have to balance the geopolitics of oil, striking a balance between their need for relatively high prices against the support of U.S. President Donald Trump in their struggle against regional rival Iran. In some ways the wild card for the oil markets currently is the United States, which is becoming an increasingly important player in Asian markets. Record U.S. crude shipments to Asia are expected in the coming months, with a senior executive at a U.S. oil company estimating that the country will ship some 2.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in June, of which 1.3 million bpd will head to Asia. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts show that about 620,000 bpd of U.S. crude headed to Asia in the first five months of 2018, up from just 259,000 bpd in the same period last year. However, if U.S. crude exports to Asia do surge to more than 1 million bpd in coming months, this could provide the Saudis and the Russians with an added incentive to make more oil available to the market, and at a more competitive price. Again, there is a geopolitical angle, with China, the world’s biggest crude importer, under political pressure by President Trump pressure to buy more from the United States in order to lower the U.S. trade deficit with China. At the same time the Chinese have made their unhappiness with the recent Saudi price increases quite clear, meaning they would most likely want to see a substantial reduction before boosting their volumes from the kingdom.

2018-05-30,"BEIJING, May 30 (Reuters) - China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd reported record power demand this month, the government said on Wednesday, the latest sign that China’s power market is already under pressure as weather forecasters predict a hotter-than-usual summer. The state power company has increased its load to a record of 164 gigawatts this month, up 0.9 percent from the previous peak load and an increase of 25.5 percent year-on-year, the National Development & Reform Commission said in a statement. It is the first time the peak load has reached a new high before the official start of the Northern Hemisphere summer on June 21, when power demand surges as a result of air conditioner use. China Southern Power is one of two state-owned power transmission firms covering five provinces in the south, including Yunnan, Hainan, Guangxi, Guangdong and Guizhou, with the rest of the country covered by the State Grid Corp. An unusually warm spring and forecasts of a hotter-than-usual summer are expected to boost electricity demand as households turn up their air-conditioning units or fans to keep cool. Coal prices have soared as investors have bet on potential supply tightness due to strong demand from the nation’s coal-fired power stations. Coal accounts for the majority of China’s power generation. Some 60 percent of households in China have air conditioning, according to the International Energy Agency, which warned in a report published earlier this month that the rising use of cooling systems is the “most critical blind spot” in the energy debate.

2018-05-30,"(Repeats May 29 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LBbW8l By John Kemp LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers were busy reducing bullish positions in petroleum well before OPEC and its allies indicated in the middle of last week that they would consider relaxing output curbs. Hedge funds and other money managers reduced their net long position in the six major petroleum futures and options contracts in each of the five weeks to May 22 by a total of 108 million barrels. The reduction has been concentrated in crude, where net long positions in Brent and WTI were cut by 169 million barrels over those five weeks (tmsnrt.rs/2LBbW8l). Liquidation was heaviest in Brent (-131 million barrels over six weeks) rather than NYMEX and ICE WTI (-51 million barrels over four weeks). It was partly offset by increased net length in fuels, especially U.S. gasoline (34 million barrels), with smaller increases in U.S. heating oil (+26 million barrels) and European gasoil (+2 million barrels). Liquidation hit near-term Brent futures prices particularly hard, since most hedge fund positions are held in contracts just a few months from expiry, which has helped push near-term contract prices into contango. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in Brent by almost 50 million barrels in the week to May 22, the largest one-week reduction since before the rally started in June 2017. Hedge funds have continued to add bullish positions in fuels, especially gasoline, in a bet consumption will remain relatively strong. But the decision to pare positions in crude points to deeper unease about the sustainability of the rally in oil prices over the last 10 months. Hedge funds started to reduce their net long position in petroleum around the time U.S. President Donald Trump used Twitter on April 20 to blame OPEC for pushing up oil prices. For all the bullish commentary around oil prices in recent weeks, hedge fund managers have used rising prices to realise some profits rather than increase their positions. Hedge fund positioning in the petroleum complex had become exceptionally stretched, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a record ratio of 14:1 by April 17. Positioning was even more lopsided in Brent, where portfolio managers held more than 20 long positions for every short one, according to exchange and regulatory data. Since then, however, fund managers have cut long positions across the petroleum complex by 52 million barrels and boosted shorts by 57 million barrels. The number of shorts has risen from just 109 million barrels to 166 million barrels, the highest for five months since the middle of December. Positioning is still stretched, but much less so than before, with long positions now outnumbering shorts by 9:1 in petroleum and 7:1 in Brent. Large concentrations of hedge fund positions have normally preceded a sharp reversal in the price trend over the last four years. Recent sharp falls in oil prices, especially Brent, are therefore not surprising, given that fund managers have been steadily liquidating long positions and adding shorts for more than a month. Comments from senior OPEC and non-OPEC officials suggesting they would consider raising output to compensate for lost production from Venezuela and sanctions on Iran catalysed a sharp fall in oil prices. But the market had been primed for a sharp correction given steady hedge fund selling over the last five weeks.

2018-05-30,"(Reuters) - A coalition of ethanol and farm groups sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, challenging its decision to free three refineries, including one owned by billionaire investor Carl Icahn, from annual biofuels requirements. The groups, including the Renewable Fuels Association and the National Corn Growers Association, filed the challenge in a U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver, according to a statement from the coalition. The lawsuit targets three waivers doled out to refineries owned by CVR Energy Inc, in which Icahn hold a majority stake, and HollyFrontier Corp. Refiners are required by the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard to blend increasing volumes of biofuels like ethanol each year, but the EPA can offer exemptions for facilities under 75,000 barrels per day, if they experience “disproportionate economic hardship.”  The EPA did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The EPA has come under pressure for being stingy with the waivers in the past, and a successful lawsuit last year by Sinclair Oil Corporation led a federal court to order EPA to expand its definition of “economic hardship” - opening the door for more facilities to qualify. U.S. refiner Andeavor and CVR are among the companies that sources have said have received waivers for their smallest units. Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and Marathon Oil Corp have requested them, sources have told Reuters. The number of waivers has soared, amplifying controversy over a program that has been a battleground for entrenched farm and oil interests in Washington for years. Oil refiners say the requirements cause undue financial strain, while corn and biofuels supporters say the waivers reduce demand for their products. In addition to challenging the waivers themselves, the group criticized the EPA for its lack of transparency. The EPA has refused to share details of which companies have asked for and received the waivers, citing confidential business information. “EPA is trying to undermine the RFS program under the cover of night,” Bob Dinneen, CEO and president of Renewable Fuels Association, said in the statement. The American Coalition for Ethanol and National Farmers Union joined in filing the lawsuit.

2018-05-30,"TOKYO, May 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed in early Asian trade on Wednesday, with worries that Saudi Arabia and Russia will pump more crude weighing on the market. Saudi Arabia and Russia have discussed raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran. Brent crude was down 1 cent at $75.38 a barrel by 0015 GMT, after settling up 9 cents on Tuesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $66.86 a barrel, having earlier settled down $1.15. Credit Suisse analysts on Tuesday said even if Russia and OPEC producers raise output, they would likely only add an additional 500,000 bpd, which would leave inventories in the most developed countries short of the five-year average by the end of 2018. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is due to meet in Vienna on June 22. Falling stocks and a stronger U.S. dollar index also weighed on oil prices. U.S. stock markets sank more than 1 percent, while the dollar wobbled at a 10-month high against the euro. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. U.S. oil got some support as U.S. crude inventories likely fell by 1.8 million barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. Industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) releases its weekly oil data at 2030 GMT, followed by the report by U.S. Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration on Thursday, both delayed a day because of the federal Memorial Day holiday on Monday.

2018-05-30,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Superior Labor Court (TST) ruled on Tuesday that a 72-hour strike planned by workers of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) was illegal, the office of the government’s solicitor general said. The strike due to start on Wednesday was called by unions that are demanding the resignation of Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente and the reversal of market-based changes to pricing that sparked a nine-day truckers strike. The government called the strike political and asked the TST to declare it illegal, while Petrobras said it has taken provisions so that the stoppage does not affect production.

2018-05-30,"* Asian shares set to fall after Italian crisis rattles Wall St * Edgy investors flee stocks, seek safety in bonds * Euro hits 10-month low, dollar and yen rise * U.S. moves on China trade also unnerve investors By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, May 30 (Reuters) - Asian shares looked set for a sharp fall on Wednesday as Italy’s political crisis provoked a sell-off on Wall Street, sent the euro to a 10-month low and spiked borrowing costs for the government in Rome. Japan’s Nikkei futures traded in Chicago pointed to a 1.4 percent fall in the Nikkei. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.58 percent to 24,361.45, the S&P 500 lost 1.16 percent to 2,689.86 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.5 percent to 7,396.59. Investors fear that repeat elections - which now seem likely in the euro zone’s third-largest economy as soon as July - may become a de-facto referendum on Italian membership of the currency bloc and the country’s role in the European Union. Short-dated Italian bond yields - a sensitive gauge of political risk - soared 1.5 percentage points from Monday to their highest since 2013 in their biggest move in nearly 26 years. Tradeweb Markets LLC reported average trading volume in the debt is up by more than 60 percent in May compared to the month prior. Safe-haven U.S. Treasury bonds and German bunds rallied, as did the Japanese yen, the U.S. dollar and gold. The euro fell against the Swiss franc, Japanese yen and U.S. dollar, nearing $1.15 and touching its lowest point since July. “It’s not surprising that investors fled fragile emerging markets and southern Europe and sought safety in cash,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments. “I have been waiting for a 5 percent correction in Japanese and U.S. stocks for some time. But I probably wouldn’t start buying on a full scale unless the Nikkei drops below the 21,000 level.” In Asia, the focus was also on the on-again, off-again U.S.-North Korean summit and the U.S.-China trade relationship. An aide to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un arrived in Singapore on Monday, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, and the White House said a “pre-advance” team was traveling to the city to meet the North Koreans. The reports indicate that planning for the summit, initially scheduled for June 12, is moving ahead. The United States also said on Tuesday that it would continue pursuing actions on trade with China, days after Washington and Beijing announced a tentative solution to their dispute and suggested that tensions had cooled. Emerging market stocks lost 1.0 percent, marking a new low point for the year, under continued pressure from a rising U.S. dollar for countries that often borrow in that currency. Oil struggled under pressure from expectations that Saudi Arabia and Russia would pump more oil to counter potential supply shortfalls from Venezuela and Iran, even as U.S. output has surged in recent years. U.S. crude futures stood at $66.80 per barrel after falling for five sessions.

2018-05-30,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer said on Tuesday there was no chance that a nationwide truckers’ protest that has paralysed Latin America’s biggest economy will spark a military coup and topple his government. Temer, speaking to a small group of foreign journalists at an investment forum in Sao Paulo, batted down questions about risks of a military intervention. The nine-day demonstrations by truck drivers against diesel price hikes has emptied roads and left major cities running short on food, gasoline and medical supplies. The nationwide protest has been has been slow to unwind despite a raft of concessions that Temer offered over the weekend. Some striking truckers are calling for a coup, a hotly debated topic on social media, and fringe groups who want the military back in charge have been a constant presence during anti-corruption protests in recent years. “There is zero chance of military intervention,” Temer said through a translator. “What I see is a rejection both in the Ministry of Defense and throughout the military forces to any kind of military intervention.”   But polling shows that Temer is Brazil’s least popular president since the country’s 1964-85 military junta ended. He also remains under investigation amid allegations of graft.  If Brazil’s Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge were to decide to charge Temer, it would be up to a congressional vote on whether he would be tried before the Supreme Court. Temer last year fought off two such corruption charges, but with general elections in October and polls consistently demonstrating the public’s deep dissatisfaction with political leaders across the board, it is not clear that he retains congressional support to survive any potential new charges. Temer said in a television interview that protests by truck drivers still parked on motorways should be resolved by Wednesday, though his government still has to deliver on its pledge to cut the price of diesel by 0.46 real ($0.12) per litre. A bill approved by the Senate on Tuesday included a tax exemption on diesel inserted by the lower house, but Temer is expected to veto the fuel provision and find a different way to fund the costly concession to truckers. Temer said hefty fines were being levied on distribution firms found to be supporting the strike, but said he hoped tougher action would not be necessary if the truckers moved vehicles off the roads. Earlier on Tuesday, Public Security Minister Raul Jungmann said the government had started taking tougher action against the truckers, threatening to crack down on alleged political agitators contributing to the crisis.  The more aggressive stance underscored the government’s mounting urgency to end the protest.  The highway blockades and fuel shortages have halted industries from automaking to sugarcane crushing, hammering exports of everything from beef and soybeans to coffee and cars. Brazil’s CNA farm lobby said producers have lost 6.6 billion reais ($1.77 billion) so far during the truckers protest. CNA said that did not take into account losses for food processors, industries and makers of inputs. Disruption to supplies of animal feed has had a devastating impact on the nation’s livestock.  Some 70 million chickens had been slaughtered as of Monday because producers cannot feed them, said the poultry and pork processing association ABPA. Some factions within the loosely organised truckers’ movement have added to the demands and ignored a call to demobilize by industry group Abcam, which says it represents 600,000 drivers and spearheaded the early protests. Oil industry regulator ANP said fuel distribution had begun to improve in cities such as Rio de Janeiro and the capital Brasilia, but it remained scarce in several regions, including the business hub of Sao Paulo. It will take at least a week for fuel distribution to return to normal, according to ANP.
