2018-08-13,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday his administration will invest more than $11 billion to boost refining capacity in order to curb growing fuel imports. Lopez Obrador, who will take office on Dec. 1, told reporters his government plans to invest $2.6 billion to modernize existing domestic refineries owned and operated by national oil company Pemex, and spend another $8.4 billion to build a new one within three years. The $8.4-billion figure is higher than a $6 billion estimate provided by a key energy advisor during the campaign. Lopez Obrador, set to become Mexico’s first leftist president in decades, did not detail how the projects would be financed or whether private capital would be involved, but he has often said he will not raise taxes or grow government debt. Mexico is among Latin America’s largest crude exporters, but is also the biggest importer of U.S. refined products. The country’s next president has pledged to lift refining capacity, which he says has declined due to corruption and neglect. Pemex, formally known as Petroleos Mexicanos, has six domestic refineries with a total processing capacity of some 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd), but the facilities are only operating at about 40 percent of capacity so far this year. Meanwhile, gasoline and diesel imports have sky-rocketed in recent months amid planned and unplanned refinery stoppages. Pemex has posted losses in its refining division for years but Lopez Obrador aims to boost crude processing enough to halt imports within three years. Lopez Obrador also said he plans to invest another $4 billion to drill new onshore and shallow-water oil wells in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Chiapas. Pemex production has consistently declined in recent years to fall below 2 million bpd after hitting peak output of 3.4 million bpd in 2004. President Enrique Pena Nieto passed a reform to open up Mexico’s state-run energy industry to private producers, which has led to a series of competitive auctions that have awarded more than 100 oil exploration and production contracts. Lopez Obrador has said he will respect those contracts as long as an ongoing review does not find signs of corruption. He is widely expected to slow down the process of offering more contracts to private players. $1 = 19.1100 Mexican pesos

2018-08-13,"NEW YORK - Turkey’s worsening currency crisis sent world equities lower and cut into the value of emerging market stocks and currencies on  Monday, while boosting the prices of German bonds and other stable assets.  The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.8 percent on the day and 1.8 percent since Friday’s open as the Turkish lira plunged to a record low, forcing the country’s finance minister to announce an economic action plan to ease nerves. The lira has tumbled on worries over President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. It fell as much as 12 percent at one stage on Monday, then recovered to a loss of 8.5 percent.    “The plunge in the lira, which began in May, now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession, and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class.”   Emerging market stocks lost 1.97 percent.

2018-08-13,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday after data suggested inventories at the U.S. crude delivery hub rose in the latest week, compounding worries that troubled emerging markets and trade tensions will dent the outlook for fuel demand. Brent crude futures LCOc1 dipped 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to settle at $72.61 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 declined 43 cents to settle at $67.20 a barrel, with a 0.7 percent loss. Prices fell earlier in the session by more than $1 a barrel after inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for WTI rose by about 1.7 million barrels in the week through Aug. 10, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Crude inventories at Cushing have been dwindling, in part due to an outage at an oil processing facility in Canada that has reduced the flow of crude into the hub. The Canadian Syncrude processing facility has begun ramping up light oil production and was expected to return to full production in September. “Cushing may finally start to replenish from critically low inventory levels,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  Turkey’s financial crisis has raised the risk of contagion throughout emerging economies, dragging down South Africa’s rand, Argentina and Mexico’s pesos and the Russian rouble. It has also dented emerging market stocks while curbing growth and the outlook for oil demand. That is compounding worries that a deepening trade war between the United States, China and the European Union will squeeze business activity in the world’s biggest economies. Turkey is a relatively small oil consumer, accounting for less than 1 million barrels per day (bpd), or around 1 percent of global demand. However, contagion concerns are prompting risk-off sentiment, Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “The energy complex is being increasingly jostled by fresh daily headlines that don’t necessarily have much effect on current supply or demand on a short term basis but could dramatically affect oil balances when looking down the road just a few months,” he said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries forecast lower demand for its crude next year as rivals pump more and said top oil exporter Saudi Arabia, eager to avoid a return of oversupply, had cut production. In a monthly report, OPEC said the world will need 32.05 million bpd of crude from its 15 members in 2019, down 130,000 bpd from last month’s forecast. U.S. oil production from seven major shale basins was expected to rise 93,000 bpd in September to 7.52 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.

2018-08-13,"* H1 core earnings up 77 percent to $3.1 billion * Sold 101,000 tonnes of nickel in first half * Investors, battery makers bet on electric car boom (Adds battery industry demand, cobalt sales) By Polina  Ivanova MOSCOW, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Expectations of a boom in demand for electric vehicles are leading investors and battery makers to stockpile nickel and helping to fuel a spike in global prices of the metal, Russian mining company Norilsk Nickel said on Monday. Nornickel, the world’s second-largest nickel producer, said demand for the metal from the battery sector leapt 38 percent in the first half of this year versus the same period last year. Along with demand from the stainless steel sector, this helped boost prices to $15,750 per tonne in June, their highest in over four years, the company said, with the battery sector accounting for 5 percent of total global nickel demand. Nornickel said the expected pick-up in demand for electric vehicles was also a factor behind a drop in industry inventories, as investors and battery makers built up stocks. Nickel inventories at the London and Shanghai exchanges fell to 274.000 tonnes from 411,000 tonnes between January and July, it said. Nornickel sold 101,000 tonnes of nickel in the first half of the year. It also mines cobalt, also used in electric vehicle batteries, and revenue from that metal rose 52 percent in the first half of this year, the company added. On a phone call with investors and producers, Nornickel said it expected the battery sector to become the industry’s second-largest market in the next few years, behind stainless steel. “Consumption by the battery sector for electric vehicles may be lagging behind stainless steel, but it is growing at a furious pace,” said Anton Berlin, head of Nornickel’s marketing department. The firm reported a 77 percent jump in first-half core earnings, with strong global prices offsetting the impact of U.S. sanctions on aluminium giant Rusal, which holds a 27.8 percent stake in Nornickel. At $3.1 billion, Nornickel’s first-half earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) beat analysts’ expectations. “We enjoyed (a) favourable global commodity markets environment in the first half of 2018,” Nornickel president and co-owner Vladimir Potanin said in a statement. “As a result, average realised prices for all our key metals (except for platinum) rallied in the range of 20-40 percent.” Shares in the nickel producer were up 1.9 percent on the day, recovering from a fall on Friday after news that Russia President Vladimir Putin would consider a proposal to raise further revenue for the state budget from metals and mining companies. Nornickel, which vies with Brazil’s Vale SA to be the world’s biggest nickel producer, said it expected the nickel deficit on global markets to widen from 15,000 tonnes to 124,000 tonnes.

We have no other choice,” Abadi told a news conference in Baghdad. Last week he said Iraq disagreed with the U.S. sanctions on Iran but would abide by them to safeguard its own interests, triggering criticisms from Iran-allied Iraqi politicians and in the Islamic Republic. The United States and Iran, increasingly at odds, are Iraq’s two biggest allies and the sanctions put Abadi’s outgoing government in a difficult position. The sanctions target Iran’s trade in gold and other precious metals, its purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. Asked if Baghdad would stop imports of commodities, appliances and equipment by government companies from Iran he said the matter was still being reviewed. “We honestly have not made any decision regarding this issue until now.” (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed Writing by Ahmed Aboulenein and Maria Tsvetkova Editing by John Stonestreet and David Holmes)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-iraq/update-1-iraq-to-respect-dollar-ban-but-not-all-u-s-sanctions-on-iran-idUKL5N1V45DV,13 Aug 2018,"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider

The run from risk dragged MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 1.3 percent to a five-week low. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.6 percent with every bourse in the region in the red. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.4 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields dipped further to 2.85 percent . China’s blue chip index shed 1.4 percent, while Hong Kong stocks lost 1.6 percent as the local dollar fell to the limits of its trading band. Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400. The lira found just a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions. Yet the dollar was still up almost 10 percent on the day at 7.0000 lira. This time last month it was at 4.8450. The currency tumbled on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. “The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,” he added. Kenningham noted Turkey’s annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added. “Nonetheless, Turkey’s troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.” Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45. Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13700. It was last at $1.1380 and still a long way from last week’s top at $1.1628. The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.21 , but was a shade firmer against a basket of currencies at 96.431. The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire, with the dollar adding 5 percent on the rand. Dealers said Japanese retail investors had been squeezed out of long positions in the rand sending the yen steaming higher. “Contagion risks centre on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,” warned analysts at ANZ. “Turkey’s massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that’s threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.” In commodity markets, gold found little in the way of safety flows and was last down at $1,208.21 an ounce.

2018-08-13,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck on Sunday near the native Alaskan village of Kaktovik and part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where the Trump administration plans to allow oil drilling, but no injuries or damage were reported. The temblor, which occurred just before 7 a.m. (1500 GMT), was the most powerful on record to hit Alaska’s oil-producing North Slope, said Paul Huang, a seismologist and deputy director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska. No tsunami alert was generated, though ground motion was felt as far away as Fairbanks, Alaska, nearly 400 miles (644 km) to the south.  The quake had no impact on operations of the Trans Alaska Pipeline system that carries North Slope crude 800 miles (1,300 km) to the marine terminal at Valdez, according to a statement from Alyeska, the consortium that runs the pipeline. Alyeska said it would conduct follow-up inspections of the pipeline and related facilities. Inspection teams likewise found nothing amiss at the Prudhoe Bay oil field about 85 miles (137 km) to the east, said Megan Baldino, a spokeswoman for BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc, which operates the field. The quake, initially measured at a magnitude 6.5, was followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest of which was a 6.0 tremor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The main earthquake was centred 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Kaktovik, a coastal Inupiat village of about 260 residents at the northern edge of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). State emergency officials said they had no reports of damage, but locals in Kaktovik said the tremor did not pass unnoticed. “I felt a little shaking and felt dizzy, and felt the shelves shaking,” said Archie Brower, assistant manager at the Kaktovik Kikiktak grocery. The epicentre also lies near an area the U.S. Interior Department plans to lease for petroleum exploration along ANWR’s coastal plain, which had been off-limits to fossil fuel development until a provision was enacted as part of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax bill. The vast and environmentally pristine coastal plain, wedged between the Beaufort Sea and Brooks Range mountains, is prized for its importance to caribou, polar bears and other wildlife but is believed to hold billions of barrels of oil. “Scientifically, however, this region is poorly understood and the behaviour of the fault or faults responsible for today’s earthquake are not known,” the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks said in a bulletin.  Strong earthquakes are not uncommon in seismically active Alaska, but they tend to occur in remote, sparsely populated regions where there is little or no damage.

2018-08-13,"(Repeats Aug. 10 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MAQVuG By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices have stalled over the last two months as the prospect of tough sanctions on Iran’s exports from November is offset by concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth later in 2018 and 2019. Brent futures prices for crude delivered in 2019 have been flat since late May, after rising strongly since February, with the calendar strip steadying around $71-73 per barrel. The U.S. government estimates Iran’s oil exports will be cut by between 0.7 and 1.0 million barrels per day from November as a result of sanctions (“U.S. forecasts 50 percent cut in Iran oil sales”, Bloomberg, Aug. 10). But the prospective loss of crude has failed to lift prices as traders focus on compensating increases in production from Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as slower growth in consumption. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has slumped from a steep backwardation in April and May into a contango structure as traders anticipate more oil availability (tmsnrt.rs/2MAQVuG). Some of the shift stems from the big increase in production by Saudi Arabia and Russia that started in late May and June, which should help build up stocks ahead of the reimposition of sanctions in November. But it also coincides with a weakening of the global economic outlook that suggests slower growth in consumption of diesel and other refined products later this year and into 2019. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s composite leading indicator has slipped since the start of the year and “is pointing tentatively to easing growth momentum in the OECD area as a whole”. Growth is easing in Canada, Germany, France and Britain though it remains stable in the United States and Japan (“Composite Leading Indicators,” OECD, Aug. 8). The World Trade Organization’s trade outlook indicator also points to a slowdown in the momentum of global trade growth in the months ahead (“World Trade Outlook Indicator”, WTO, Aug. 9). Export orders have declined steadily since the start of the year, while air freight volumes and container port throughput are growing above trend but appear past their peak, according to the WTO. The WTO notes air freight has proven to be a timely indicator of overall world trade and an early signal of turning points in economic activity. In that context, the International Air Transport Association’s monthly update shows air freight volumes growing more slowly than in 2016/17. The inventory restocking cycle was mostly completed by the end of 2017, according to the association (“Air cargo volumes continue their modest uptrend, amid rising risks”, IATA, Aug. 9). “Moreover, the loss of momentum in air freight demand is also consistent with the broad-based moderation in manufacturing firms’ export order books since the start of 2018.” The prospective deceleration in global trade growth has been reflected in lower diesel prices since the end of May as traders anticipate consumption will advance more slowly than before. Diesel, jet fuel and other mid-distillates are more sensitive to the economic cycle and freight movements than any other part of the oil market. The gross refining margin for low-sulphur distillate delivered in April 2019, after next winter, has tumbled over the last three months on the weaker freight outlook. The oil market is now delicately poised between a mildly tightening production outlook (with partially effective Iran sanctions) and a mildly deteriorating consumption outlook (with somewhat slower growth). The International Energy Agency warned on Friday that “trade tensions might escalate and lead to slower economic growth, and in turn lower oil demand” (“Oil Market Report,” IEA, Aug. 10). “For now, we have made no changes to our underlying economic and oil demand assumptions, but we are mindful that demand growth could cool down later this year and into 2019”, the IEA added.

2018-08-13,"SINGAPORE, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Monday as U.S. sanctions against Iran pointed towards a tighter market, although concerns over slowing economic growth amid global trade tensions kept a lid on gains. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $72.88 per barrel at 0053 GMT, up by 7 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 16 cents at $67.79 per barrel. The United States has started implementing new sanctions against Iran, which from November will also target the country’s petroleum sector. “With U.S. sanctions on Iran back in place ... all eyes have been on the impact on crude oil exports from that country,” ANZ bank said on Monday. “Maintaining global supply might be very challenging,” the bank said, although it added that “the U.S. is doing its bit to increase production, with data showing drilling activity is continuing to rise.” U.S. energy companies last week added the most oil rigs since May, adding 10 rigs to bring the total count to 869, according to the Baker Hughes energy services firm. That was the highest level of drilling activity since March 2015. Also potentially weighing on oil markets are signs of slowing economic growth and fuel demand growth, especially in Asia’s large emerging markets. “Lower demand from China, the world’s biggest importer, comes at a critical time when demand growth from Asia in general is being called into question. This due to the negative impact of trade wars, a stronger dollar and rising funding costs,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank, said in a note late last week.

2018-08-13,"* Turkish lira hits new lows, govt promises it has a plan * Euro slips as safe haven yen, Swiss franc, dollar bid * Asian stocks open lower, emerging markets under pressure By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Asia share markets slipped and the euro hit one-year lows on Monday as a fresh fall in the Turkish lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.95 percent and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.3 percent as bourses across the region turned red. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.15 percent, while Treasury yields dipped further. Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400 at one stage. It was last at 6.8450, having found just a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions. The currency tumbled more than 40 percent this year on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. “The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,” he added. Kenningham noted Turkey’s annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added. “Nonetheless, Turkey’s troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.” Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc in early trade around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45 . Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13715. It was last at $1.1392 and still a long way from last week’s top at $1.1628. The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.65, but was a shade firmer against a basket of currencies at 96.388. The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire. “Contagion risks centre on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,” warned analysts at ANZ. “Turkey’s massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that’s threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.” In commodity markets, gold had found little in the way of safety flows and was last stuck at $1,211.80 an ounce . Oil prices edged higher with Brent up 5 cents at $72.86 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 15 cents to $67.78.

2018-08-13,"IMMERATH, Germany, Aug 13 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For four generations, Portz family life has focused around a quaint, red-brick farmhouse and the fertile fields beyond, ready for early harvest after this summer’s high heat. Soon, the family will pull its last potato and final spike of grain from the rich Immerath soil. Big coal is coming to replace their agrarian way of life. The Portz matriarch puts on a brave face as she folds laundry in her flower-packed yard, the ground strewn with toys. “It’s always jolly here,” Christiane Portz told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, interrupted by a chatter of grandchildren who make noisily for the stable. The singsong voices, the spill of toys - everything will go when the home is bulldozed and replaced with a vast coal mine. Immerath, once a small village of 1,200 in Germany’s western frontier, host to both farms and industry, has fallen quiet. The Portz family is one of the last households still in situ; they live among piles of rubble after neighbouring families were resettled 12 k west at New Immerath. Roughly 1.3 billion tons of lignite - a soft coal - were discovered long ago under the village and its surrounding land in Germany’s North Rhine Westphalia state. Few locals took the threat seriously, so life continued until development of the mine became reality and villages were lined up for destruction. Immerath is one of the last to make way for the expansion of Garzweiler opencast mine, which is run by giant German energy provider RWE, supplying one third of Germany’s overall power. Once Garzweiler is finished, 20 villages will have gone. Under the scheme, some 5,000 people will be forced to move, compensated with either a new house or cash. RWE says almost half of locals just take the money. “Our expectation is that Garzweiler will be open until the middle of the century,” RWE press officer Guido Steffen told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “Germany is making radical changes, but even in the long run, in order to provide energy, we can’t forgo conventional power plants.” Once finished, the company website says the mine will cover an operating surface of about 32 sq km. The size of the approved mining field is 114 sq km, it says. The plan to expand was no shock for locals. It was back in the 1960s when nearby villages first made way for coal extraction, despite loud community protests, and protesters say the march of commerce over community continues nationwide. Germany’s Environmental Agency says the Federal Mining Act prioritises the extraction of raw materials over the interests of the common good. Since 1945, hundreds of villages yielded to a growing need for energy, with 40 percent of Germany’s power coming from coal. RWE, Europe’s top emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), admits lignite is cheap to produce, but harmful for the environment. “We aim to halve CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2030,” RWE’s Steffen said. What’s left of Immerath - and other nearby villages - is eerie streets and abandoned houses. The noise of the bulldozers is omnipresent as they rumble through the ghost towns. Immerath’s village church - lovingly dubbed the ‘cathedral’ by locals who financed its construction 130 years ago - was demolished in January. In New Immerath, a simple modern church has usurped the imposing, towered cathedral. The Portz family is due to leave in September. “It is what it is,” said Portz, who is in her 60s and helps run the farm. “We’ve known the day would arrive and we all need energy.” Portz insists she is positive about her new home, too. The old, ivy-covered farmhouse will be swallowed by the mine and the family will move to three modern houses 12 k away. Her husband, who grew up on the family farm and has watched two more generations do the same, does not take change lightly. “It’s a nightmare. I think about it constantly,” said her husband, who did not want to give his first name. Aside from the human cost to close-knit families like his, campaigners count the wider environmental fallout. “It is absolutely unacceptable that coal companies like RWE still want to destroy homes and nature for dirty lignite. It is inefficient, CO2-intense and not able to be a flexible partner for clean renewables like wind and solar power,” said campaigner Anike Peters of Greenpeace. Along with local residents, Greenpeace and other groups have protested against the forced resettlement and say they plan to step up the demonstrations. “Local resistance against lignite is stronger than ever. We want the coal to stay in the ground,” said Johanna Winter of Klimacamp, an initiative organised to protect the environment. More protests are planned this month against what Maja Rothe, also of Klimacamp, calls “a clear example of the rules of capitalism putting boundaries to democracy.” About 6 km from Immerath sits Berverath: a small farming village squeezed between green fields and apple trees. It is due to be destroyed in 2023 and local agronomist Elionore Kreins is fighting hard for her farm’s survival. “During a first meeting with RWE, a representative told us that ‘our emotions are out of place.’ Immediately after, we decided to get legal help,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from a wooden bench at her farm. Costs are steep: up to 250 euros ($290) an hour and the family has not yet sold its land. Once sold, RWE finances the resettlement. “We are expropriated and our lifestyle will have to change. Keeping animals in town is allowed in Berverath, but it won’t be possible in New Berverath, so farmers have to rethink,” she said. Both her children and parents live on the farm and Kreins takes care of her elderly mother. The rules mean her animals cannot figure in her new life. “It’s true,” Steffen admitted. “The new villages have to abide by new building regulations. The old villages will look like modern suburbs with detached houses and small gardens.” Lignite extraction is due to start in the village by 2028, and will continue until about 2045. Once finished, the area will be flooded with Rhine water and turned into a lake. “The destruction of villages like Berverath must be completely avoided,” said Greenpeace’s Peters. “Germany must phase out coal until 2030 at the latest.” Back in Immerath, a small house still stands at the village entrance. A sign above the door reads “Heimat” - roughly translated as 'home'. But this very German concept also carries a sense of 'homeland'; a feeling of belonging and roots. Empty and lifeless, the house now sits with its blinds down and its driveway overgrown, waiting for the bulldozer to call.

2018-08-13,"PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to make bottles produced with recycled plastic cheaper than bottles made from virgin plastic and will further tighten regulation on plastics use, a government minister said.  Junior Environment Minister Brune Poirson told the “Le Journal du Dimanche” (JDD) weekly that the government also plans to increase taxes on landfill and reduce value-added tax on recycling activities.  This would be a boost for French recycling firms such as Veolia and Suez, which have called for such measures. reut.rs/2nBen06 Poirson said that in order to channel more plastic waste towards recycling, France will introduce a discount-premium system worth up to 10 percent of the price of a product in order to encourage consumers to recycle.  “Tomorrow, when there is a choice between two bottles, one made with recycled plastic, the other not, the first one will be cheaper,” she said.  She gave no timeline, but said that in early 2019 the government will present additional and specific measures to tackle plastic pollution.  The previous socialist French government in 2016 banned plastic straws, cups and plates from Jan. 2020, but the centrist government of President Emmanuel Macron has rejected proposals to introduce a deposit on plastic bottles, as some European countries have done.  Asked whether it was sufficient to count on the goodwill of industry to reach Macron’s target of 100 percent plastic recycling by 2025, Poirson said that imposing new regulation too quickly would lead to defensive reactions.  “If in two years there is no progress, we will introduce regulation,” she said.  France recycles just 25.5 percent of its plastic packaging waste, the second-worst recycling rate in Europe. It compares to about 50 percent in Germany and The Netherlands, data from statistics portal Eurostat show.  bit.ly/2B7MtCu Michel-Edouard Leclerc, CEO of leading French retailer E.Leclerc, told the JDD that ahead of the 2020 ban on throwaway plastic tableware, his stores would stop selling these products from the end of the first quarter of 2019. He said they would be replaced by reusable products or by disposable cups and plates made from more environmentally friendly materials such as cardboard or bamboo.  Leclerc is also trialing a plastic and glass bottle deposit system in some of its stores in northern France that gives customers points on their loyalty cards, he said.

2018-08-13,"LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.AS) global refining operations Lori Ryerkerk will step down at the end of the month after five years in a job where she oversaw a vast overhaul of the business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Ryerkerk will be succeeded by Robin Mooldijk, who currently serves as Vice President Manufacturing Americas, responsible for the Anglo-Dutch company’s refining and chemical plants in the United States, Canada and Argentina. Ryerkerk played a key part in the transformation of Shell’s refining operations in recent years into a major cash generator, particularly during the 2014-2016 market downturn.  That included the dissolution of the Motiva joint venture with Saudi Aramco last year, which saw Shell sell its stake in the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to become sole owner of the Norco and Convent refineries in Louisiana. Shell sold other refineries and invested billions in upgrading its operations in recent years to create three major hubs in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Rotterdam and Singapore. Over the past 15 years, Shell has cut refining operations from 51 sites with a capacity of 4.4 million barrel per day (bpd) to 18 sites with 2.9 million bpd, Ryerkerk said in a presentation in March. “The consolidation of our footprint has focused on retaining increasingly complex sites, which offer crude grade flexibility, proximity to trading centres for full product-side flexibility, connectivity to material marketing demands, and strong integration with Chemicals manufacturing assets,” she said. The company will invest $2 to $3 billion a year by 2020 in its refining and trading business out of a total spending budget of $25 to $30 billion. Before joining Shell in 2010, Ryerkerk worked in refining for Exxon Mobil for 24 years, and at Hess Corporation. Mooldijk was appointed Vice President Manufacturing  Americas on July 1, 2016. He joined Shell in 1991 and has since worked in the Netherlands, Britain and South Africa in the refining and chemicals business.

2018-08-13,"* Turkish lira hits record low of 7.24 to the dollar overnight * Lira crisis hits South African rand, Russian rouble, China yuan * MSCI EM stock index falls 1.8%, close to more than 1 year low By Karin Strohecker and Swati Pandey LONDON/SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The crisis engulfing Turkish markets over its diplomatic rift with the United States sent tremors through emerging markets on Monday, knocking some main currencies to multi-year lows and weighing heavily on equities. Investors fear the selloff in the lira, which hit a fresh record low overnight, could have a ripple effect in global financial markets, with the euro, South Africa’s rand and Mexico’s peso already dented by Turkey’s crisis. The lira pared some of its losses against the dollar after the central bank said it had lowered reserve requirement ratios for banks as well as pledged to provide whatever liquidity banks needed and to take all necessary measures to maintain financial stability. However, the Turkish currency was still down more than 6 percent on the day and within spitting distance of a record low around 7.24 hit it early Asian trade. The lira has weakened nearly 45 percent since the start of the year. Turkey’s local bond markets saw yields spike above 21 percent, while dollar-denominated bonds issued by the government and banks suffered a steep selloff. Istanbul’s stock exchange halted trading in three of the country’s leading banks after they tumbled more than 11 percent. “It’s a textbook crisis – for many years everybody said Turkey was a weak country due to its large external debt and current account deficit,” said Guillaume Tresca, senior emerging markets strategist at Credit Agricole. “There is nothing surprising other than that the central bank is not really reacting. They issued this new plan but there is no tightening of financial conditions – they are completely behind the curve.” Other main currencies were caught in the vortex. South Africa’s rand skidded to levels not seen since mid-2016 and Russia’s rouble slumped to a near 2-1/2 year trough. The Indian rupee slid to an all-time trough, while the Indonesian rupiah hitting a near three-year low prompted the central bank to intervene. China’s yuan weakened 0.5 percent - its steepest daily decline in nearly four weeks. The wave of selling was triggered on Friday when U.S. President Donald Trump announced tougher sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminium exports, causing a spike in emerging foreign exchange volatility gauges. Adding to the emerging market woes, Washington imposed surprise sanctions last week against Russia. Some safe haven currencies and bonds rallied. The dollar index held near its one-year top of 96.522, while the Japanese yen climbed for a second straight day to a 1-1/2 month peak. However, the sell-off was not limited to emerging markets: the euro stumbled to more than one-year lows on worries about European bank exposure to Turkey.

MSCI’s broadest emerging markets index slipped 1.8 percent and traded within eyesight of a one-year low hit in June.

2018-08-13,"* Lori Ryerkerk to leave company at end of Aug * To be succeeded by Robin Mooldijk, head of Americas refining * Ryerkerk oversaw major refining overhaul By Ron Bousso LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - The head of Royal Dutch Shell’s global refining operations Lori Ryerkerk will step down at the end of the month after five years in a job where she oversaw a vast overhaul of the business, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. Ryerkerk will be succeeded by Robin Mooldijk, who currently serves as Vice President Manufacturing Americas, responsible for the Anglo-Dutch company’s refining and chemical plants in the United States, Canada and Argentina. Ryerkerk played a key part in the transformation of Shell’s refining operations in recent years into a major cash generator, particularly during the 2014-2016 market downturn. That included the dissolution of the Motiva joint venture with Saudi Aramco last year, which saw Shell sell its stake in the Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to become sole owner of the Norco and Convent refineries in Louisiana. Shell sold other refineries in recent years to create three major hubs in the U.S. Gulf Coast, Rotterdam and Singapore. Shell today operates 14 refineries in eight different countries with a capacity of 2.9 million barrels per day. Before joining Shell in 2010, Ryerkerk worked in refining for Exxon Mobil for 24 years, and at Hess Corporation.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.5 percent on Monday and 1.6 percent since Friday’s open as the Turkish lira plunged to a record low, forcing the country’s finance minister to announce an economic action plan to ease nerves . The lira has tumbled on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. It fell as much as 12 percent at one stage on Monday, then recovered to a loss of 7 percent by 0800 GMT. “There’s a risk-off mood generally triggered by the Turkish currency sell off, and we are seeing a wider sell-off now, and it’s looking pretty ugly in other emerging markets as well,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. He pointed to the South African rand and the Mexican peso, both down about 2.5 percent on Monday, as two examples of emerging markets hit by contagion. “The plunge in the lira, which began in May, now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession, and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class.” Turkish credit default swaps - a hedge against financial turbulence - surged to their highest since the 2008 global financial crisis as the lira took its latest dive. The euro zone has also been hit by Turkish woes, particularly after a report by the Financial Times last week suggested the European Central Bank is increasingly concerned about euro zone banks with exposure to Turkey. The euro fell to a one-year low against the dollar on Monday and sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc as well. It hit a 10-week low to the yen around 125.45 . European stocks fell in early trade on Monday, with a pan-European index of shares down half a percent and the banking stock index as much as 1.2 percent lower. This after MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.5 percent to a near one-year low. Japan’s Nikkei lost 2.0 percent with every bourse in the region in the red. Safe-haven government bonds were in demand, with yields on German 10-year debt, the benchmark for the euro zone, dropping to a one-month low. Overnight, U.S. Treasury 10-year yields also dipped to the lowest in just over three weeks at 2.85 percent. Copper prices, meanwhile, often seen as a proxy for global economic growth, were down 1 percent at $6,131 a tonne. In other commodity markets, gold was last down half a percent at $1,204 an ounce. Oil prices fell, with Brent crude off 25 cents at $72.56 a barrel and U.S. crude 21 cents lower at $67.43.

2018-08-13,"ALGIERS, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Algeria has been trying to attract more investment to its vital oil and gas sector. Here are some of the key developments since Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour took over as CEO of state energy firm Sonatrach in March, 2017. — Kaddour has resolved a series of disputes with oil majors including France’s Total, Italy’s ENI and Spain’s Repsol which had blocked investments. In January, Sonatrach signed a memorandum of understanding with Norway’s Statoil and Britain’s BP to strengthen cooperation, particularly in upstream oil exploration. — The government has planned a new energy law for years to offer more competitive terms to investors. The bill should be ready by the end of 2018, Sonatrach sources say. While a tax benefit will be added, a rule limiting foreign ownership of foreign ventures to 49 percent is likely to remain, they say. — Sonatrach has been trying to focus on petrochemicals to lower a fuel import bill by agreeing to buy Exxon Mobil’s Augusta refinery in Italy for $700 million this year. It signed a deal in January with oil trader Vitol to exchange crude for refined products, its first such deal, and is discussing a trading venture. — It also plans to develop solar power to enable it to export more of its output. — Sonatrach’s CEO has launched a long term strategy called “SH 2030” that aims to make $67 billion in additional revenue by 2030, of which 50 percent will be reinvested. Few other details of the plan have been released since then. — Another focus has been to boost shale gas reserves to offset rising domestic gas consumption eating into exports. Sonatrach has expressed hope that Exxon Mobil will agree on cooperation in this area. Algeria sits on the third-largest reserves in the world. — Sonatrach has also been trying to expand abroad, holding talks with Niger and Iraq for exploration contracts. Nothing concrete has been announced yet.

2018-08-13,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - The head of Algerian state oil firm Sonatrach has assembled a new leadership team, a senior company source said, aiming to reverse a flow of talent from an unwieldy state enterprise that keeps the country afloat. President Abdelaziz Bouteflika put U.S.-trained Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour in charge of overhauling Sonatrach in March, 2017, after years of short-lived CEOs, fraud scandals and red tape had put foreign investors off the North African OPEC producer. The oil giant is an important source of energy for European states trying to reduce their dependence on Russia, and it funds a major part of the budget in a country where economic security helps prevent social turbulence. Jobs at Sonatrach are plentiful and sought-after, but, on a global scale, pay is low and depends on time served. “We have lost thousands of experienced and talented people mainly because we can’t give them a salary they get now in the Gulf and other countries,” Kaddour said in an interview in his 10th-floor office in Algiers. The CEO, who came with his own team to help win back the trust of oil majors, has now chosen eight vice presidents from within the firm, the Sonatrach source said, declining to be named because the appointments have not been made public. The source said they included experienced managers such as Salah Mekmouche for exploration and Arbi bey Slimane for pipe transportation, and what he said were “rising stars” Farid Ghazali, for strategy, and Ahmed Mazighi on commercial affairs. “The appointments still need to be validated by a presidential decree but the top managers have already started,” the source said. Sonatrach and Kaddour were not immediately available to comment on the appointments. Kaddour aims to make the firm one of the top five state oil companies by 2030. In 2017, Algeria was ranked 18th in a U.S. Energy Information Administration list by output. Empowering Kaddour to make far-reaching changes is part of efforts by Bouteflika, an army-backed former independence fighter in office since 1999, to overcome a slump in oil and gas exports by easing the grip of generals on economic matters. Annual energy revenues have halved since 2014. Bouteflika, who has not spoken in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, dismissed four senior generals in June, including police chief Abdelghani Hamel, a display of power over security services before elections next year. It is part of a trend some outsiders have noticed. “When you speak to a banker or to an economic operator now you can be sure that they no longer have someone telling them what to do, as used to be the case when the old guard was in charge,” a Western diplomat said. Sonatrach holds the third biggest shale reserves in the world and has been talking to Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and other firms about exploration to shore up energy export revenues, which make up 95 percent of total exports.  But such exploration requires specialist skills, and 10,000 engineers, drillers, reservoir specialists and others have left since 2010, said a manager at Sonatrach, a sprawling conglomerate with around 40,000 workers in its oil and gas division. They have been encouraged by generous bonuses offered to state workers who resign to ease the burden on the budget. Hundreds are already working in the Gulf, including Zahir Shikh, a senior reservoir engineer based there, and several sources said the exodus had accelerated this year as rising crude prices encouraged firms there and elsewhere to hire more. “Friends and colleagues at Sonatrach call me on a daily basis seeking a position in the Gulf,” Shikh said by telephone. “(Monthly) Salaries here are between $5,000 to $15,000, while Sonatrach’s CEO salary is no more than $10,000.” Kaddour, who spent much of his career in the U.S. as well as energy firms in the Gulf and Africa, plans education and training via a ‘Sonatrach Management Academy’ and will bring back retired workers to coach new recruits. He is also seeking to introduce special rewards to retain bright people, working around a rigid salary structure which pays a bureaucrat like a deep-water drilling engineer. Kaddour fears any outright wage increase for engineers might trigger wider protests after doctors and teachers went on strike for months this year demanding pay rises to match inflation. A former energy minister said Sonatrach should expand its  overseas activities to retain high performers — under the pay system such foreign jobs are paid better than local hires.  Sonatrach is present in its southern neighbour Niger and officials have said it is talking to Iraq and Libya about exploration and development contracts. Kaddour’s success could hang on whether potential recruits think he can last in his post in a country where regular reshuffles signal shifts in a secretive elite made up of the ruling party, military, intelligence and tycoons. Sonatrach has had ten CEOs in the past ten years; Kaddour himself served a jail term before he got the top job. Bouteflika is expected to run for a fifth presidential term next year, but there are questions over his health. His last appearance, in April, was the first in some time, although allies say his mind is sharp and he remains in charge.

2018-08-13,"(Refiles to fix one word in quote in 6th pargrapah) * Turkey’s lira at record lows $7.2149 as crisis with U.S. deepens * South African rand, Russia’s rouble also hit * Analysts fear contagion risks from lira’s crisis By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Emerging market currencies suffered a renewed bout of selling on Monday while Asian shares were a sea of red amid a deepening crisis for Turkey’s lira, which plunged to all-time lows on concerns over a rift with the United States. Investors fear the lira’s sell-off could have a ripple effect in global financial markets with the euro, the South African rand and Mexico’s peso already dented by Turkey’s crisis. The lira hit a record low around $7.2400 against the dollar in early Asian trade. The South African rand skidded to a level not seen since mid-2016 and Russia’s rouble slumped to a near 2-1/2 year trough. The Indian rupee slid to an all-time trough, while the Indonesian rupiah hit its lowest in almost three years, prompting intervention from the country’s central bank. The wave of selling was triggered on Friday when President Donald Trump announced higher U.S. sanctions on Turkish steel and aluminium exports, causing a spike in EM FX volatility gauges. Russian markets also felt the heat last week after a surprise sanctions move by Washington. “It is premature to conclude how long and how much the impact will expand,” said Kim Doo-un, Seoul-based economist at KB Securities. “I expect emerging countries, which have thorny relationship with Trump administration, could be the first ones (to) suffer from capital outflows. A strong dollar will cause some dissonance and the trend will continue throughout this week.” Safe haven currencies and bonds rallied. The dollar index was near a one-year top of 96.505 while the Japanese yen climbed for a second straight day to a 1-1/2 month top. Yet, the sell-off is not limited to emerging markets: the euro stumbled to more than one-year lows on worries about European bank exposure to Turkey. Spain’s BBVA, Italy’s UniCredit and France’s BNP Paribas have some of the largest operations in Turkey among the euro zone banks. The fear of a contagion reverberated across markets with every Asian share index in the red on Monday. At 0410 GMT, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had fallen 1.7 percent while the MSCI International EM index was down 2.0 percent. Still, some analysts see the current turmoil as an opportunity to pick up cheap assets. “Asia should not see any contagion effect fundamentally due to the ongoing crisis in Turkey as the region does not have a meaningful exposure to the country,” analysts at Singapore’s DBS said in a note. “We would see any meaningful correction in bond prices on the back of the Turkey developments alone, as a buying opportunity.” Editing by Richard Borsuk",https://uk.reuters.com/article/emerging-markets/refile-emerging-markets-em-currencies-shares-hit-by-turkeys-turmoil-idUKL4N1V41VN,13 Aug 2018,"* Turkey's lira at record lows $7.2149 as crisis with U.S.

2018-08-13,"(Reuters) - The board of Australia’s APA Group (APA.AX) has recommended shareholders vote for a A$12.98 billion ($9.45 billion) takeover offer from a consortium led by Hong Kong’s CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd (CKI) (1038.HK) at a meeting in late November. While analysts expect shareholders to approve the deal, APA’s stock was broadly flat after the announcement, trading around 10 percent below the A$11 offer price on concern the regulators may block the deal due to rising gas prices. “CKI is satisfied with its prospects of obtaining clearance and we are comfortable with the prospects of gaining approvals based on the information available to us,” APA Chairman Michael Fraser told reporters on a conference call on Monday. The deal would make CKI - part of an empire founded by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing - the biggest gas pipeline player on Australia’s east coast, giving it more pricing power in a market where gas prices are so high the issue has become political. Gas prices have soared since the opening of three liquefied natural gas export plants on the east coast, sucking gas out of the domestic market. A consequent rise in utility bills has become a sore point for voters, leaving the government trying to win approval for an energy policy aimed at bringing prices down. CKI, in a separate statement on Monday, said it is seeking approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) as well as the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is being advised by the Critical Infrastructure Centre. “CKI is strongly supportive of the Australian government’s energy policy objectives, particularly as they relate to the availability, reliability and affordability of energy for Australian businesses and consumers,” said CKI Deputy Managing Director Andy Hunter. The recommendation comes after CKI conducted nearly two months of due diligence without changing its offer made in June. That was 33 percent above APA’s share price on the eve of the offer, and led APA to open its books to the consortium, which includes CK Asset Holdings Ltd (1113.HK) and Power Assets Holdings Ltd (0006.HK). “We think the offer’s broadly fair, but we’re waiting for the ACCC and Critical Infrastructure review,” said Nick Langley, co-chief executive of RARE Infrastructure, APA’s eighth-largest shareholder. Last year, CKI received approval for a A$7.4 billion takeover of pipeline owner DUET Group. To minimise competition concern for the APA deal, it has offered to divest all of APA’s pipeline assets in Western Australia, where it has owned the Dampier-to-Bunbury gas pipeline since the DUET takeover. The competition watchdog began reviewing the deal in June and aims to announce a decision or concerns on Sept. 13. “These bids are expensive, so you wouldn’t be frivolous with your capital unless you were reasonably confident of finding a way through,” Langley said. “Having said that, (APA) is trading a long way below the terms of the deal, so the market obviously has a different view.” Reporting by Devika Syamnath in Bengaluru; Editing by Susan Thomas and Paul Tait",https://uk.reuters.com/article/apa-ma-ck-asst-hldg/update-2-australias-apa-backs-9-5-bln-bid-from-hong-kongs-cki-as-regulatory-jitters-cap-shares-idUKL4N1V30O5,13 Aug 2018,"* APA shares broadly flat, still 10 pct below bid price

2018-08-13,"(Repeats story issued late on Friday with no changes to text) By Rajendra Jadhav and Sudarshan Varadhan MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, Aug 10 (Reuters) - China is exporting textiles to India through Bangladesh to get around a tax increase on imports, undermining New Delhi’s efforts to support local manufacturers, industry sources said. Earlier this week, India doubled the import tax on more than 300 textile products to 20 percent, marking the second tax increase on textiles in as many months. This is aimed at providing relief to the country’s domestic textile industry, which has been hit by cheaper imports. India’s total textile imports jumped by 16 percent to a record $7 billion in the fiscal year to March 2018. Of this, about $3 billion were from China. Textiles are India’s second largest job provider directly employing nearly 51 million people and accounting for 5 percent of India’s gross domestic product, and 13 percent of its export earnings. Industry officials said textile raw material from China is coming into India via Bangladesh, which has a free-trade agreement with India giving it access to the country’s $100 billion textile market. “Duty free fabric from China is coming to Bangladesh, getting converted and landing into India at zero duty,” Sanjay Jain, president of Confederation of Indian Textile Industry (CITI) told Reuters. Industry bodies argue that India’s latest action is not enough to protect domestic garment manufacturers which are facing fierce competition from China and Bangladesh. Imports of clothing accessories and apparel from Bangladesh - the world’s second largest exporter of ready-made garments -rose over 43 percent to $200.9 million during the year ended March 2018, according to Indian government data. “Import trends suggests 40 to 50 percent of the garments were made with Chinese fibre,” said an Indian analyst who did not want to be named. It is difficult to estimate exactly how many garments imported in India were produced with fibre sourced from China, he said. India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among the signatories of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) that created a free-trade zone in the South Asian region. Shipments of edible oils coming into India are also being designated as duty free under the regional free-trade pact, circumventing an import tax increase. Trade bodies, which expect textile imports from Bangladesh to rise further, have asked the government to introduce a rule of origin for duty free imports. Competition from China is forcing some businesses, such as polyester production facilities, to run idle, leading to job losses, they said. “Under the SAFTA agreement and trade agreement with Bangladesh, only those goods should be exempted from custom duty, whose raw material is also manufactured by one of the SAFTA countries,” Dilip Chenoy, head of The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry said in a letter dated July 25 to a senior official in the government’s textile ministry. Kavita Gupta, India’s textile commissioner told Reuters: “The textile ministry has proposed a ‘Fabric Forward Policy,’ where duty free access to garments will be provided if the fabric is sourced from India. The policy is in discussion stage.” Rising imports sent India’s trade deficit with China in textile products (finished garments) to a record high $1.54 billion in 2017/18, alarming industry officials as India had been until recently a net exporter of textile products to China. There is a 10 percent price difference on average between textile products made in India and those made in China, according to FICCI. The unit value of some Chinese products such as stockings, blouses and baby garments cost far less than produced in India. (Reporting by Sudarshan Varadhan and Rajendra Jadhav.

2018-08-13,"* Turkish lira hits new lows, govt promises it has a plan * Selling spreads to South African rand, Argentine peso * Euro slips as safe haven yen, Swiss franc, dollar bid * Asian stocks fall further, emerging markets under pressure By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Asia share markets skidded and the euro hit one-year lows on Monday as a renewed rout in the Turkish lira infected the South African rand and drove demand for safe harbours, including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen. The run from risk dragged MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 1.3 percent to a five-week low. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.6 percent with every bourse in the region in the red. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.4 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields dipped further to 2.85 percent . China’s blue chip index shed 1.4 percent, while Hong Kong stocks lost 1.6 percent as the local dollar fell to the limits of its trading band. Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400. The lira found just a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions. Yet the dollar was still up almost 10 percent on the day at 7.0000 lira. This time last month it was at 4.8450. The currency tumbled on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. “The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,” he added. Kenningham noted Turkey’s annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added. “Nonetheless, Turkey’s troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.” Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45. Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13700. It was last at $1.1380 and still a long way from last week’s top at $1.1628. The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.21 , but was a shade firmer against a basket of currencies at 96.431. The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire, with the dollar adding 5 percent on the rand. Dealers said Japanese retail investors had been squeezed out of long positions in the rand sending the yen steaming higher. “Contagion risks centre on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,” warned analysts at ANZ. “Turkey’s massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that’s threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.” In commodity markets, gold found little in the way of safety flows and was last down at $1,208.21 an ounce. Oil prices were mixed with Brent off 14 cents at $72.67 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 2 cents to $67.65.

2018-08-13,"ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.4 earthquake struck on Sunday near the native Alaskan village of Kaktovik and part of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge where the Trump administration plans to allow oil drilling, but no injuries or damage were reported. The temblor, which occurred just before 7 a.m. (1500 GMT), was the most powerful on record to hit Alaska’s oil-producing North Slope, said Paul Huang, a seismologist and deputy director of the National Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer, Alaska. No tsunami alert was generated, though ground motion was felt as far away as Fairbanks, Alaska, nearly 400 miles (644 km) to the south.  The quake had no impact on operations of the Trans Alaska Pipeline system that carries North Slope crude 800 miles (1,300 km) to the marine terminal at Valdez, according to a statement from Alyeska, the consortium that runs the pipeline. Alyeska said it would conduct follow-up inspections of the pipeline and related facilities. Inspection teams likewise found nothing amiss at the Prudhoe Bay oil field about 85 miles (137 km) to the east, said Megan Baldino, a spokeswoman for BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc, which operates the field. The quake, initially measured at a magnitude 6.5, was followed by a series of aftershocks, the largest of which was a 6.0 tremor, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The main earthquake was centred 40 miles (64 km) southwest of Kaktovik, a coastal Inupiat village of about 260 residents at the northern edge of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). State emergency officials said they had no reports of damage, but locals in Kaktovik said the tremor did not pass unnoticed. “I felt a little shaking and felt dizzy, and felt the shelves shaking,” said Archie Brower, assistant manager at the Kaktovik Kikiktak grocery. The epicentre also lies near an area the U.S. Interior Department plans to lease for petroleum exploration along ANWR’s coastal plain, which had been off-limits to fossil fuel development until a provision was enacted as part of President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax bill. The vast and environmentally pristine coastal plain, wedged between the Beaufort Sea and Brooks Range mountains, is prized for its importance to caribou, polar bears and other wildlife but is believed to hold billions of barrels of oil. “Scientifically, however, this region is poorly understood and the behaviour of the fault or faults responsible for today’s earthquake are not known,” the Alaska Earthquake Center in Fairbanks said in a bulletin.  Strong earthquakes are not uncommon in seismically active Alaska, but they tend to occur in remote, sparsely populated regions where there is little or no damage.

2018-08-13,"(Repeats Aug. 10 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MAQVuG By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices have stalled over the last two months as the prospect of tough sanctions on Iran’s exports from November is offset by concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth later in 2018 and 2019. Brent futures prices for crude delivered in 2019 have been flat since late May, after rising strongly since February, with the calendar strip steadying around $71-73 per barrel. The U.S. government estimates Iran’s oil exports will be cut by between 0.7 and 1.0 million barrels per day from November as a result of sanctions (“U.S. forecasts 50 percent cut in Iran oil sales”, Bloomberg, Aug. 10). But the prospective loss of crude has failed to lift prices as traders focus on compensating increases in production from Saudi Arabia and Russia, as well as slower growth in consumption. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has slumped from a steep backwardation in April and May into a contango structure as traders anticipate more oil availability (tmsnrt.rs/2MAQVuG). Some of the shift stems from the big increase in production by Saudi Arabia and Russia that started in late May and June, which should help build up stocks ahead of the reimposition of sanctions in November. But it also coincides with a weakening of the global economic outlook that suggests slower growth in consumption of diesel and other refined products later this year and into 2019. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s composite leading indicator has slipped since the start of the year and “is pointing tentatively to easing growth momentum in the OECD area as a whole”. Growth is easing in Canada, Germany, France and Britain though it remains stable in the United States and Japan (“Composite Leading Indicators,” OECD, Aug. 8). The World Trade Organization’s trade outlook indicator also points to a slowdown in the momentum of global trade growth in the months ahead (“World Trade Outlook Indicator”, WTO, Aug. 9). Export orders have declined steadily since the start of the year, while air freight volumes and container port throughput are growing above trend but appear past their peak, according to the WTO. The WTO notes air freight has proven to be a timely indicator of overall world trade and an early signal of turning points in economic activity. In that context, the International Air Transport Association’s monthly update shows air freight volumes growing more slowly than in 2016/17. The inventory restocking cycle was mostly completed by the end of 2017, according to the association (“Air cargo volumes continue their modest uptrend, amid rising risks”, IATA, Aug. 9). “Moreover, the loss of momentum in air freight demand is also consistent with the broad-based moderation in manufacturing firms’ export order books since the start of 2018.” The prospective deceleration in global trade growth has been reflected in lower diesel prices since the end of May as traders anticipate consumption will advance more slowly than before. Diesel, jet fuel and other mid-distillates are more sensitive to the economic cycle and freight movements than any other part of the oil market. The gross refining margin for low-sulphur distillate delivered in April 2019, after next winter, has tumbled over the last three months on the weaker freight outlook. The oil market is now delicately poised between a mildly tightening production outlook (with partially effective Iran sanctions) and a mildly deteriorating consumption outlook (with somewhat slower growth). The International Energy Agency warned on Friday that “trade tensions might escalate and lead to slower economic growth, and in turn lower oil demand” (“Oil Market Report,” IEA, Aug. 10). “For now, we have made no changes to our underlying economic and oil demand assumptions, but we are mindful that demand growth could cool down later this year and into 2019”, the IEA added.

2018-08-13,"SINGAPORE, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices inched up on Monday as U.S. sanctions against Iran pointed towards a tighter market, although concerns over slowing economic growth amid global trade tensions kept a lid on gains. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $72.88 per barrel at 0053 GMT, up by 7 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 16 cents at $67.79 per barrel. The United States has started implementing new sanctions against Iran, which from November will also target the country’s petroleum sector. “With U.S. sanctions on Iran back in place ... all eyes have been on the impact on crude oil exports from that country,” ANZ bank said on Monday. “Maintaining global supply might be very challenging,” the bank said, although it added that “the U.S. is doing its bit to increase production, with data showing drilling activity is continuing to rise.” U.S. energy companies last week added the most oil rigs since May, adding 10 rigs to bring the total count to 869, according to the Baker Hughes energy services firm. That was the highest level of drilling activity since March 2015. Also potentially weighing on oil markets are signs of slowing economic growth and fuel demand growth, especially in Asia’s large emerging markets. “Lower demand from China, the world’s biggest importer, comes at a critical time when demand growth from Asia in general is being called into question. This due to the negative impact of trade wars, a stronger dollar and rising funding costs,” Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank, said in a note late last week.

2018-08-13,"* Turkish lira hits new lows, govt promises it has a plan * Euro slips as safe haven yen, Swiss franc, dollar bid * Asian stocks open lower, emerging markets under pressure By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Asia share markets slipped and the euro hit one-year lows on Monday as a fresh fall in the Turkish lira fuelled demand for safe havens, including the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc and yen. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.95 percent and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.3 percent as bourses across the region turned red. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were off 0.15 percent, while Treasury yields dipped further. Much of the early action was in currencies with the euro gapping lower as the Turkish lira took another slide to all-time lows around 7.2400 at one stage. It was last at 6.8450, having found just a sliver of support when Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak said the country had drafted an action plan to ease investor concerns and the banking watchdog said it limited swap transactions. The currency tumbled more than 40 percent this year on worries over Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s increasing control over the economy and deteriorating relations with the United States. “The plunge in the lira which began in May now looks certain to push the Turkish economy into recession and it may well trigger a banking crisis,” said Andrew Kenningham, chief global economist at Capital Economics. “This would be another blow for EMs as an asset class, but the wider economic spillovers should be fairly modest, even for the euro zone,” he added. Kenningham noted Turkey’s annual gross domestic product of around $900 billion was just 1 percent of the global economy and slightly smaller than the Netherlands. The Turkish equity market was less than 2 percent of the size of the UK market, and only 20 percent was held by non-residents, he added. “Nonetheless, Turkey’s troubles are a further headwind for the euro and are not good news for EM assets either.” Indeed, the single currency sank to a one-year trough against the Swiss franc in early trade around 1.1300 francs, while hitting a 10-week low on the yen around 125.45 . Against the U.S. dollar, the euro touched its lowest since July 2017 at $1.13715. It was last at $1.1392 and still a long way from last week’s top at $1.1628. The dollar eased against the safe haven yen to 110.65, but was a shade firmer against a basket of currencies at 96.388. The Argentine peso and South African rand were also caught in the crossfire. “Contagion risks centre on Spanish, Italian and French banks exposed to Turkish foreign currency debt, as well as Argentina and South Africa,” warned analysts at ANZ. “Turkey’s massive pile of corporate debt denominated in foreign currencies, but a rapidly sliding currency – and inflation that’s threatening to go exponential – is a toxic combination.” In commodity markets, gold had found little in the way of safety flows and was last stuck at $1,211.80 an ounce . Oil prices edged higher with Brent up 5 cents at $72.86 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 15 cents to $67.78.
