2018-03-04,"* PNG LNG to take about 8 weeks to restore production - Exxon * Project uncertainty has drained liquidity from spot markets * Quake has killed at least 31 people (Adds ExxonMobil PNG quotes, project details) SYDNEY, March 5 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp said on Monday it would take about eight weeks to restore production at the Papua New Guinea liquified natural gas project (LNG), following a powerful earthquake that hit the country’s energy-rich interior a week ago. The 7.5 magnitude quake on Feb. 26 triggered landslides and flattened buildings, killing at least 31 people, and has affected the regional LNG market. The South Pacific nation has declared a state of emergency. Exxon said in a statement on Monday that 300 non-essential personnel had been evacutated and work at the Hides gas conditioning plant in the highlands had turned to restoring camp and associated facilities. “While the gas conditioning plant was safely shut in, there has been some damage to various pieces of equipment and foundation supports that will need to be inspected and repaired,” it said. “Initial visual inspections of the major processing equipment indicate that they may not have been significantly impacted,” it added. Exxon is the operator and largest shareholder of the project that includes a 700-km (435-mile) gas pipeline that connects gas reserves in PNG’s jungle Southern Highlands to a coastal liquefaction plant. Oil Search Ltd and Santos are also project partners. Oil Search said the Agogo production facility and the Moran field were the most affected by the quake, and major repairs will be required before production can restart. The timeframe to restart production through Agogo is still being reviewed. Uncertainty around production from PNG has drained liquidity from Asia’s spot LNG markets with buyers and sellers taking a wait-and-see approach before committing to trade, a market source said. The PNG LNG project is considered one of the world’s best-performing LNG operations. Exxon said earlier this month that together with its partners, France’s Total SA and Australia’s Oil Search, it plans to almost double the facility’s export capacity to 16 million tonnes per year.

2018-03-04,"(Updates levels throughout; adds analyst comment, bullets) * Dollar near lowest since November 2016 vs yen * Trump’s tariff threat met with warnings of retaliation * Italian exit polls point to hung parliament * Japan futures, S&P E-Minis ease in early trade Monday By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures slipped and the safe-haven yen rose on Monday amid fears of a global trade war, while the euro was volatile after results of exit polls for Italy’s elections pointed to a hung parliament. A centre-right coalition is set to win the most seats in Italy’s parliament ahead of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, according to the exit polls, although it was unlikely to produce an outright winner. The euro rose to a two-week high of $1.2365 after 5-Star failed to win a clear majority, but talk the party could form a coalition government soon dragged it back to $1.2310. Supporting the euro was the revival of Germany’s grand coalition over the weekend, meaning Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives will form a new government more than five months since the country’s inconclusive election. The yen got a lift from safe-haven flows as risk sentiment soured after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, rattling financial markets. The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to go as deep as 105.40 yen, but was slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016. Stock futures pointed to a weak start for Asia, with S&P e-minis and Dow futures down 0.5 percent each while Nikkei futures were off 0.4 percent. Australian shares slipped 0.2 percent in early trading. “It seems that investors are willing to bet that the U.S. economy is the loser in a trade war started by the White House,” said Sean Callow, currency strategist at Westpac. “There seems to be lots of chatter for a 5-Star-Northern League majority. The European Central Bank’s upbeat narrative should be reinforced on Thursday, encouraging speculators already long euros to top up their positions.” Wall Street had a late rebound on Friday as investors who were initially spooked by the prospect of a global trade war clung to hopes that Trump was just rattling sabres as a negotiating tactic. News over the weekend suggested, however, that Trump was going ahead with his plan, while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs planned on imported steel and aluminium. Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. Trump says the tariffs are needed to protect domestic industries against unfair competition from China and elsewhere. “Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut. “A number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of a parliamentary election in Italy.” In commodities, Brent crude was up 38 cents at $64.75 a barrel while U.S. light crude edged up 42 cents to $61.67. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,323.10.

2018-03-04,"(Repeats item published on March 2, no changes in text) * Record volume of soybean imports to reduce palm oil use * High palm oil stocks also seen weighing on imports * Higher purchases of rapeseed oil to further curb demand By Naveen Thukral and Emily Chow SINGAPORE/KUALA LUMPUR, March 2 (Reuters) - China’s palm oil imports may fall in 2017/18 as the country instead boosts purchases of soybeans, giving it ample supplies of domestically produced soyoil, analysts and industry officials said. The world’s second-biggest economy, which ships more than 60 percent of soybeans traded worldwide, bought record volumes of the beans in 2017 as the country’s demand for protein-rich animal feed ingredient soymeal grows. But the waning of China’s appetite for palm oil - as well as its implications for soybeans - is set to be a key theme for the industry this year, and likely to be a hot topic at a major conference in Kuala Lumpur this week. Malaysia is the world’s second-biggest supplier after Indonesia of palm oil, used in the making of everything from cosmetics to food snacks. “(China’s) edible oil demand is not growing as fast as meal demand, so they have excessive supplies of soybeans,” said veteran industry official M.R. Chandran, now a consultant in Kuala Lumpur. “China is buying more soybeans and that demand is essentially driven by higher consumption of soymeal for feeding animals.” China’s soybean imports in 2017 hit an all-time high of 95.54 million tonnes, up 13.9 percent from last year’s 83.91 million tonnes, according to the country’s customs data. The country’s palm oil imports in 2017/18 are expected to decline to 4.8 million tonnes as compared 4.881 million tonnes a year ago, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates issued on Feb. 8. Meanwhile, Malaysian palm oil futures traded on the Bursa Malaysia Derivative Exchange have risen around 2 percent in February after declining for the last three months. Market watchers have ascribed the earlier declines to rising production in Southeast Asia. But February prices climbed on tight market supplies as recent rains curbed harvesting activities. Existing high palm oil stocks in China of about 600,000 tonnes are also expected to depress demand, said David Ng, a derivatives specialist at Phillip Futures in Kuala Lumpur. “Current stock levels are above market expectation as well as average levels,” he said. “Keep in mind China’s demand for soymeal is going to increase again this year, and that will increase crush margins and overall demand for soyoil, which will impact demand for palm.” Elsewhere, China’s rapeseed imports are set to rise to 4.7 million tonnes this year, up from 4.26 million tonnes a year ago, according to the USDA. “Rapeseed oil demand will increase as it becomes cheaper. There is parity to import canola oil from Canada as there are good margins,” said one trader in Singapore. “They have bumper (canola) crops in most areas of Canada and Australia, so the seed becomes cheaper.” Reporting by Naveen Thukral in SINGAPORE and Emily Chow in

2018-03-04,"(Repeats story first published on Sunday, no change to text) * USS Carl Vinson makes first US carrier visit to Vietnam since 1975 * U.S. wants to develop security ties with Vietnam to counter China By Greg Torode and Mai Nguyen HONG KONG/HANOI, March 4 (Reuters) - The visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War is a powerful symbol of the growing strategic ties between the former foes. But the arrival on Monday of the USS Carl Vinson also illustrates Hanoi’s complex and evolving relationship with Beijing over the disputed South China Sea. For months now, Vietnamese envoys have been working to ease the concerns of their giant Chinese neighbour over the visit and the prospect of broader security co-operation between Hanoi and Washington, according to diplomats and others familiar with discussions. Vietnamese diplomats and military officers have repeatedly stressed the country’s independent foreign policy and its desire for broad foreign relations - hoping to maintain stable ties with China while standing up to it over the South China Sea, the sources said. The Vinson will mark the biggest U.S. military presence in the country since 1975 when it berths in Danang for a five-day stay. The port city on Vietnam’s central coast is close to its Blue Whale gas field now being developed by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil, as well as the increasingly fortified Paracel islands, which China occupies and Vietnam also claims. China’s rapid construction and build-up of the seven features it holds in the disputed Spratly group further south has alarmed Vietnam and other regional governments. As it seeks to enforce its claims to much of the South China Sea, China’s navy and coastguard now routinely patrol vast swathes of the area through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually. While some Chinese commentators have used the Vinson’s presence to demand an even greater Chinese military build-up in the waterway, official reaction from Beijing has been relatively muted since the stop was confirmed in January. U.S. carriers frequently ply the South China Sea as part of a rising pattern of naval deployments, and are now routinely shadowed by Chinese naval vessels, regional naval officers say. “Even as it moves forward with the U.S., Vietnam has been engaging China over South China Sea tensions,” said Le Hong Hiep, a Vietnam expert at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute. “They might be irritated but gradualism is the key word here...Vietnam will only embrace the U.S. at a pace that doesn’t cause an over-reaction from China.” Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong Lingnan University, said he believed Beijing would not be panicked by the carrier visit, in part due to quiet but successful Vietnamese diplomacy. “Beijing has a much better understanding of Vietnam’s balancing formula now,” he said. The Vinson arrives amid repeated signals from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that it is keen to further develop security ties with Vietnam as part of a range of political and military relationships to check the rise of China. Given historic Vietnamese suspicions of Beijing, Hanoi’s Communist Party leadership has forged a range of security relationships to balance its own ties with China. Moscow, its major patron through the Cold War, remains the key supplier to the modernising Vietnamese military, and India and Israel are increasingly important suppliers. Trump himself touted possible missile and other advanced weapons sales during his November visit to Vietnam but not major arms deal has yet been completed. His administration’s National Security Strategy, published in December, listed Vietnam as a “co-operative maritime partner”. Derek Grossman, a senior defence analyst at the U.S. RAND think-tank, said it was uncertain just how fast and how far Vietnam was prepared to go even as it sought to deter China in the South China Sea. “It seems the U.S. side is still not sure quite what Vietnam wants, but the focus will likely be on ways to enhance Vietnam’s maritime domain awareness and maritime security capabilities,” he said. A recent study of Vietnam’s military modernisation by Grossman, published by the Seattle-based National Bureau of Asian Research, found that Hanoi would struggle to sustain a large-scale conflict if its deterrence strategy failed. Despite the acquisition of its first submarines, new Russian jet fighters and missiles, Vietnam faced extensive deployment and integration hurdles.

The prosecutor’s office said an investigation is expected to start on Monday.  “Looking at the degree of destruction of this building, it was initially assumed that it could have been a gas explosion, but we do not have certainty yet.

2018-03-04,"PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Reuters) - Cambodia’s former opposition leader Sam Rainsy said on Sunday he was open to talks with Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has held power since 1985, to end a crisis caused by the dissolution of the main opposition party ahead of elections in July. The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was dissolved by the Supreme Court last November at the request of Hun Sen’s government who said they had been plotting to take power with the help of the United States. The CNRP denies the allegation. The dissolution followed the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha who was also accused of plotting to take power with U.S. help. That charged was mounted because of the threat the CNRP posed at the elections set for July 29, he said. Sam Rainsy resigned as president of the CNRP in 2017 but remains one of the government’s most visible critics. He had previously served as finance minister in an ill-fated coalition set up when Hun Sen refused to give up power after losing a U.N.-organized election in 1993. He has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions he says are politically motivated. “I am always open to meeting with Hun Sen’s government in order to find a peaceful solution to this unprecedented crisis, a solution that would be acceptable to both sides with international guarantees,” Sam Rainsy said in a tweet on Sunday. They were his first comments on the matter since the opposition was banned. Hun Sen has been criticized by Western countries over the CNRP’s dissolution and the arrest of Kem Sokha ahead of the July 29 general election. A crackdown by Hun Sen’s government and its allies has included non-governmental organizations, opposition lawmakers and some independent media. Hun Sen, who will visit Australia in mid-March for a regional meeting, said on Friday he is open to holding talks to end the crisis but would not negotiate a change to criminal convictions brought against opposition figures. A spokesman for Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party said on Sunday that Sam Rainsy was not serious about holding talks. “He has no way out,” Sok Eysan told Reuters. “The culture of dialogue is dead and he has to face prison for crimes he’s has committed.” (Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Matthew Mpoke Bigg)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/cambodia-politics/cambodias-former-opposition-head-says-open-to-talks-with-pm-idUKL4N1QM0BE,04 Mar 2018,"Cambodia's former opposition

Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD) voted decisively for another tie-up with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, clearing the way for a new government in Europe’s largest economy more than five months since the country’s inconclusive election. Two thirds of the SPD membership voted “yes” to the deal, a party official said, meaning Merkel could be sworn in for a fourth term by mid-March in a repeat of the grand coalition that has governed since 2013. Financial markets won’t be open in any meaningful sense until Asian trading begins around 1000 GMT, but the initial reaction from investors suggested the German deal should support the euro, stock and bond markets. “This is the outcome that markets have been crossing their fingers and hoping for,” said James Athey, a senior investment manager at Standard Life Aberdeen, adding that it was “by far the least disruptive outcome”. “While it by no means answers all the policy questions at either the German domestic nor European level, it certainly provides a more stable base from which to address the many issues at hand.” Traders went into the weekend betting on a higher euro, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed on Friday. The currency is seen as the most sensitive gauge to euro zone politics and the value of net long euro positions — betting on the currency rising — climbed to its highest in three weeks the figures showed. “It is probably good news in terms of the capacity for Germany to open up to (French President) Emmanuel Macron’s proposal for the future of Europe,” said Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s Chief European economist, Gilles Moec. Macron’s office in Paris said: “France and Germany will work together on new initiatives in the coming weeks to bring the European project forward.” German business also greeted the result with relief. The wait for a government since September was the country’s longest post-election interregnum. “While the United States is starting a trade war and China is challenging our industrial leadership, we have been unnecessarily self-absorbed,” said engineering trade union VDMA’s managing director, Thilo Brodtmann. It wasn’t only Germany that investors were looking at on Sunday though. Italy was holding an national election under a complex new voting system that has made the outcome even trickier than usual to predict. Pollsters generally expect a hung parliament, with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi’s alliance of centre-right groups emerging as the largest bloc. The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement looks almost certain to be the biggest single party, potentially complicating matters, with the various party leaders all having ruled out post-election alliances with rivals. Italy, however, has a long history of finding a way out of apparently intractable political stalemate and markets have shown little concern in recent weeks about the prospect of a confused result. Italian bond yields, which are a reflection of government’s credit market borrowing costs, fell to a three-week low on Friday. The gap with Germany’s borrowing costs also narrowed to the smallest in two weeks. “I am surprised how little risk the market is pricing from this,” said Cesar Perez Ruiz, chief investment officer at Pictet Wealth Management. That gap between Italian and German yields could shrink a little further with an centre-right alliance, though there would be a heavy sell-off in Italian markets if the most anti-European parties were part of any new government, he added.

2018-03-04,"BERLIN, March 4 (Reuters) - Germany’s Social Democrats (SPD) voted decisively for a coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives on Sunday, clearing the way for a new government in Europe’s largest economy and ending months of political uncertainty. Two thirds of the party’s 464,000 members voted “yes” to the deal, meaning Merkel could be sworn in for a fourth term by the middle of the month, in a repeat of the grand coalition that has governed since 2013. Following is a summary of the main policies the two parties agreed in a draft coalition treaty on Feb. 7: * Invest 5.95 billion euros in education, research and digitalisation by 2021. * Invest 12 billion euros in family, child and social measures such as nursery centres and boosting child benefit. * Invest 4.0 billion euros in building social housing and in tax incentives to encourage home ownership. * Stick to goal of balanced budget with no new debt. * Ensure all regions have fast internet by 2025.

2018-03-04,"ALEPPO, Syria (Reuters) - The power supply in Syria’s Aleppo will be boosted this year thanks to new capacity installed by its ally Iran, a step towards reviving the industrial hub whose electricity grid has been destroyed in seven years of war, a Syrian official said.   The five power generation plants are part of a deal penned last year by which Iran, a vital supporter of President Bashar al-Assad, will help repair the Syrian power grid, and reflects Tehran’s deepening role in the country. Syrian government forces, with critical help from Iran-backed militias and the Russian air force, recovered full control of Aleppo some 14 months ago, driving out rebels who had held the city’s eastern districts. Mohammed al-Saleh, the director general of the state-owned Aleppo power company, said all of the city’s pre-war power generation capacity - amounting to 1,000 Megawatts - had been destroyed in the conflict that erupted in 2011. He said the new capacity being installed by Iran at a cost of 110 million euros would produce 125 Megawatts once it comes on line at some point between April and June. “Other sources will enter service to feed Aleppo city ... and so the hours of provision will certainly increase after April 2018,” said Saleh, speaking to Reuters as he inspected work to restore the power supply to one part of the city.  Industrialists have cited power supply as one of the big impediments to reviving their businesses in Aleppo, a city which enjoyed 24-hour-a-day electricity before the war. Power provision today ranges between 12 and 14 hours a day in parts of the city where there is electricity, said Saleh.  But some parts of the city, specifically areas that were under rebel control, have yet to be reconnected to the power grid, he said. The government aimed to restore electricity to those areas this year.     “There is cooperation from our Iranian and Russian friends in the power sector,” he said when asked how the government plans to restore power to those areas. Western states, some of which have backed the anti-Assad opposition, have said they will not help rebuild Syria until a political transition is in place. The Syrian government hopes China will help it rebuild, in addition to Iran and Russia. While Assad continues to recover territory from rebels, the main highway linking Aleppo to other government-held cities such as Hama, Homs, Latakia and Damascus still runs through territory held by insurgents, rendering it insecure. That forced the government last year to extend new power lines out into the desert along a circuitous but secure government-held road to Aleppo. “More than 170 towers were put up along the road,” Saleh said. He also said that state engineers were fixing the power grid in Kurdish districts of Aleppo city that were recently restored to state control after Kurdish militias withdrew.

2018-03-04,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Almost a week after a deadly quake struck the rugged Papua New Guinea highlands, nearly 150,000 people remain in urgent need of emergency supplies as damaged roads and landslides have hampered the delivery of aid to isolated communities, agencies have said. The quake destroyed or damaged the homes of around 7000 people, while 147,000 were in severe need of food, water and sanitation, the director of the International Red Cross in PNG, Udaya Regmi, told Reuters on Sunday. Landslides have cut roads, preventing the delivery of aid to several places where it’s most needed. “The challenge is road access, it’s still not accessible to trucks and four-wheel drives,” Regmi said. “Big trucks cannot go there. It’s one of the reasons the food is becoming less and less. There are no fears of starvation yet but we’ve not got the full picture.” Papua New Guinea (PNG) declared a state of emergency across the earthquake-hit region last week but the scale of the disaster will not be known until relief workers and authorities can complete their assessments in the area. A report by the World Food Program for the United Nations two days after the 7.5 magnitude quake hit the Southern Highlands on February 26 estimated 465,000 people were exposed to the disaster of which 143,000 needed urgent humanitarian assistance and 64,000 were suffering from extreme food insecurity. Anna Bryan, programme director for CARE International in PNG, said the impact of the earthquake could not be understood by the initial death toll of 31 people as tens of thousands of people uninjured by the actual quake have been cut off from food, drinking water, communications and medical help for a week. “Public health and public hygiene are now concerns,” she said. Bryan said rivers dammed by landslides created stagnant water polluted by silt and bacteria, leaving people with the threat of disease. Aid has been flown in by aircraft but it is not yet known if it has been able to get to all the people in need. Aftershocks terrified villagers for five days after the initial temblor and only started subsiding on Saturday, multiple sources said. Julie Sakol a nurse at Mendi General Hospital said on Sunday the aftershocks were slowly decreasing. “It’s coming every two hours now ... the movement of the ground is slowly going down.” Australian Sally Lloyd who is visiting PNG said villagers were terrified by the constant shaking. “It is terror,” she said by telephone from Mount Hagen on Sunday. “They think the end of the world is happening.” Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates. The PNG and Australian governments, the Red Cross and Care International have all provided aid. Energy firm ExxonMobil which had to declare force majeure on exports from its PNG LNG project in the wake of the earthquake has also donated US$1 million to the humanitarian effort. Oil company Santos said on Sunday that it will donate US$200,000 to aid agencies in PNG for disaster relief on top of a US$1 million donation it has already provided to Hela Provincial Hospital.

2018-03-04,"OSLO (Reuters) - Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation’s $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018. The world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. In Norway, just two firms - DNB (DNB.OL) bank and property firm Entra (ENTRA.OL) - were on a CDP list of 160 “A” rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show. Norway’s state-controlled oil group Statoil STL.OL got an “F” grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey.  On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong “A-“. “It’s not our responsibility” to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L’Oreal (OREP.PA), Walmart (WMT.N) and Toyota (6201.T) rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains. “If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,” said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP. Norway’s fund, built from the nation’s oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonized data to compare risks. Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide.  Yngve Slyngstad, the fund’s CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to “strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP”. Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said. Statoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm’s operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States. “Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,” he said.  Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway’s deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry “welcomes efforts to standardize climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles.” The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said “obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally”. He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the center-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting. Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group Telenor (TEL.OL) got an “A-“ for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminum producer Hydro (NHY.OL) and fertilizer-maker Yara International (YAR.OL), in which the state owns just over a third, got “C”s. Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities. “When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,” it said in an e-mail. Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013. “We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,” she said. Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Nestle (NESN.S) - both got “A” grades from CDP for climate change reporting. On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included Total (TOTF.PA) and Neste Oy (NESTE.HE).

2018-03-04,"HONG KONG/HANOI (Reuters) - The visit of a U.S. aircraft carrier to Vietnam for the first time since the end of the Vietnam War is a powerful symbol of the growing strategic ties between the former foes. But the arrival on Monday of the USS Carl Vinson also illustrates Hanoi’s complex and evolving relationship with Beijing over the disputed South China Sea. For months now, Vietnamese envoys have been working to ease the concerns of their giant Chinese neighbour over the visit and the prospect of broader security co-operation between Hanoi and Washington, according to diplomats and others familiar with discussions. Vietnamese diplomats and military officers have repeatedly stressed the country’s independent foreign policy and its desire for broad foreign relations - hoping to maintain stable ties with China while standing up to it over the South China Sea, the sources said. The Vinson will mark the biggest U.S. military presence in the country since 1975 when it berths in Danang for a five-day stay. The port city on Vietnam’s central coast is close to its Blue Whale gas field now being developed by U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil, as well as the increasingly fortified Paracel islands, which China occupies and Vietnam also claims. China’s rapid construction and build-up of the seven features it holds in the disputed Spratly group further south has alarmed Vietnam and other regional governments. As it seeks to enforce its claims to much of the South China Sea, China’s navy and coastguard now routinely patrol vast swathes of the area through which some $3 trillion in trade passes annually.  While some Chinese commentators have used the Vinson’s presence to demand an even greater Chinese military build-up in the waterway, official reaction from Beijing has been relatively muted since the stop was confirmed in January. U.S. carriers frequently ply the South China Sea as part of a rising pattern of naval deployments, and are now routinely shadowed by Chinese naval vessels, regional naval officers say. “Even as it moves forward with the U.S., Vietnam has been engaging China over South China Sea tensions,” said Le Hong Hiep, a Vietnam expert at Singapore’s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute.  “They might be irritated but gradualism is the key word here...Vietnam will only embrace the U.S. at a pace that doesn’t cause an over-reaction from China.” Zhang Baohui, a mainland security expert at Hong Kong Lingnan University, said he believed Beijing would not be panicked by the carrier visit, in part due to quiet but successful Vietnamese diplomacy. “Beijing has a much better understanding of Vietnam’s balancing formula now,” he said. The Vinson arrives amid repeated signals from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that it is keen to further develop security ties with Vietnam as part of a range of political and military relationships to check the rise of China. Given historic Vietnamese suspicions of Beijing, Hanoi’s Communist Party leadership has forged a range of security relationships to balance its own ties with China. Moscow, its major patron through the Cold War, remains the key supplier to the modernising Vietnamese military, and India and Israel are increasingly important suppliers. Trump himself touted possible missile and other advanced weapons sales during his November visit to Vietnam but not major arms deal has yet been completed. His administration’s National Security Strategy, published in December, listed Vietnam as a “co-operative maritime partner”. Derek Grossman, a senior defence analyst at the U.S. RAND think-tank, said it was uncertain just how fast and how far Vietnam was prepared to go even as it sought to deter China in the South China Sea. “It seems the U.S. side is still not sure quite what Vietnam wants, but the focus will likely be on ways to enhance Vietnam’s maritime domain awareness and maritime security capabilities,” he said. A recent study of Vietnam’s military modernisation by Grossman, published by the Seattle-based National Bureau of Asian Research, found that Hanoi would struggle to sustain a large-scale conflict if its deterrence strategy failed. Despite the acquisition of its first submarines, new Russian jet fighters and missiles, Vietnam faced extensive deployment and integration hurdles.
