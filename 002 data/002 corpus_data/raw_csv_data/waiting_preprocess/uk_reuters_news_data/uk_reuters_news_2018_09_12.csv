2018-09-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of global stocks rose on Wednesday, helped by a report that Washington is proposing a new round of trade talks with Beijing and as resurgent oil prices pumped up energy shares. The United States is proposing new talks with China aimed at getting bilateral economic negotiations back on track, according to two people familiar with the matter. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.22 percent. Energy shares rose in Europe and the United States after U.S. crude inventories dropped and the bite of sanctions on Iran threatened to limit supply. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 1.62 percent at $70.37 per barrel while Brent LCOcv1 gained 0.86 percent to $79.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 27.86 points, or 0.11 percent, to 25,998.92, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.03 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,888.92, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 18.25 points, or 0.23 percent, to 7,954.23. [.N] The market’s mood music had been somber after a weak trading session in Asia, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo all closing lower. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was taking a tough stance on trade issues with China. That cemented expectations that new levies on Chinese exports would soon be announced. “What the market needs is a signal of some relaxation in trade rhetoric, a bit of climbdown,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. “That should be enough as (economic) fundamentals are strong. But you do need a trigger point, and so far we have not seen it.” MSCI’s broad emerging markets index .MSCIEF touched a near-16-month low before staging a recovery after the Wall Street Journal initially reported that the United States was proposing new trade talks with China, to rise 0.12 percent. The Chinese yuan traded offshore CNH= also gained against the dollar. U.S.-listed exchange-traded funds focused on China traded higher, pointing to a strong open for Asian markets on Thursday.   Hard-hit emerging markets currencies .MIEM00000CUS were 0.43 percent stronger, helped by a weaker greenback. The U.S. dollar index .DXY fell 0.43 percent as hopes also grew of concessions by Canada that would resolve disputes over reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ahmed said another positive catalyst for markets could be signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could slow the pace of interest rate rises. But given the torrent of strong U.S. data, that looks unlikely - data this week showed U.S. small business optimism at the highest level on record. “In 2015 when emerging markets got into a lot of trouble the Fed recognized the international spillover effect. This time that has not happened,” he added. Markets will also keep an eye on U.S. bonds, especially given the steady march higher in shorter-term Treasuries heavily influenced by expectations of Fed policy. The yield on the 2-year note US2YT=RR hit a decade peak of 2.7522 percent despite weaker-than expected producer price data. Political risk, meanwhile, returned to the radar of investors in Italy.

2018-09-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures rose on Wednesday, with Brent reaching $80 a barrel, after a larger-than-expected drop in U.S. crude inventories and as U.S. sanctions on Iran added to concerns over global oil supply.  Benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 68 cents to settle at $79.74 a barrel. The global benchmark earlier reached $80.13 a barrel, its highest level since May 22.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures  rose $1.12 to settle at $70.37 a barrel, a one-week high.  U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI fell by 5.3 million barrels in the last week, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Analysts had expected a decrease of 805,000 barrels. “Today’s crude stock draw of 5.3 million barrels fell far short of the (American Petroleum Institute’s) decline but was significantly larger than the normal draw of around 1 million barrels for this particular week,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Also supporting prices were supply concerns surrounding U.S. sanctions on Iran. Since the spring, when the Trump Administration said it would impose the sanctions, traders have been focusing on the potential impact on global supply. The sanctions will target Iran’s oil exports from November.  “Iran is increasingly becoming the preoccupation of the crude market. The last couple of weeks have seen the expected squeeze on Iranian crude flows taking shape, with overall outflows down markedly,” consultancy JBC Energy said.  (Graphic: Iran oil exports to Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2CEzade) Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Wednesday warned of the impact of the U.S. sanctions against Iran. “This is a huge uncertainty on the market – how countries, which buy almost 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian oil, will act. The situation should be closely watched, the right decisions should be taken,” he said.  Novak said global oil markets were “fragile” due to geopolitical risks and supply disruptions, but added his country could raise output if needed. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut its forecast for oil demand growth in 2019 in its monthly report and said rising challenges in some emerging and developing countries could negatively impact global economic growth. [OPEC/M] OPEC said it expected demand growth of 1.41 million bpd in 2019, a 20,000-bpd downgrade from its previous forecast.  Oil traders were also watching the progress of category 4 Hurricane Florence, which is expected to make landfall on the U.S. East Coast by Friday. Crude output will not be affected by the massive storm, but the evacuation of more than a million residents, as well as businesses, has prompted a near-term spike in fuel demand.

2018-09-12,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Archer Daniels Midland Co has sold unusually high volumes of ethanol into the Chicago market since late last year as export markets dried up, driving down prices in the U.S. Midwest and angering the company’s rivals, according to traders and regulatory data. The Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse, a major ethanol producer, accounted for roughly 61 percent of the 9.5 million barrels sold at the Chicago hub between November and August, according to the data reviewed by Reuters. Previously, ADM had been a regular buyer: In September and October of last year, for example, ADM bought 810,000 barrels, 32 percent of the 2.495 million total trades in the Chicago hub during that stretch, according to the data. ADM’s shift came amid an upheaval in the domestic ethanol market as U.S. demand flatlined and export markets, including China and Brazil, were cut off due in part to the effects of President Donald Trump’s widening trade disputes. With growth in export markets slowing, U.S. ethanol inventories swelled to a record. Ethanol traders say ADM is saturating the domestic market, anchoring prices and bleeding out smaller producers less equipped to manage through the tough times. ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson, when asked about the shift in the company’s strategy, said ADM does not comment on the specifics of its commercial activity. Ethanol futures prices traded on the Chicago Board of Trade late last month fell to $1.21 per gallon, lowest in over a decade. Ethanol in Chicago cash markets, meanwhile, were about $1.28 per gallon, just above a low of $1.24 from December, traders told Reuters. The heavy selling by ADM has led traders who have lost money on the slumping ethanol market to complain to S&P Global Platts, which provides benchmark pricing for the physical ethanol contract at different U.S. delivery points including Chicago. In July, Platts hosted an ethanol pricing methodology workshop in Houston at which senior traders from the largest U.S. ethanol trading shops expressed anger about ADM’s influence on the market, according to several traders who attended. “It’s one person’s view of the market,” said one trader who attended the meeting. “Traders are angry ... and they blame ADM,” another trader said. Platts said the company is conducting ongoing discussions about evolving its pricing methodology, including feedback from the July conference. “We are still evaluating the feedback and continuing bilateral conversations with market participants who were not able to attend,” the company said in a written statement. ADM can produce roughly 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol annually, about 10 percent of U.S. capacity. Despite its massive production, it has often been a buyer on the cash market to supplement its long-term supply deals or to support a market view, dealers said. The company has told investors that a sustained trade war with China could hurt sales. China, considered the top growth market for U.S. ethanol exports, imposed tariffs of about 70 percent on imports of American biofuel - all but halting shipments there. The commodity giant has also been using the futures market to show that it could deliver additional volumes in and around the Chicago hub. The company can easily ship to Chicago from its large ethanol plants in Iowa. On the Chicago Board of Trade, ADM registered all 579 ethanol contracts for delivery as of Tuesday, each contract representing 29,000 gallons – or enough for about one rail tanker car - the most in the history of the contract, according to CME Group data. The registrations were a signal to the over 20 other companies also registered to participate in CBOT ethanol deliveries - which include Shell, Green Plains Inc, Vitol and Mercuria - that ADM has an abundant supply of biofuel in storage, to tap and sell against the futures contract. “We don’t really know or understand what they are doing,” said one CEO of a publicly-traded ethanol company. One trader noted that ADM was short 400,000 barrels last week on the Chicago Board of Trade. As a major ethanol producer, they are long physical gallons so having a short position in futures as a hedge against physical price declines is not unusual, traders said.

2018-09-12,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya’s state oil firm NOC said on Wednesday that it continued to manage its operations normally throughout the country, without loss of production, after a shooting attack on its Tripoli headquarters. The attack on Monday, claimed by Islamic State militants, killed two people and wounded 25.     NOC provides the vast bulk of the Libyan state’s income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state enterprises still functioning well after years of armed factional conflict.     “The National Oil Corporation has assured all citizens that it has implemented contingency plans to deal with the crisis to ensure that (its) production and daily operations continue on a regular basis,” NOC said in a statement.     “This attack did not cause a loss of production,” NOC chairman Mustafa Sonallah said in the statement, which did not reveal NOC’s current production level. “However, it led to the shedding of Libyan blood,” Sonallah said, adding that the attack “is indicative of the weakness and fragility of the security arrangements in the country”.     He also said the current security vacuum “allows terrorist organisations to be present inside the country”. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis. However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil output has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day.       Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya’s southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials.

2018-09-12,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Airline fuel efficiency on transatlantic flights has improved by one percent a year since 2014 as carriers modernized their fleets, but the industry still lags its own climate goals, according to a study released on Wednesday by the International Council on Clean Transportation. But the study’s findings were challenged later Wednesday by an aviation industry group which argued that carriers are actually ahead of their targets. According to the ICCT study, the industry’s average fuel efficiency, as measured by how much fuel is used to transport passengers, improved to 34 passenger kilometers per litre of fuel from 33 between 2014 and 2017 as carriers opted for modern aircraft with lower fuel burn and operated fuller planes. Airlines have been switching to more fuel-efficient planes to mitigate the impact of high oil prices on their margins. The aviation industry has also set a non-binding goal of capping emissions from international flights at 2020 levels, despite rising passenger traffic as demand for global travel climbs.  Haldane Dodd, spokesman for the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG), which counts airlines among its members, said the industry is achieving a 2.1 percent rolling average fleet fuel efficiency improvement for all flights.  That figure is ahead of a goal of 1.5 percent efficiency improvements per year, Dodd said by email.   “Rankings of airline efficiency based on assumptions and modelled estimates are not a useful tool for either the public or policymakers, as they present an inaccurate picture of the operation,” Dodd said. The ICCT compared the fuel efficiency of nonstop passenger flights between North America and Europe by 20 major airlines. While the study only examined transatlantic flights, the authors argued the results showed industry lagged its goals. Flights to and from European states are expected to account for 36 percent of all carbon emissions from global aviation in 2020, the ICCT said citing data from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).   “New policies to accelerate investments in more fuel-efficient aircraft and operations are critical if industry is to meet its long-term climate goals,” said Dan Rutherford, aviation program director for the ICCT, a U.S.-based independent non-profit research organization. According to the study, budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA (NWC.OL) was ranked first of 20 transatlantic carriers for fuel efficiency, while British Airways, part of the International Airlines Group (ICAG.L), came in last. British Airways on Wednesday said its fuel efficiency per passenger “appears lower,” because on such routes the carrier has a “greater share of the premium market,” which has fewer seats.

2018-09-12,"(Adds analyst quote, updates prices, details on wheat) By Mark Weinraub CHICAGO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - The U.S. Agriculture Department on Wednesday issued a surprise increase to its corn harvest forecast due to expectations of record yields in key production areas such as Illinois, Iowa, Nebraska and Indiana. Soybean yields were seen at an all-time high, with the production outlook raised above its already record-high forecast. USDA also boosted its outlook for Russian wheat production, where concerns about dry conditions had raised concerns about export cuts from that key global supplier. Chicago Board of Trade corn and wheat futures dropped sharply after the report was released, with both sinking to their lowest since mid-July. Soybeans shrugged off the bearish news amid hopes for fresh trade talks between the United States and China. In its monthly supply and demand report, USDA pegged the 2018/19 corn harvest at 14.827 billion bushels, which would be the second biggest ever. The government forecast average corn yields at a record 181.3 bushels per acre. “Everybody and their brother was expecting a decline in the corn yield,” said Tomm Pfitzenmaier, partner, Summit Commodity Brokerage. “It caught everybody leaning the wrong way when they came out with a bigger-than-expected yield.” Soybean production was seen at 4.693 billion bushels, based on average yields of 52.8 bushels per acre. A month ago, USDA had predicted the corn harvest at 14.586 billion bushels, with yields at 178.4 bushels per acre. Its August outlook had pegged the soybean harvest at 4.586 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 51.6 bushels per acre. Analysts expected the USDA to cut its corn harvest outlook to 14.529 billion bushels and yields to 177.8 bushels per acre. Soybean production had been expected to rise to 4.649 billion bushels, with yields seen at 51.6 bushels per acre. USDA said supplies would balloon due to the bumper harvests, with domestic soybean ending stocks for the 2018/19 marketing year rising to 845 million bushels. This is above both the previous year’s 395 million bushels ending stocks and the previous forecast for 2018/19 of 785 million bushels made in August. USDA pegged corn ending stocks at 1.774 billion bushels, up from its August estimate of 1.684 billion bushels. The forecast for Russian wheat production was raised by 3 million tonnes to 71 million tonnes. USDA kept its outlook for soybean exports steady at 2.070 billion bushels despite an ongoing trade war with China. It lowered its forecast for Chinese soybean imports to 94 million tonnes from 95 million. Earlier in the day, China slashed its forecast for 2018/19 soybean imports to 83.65 million tonnes.

2018-09-12,"SAO PAULO, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Brazilian and Australian sugar industry groups have joined forces and are working together with their respective governments to prepare a formal complaint to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over any possible sugar export subsidy by India, a top Brazilian sugar official told Reuters. Eduardo Leão, executive director at Brazil’s cane industry group Unica, said in an interview that Brazil and Australia view any subsidy by India, set to take over as the world’s largest sugar producer this year, as a grave threat to a recent price recovery. Leão told Reuters late on Tuesday that the two countries reached a consensus regarding the need to act at WTO level if India moves to award sugar producers with a export subsidy. Analysts and sugar traders are expecting such a move by India as the country would be willing to put in the market a large local surplus built after a record crop this year, and amid expectations for another big output in the coming season. “We have heard comments that India could launch a export subsidy,” Leão said. “It is not admissible, we would seek an action from the Brazilian government,” he added. Raw sugar prices in New York recovered slightly in the last days since slumping to a 10-year low of 9.91 cents on Aug. 22 as a two-year global supply surplus and massive fund short position pressured values. There was no immediate comment from the Indian trade ministry. Indian officials have earlier said the country’s sugar exports do not violate WTO rules as New Delhi does not give any subsidy for overseas sales. India rather gives production subsidy to its cane growers. The Unica director said there are talks going on with Australian sugar industry representatives for a joint strategy at the WTO if need arises. There was no immediate answer from the Australian Sugar Milling Council of a request for comments. “We know the market fell due to a coincidence of large productions in Europe, Thailand and India, but things are improving now, production is falling so we don’t see the need for a export subsidy from India,” Leão said. Market estimates put Indian sugar surplus at around 10 million tonnes. That sugar is priced above current market so to stimulate exports the government would need to help mills. Unica’s director said Indian mills will eventually be able to sell in the export market as prices continue to recover. He said the Brazilian government is willing to back their plans. “They are sensitive to this due to the difficult financial situation of many mills”. Brazil decided on Aug. 31 to open a consultation at the WTO regarding Chinese safeguards on sugar imports. Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Additional reporting by Manoj

2018-09-12,"(Adds context, details on cargoes) By Marianna Parraga Sept 12 (Reuters) - PDVSA expects to reopen the south dock of Venezuela’s main oil port Jose by the end of September, easing strains on crude exports delayed due to a tanker collision last month, according to internal trade documents from the state-run oil firm seen by Reuters. Last week, PDVSA began diverting tankers to Puerto la Cruz for loading, but the South American country’s crude exports have remained slow in recent weeks as few customers have accepted the 500,000-barrel-per-cargo maximum neighboring terminals can handle. Besides Puerto la Cruz, tankers waiting to load a total 2.65 million barrels of Venezuelan upgraded and diluted crudes also plan to be serviced this month by two monobuoys at Jose, including cargoes scheduled for U.S.-based Chevron Corp and Russia’s Rosneft, the documents showed. But a 1-million-barrel cargo of diluted crude oil (DCO) scheduled to be lifted by Rosneft at Jose between late September and early October was cancelled, according to the documents. Rosneft and PDVSA in April agreed to a “remediation plan” to refinance an oil-for-loan agreement after delays to deliver cargoes of Venezuelan crude on time. DCO shipments scheduled since then belong to that plan. PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment. At least three other 500,000-barrel cargoes for Valero Energy and PDVSA’s U.S. refining unit Citgo Petroleum plan to be loaded at Jose’s available docks and monobuoys in the coming days, after delays. Valero also would pick up two additional 600,000-barrel cargoes of Morichal crude after a maintenance project that would halt the 150,000-barrel-per-day Petromonagas crude upgrader in August was again postponed, allowing more production. PDVSA and its joint ventures exported 1.292 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last month, a 7.7 percent decline versus July, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. The country’s oil output fell again in August to 1.448 million bpd, according to numbers reported by OPEC on Wednesday. Venezuela’s accumulated annual production this year is 1.544 million bpd, the lowest since 1950.

U.S. crude rose 2.35 percent to $70.88 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.77, up 0.9 percent on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 156.55 points, or 0.6 percent, to 26,127.61, the S&P 500 gained 5.48 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,893.37 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.36 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,951.11. The market’s mood music had been somber after a weak trading session in Asia, where bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo all closed lower. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was taking a tough stance with China. That cemented expectations that new levies on Chinese exports will soon be announced. New negotiations would give markets hope after a months-long escalation in tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. “What the market needs is a signal of some relaxation in trade rhetoric, a bit of climbdown,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier. “That should be enough as (economic) fundamentals are strong. But you do need a trigger point and so far we have not seen it.” MSCI’s broad emerging markets index touched a near-16-month low before rebounding a bit to rise 0.33 percent for the day. Hard-hit emerging markets currencies were 0.47 percent stronger, helped by the weaker greenback. The U.S. dollar index fell 0.45 percent as hopes also grew of concessions by Canada that would resolve disputes over reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement. Ahmed said another positive catalyst for markets could be signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could slow the pace of interest rate rises.

Markets will also keep an eye on U.S. bonds, especially given the steady march higher in shorter-term Treasuries heavily influenced by expectations of Fed policy. The yield on the 2-year note hit a decade peak of 2.752 percent on Tuesday when data showed sustained strength in the jobs market and the Treasury started a record debt sale amounting to almost $150 billion. It eased to 2.744 percent on Wednesday on weaker-than expected producer price data. Political risk meanwhile returned to the radar of investors in Italy. Italian bond yields, which fell to six-week lows in recent days, rose after local media reported 5-Star, one of the parties in the ruling coalition, was demanding 10 billion euros in the budget to implement plans for a basic universal income.

2018-09-12,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC on Wednesday further trimmed its forecast for 2019 global oil demand growth and said the risk to the economic outlook was skewed to the downside, adding a new challenge to the group’s efforts to support the market next year. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said world oil demand next year would rise by 1.41 million barrels per day (bpd), 20,000 bpd less than last month and the second consecutive reduction in the forecast. The report provides further indication the rapid oil demand that helped OPEC and allies get rid of a supply glut will moderate in 2019. OPEC last month said global growth faced “numerous challenges”, although its latest report suggests concern about them has deepened.  “Rising challenges in some emerging and developing economies are skewing the current global economic growth risk forecast to the downside,” OPEC said in the report. “Rising trade tensions, and the consequences of further potential monetary tightening by G4 central banks, in combination with rising global debt levels, are additional concerns.” Crude LCOc1 briefly pared gains after the OPEC report was released but later rallied to trade above $80 a barrel, a level reached earlier this year for the first time since 2014, supported by expectations for a further drop in Iranian exports. OPEC and a group of non-OPEC countries agreed on June 22-23 to return to 100 percent compliance with oil output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction by Venezuela and others pushed adherence above 160 percent. The economic downside risks will provide a talking point for a group of OPEC and non-OPEC energy ministers meeting on Sept. 23 in Algiers to monitor the market. The meeting could make policy recommendations. OPEC’s next meeting to set policy is not until December. In the report, OPEC said its oil output rose in August by 278,000 bpd to 32.56 million bpd following the June deal.  The biggest rise came from Libya, which is exempt from the agreement. This helped offset declines in Venezuela, where production is declining due to the economic crisis, and Iran, as buyers walked away ahead of the U.S. sanctions. This means compliance with the original supply-cutting deal has increased to 133 percent, according to a Reuters calculation, meaning members are still cutting more than promised. The original figure for July was 126 percent. The August production rate is lower than the average demand for OPEC crude in 2018 and considerably more than will be needed next year as rivals such as the United States expand supplies.  OPEC said the world will need 32.05 million bpd from its 15 members in 2019, unchanged from last month. This suggests there will be a 500,000 bpd surplus in the market should OPEC keep pumping the same amount and other things remain equal. The higher prices that have followed the OPEC-led deal are still prompting more growth in rival supply. OPEC said it expects non-OPEC production to expand by 2.15 million bpd next year, 20,000 bpd more than forecast last month.

2018-09-12,"(Adds price reaction, comment, details throughout) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories fell more than expected last week to below 400 million barrels, while gasoline and distillate inventories rose as refiners ramped up production, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell 5.3 million barrels in the week to Sept. 7 to 396.2 million barrels, the lowest level since February 2015, and about 3 percent below the five-year average for this time of year, the EIA said. Analysts had forecast a decrease of 805,000 barrels. U.S. Midwest crude oil inventories fell to 105.9 million barrels last week, the lowest weekly level since January 2015, EIA data showed. Inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures, located in the PADD 2 or the Midwest, fell 1.2 million barrels, EIA said. The bullish weekly report sent crude futures higher, with global benchmark Brent rising more than $1 a barrel in the session to a high of $80.13 a barrel. U.S. crude rose $1.65 a barrel to $70.90 after the report was issued. “A solid draw to crude inventories this week was the result of a counter-seasonal increase in refining activity - at a point when we should be tumbling into fall maintenance,” said Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData. “The Midwest accounted for the lion’s share of the inventory drop, while lower crude imports, higher crude exports and higher refinery runs on the Gulf Coast also help explain away a good part of today’s crude draw,” he said. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 443,000 barrels per day. Refinery crude runs rose by 210,000 bpd and utilization rates increased 1 percentage point to 97.6 percent of total capacity, EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks rose 1.3 million barrels, slightly below analysts’ expectations. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 6.2 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.4 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault

2018-09-12,"STUTTGART (Reuters) - Former Volkswagen (VW) Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn and Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner are no longer expected to testify in a trial brought against VW’s main shareholder Porsche SE by investors, according to a judge. Most of the two dozen witnesses called in the case have invoked their right to refuse to give evidence, Judge Fabian Richter Reuschle said in the opening of the trial in a regional court in Stuttgart. “We have to accept that we cannot force them to incriminate themselves,” Richter Reuschle said, adding the trial dates set aside for witness testimony through mid-November had been canceled. Shareholders represented by law firm TILP are seeking compensation from Porsche SE, alleging the company did not inform markets quickly enough about the scale of potential liabilities VW faced over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. emissions tests, disclosed in September 2015. The start of proceedings in Stuttgart comes two days after a separate investor suit launched in the northern German city of Braunschweig, in which the plaintiffs are seeking billions of euros in damages from VW itself as well as from Porsche SE. VW has admitted to cheating diesel emissions tests, but denies it failed to inform investors in a timely fashion. Bosch supplied key parts for VW’s diesel engines, but says the integration of them was the responsibility of the manufacturer.  Had investors known about VW’s unlawful activities in rigging emissions tests, they may have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue. VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars. A higher court in Stuttgart is due to rule on whether the suit against Porsche SE should be suspended to await the outcome of the Braunschweig trial, since the two cases are similar. Porsche SE, the holding company of the Porsche and Piech families, owns about 52 percent of voting rights in VW. It is being sued by investors for a total of 865 million euros ($1 billion) in the two courts. Porsche SE sees all of the suits as unfounded and in some cases without legal basis. Like VW’s management board, the board of Porsche SE had no knowledge of any cheating on diesel emissions tests before the matter became public in a “notice of violation” by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Sept. 18, 2015, the company says. Winterkorn was the CEO of both Volkswagen and Porsche SE at the time.

2018-09-12,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Energy issues will be “very heavily on the agenda” at a meeting between Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Russian President Vladimir Putin next Tuesday in Moscow, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told Reuters on Wednesday. Hungary imports most of its gas from Russia under a long-term supply agreement, due to expire by 2020.  “Another long-term agreement is not on the agenda yet since we have to come to an agreement about year 2020, although some ... preparatory negotiations on how to go forward have been launched,” Szijjarto said on the sidelines of a news conference. “(Our) long-term gas supply deal with expire at the end of 2020 or already at the end of 2019, we will see the Russian position on that,” he added. Hungary has promoted Moscow’s interests within the European Union, repeatedly calling for the ending of economic sanctions imposed after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014. “We have to find a way in order to minimize our losses ... which were caused by the regime of the sanctions in the last years,” Szijjarto said on Wednesday. In 2014, Budapest also signed a deal for two new reactors at its Paks nuclear plant with Russia, to be built by state atomic energy firm Rosatom.  It will be funded with a 10 billion euro loan from Russia but will be owned and operated by the Hungarian state. The project has been delayed, which Hungary said was due to EU regulatory hurdles. The EU cleared the project last year. Hungary’s government has said the nuclear plant will serve the country’s long-term energy security. It also says Russia has less economic influence in Hungary than in other Western European states. However, Orban has also clamped down on non-governmental bodies that he accuses of using foreign funding and actively helping illegal immigration. Putin last met Orban in July.

2018-09-12,"(Repeats item with no changes in text) * U.S. crude exports to Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2CITKcJ * Iran crude exports to Asia: tmsnrt.rs/2NDV3Os * Discount of U.S. crude vs Brent: tmsnrt.rs/2CEdfTu By Henning Gloystein and Collin Eaton SINGAPORE/HOUSTON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - U.S. oil exports to Japan and South Korea will rise to record highs this month as Asian refiners take advantage of the steep discounts American sellers are offering after losing Chinese customers amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing. Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that oil exports from the United States to South Korea in September will rise to a record average of at least 230,000 barrels per day (bpd). U.S. shipments to Japan will also rise to a record average of at least 134,000 bpd, the data showed. Two traders and a brokerage source said South Korean and Japanese refiners have been taking advantage of steep discounts of up to $10 per barrel between the U.S. crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) that American producers base their crude sales on and the international Brent crude benchmark. LCO-CLFVMc1 “They (South Koreans and Japanese refiners) need to find replacements for their drop in Iran imports and a fair amount of that is coming from the States. The steep discount of WTI to Brent is hard to resist,” said a Singapore-based ship broker. The sources declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk about commercial operations in public. “Our U.S. crude oil purchase is purely because of its price advantage,” said Kim Woo-kyung, a spokeswoman at SK Innovation , the owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy. A spokesman for Japan’s biggest refiner JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp said his firm had not received government orders to halt Iranian oil imports. He would not comment on commercial operations beyond saying “we will determine optimum crude in our own procurement plan.” Japan and South Korea were among the first major Iranian clients to bow to U.S. pressure and cut orders from Iran, the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with South Korea importing its last cargoes in July, the trade data showed. India, typically the second-biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, has also dialled back Iranian orders while importing more from the United States, the data showed. With Middle East crude markets tightening because of the start of U.S. sanctions against Iran in November, many Asian refiners have been seeking to make up the shortfall with American supply. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader said there has been “a divergence between Brent and WTI.” U.S. prices, including benchmark WTI, are under pressure amid rising production and a decline in Chinese buying interest because of the trade dispute which is forcing U.S. sellers to find new buyers for their crude. Meanwhile, the Brent benchmark is supported by several supply disruptions including the Iranian sanctions, tumbling exports from Venezuela, and lingering concerns about Libyan production amid clashes between internal groups. “There are still plenty of battles and other influences to disrupt Brent supply which has kept traders interested,” McKenna said, referring to concerns about supplies that tend to be priced off Brent, including from Libya, West Africa and the Middle East. Whether this price divergence will last is not clear. There are signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia will increase output to take up Iranian market share, which should ease Brent prices. Meanwhile, U.S. prices could rise because the surge in demand may exacerbate logistical bottlenecks since the current domestic pipeline, port and storage infrastructure is not geared to handle exports on this scale. This congestion is already causing offers to rise for U.S. supply for loading towards the end of the year, although no fixed deals have been reported, said a third trader in Singapore.

2018-09-12,"VLADIVOSTOK (Reuters) - Global oil markets remain “fragile” due to geopolitics and production declines in several regions, Russia’s energy minister said on Wednesday, but added his country could raise output if needed. The comments come amid oil prices eyeing $80 per barrel LCOc1, up from little over $60 in February, amid supply disruptions and expected U.S. sanctions against Iran. “Today, the situation is quite fragile, of course, and it is related to the fact that not all the countries have managed to restore their market and production,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at an economic conference in the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok. “We observe such situation in Mexico, where the decline more than halved from the forecasts on 2018. In Venezuela production is falling quite strongly, by 50,000 barrels per day. This means that the market is still not balanced in long-term perspective.” Venezuelan oil exports have halved over the past year to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) as the South American country grapples with a political and economic crisis. Novak also warned of the impact on markets of looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, which will be implemented from November. “This is huge uncertainty on the market – how the countries, which buy almost 2 million barrels per day of Iranian oil will act. Those are Europe, Asia Pacific region ... There is a lot of uncertainty. The situation should be closely watched, the right decisions should be taken.” Washington has put pressure on other countries to also stop importing Iranian oil. Despite some opposition from governments in Europe and Asia, many oil firms have already started dialling back purchases in anticipation of U.S. sanctions. (Graphic: Iran oil exports to Asia - tmsnrt.rs/2CEzade) Should markets overheat and prices spike, Novak said there was potential for some countries to raise output. “Russia has potential to raise production by 300,000 barrels (per day) mid-term, in addition to the level of October 2016.” October 2016 was a baseline for the accord to withhold output from 2017. For that month, Russia produced 11.247 million barrels per day, a post-Soviet record high. Novak said a September meeting between the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, will discuss the market situation in Algeria. He said the meeting would discuss further oil market cooperation, taking into account supply and demand forecasts for the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first half of 2019.  Novak also said that Russia plans to obtain a 20 percent share of the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market thanks to abundant gas reserves. “I am sure we will reach this goal,” he said.

2018-09-12,"(Repeats Sept. 11 column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Traders more concerned about supply than consumption outlook * Efforts to maintain global supply amid sanctions in sharp focus * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Oil traders have become much more concerned in recent weeks about the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran and the effect on the availability of crude at the end of the year. Brent futures for November have moved to a premium of 45 cents a barrel over the December contract, in a sharp reversal from early last month, when the earlier contract traded at a 20 cent discount. The gyrations in the futures curve are linked closely to traders’ perceptions of the availability of seaborne crude once sanctions are re-imposed from early November (tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB). The November-December calendar spread moved into an increasing premium (backwardation) between July 2017 and May 2018, reflecting the overall tightening of the oil market. Rapid growth in consumption, output restraint by OPEC and its allies as well as unexpected disruptions to production in Venezuela and some African countries all helped to reduce excess oil inventories. The U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s exports from early November contributed to a forecast tightening of the market, pushing the Nov-Dec spread to a premium of more than 50 cents in early May. But the calendar spread subsequently collapsed as OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, started to increase production from May onwards. For a short period, in late July and early August, the Nov-Dec spread was trading at a small but significant discount (contango) consistent with plentiful availability of oil at the end of the year. In recent weeks, however, the spread has tightened again, amid signs that output from the Permian Basin in Texas is levelling off and that Saudi Arabia is raising production more slowly than expected. Traders have become much more cautious about crude availability late this year, reflected in a rise in spot oil prices, tighter calendar spreads and an increase in bullish hedge fund positioning in crude futures. Concerns about crude availability have been exacerbated by signs that the threatened re-imposition of sanctions is already having an impact on Iran’s exports, even before the secondary embargo formally goes into effect. For the moment, traders are more concerned about a shortfall in crude availability as a result of sanctions and the stagnation of U.S. drilling than they are about a slowdown in the global economy hitting growth in oil consumption. THREE-WAY DANCE The sharp movements in the spread point to the complicated three-way dance between the White House, Saudi Arabia and hedge fund managers over Iran sanctions and oil supplies. The White House wants tough sanctions but is anxious to maintain crude availability and avoid being blamed for a rise in fuel costs, especially in an election year. Saudi Arabia supports a tough policy on Iran and has promised to make up any shortfall in oil supplies, but it does not want to risk oversupplying the market and provoking a renewed drop in prices. Hedge fund managers, in turn, are betting supplies will fall and prices rise as Saudi caution trumps White House pressure for steady or lower fuel costs. Someone must be miscalculating. If the market tightens as much as traders currently expect, the White House will be faced with a rise in prices it has tried hard to avoid. Rising prices may matter less after election day on Nov. 6, but they are likely to remain unwelcome at any time and will expose both the White House and Saudi Arabia to criticism for poorly executed policy. If, on the other hand, the White House and Saudi Arabia manage to keep the market plentifully supplied even as sanctions go into effect, Brent spot prices and calendar spreads are likely to come under renewed pressure. And hedge fund managers are likely to liquidate some of the new bullish positions they have established since late last month, intensifying downward pressure on spot prices and spreads. The oil market outlook now depends on whether the United States and Saudi Arabia can successfully implement their sanctions policy without disrupting global oil supplies. Most oil traders are betting they will fail and leave the market at least moderately short of crude.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.05 percent, hovering near its lowest levels plumbed since July 2017 on Monday. Tokyo’s Nikkei fell 0.25 percent and Australian stocks gave up 0.3 percent, while South Korea’s KOSPI managed to eke out a modest 0.15 percent gain. The mood was dimmed by the verbal sparring between Washington and Beijing as the months-long escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies took their toll on riskier assets. China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States in retaliation for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties. Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was taking a tough stance with China. Asian equities and the broader emerging markets have continued to sag in the wake of the trade tensions and concerns about the crises in Turkey and Argentina. MSCI’s index of emerging market shares has fallen to its lowest level since May 2017. Still, other markets have shown resilience. Wall Street gained on Tuesday as Apple led a jump in technology shares and a gain of more than 2 percent in oil prices drove up energy stocks. “In thinking of the prospects of the trade war, it is important to distinguish the journey from the destination. The journey will remain very noisy and unsettling. But I suspect the destination will be less so,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz SE, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday. El-Erian expects the United States to eventually secure trade concessions. He sees a 60 percent probability of “slightly fairer but and still free trade,” a 25 percent possibility of a global trade war and 15 percent likelihood of a “Reagan Moment” that significantly improves the landscape for international trade.” In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent lower at 95.128, handing back the previous day’s modest gains. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1593 The Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7102 after hitting $0.7085 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2016, on concerns that any damage to the Chinese economy from a trade war could hurt Australia’s exporters. The pound eased 0.1 percent to $1.3017, pulling back from a one-month peak of $1.3087 scaled on Monday hopes over prospects for a Brexit trade deal with the European Union subsided. Crude oil stretched their gains from the previous day, when the market rallied as U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports and after U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was forecast to grow at a slower rate than previously expected.

Prices were also pushed up by Hurricane Florence, which is expected to make landfall on the U.S. East Coast on Friday, and which has caused fuel shortages following the evacuation of millions of households and businesses. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.81 per barrel at 0047 GMT, up 56 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement.

The increases extended a more than 2 percent climb in both crude benchmarks the previous session. “Oil prices jumped overnight as American Petroleum Institute inventory data showed a large drawdown in inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. crude stocks fell by 8.6 million barrels in the week to September 7 to 395.9 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute (API), a private industry group, said on Tuesday. Official weekly government data will be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Outside the United States, traders have been focusing on the impact of looming U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target oil exports from November.

A bruising session in Asia took MSCI’s main Asia-Pacific ex-Japan index to a 10th straight day in the red, its longest losing streak since September 2000. Bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Tokyo all closed lower, taking emerging equities to a new 15-month low. MSCI’s all-country equity index inched up marginally, looking to extend two sessions of modest gains that had snapped six straight days of losses. “What the market needs is a signal of some relaxation in trade rhetoric, a bit of climbdown,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier. “That should be enough as (economic) fundamentals are strong. But you do need a trigger point and so far we have not seen it.” The months-long escalation in tensions between the world’s two biggest economies shows no sign of letting up. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was taking a tough stance with China. That cemented expectations that new levies on Chinese exports will soon be announced. Earlier China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States in retaliation for non-compliance with a ruling in an earlier trade dispute. Equity markets also faced pressure from U.S. two-year bond yields which touched a decade peak on Tuesday, partly spurred by data that provided yet more evidence of the U.S. economy’s strength. That data had pushed Wall Street to a strong close, led by tech and energy shares, and futures for the tech-heavy Nasdaq benchmark were up 0.2 percent on Wednesday. The S&P500 and Dow Jones indexes looked set for flat openings, however . In Europe, a pan-European index rose 0.2 percent off recent five-month lows though it gave up earlier strong gains. Ahmed said another positive catalyst for markets could be signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve that it could slow the pace of interest rate rises. But given the torrent of strong U.S. data, that looks unlikely - data this week showed U.S. small business optimism at the highest level on record. “In 2015 when emerging markets got into a lot of trouble the Fed recognised the international spillover effect. This time that has not happened,” he added. The trade rows and higher U.S interest rates have pushed an index of emerging currencies almost 7 percent lower this year . The yuan touched 2-1/2 week lows against the dollar, leading Asian peers lower and keeping the Australian dollar - heavily linked to Chinese trade - close to its lowest since February 2016. The dollar inched down against a basket of currencies as hopes grew of concessions by Canada that would resolve disputes over reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement. But emerging currencies stayed under pressure. While the worst-hit Turkish lira and Argentine peso have steadied off record lows, the Indian rupee is continuing to plumb new troughs, taking year-to-date losses versus the dollar to more than 12 percent. “The rupee ... is symptomatic of the overall situation in emerging markets, but it also embeds some idiosyncratic problems - with the fiscal deficit growing and the current account deficit widening on (the) back of rising commodity prices,” said Cristian Maggio, head of emerging markets strategy at TD Securities. Markets will also keep an eye on U.S. bonds. Ten-year yields stand just off the one-month highs hit on Tuesday after data showing sustained strength in the jobs market and the Treasury started a record debt sale amounting to almost $150 billion. Political risk meanwhile returned to the radar of investors in Italy and Britain. Italian bond yields, which fell to six-week lows in recent days, rose after local media reported 5-Star, one of the parties in the ruling coalition, was demanding 10 billion euros in the budget to implement plans for a basic universal income. The British pound also slipped off five-week highs hit this week against the dollar, as cautious optimism over a Brexit trade deal with the European Union subsided. Oil prices extended Tuesday’s $2 surge, with Brent futures close to $80 a barrel as Hurricane Florence advanced and U.S. sanctions started weighing on Iran’s exports.

2018-09-12,"(Adds quote by President Kabila) KOLWEZI, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sept 12 (Reuters) - D emocratic Republic of Congo’s mines minister said on Wednesday that a new mining code signed into law in March that hikes royalties and taxes cannot be called into question. Addressing a mining conference in the copper and cobalt-mining city of Kolwezi, Martin Kabwelulu called on industry leaders to work to implement the code as it was promulgated by President Joseph Kabila. Major mining companies including Glencore and Randgold bitterly opposed the code, which axes tax exemptions and hikes royalties and profit taxes. They have been holding out hope it might be watered down in further negotiations. “It is not the place of any participating party, whether civil society, mining companies or even the government to try to call into question the text governing the mining sector,” Kabwelulu said. Kabila addressed the conference later, urging all parties to implement the new code. He also called on mining companies to explore beyond their existing concessions, most of which were state-owned before being privatised over the past two decades. “I call on investors to move beyond the comfort of the land and concessions that were ceded to them by different state companies ... to take real risks by exploiting the rest of the country,” he said. Companies say the new code’s tax hikes and cancelling of 10-year exemptions for existing projects against changes to the previous fiscal and customs regimes breach previous agreements with the government and will deter further investment. Congo is Africa’s top copper producer and the world’s leading miner of cobalt, a mineral which has seen a surge in demand to manufacture electric car batteries. Other major mining companies with investments in Congo include AngloGold Ashanti, Ivanhoe Mines, China Molybdenum, Zijin Mining and MMG .

2018-09-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen will face another class action lawsuit over its rigging of diesel emissions tests, this time at home when Germany introduces a new law in November. State-financed consumer protection organization vzbv said on Wednesday it would undertake “pioneering work” with motorists’ lobby group ADAC by filing for damages on behalf of car owners. The class action was made possible after the German cabinet approved a draft law in May that will allow consumer protection organizations to litigate on behalf of the consumers they represent, avoiding the high legal costs that might otherwise put people off bringing legal action. Vzbv said it would aim to show that owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars with so-called type EA 189 diesel engines had been intentionally harmed by the Volkswagen’s use of software that was used to cheat emissions tests Volkswagen said the possibility did not change its view that there was no legal basis for consumers to make claims in connection to the diesel issue in Germany. Vzbv said it wanted to get compensation for some 2 million owners of diesel cars that were not as environmentally friendly as VW said they were at the time of purchase. VW admitted in 2015 it had used illegal engine control devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.     Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners. VW had rejected criticism that the compensation for U.S. car owners was not extended to other jurisdictions. Consumers have brought lawsuits in countries including Switzerland, Australia and Belgium.    Information for motorists on how to join the German action is due to be posted here.

2018-09-12,"ROME (Reuters) - Conditions in Libya are too unstable to hold elections, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj was cited as saying on Wednesday, casting doubts on a French-led push for a vote in December which aims to end years of turmoil and unify the North African country. French President Emmanuel Macron hosted a conference in May where rival Libyan factions agreed to work with the United Nations for a national election by Dec. 10. Libya splintered following the 2011 NATO-backed revolt that toppled Muammar Gaddafi, and since 2014 has been divided between competing political and military groups based in Tripoli and the east. “You can not vote with instability in the streets ... it is necessary that everyone accepts the result of the ballot. We need shared rules,” Seraj, who leads the U.N.-brokered transitional government based in Tripoli, said in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera. Armed groups have vowed to resume hostilities if talks to be hosted by U.N. Special Envoy Ghassan Salame do not result in a lasting settlement. Seraj has close relations with Italy. His main rival, military commander Khalifa Haftar, is aligned with a government based in the east and is seen as closer to France. Seraj also said factions would need to agree on a  constitution before any vote is held.   “We had talked about elections in Paris, but the constitutional document, which is ready but not approved, must first be voted on,” Seraj said. “Unfortunately, the parliament of Tobruk has not yet examined it. Without the constitution, how can one go to a  national vote?” (Refiles to fix garble in paragraph 5 and 9) Reporting by Giselda Vagnoni; Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky",https://uk.reuters.com/article/libya-security-election/refile-libyas-pm-says-conditions-for-elections-not-yet-ripe-paper-idUKL5N1VY1Z2,12 Sep 2018,"Conditions in Libya are too

2018-09-12,"SINGAPORE/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), the world’s biggest container shipping group, will add devices to reduce harmful exhaust emissions to some of its ships ahead of new global fuel regulations starting in 2020. To combat air pollution, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations’ shipping agency, has set global regulations to cap the sulphur content in marine fuels, known as bunkers, at 0.5 percent down from 3.5 percent now. Shipowners could meet the new regulations by installing sulphur-stripping exhaust cleaning systems, known as scrubbers, and continue to burn cheaper high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO). The companies could also comply by burning costlier low-sulphur fuels such as marine gasoil, ultra-low-sulphur fuel oil or liquefied natural gas (LNG).    “As part of the preparations we have decided to invest in new scrubber technology on a limited number of vessels in our fleet of around 750 container vessels,” Niels-Henrik Lindegaard, head of Maersk Oil Trading told Reuters in an email. “Using scrubber technology is a small part of – and just one of several elements in – our overall 2020 fuel sourcing strategy to ensure compliance in time,” he said.      A spate of recent scrubber installation orders led energy researchers to revise their demand forecasts for high-sulphur bunker fuel higher as the scrubbers will let the ships continue to burn HSFO. But, a switch to low-sulphur fuels is still widely seen as the most practical form of compliance given the high investment and operational costs associated with scrubbers and uncertainty around future emissions regulations.   “While we will continue to explore how to best comply with the 2020 sulphur cap, we still believe the best solution remains with compliant fuels from refineries on land,” said Lindegaard.   In August, Maersk announced it had reached an agreement with Royal Vopak, an independent tank storage operator, to launch a 0.5 percent sulphur fuel bunkering facility in Rotterdam. The joint initiative with Vopak will meet about 20 percent of Maersk’s global demand for IMO 2020 compliant fuels “and we are looking into more bunkering facilities like this,” said Lindegaard.  Maersk Oil Trading purchases marine fuel for its parent company A.P. Moller-Maersk and is among the biggest bunker buyers in the world.

2018-09-12,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday following a report that crude inventories in the United States fell and as looming sanctions against Iran raised expectations of tightening supplies, with top producer Russia warning of a “fragile” global crude market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were at $69.81 per barrel at 0047 GMT, up 56 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. WTI futures gained 2.5 percent in the previous session.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 climbed 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $79.30 a barrel. Brent has climbed for four straight days and gained 2.2 percent in the previous session.  “Oil prices jumped overnight as American Petroleum Institute inventory data showed a large drawdown in inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. crude stocks fell by 8.6 million barrels in the week to Sept. 7 to 395.9 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute (API), a private industry group, said on Tuesday. Official weekly government data will be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Outside the United States, traders have been focusing on the impact of U.S. sanctions against Iran that will target oil exports from November. Washington has put pressure on other governments to also cut imports, and many countries and companies are already falling in line and reducing purchases, triggering expectations of a tighter market. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak on Wednesday warned of the impact the U.S. sanctions against Iran. “This is huge uncertainty on the market – how the countries, which buy almost 2 million barrels per day of Iranian oil will act. The situation should be closely watched, the right decisions should be taken,” he said.  Novak said global oil markets were “fragile” due to geopolitical risk and supply disruptions, but added his country could raise output if needed. “It is related to the fact that not all the countries have managed to restore their market and production,” he said, referring to outages and falling production in Mexico and Venezuela. Should markets overheat and prices spike, Novak said Russia could raise output. “Russia has potential to raise production by 300,000 barrels (per day) mid-term, in addition to the level of October 2016,” he said. That month Russia produced 11.247 million barrels per day, a post-Soviet Union record high. Crude prices were also pushed up by Hurricane Florence offshore the United States amid surging demand for gasoline and diesel. The storm is expected to make landfall on the U.S. East Coast on Friday, and has caused fuel shortages as millions of households and businesses have evacuated.

2018-09-12,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) will face another class action lawsuit over its rigging of diesel emissions tests, this time at home when Germany introduces a new law in November. State-financed consumer protection organization vzbv said on Wednesday it would undertake “pioneering work” with motorists’ lobby group ADAC by filing for damages on behalf of car owners. The class action was made possible after the German cabinet approved a draft law in May that will allow consumer protection organisations to litigate on behalf of the consumers they represent, avoiding the high legal costs that might otherwise put people off bringing legal action. Vzbv said it would aim to show that owners of VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat cars with so-called type EA 189 diesel engines had been intentionally harmed by the Volkswagen’s use of software that was used to cheat emissions tests Volkswagen said the possibility did not change its view that there was no legal basis for consumers to make claims in connection to the diesel issue in Germany. Vzbv said it wanted to get compensation for some 2 million owners of diesel cars that were not as environmentally friendly as VW said they were at the time of purchase. VW admitted in 2015 it had used illegal engine control devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests.     Nearly all U.S. owners of affected cars agreed to take part in a $25 billion settlement in 2016 in the United States that addressed claims from them, environmental regulators, U.S. states and dealers and included buyback offers and additional compensation for about 500,000 owners. VW had rejected criticism that the compensation for U.S. car owners was not extended to other jurisdictions. Consumers have brought lawsuits in countries including Switzerland, Australia and Belgium.    Information for motorists on how to join the German action is due to be posted here.

2018-09-12,"NEW YORK, Sept 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The United States is on course to meet its targets to cut geenhouse gas emissions, because cities and states are taking on the climate change fight abandoned by President Donald Trump, according to report released on Wednesday. The findings highlight a desire among large swathes of the country to continue fighting the threat of climate change despite the U.S. government’s disengagement from the global Paris agreement to curb global warming. “The Trump administration may have dropped the ball on climate action,” said Daniel Firger, a spokesman for Bloomberg Philanthropies, which commissioned the report. “But the rest of the country, including thousands of cities, states and businesses, are picking it up,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The report projected that U.S. emissions would drop to 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 if more than 3,000 leaders from states, cities, and businesses fulfill pledges they have made over the past year to cut carbon pollution. It was released on the sidelines of the Global Climate Action Summit in San Francisco, which is expected to draw about 4,500 delegates from city and regional governments around the world. Should more mayors, governors and CEOs join the movement, reductions could hit the 24 percent mark below 2005 levels by 2025, the authors said. The report measured progress made under “America’s Pledge”, a plan rolled out by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and California Governor Jerry Brown last year, providing options for Americans still committed to the Paris agreement. Under the plan, U.S. cities, states, businesses and others are honoring the pledge made by the previous administration of Barack Obama to the Paris agreement. Under the Paris pact, the U.S. promised to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 26-28 percent below 2005 levels by the year 2025. The United States is the only country to reject the climate accord, which nearly 200 other nations have signed. The findings published in Wednesday’s report are a “really important quantitative demonstration” that subnational policies to reduce greenhouse gases are paying off, said Austin Brown, from the University of California, Davis. “Cities, states and businesses...can actually make a meaningful and lasting contribution to our national goals,” said Brown, who is executive director of the university’s Policy Institute for Energy, Environment, and the Economy. In the latest move by a state government toward combating climate change, Brown, the governor of California, signed a bill on Monday requiring the state to source electricity from exclusively carbon-free sources by 2045.

Trafigura, which declined to comment, lost the rights to sell Angolan fuel oil this year, with the contract going to French oil major Total, two trading sources said. Fuel oil was the last major Angolan contract Trafigura had, with volumes of 1.1 million tonnes in 18 cargoes over 2017 worth some $450 million. Total is now expected to market a similar amount for Angolan state oil company Sonangol in 2019. “It is part of broader oil industry reforms that were ordered by Lorenco. The fuel oil contract change effectively completes this process on the trading side,” a source familiar with how Sonangol sells its oil and products told Reuters. Sonangol declined to comment on the changes. Lourenco said shortly after taking office in September 2017 that he was committed to economic reforms and ordered a review of Angola’s oil industry. He has since pushed out prominent figures from key state roles, including the former president’s daughter Isabel dos Santos, who was head of Sonangol. Trafigura has long been the main player in Angolan oil, helping Sonangol sell large volumes of crude and fuel oil and also importing gasoline, gasoil and other refined products. The trading house was also a large lender to Sonangol - with debt guaranteed by future fuel sales, although the sources said the African country had now repaid all loans. Sonangol also changed the way it imported refined products with Trafigura losing out in March on the right to supply 2 million tonnes a year of gasoil in 21 cargoes to rival Glencore. In addition it lost the rights to import some 300,000-400,000 tonnes of bunker fuel to Total, which has also won the right to supply 1.2 million tonnes of gasoline to Angola, a contract previously held by Vitol. Total, one of the biggest foreign operators in Angola, has been steadily expanding production with the launch this summer the offshore Kaombo project and reaching a framework agreement with Sonangol to develop a retail station network.

Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was taking a tough stance with China. Asian equities and the broader emerging markets have faced persistent selling pressure over recent months in the wake of the trade tensions and concerns about the crises in Turkey and Argentina. MSCI’s index of emerging market shares has fallen to its lowest level since May 2017. Still, other markets have shown resilience.

The greenback, which had gained earlier on safe-haven demand, eased after Canada signalled it was ready to make a concession to the United States to resolve their talks over reworking the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The euro dipped 0.15 percent to $1.1587. The Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7102 after hitting $0.7085 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2016, on concerns that any damage to the Chinese economy from a trade war could hurt Australia’s exporters. The pound eased 0.2 percent to $1.3007, pulling back from a one-month peak of $1.3087 scaled on Monday as hopes over a Brexit trade deal with the European Union subsided. The trade woes pulled China’s yuan down for the fourth day in onshore trade, with the currency brushing a 2-1/2-week low of 6.88 per dollar. MSCI’s emerging markets currency index retreated to its lowest since May 2017 on Tuesday, although some observers expect the downturn in these currencies to eventually slow. “While the markets are yet to give a positive assessment of Argentina’s fiscal and monetary policy efforts, the country is headed in the right direction.

2018-09-12,"MONTREAL, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Airline fuel efficiency on transatlantic flights has improved by one percent a year since 2014 as carriers buy modern planes, but the industry still lags its own climate goals, a study released on Wednesday said. The industry’s average fuel efficiency improved to 34 passenger kilometers per liter of fuel from 33 between 2014 and 2017 as carriers opted for modern aircraft with lower fuel burn and operated fuller planes, the study from the U.S.-based International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) said. Airlines have been switching to more fuel-efficient aircraft in an attempt to mitigate the impact of high oil prices on their margins. The aviation industry has also set a non-binding goal of capping emissions from international flights at 2020 levels, despite rising passenger traffic as global travel demand climbs. In 2010, the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICCT) set a goal of 2 percent annual fuel efficiency improvement through 2050 for all international flights. Airline trade group International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects an average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5 percent per year on all international flights from 2009 to 2020. While the study only looked at transatlantic flights, the ICCT said airlines will have to become more efficient to meet industry goals. “New policies to accelerate investments in more fuel-efficient aircraft and operations are critical if industry is to meet its long-term climate goals,” said Dan Rutherford, aviation program director for the U.S.-based independent non-profit research organization. The study compared the fuel efficiency of nonstop passenger flights between North America and Europe by 20 major airlines, following a similar study conducted in 2014. Starting Jan. 1, 2019, most airlines flying international routes will begin monitoring their fuel and carbon emissions as part of a landmark agreement brokered two years ago by ICAO. According to industry figures, air transport accounts for 2 percent of global man-made carbon emissions. Budget carrier Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, which operates new Boeing 787 Dreamliners and 737 MAX aircraft, was ranked first of the 20 transatlantic carriers for fuel efficiency, while British Airways, part of the International Airlines Group, came in last. Of the U.S. carriers, Delta Air Lines had the most fuel efficient fleet, meeting the industry average, while United Airlines was ranked third from the bottom.

The proposed deal is based on an enterprise value of $1.6 billion, Sapura said, adding the companies have agreed to continue talks on an exclusive basis. Sapura shares rose as much as 4.5 percent after the announcement, which comes weeks after the firm said it was planning to raise 4 billion ringgit ($963.86 million) through a proposed rights issue, in a bid to boost its financial position and pare down debt. “We have explored all options including the potential listing of our Upstream business,” Shahril Shamsuddin, Sapura’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “The invitation to enter into this strategic partnership with a leading oil and gas player serves our goals and aspirations better while providing certainty in timing and valuation,” Shahril said. Sapura has a market capitalisation of about $484.5 million, while OMV has a valuation of about $16.9 billion, Thomson Reuters data shows. Last week, OMV’s head of exploration and production, Johann Pleininger, told Reuters in an interview it had plans to expand its exploration business with an acquisition in Southeast Asia by the end of 2018. Earlier this year, the Austrian firm expanded its operations in New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates, to balance geopolitical risks it faces in its operations in countries like Russia, Libya and Yemen. OMV has set aside 10 billion euros ($11.59 billion) for acquisitions until 2025. Sapura’s Shahril said the strategic partnership with OMV will complement their continued strategy “to grow our portfolio and expand our acreage position”. “The partnership will sharpen Sapura Energy’s competitive advantage by leveraging on the strength of its portfolio of commercially viable gas fields offshore Sarawak and its acreage in new markets in New Zealand, Gulf of Mexico and most recently, Australia,” Shahril said.

Ship tracking data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that oil exports from the United States to South Korea in September will rise to a record average of at least 230,000 barrels per day (bpd). U.S. shipments to Japan will also rise to a record average of at least 134,000 bpd, the data showed. Two traders and a brokerage source said South Korean and Japanese refiners have been taking advantage of steep discounts of up to $10 per barrel between the U.S. crude benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) that American producers base their crude sales on and the international Brent crude benchmark. LCO-CLFVMc1 “They (South Koreans and Japanese refiners) need to find replacements for their drop in Iran imports and a fair amount of that is coming from the States. The steep discount of WTI to Brent is hard to resist,” said a Singapore-based ship broker. The sources declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk about commercial operations in public. “Our U.S. crude oil purchase is purely because of its price advantage,” said Kim Woo-kyung, a spokeswoman at SK Innovation , the owner of South Korea’s top refiner SK Energy. A spokesman for Japan’s biggest refiner JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy Corp said his firm had not received government orders to halt Iranian oil imports. He would not comment on commercial operations beyond saying “we will determine optimum crude in our own procurement plan.” Japan and South Korea were among the first major Iranian clients to bow to U.S. pressure and cut orders from Iran, the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, with South Korea importing its last cargoes in July, the trade data showed. India, typically the second-biggest buyer of Iranian oil after China, has also dialled back Iranian orders while importing more from the United States, the data showed. With Middle East crude markets tightening because of the start of U.S. sanctions against Iran in November, many Asian refiners have been seeking to make up the shortfall with American supply. Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader said there has been “a divergence between Brent and WTI.” U.S. prices, including benchmark WTI, are under pressure amid rising production and a decline in Chinese buying interest because of the trade dispute which is forcing U.S. sellers to find new buyers for their crude. Meanwhile, the Brent benchmark is supported by several supply disruptions including the Iranian sanctions, tumbling exports from Venezuela, and lingering concerns about Libyan production amid clashes between internal groups. “There are still plenty of battles and other influences to disrupt Brent supply which has kept traders interested,” McKenna said, referring to concerns about supplies that tend to be priced off Brent, including from Libya, West Africa and the Middle East. Whether this price divergence will last is not clear. There are signs that Saudi Arabia and Russia will increase output to take up Iranian market share, which should ease Brent prices. Meanwhile, U.S. prices could rise because the surge in demand may exacerbate logistical bottlenecks since the current domestic pipeline, port and storage infrastructure is not geared to handle exports on this scale. This congestion is already causing offers to rise for U.S. supply for loading towards the end of the year, although no fixed deals have been reported, said a third trader in Singapore.

2018-09-12,"VLADIVOSTOK (Reuters) - Global oil markets remain “fragile” due to geopolitics and production declines in several regions, Russia’s energy minister said on Wednesday, but added his country could raise output if needed. The comments come amid oil prices eyeing $80 per barrel LCOc1, up from little over $60 in February, amid supply disruptions and expected U.S. sanctions against Iran. “Today, the situation is quite fragile, of course, and it is related to the fact that not all the countries have managed to restore their market and production,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at an economic conference in the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok. “We observe such situation in Mexico, where the decline more than halved from the forecasts on 2018.

This means that the market is still not balanced in long-term perspective.” Venezuelan oil exports have halved over the past year to little more than 1 million barrels per day (bpd) as the South American country grapples with a political and economic crisis. Novak also warned of the impact on markets of looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports, which will be implemented from November. “This is huge uncertainty on the market – how the countries, which buy almost 2 million barrels per day of Iranian oil will act. Those are Europe, Asia Pacific region ... There is a lot of uncertainty. The situation should be closely watched, the right decisions should be taken.” Washington has put pressure on other countries to also stop importing Iranian oil. Despite some opposition from governments in Europe and Asia, many oil firms have already started dialling back purchases in anticipation of U.S. sanctions. (Graphic: Iran oil exports to Asia - tmsnrt.rs/2CEzade) Should markets overheat and prices spike, Novak said there was potential for some countries to raise output. “Russia has potential to raise production by 300,000 barrels (per day) mid-term, in addition to the level of October 2016.” October 2016 was a baseline for the accord to withhold output from 2017. For that month, Russia produced 11.247 million barrels per day, a post-Soviet record high. Novak said a September meeting between the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and a group of other non-OPEC producers, including Russia, will discuss the market situation in Algeria. He said the meeting would discuss further oil market cooperation, taking into account supply and demand forecasts for the third and fourth quarters of 2018 and the first half of 2019.  Novak also said that Russia plans to obtain a 20 percent share of the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market thanks to abundant gas reserves. “I am sure we will reach this goal,” he said.

2018-09-12,"(Repeats Sept. 11 column without change. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Traders more concerned about supply than consumption outlook * Efforts to maintain global supply amid sanctions in sharp focus * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Oil traders have become much more concerned in recent weeks about the potential impact of U.S. sanctions on Iran and the effect on the availability of crude at the end of the year. Brent futures for November have moved to a premium of 45 cents a barrel over the December contract, in a sharp reversal from early last month, when the earlier contract traded at a 20 cent discount. The gyrations in the futures curve are linked closely to traders’ perceptions of the availability of seaborne crude once sanctions are re-imposed from early November (tmsnrt.rs/2oZ5MoB). The November-December calendar spread moved into an increasing premium (backwardation) between July 2017 and May 2018, reflecting the overall tightening of the oil market. Rapid growth in consumption, output restraint by OPEC and its allies as well as unexpected disruptions to production in Venezuela and some African countries all helped to reduce excess oil inventories. The U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran’s exports from early November contributed to a forecast tightening of the market, pushing the Nov-Dec spread to a premium of more than 50 cents in early May. But the calendar spread subsequently collapsed as OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and its non-OPEC allies, led by Russia, started to increase production from May onwards. For a short period, in late July and early August, the Nov-Dec spread was trading at a small but significant discount (contango) consistent with plentiful availability of oil at the end of the year. In recent weeks, however, the spread has tightened again, amid signs that output from the Permian Basin in Texas is levelling off and that Saudi Arabia is raising production more slowly than expected. Traders have become much more cautious about crude availability late this year, reflected in a rise in spot oil prices, tighter calendar spreads and an increase in bullish hedge fund positioning in crude futures. Concerns about crude availability have been exacerbated by signs that the threatened re-imposition of sanctions is already having an impact on Iran’s exports, even before the secondary embargo formally goes into effect. For the moment, traders are more concerned about a shortfall in crude availability as a result of sanctions and the stagnation of U.S. drilling than they are about a slowdown in the global economy hitting growth in oil consumption. THREE-WAY DANCE The sharp movements in the spread point to the complicated three-way dance between the White House, Saudi Arabia and hedge fund managers over Iran sanctions and oil supplies. The White House wants tough sanctions but is anxious to maintain crude availability and avoid being blamed for a rise in fuel costs, especially in an election year. Saudi Arabia supports a tough policy on Iran and has promised to make up any shortfall in oil supplies, but it does not want to risk oversupplying the market and provoking a renewed drop in prices. Hedge fund managers, in turn, are betting supplies will fall and prices rise as Saudi caution trumps White House pressure for steady or lower fuel costs. Someone must be miscalculating. If the market tightens as much as traders currently expect, the White House will be faced with a rise in prices it has tried hard to avoid. Rising prices may matter less after election day on Nov. 6, but they are likely to remain unwelcome at any time and will expose both the White House and Saudi Arabia to criticism for poorly executed policy. If, on the other hand, the White House and Saudi Arabia manage to keep the market plentifully supplied even as sanctions go into effect, Brent spot prices and calendar spreads are likely to come under renewed pressure. And hedge fund managers are likely to liquidate some of the new bullish positions they have established since late last month, intensifying downward pressure on spot prices and spreads. The oil market outlook now depends on whether the United States and Saudi Arabia can successfully implement their sanctions policy without disrupting global oil supplies. Most oil traders are betting they will fail and leave the market at least moderately short of crude.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.05 percent, hovering near its lowest levels plumbed since July 2017 on Monday. Tokyo’s Nikkei fell 0.25 percent and Australian stocks gave up 0.3 percent, while South Korea’s KOSPI managed to eke out a modest 0.15 percent gain. The mood was dimmed by the verbal sparring between Washington and Beijing as the months-long escalation in trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies took their toll on riskier assets. China told the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Tuesday it wanted to impose $7 billion a year in sanctions on the United States in retaliation for Washington’s non-compliance with a ruling in a dispute over U.S. dumping duties. Separately, U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was taking a tough stance with China. Asian equities and the broader emerging markets have continued to sag in the wake of the trade tensions and concerns about the crises in Turkey and Argentina. MSCI’s index of emerging market shares has fallen to its lowest level since May 2017. Still, other markets have shown resilience. Wall Street gained on Tuesday as Apple led a jump in technology shares and a gain of more than 2 percent in oil prices drove up energy stocks. “In thinking of the prospects of the trade war, it is important to distinguish the journey from the destination. The journey will remain very noisy and unsettling. But I suspect the destination will be less so,” Mohamed A. El-Erian, Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz SE, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Wednesday. El-Erian expects the United States to eventually secure trade concessions. He sees a 60 percent probability of “slightly fairer but and still free trade,” a 25 percent possibility of a global trade war and 15 percent likelihood of a “Reagan Moment” that significantly improves the landscape for international trade.” In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent lower at 95.128, handing back the previous day’s modest gains. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1593 The Australian dollar was down 0.25 percent at $0.7102 after hitting $0.7085 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2016, on concerns that any damage to the Chinese economy from a trade war could hurt Australia’s exporters. The pound eased 0.1 percent to $1.3017, pulling back from a one-month peak of $1.3087 scaled on Monday hopes over prospects for a Brexit trade deal with the European Union subsided. Crude oil stretched their gains from the previous day, when the market rallied as U.S. sanctions squeezed Iranian crude exports and after U.S. crude oil production in 2019 was forecast to grow at a slower rate than previously expected. Brent crude futures were 0.3 percent higher at $79.31 per barrel after surging more than 2 percent on Tuesday. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

Prices were also pushed up by Hurricane Florence, which is expected to make landfall on the U.S. East Coast on Friday, and which has caused fuel shortages following the evacuation of millions of households and businesses. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.81 per barrel at 0047 GMT, up 56 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures climbed 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $79.30 a barrel. The increases extended a more than 2 percent climb in both crude benchmarks the previous session. “Oil prices jumped overnight as American Petroleum Institute inventory data showed a large drawdown in inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. crude stocks fell by 8.6 million barrels in the week to September 7 to 395.9 million barrels, the American Petroleum Institute (API), a private industry group, said on Tuesday. Official weekly government data will be published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. Outside the United States, traders have been focusing on the impact of looming U.S. sanctions against Iran, which will target oil exports from November. Washington has put pressure on other governments to also cut imports, and many countries and companies are already falling in line and reducing purchases, triggering expectations of a tighter market.
