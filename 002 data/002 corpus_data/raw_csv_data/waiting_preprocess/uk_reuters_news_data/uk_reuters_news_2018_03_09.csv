2018-03-09,"WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The United States opened the way for more exemptions from its steel and aluminium tariffs on Friday, after pressure from allies and intense lobbying from lawmakers, further diluting the measures just a day after they were formally announced. President Donald Trump, who has broad powers to impose the tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminium, at the outset granted exemptions to Canada and Mexico, and said there would be the possibility of industry exemptions, although he has not been specific. After Trump opened the door, Brazil, Japan, South Korea, Australia and Europe clamoured for special treatment, while Chinese producers called on Beijing to retaliate in kind. Trump tweeted on Friday that he spoke with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about trade and military cooperation. “Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminium tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia!” Trump said. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin earlier said he expects countries in addition to Mexico and Canada to be exempted in the next couple of weeks. When proposed tariffs were initially announced, stock markets went into a tail spin on concerns they would ignite a global trade war. But since Trump signalled that exemptions were possible, reaction has been measured, and counter threats have been carefully calibrated so far. Those threats have been overblown, according to Dani Rodrik, professor of international political economy at Harvard University’s John F. Kennedy School of Government and one of the world’s leading experts on trade. “The reality is that Trump’s trade measures to date amount to small potatoes. In particular, they pale in comparison to the scale and scope of the protectionist policies of President Ronald Reagan’s administration in the 1980s,” Rodrik wrote on Friday. Tokyo and Brussels rejected any suggestion that their exports to the United States threatened the country’s national security - Trump’s justification for imposing the tariffs despite warnings at home and abroad that they could provoke a global trade war. “We are an ally, not a threat,” European Commission Vice President Jyrki Katainen said. China’s metals industry issued the country’s most explicit threat yet in the row, urging the government to retaliate by targeting U.S. coal - a sector that is central to Trump’s political base and his election pledge to restore American industries and blue-collar jobs. Brazil, which after Canada is the biggest steel supplier to the U.S. market, said it wanted to join the exemption list, and Argentina made a similar case.  Japan, the United States’ top economic and military ally in Asia, was next in line. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference that Japan’s steel and aluminium shipments posed no threat to U.S. national security.  The European Union, the world’s biggest trade bloc, chimed in. “Europe is certainly not a threat to American internal security so we expect to be excluded,” European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said in Brussels. Malmstrom told reporters the EU was ready to complain to the World Trade Organization, and retaliate within 90 days. She will meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Japanese Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko in Brussels on Saturday when she will ask whether the EU is to be included in the tariffs. Malmstrom won support from German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Shares in European steel makers fell, although Germany’s two biggest producers, Thyssenkrupp and Salzgitter, have insisted the impact on them will be limited. The target of Trump’s ire is China, whose capacity expansions have helped add to global surpluses of steel. China is also the potential target of far more wide-ranging U.S. action over what Washington says is its theft of intellectual property and coercion of U.S. firms to share commercial secrets. Beijing vowed to “firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests.” Tariffs would “seriously impact the normal order of international trade,” the Commerce Ministry said.  Last year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, worth about $420 million and nearly five times the amount it took in 2016. Trump has championed coal exports as demand from power firms at home weakens. The dispute has fuelled concerns that soybeans, the United States’ most valuable export to China, might be caught up in the row after Beijing launched an inquiry into imports of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and liquor.  South Korea, the third-largest steel exporter to the United States and a strategic ally on the Korean peninsula, called for calm. “We should prevent a trade war situation from excessive protectionism, in which the entire world harms each other,” Trade Minister Paik Un-gyu told a meeting with steelmakers.  While carrying a message to Washington to push forward a diplomatic breakthrough over North Korea, South Korea’s national security office chief Chung Eui-yong asked U.S. officials to support Seoul’s request for a waiver, a presidential spokesman said.

2018-03-09,"WASHINGTON, March 9 (Reuters) - The Trump administration will send five cabinet secretaries to a U.S. Senate hearing next week to tout its plan to spur $1.5 trillion infrastructure improvements using $200 billion in new federal funding. The heads of the Transportation, Commerce, Labor, Agriculture and Labor departments will testify on March 14 before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee. Democrats have criticized the plan, saying Republicans must agree to new revenue to fund projects, and that the plan shifts too much of the burden to states and cities. “Testimony from these five cabinet secretaries will support a comprehensive public discussion with senators about the White House proposal for aligning federal resources with local infrastructure needs and helping complete projects faster,” said Senator John Thune, who chairs the Commerce Committee. Senate Democrats this week proposed $1 trillion in new federal spending paid for by repealing some tax cuts approved in December. Trump’s proposal would fund the $200 billion federal contribution to infrastructure with cuts from other federal spending. It would also shift more costs to states and cities by reducing federal matching funds. Trump’s infrastructure plan unveiled in February would also eliminate bureaucratic roadblocks to completing projects that can tie up new roads for years. Democrats insist that any plan must include new revenue, which could mean raising the federal gasoline tax. That levy has been 18.4 cents a gallon since 1993, and inflation and rising vehicle fuel efficiency have reduced its usefulness in raising enough money to keep pace with repair needs. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congress is likely to pass a series of five or six smaller infrastructure measures this year, rather than one big bill. Ryan ruled out a gasoline tax Wednesday, while Trump reportedly backed a 25 cents per gallon hike last month in a meeting with lawmakers last month. Congress transferred $140 billion to the Highway Trust Fund since 2008. Lawmakers, to maintain current spending levels, would need to approve an additional $107 billion from 2021 through 2026. The Trump administration also proposed unveil workforce training proposals, including expanding apprenticeships and seeking changes to federal work-study programs that typically are used by students at four-year institutions. It would allow more students interested in skilled trades to use them. The administration also proposed requiring states that accept federal funds for infrastructure projects would have to accept workers with out-of-state skilled-trades licenses on those projects.

2018-03-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets across the globe rose the most in two weeks on Friday after U.S. job growth posted a sharp, unexpected increase, while a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un gave crude oil a further boost. The yen fell broadly after the Bank of Japan stuck to its dovish policy stance and as Kim’s pledge to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests during the proposed talks buoyed investor sentiment. But the dollar was otherwise little changed despite the U.S. economy having added the largest number of jobs in more than 1-1/2 years in February, as slowing wage gains indicated only a gradual increase in inflation this year. Wall Street led global equity gains as the U.S. labour data landed in a sweet spot for stock investors. “You got sort of a Goldilocks report with stronger employment coupled with modest wage growth, but not enough that it forces the (Federal Reserve) to act more rapidly than they otherwise would,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 440.53 points, or 1.77 percent, to 25,335.74, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 47.6 points, or 1.74 percent, to 2,786.57 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 132.86 points, or 1.79 percent, to 7,560.81. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 ended up 0.41 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.12 percent, the most since Feb. 23. Emerging market stocks rose 1.06 percent. Overnight, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 0.95 percent higher, while Japan's Nikkei .N225 rose 0.47 percent. Crude prices rose alongside Wall Street, continuing their moves in tandem with the S&P 500. The 50-day correlation between WTI crude futures and the S&P has averaged over 0.8 so far this year. The jobs report “speaks to strong, underlying economic conditions, and growth, which includes increased energy demand,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.  U.S. crude CLcv1 rose 3.28 percent to $62.09 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $65.55, up 3.05 percent on the day. The yen fell sharply versus the U.S. dollar after the Bank of Japan stuck to its dovish policy stance and as Kim’s denuclearisation pledge boosted risk assets. Still, the greenback slipped against a basket of currencies as the slow U.S. wage gains supported a view that the Federal Reserve would not quicken its pace of raising interest rates. The Japanese yen weakened 0.56 percent versus the greenback at 106.83 per dollar. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.06 percent. The euro EUR= was down 0.04 percent to $1.2305 while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3847, up 0.27 percent on the day. The Mexican peso gained 0.14 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.63. The Canadian dollar rose 0.59 percent versus the greenback at 1.28 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields advanced across the board after the strong jobs data.    Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.8938 percent, from 2.866 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond US30YT=RR last fell 16/32 in price to yield 3.1589 percent, from 3.132 percent late on Thursday. “The headline (payrolls) print is sort of a shockingly strong number, (and) the guts of the report are as good,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. Spot gold XAU= added 0.1 percent to $1,322.91 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained 0.17 percent to $1,323.90 an ounce. Copper CMCU3 rose 1.82 percent to $6,957.50 a tonne.

2018-03-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose nearly $2 on Friday, rebounding from two days of declines as Wall Street climbed on strong U.S. jobs data, while investors also grew hopeful that a planned meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un could ease geopolitical tensions. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.88 to settle at $65.49 a barrel, a 2.96 percent gain. Brent traded between $63.69 and $65.63 during the session. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose $1.92 to settle at $62.04 a barrel, a 3.19 percent gain. U.S. crude traded between $60.14 and $62.14. Oil prices extended gains in post-settlement trade, with both benchmarks up more than $2. Both Brent and U.S. crude notched weekly percentage gains after weekly percentage losses last week. Trump said he was prepared to meet Kim in what would be the first face-to-face encounter between leaders from the two countries and could mark a breakthrough in a standoff over the North’s nuclear weapons. Kim also has committed to suspending further nuclear or missile tests. Wall Street jumped after U.S. payrolls data showed strong job additions in February. The S&P 500 index .SPX was last up about 1.5 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC hit a record high on the day, further supporting oil prices. Crude futures and stock indices have recently moved in tandem.  The jobs report “speaks to strong, underlying economic conditions, and growth, which includes increased energy demand,” said John Kilduff, partner at investment manager Again Capital in New York.  Also bullish for oil prices, Libya’s 70,000 barrels per day El Feel oilfield stayed shut despite the Petroleum Facilities Guard saying it had reached a deal to reopen it, according to a field engineer and local mediator. Hedge funds and money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude for the first time in three weeks, data showed on Friday. The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 17,166 contracts to 478,531 in the week to March 6, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. The reduction came as gross short positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange 3067651MSHT climbed to the highest in nearly a month.  U.S. oil drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to March 9, bringing the total count down to 796, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. “Sometimes you’re going to have week-to-week variations which are going to be negative, but I wouldn’t take too much from any single week,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York.  “The bigger thing is that the three-month average is definitely moving higher.” Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla and Libby George in London, and Henning Gloystein in Singapore; Editing by Cynthia Osterman and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-10-oil-prices-rise-nearly-2-amid-broad-market-optimism-idUKL4N1QR20F,09 Mar 2018,"* Trump to accept invitation to meet Kim Jong Un -White

2018-03-09,"LONDON/RIYADH (Reuters) - Britain and Saudi Arabia took a step closer to a multi-billion- pound arms deal on Friday, touching on the most inflammatory element of their relationship at the end of an official visit to London that has mixed warm diplomacy with angry street protests. The two countries also said they had made trade deals worth more than $2 billion, without providing details. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been in the British capital for three days on a mission to build broader trade and investment ties, meeting Queen Elizabeth, Prime Minister Theresa May, key ministers and executives.  The countries signed a letter of intent to finalise talks on a multi-billion-pound order for 48 Typhoon aircraft made by BAE Systems. The deal has been under discussion for years but has proven tough to seal. “The Crown Prince’s visit has opened a new chapter in our two countries’ historic relationship,” British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said.  “We have taken a vital step towards finalising another order for Typhoon jets that will increase security in the Middle East and boost British industry and jobs in our unrivalled aerospace sector,” he said. Britain and Saudi Arabia have set themselves a 65 billion- pound ($90 billion) trade and investment target for the coming years, with London looking for new post-Brexit markets for its services sector, and Prince Mohammed seeking to convince wary investors his country is a tolerant and modernising place. But for now the heart of bilateral trade ties remains defence and security. Britain credits Saudi intelligence-sharing with saving British lives and has licensed billions of pounds of weapons and ammunition sales to Saudi Arabia.    That has provided a controversial backdrop to the warm diplomatic welcome for Prince Mohammed, with hundreds turning out on Wednesday to protest arms sales and Saudi Arabia’s role in Yemen’s civil war. Prime Minister May defended the two countries’ defence ties on Wednesday, saying all arms sales were strictly regulated. The deal for the Typhoon fighters has become bogged down in negotiations over where production of the jet will take place, with Saudi Arabia keen to have some parts of the process on Saudi soil. “If agreed, this shameful deal will be celebrated in the palaces of Riyadh and by the arms companies who will profit from it, but it will mean even greater destruction for the people of Yemen,” said Andrew Smith of the Campaign Against Arms Trade.  Despite an unusual advertising blitz that saw adverts promoting Prince Mohammed and Saudi Arabia appear in national newspapers and on taxis and electronic billboards across London, the visit was knocked from the British front pages by the poisoning of a Russian double agent. Prince Mohammed’s itinerary was largely private, including meetings with bankers, executives and lawmakers, and he did not speak publicly at any point during the trip.  But, in Riyadh, images of the 32-year old Saudi meeting the Christian cross-wearing head of the Anglican church on Thursday dominated newspapers, with headlines citing it as an example of the conservative kingdom’s more tolerant approach to religion.  An image of the heir-apparent striding up Downing Street towards May’s office was lauded by Saudis on social media as  emblematic of his youth, confidence, determination and enthusiasm. The thorny topic of Yemen was on the agenda at a private dinner at May’s country residence on Thursday night, but it was tempered with gifts: May’s office said she presented Prince Mohammed with a family tree showing the descent of the Al Saud dynasty. Downing Street said the framed document was originally created by Queen Victoria’s consul general in Jeddah in 1880. The two countries pledged 100 million pounds of joint funding to support economic growth in the Horn of Africa and East Africa, the joint statement said.

2018-03-09,"NICOSIA (Reuters) - Turkish Cypriots will launch their own exploration for oil and gas around Cyprus if Greek Cypriots persist with their own plans, their foreign minister said on Friday, as an uneasy standoff lingered over offshore resources. Greek Cypriots, who run Cyprus’s internationally recognised government, have licensed several offshore blocks to multinationals for oil and gas exploration. But Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) abandoned a scheduled drill last month because of the presence of Turkish military vessels. A division of ExxonMobil (XOM.N) is due to launch an exploration attempt this year. “Either we will do it together - by discussing, agreeing and moving together - or things will stop, or, we (Turkish Cypriots) will do the same thing: we will start exploiting and drilling as well,” said Kudret Ozersay, foreign minister of Northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognised only by Turkey. Turkey has vowed to prevent what it sees as a unilateral move by Greek Cypriots, but EU member Cyprus has shown no signs of backing down. Brussels has urged Turkey to avoid threats and refrain from actions that could damage relations with the bloc. Asked whether the dispute could escalate, Ozersay said diplomacy would be the first tool: “We aim at cooling down the waters, not warming them up.”  “For that reason in the most recent (incident) we did not use force. We did not even demonstrate force. There was deterrence there,” he said, adding the Turkish Cypriot side had pursued diplomacy before then. Torn apart in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a Greek-inspired coup, seeds of division were sown earlier, when a power-sharing arrangement between Greek and Turkish Cypriots crumbled amid violence just three years after the former British colony gained independence. Greek Cypriots were left running the internationally recognised government. “Our argument on the issue of maritime areas is not based on geography,” Ozersay said, to an observation that Cyprus has only licensed maritime exploration areas lying south of the island, where it exercises effective control, and not to the north. “It is based on historic rights and the rights deriving from the partnership republic,” he said from his office, less than 5 km (3 miles) from a checkpoint where hundreds of Cypriots cross daily between the two sides.  “The thing is, not only the Turkish Cypriot side, but also the international community and the Greek Cypriot side accepts and acknowledges that we are the co-owners of those hydrocarbon resources,” Ozersay said.   Greek Cypriots have repeatedly said a peace deal would allow both communities to benefit from any offshore resources, and have baulked at including the issue in reunification discussions. But peace talks collapsed last year, with no sign of resuming soon. The talks ended primarily over a dispute on the role Turkey would play in a post-reunification Cyprus. Ankara has more than 25,000 troops in northern Cyprus, and Greek Cypriots insist their departure be integral to any deal. Although the sides have agreed, in principle, to unite Cyprus as a bicommunal bizonal federation based on political equality, they do not have the same interpretation of what that means, Ozersay said.     “We don’t understand the same thing from the same sentence.

2018-03-09,"(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday said he had formally asked for the state to be excluded from a federal offshore drilling program that he said would threaten its ocean resources and endanger efforts toward a cleaner energy economy.         “New York State strongly opposes the Department of the Interior’s National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program as it poses an unacceptable threat to New York’s ocean resources, to our economy and to the future of our children,” Cuomo said in announcing the exclusion request. The five-year program, launched by the federal government in early January, proposes to make over 90 percent of the total U.S. offshore acreage available to oil and gas drilling. The plan would open two areas of the North Atlantic coast adjacent to New York State for fossil fuel exploration, according to a statement from Cuomo’s office.    “As the number three ocean economy in the nation, New York stands to lose nearly 320,000 jobs and billions of dollars generated through tourism and fishing industries should the exclusion not be granted,” Cuomo said. “Instead of protecting our waters from another oil spill, like the one that devastated the Gulf, this new federal plan only increases the chances of another disaster taking place,” he said. Florida was granted exemption from the program on the grounds that the state relies heavily on tourism. Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift did not immediately respond to a request for comment. New York is one of several states that has asked to be exempted from the drilling plan, and Interior has said it is considering the requests and holding discussions with states as it finalises the proposal over the coming months. Officials with at least two states, California and Washington, promised to take additional steps toward thwarting the plan. In letters to the Interior Department last month, they said they would block permits for transporting oil from new offshore rigs through their states. In an effort to promote renewable energy in the New York, Cuomo also announced $1.4 billion in awards for 26 large-scale renewable energy projects across the state. The awards, driven by the Clean Energy Standard mandate to obtain 50 percent of New York’s electricity from renewable energy sources by 2030, are expected to generate enough clean, renewable energy to power more than 430,000 homes and create over 3,000 short- and long-term well-paying jobs, the statement said.

2018-03-09,"(Adds detail, background) PARIS, March 9 (Reuters) - The French government wants to renegotiate and possibly cancel offshore wind projects on the French west coast that were awarded in 2012 and 2014, the financial daily Les Echos reported on Friday. The paper said the government, as part of a package of laws submitted to the Senate, had included an amendment proposing the renegotiation or possible cancellation of the tender awards for a combined 3,000 megawatt of wind power on six sites. Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment on the Les Echos report. France awarded tenders in 2012 for a combined offshore capacity of 2,000 MW, representing investment of about 7 billion euros, to two consortia, one led by EDF and one by Spanish utility Iberdrola. It was followed by a 2014 tender for 1,000 MW, worth some 4 billion euros, won by Engie . EDF declined to comment. Iberdrola and Engie could not immediately be reached for comment. The projects were expected to produce their first power early in the 2020s, but fierce local opposition has blocked progress and none of the utilities have yet decided to proceed. Both tenders were awarded with contracts to sell power at around 200 euros per MW. But since then, prices for offshore wind power have more than halved and French energy regulator CRE has criticised the high cost of the planned subsidies. Les Echos said the draft legislation noted that since technological progress had led to a substantial drop in costs, the state might want to renegotiate terms. If that was not possible, it could cancel the projects and launch new tenders. Wind industry officials had said at a conference this week on the French offshore wind sector that they feared the government wanted to renegotiate the tender terms, which they said would be a bad signal for investment in the industry. France has huge coastlines and major potential for wind, but has not installed a single offshore wind turbine park, while Germany, Britain, Denmark and other European countries have built offshore wind parks with thousands of megawatts capacity.

2018-03-09,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Colombia plans to award up to 15 oil blocks next month and will begin routinely offering onshore and offshore areas for exploration and production in May, the head of the country’s energy regulator told Reuters.  The move, Colombia’s first offering of new areas in four years, comes as most of its neighbors also pursue new energy investments. This year, amid higher crude prices and an increase in exploration capital, bidding rounds are also set in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Mexico and Uruguay. The upcoming Colombian awards will be in the Sinu-San Jacinto basin, in the country’s northwest, Orlando Velandia, president of the National Hydrocarbons Agency, said in an interview on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference. Colombia needs to boost foreign investment to revive its stagnant crude and gas production. The Andean country plans to only slightly increase output to 900,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, Velandia said. Colombia’s last oilfield auction in 2014 secured investment from firms including ConocoPhillips and Parex Resources for seven unconventional projects that are about to finish the exploration stage to later start early production of shale oil and gas.  “We want to award the maximum possible amount of blocks in this process ... This pause has been useful for reflecting and gaining experience in a low price environment,” Velandia said. Canada-based Parex Resources and Gran Tierra, Chinese CNOOC’s unit Nexen Petroleum, Colombia’s Hocol, Repsol’s Talisman Energy, and U.S. Noble Energy qualified for the Sinu-San Jacinto auction. They will submit offers in the coming days, with results expected in early April, Velandia said. After completing the auction, Colombia expects to begin permanently offering blocks in a process similar to one  Brazil is planning this year. Colombia’s offer will include about two dozen onshore and offshore areas that can receive bids at any time. The new mechanism was approved last year and it will be tested in May. “Colombia’s priority is to develop its offshore (resources),” Velandia said. Nine permits granted to firms to study areas in the Caribbean Sea also plan to be converted into exploration and production contracts, doubling the offshore projects in that area, where big discoveries by firms including U.S. Anadarko Petroleum have been recently made. State-run company Ecopetrol plans to invest up to $4 billion in 2018, largely in exploration and production. Private firms in the country are expected to invest a further $4.5 billion to $4.9 billion.

2018-03-09,"NEW YORK/TORONTO (Reuters) - Higher oil prices and a positive earnings outlook for energy companies are expected to fuel a rebound in North American oil and gas initial public offerings in 2018, with bankers betting  investors will remain optimistic about the sector even if the broader stock market remains volatile. IPOs in the United States and Canada could reach their highest in four years, and oilfield services companies are seen leading the recovery, given their pressing capital needs. More than a dozen energy companies are lining up to list this year, including several private equity-backed U.S. exploration and production (E&P) companies.  Denham Capital-backed Covey Park Energy may be the first of these names, with initial conversations with investors planned in the next few weeks, followed by a formal deal marketing depending on investor response, two sources aware of the matter told Reuters. Indigo Natural Resources said Jan. 29 it had previously filed a confidential proposal with the Securities and Exchange Commission to go public, with timing dependent on market conditions. Vine Resources is also eying an IPO this year, while potential Canadian candidates include Canbriam Energy and Velvet Energy, two separate sources said. Warburg Pincus, one of the biggest private equity investors in the Canadian energy patch, backs both Canbriam and Velvet. Denham and Warburg declined to comment. Vine-backer Blackstone Group (BX.N) did not respond to requests for comment.  Access to equity markets for energy firms comes at an opportune time for private equity firms seeking to cash out of long-held investments. Investors are encouraged that crude prices have stayed above $60 a barrel even as drilling activity pushed U.S. oil output past 10 million barrels per day for the first time since 1970. Company fundamentals are also more resilient than 12 months ago, supporting the IPO pipeline. “The stability in oil prices is a net positive. If energy companies can demonstrate to investors that they can generate cash flow in the current oil price environment, they can go public,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking.     “The recent volatility hasn’t resulted in markets shutting down,” he added, suggesting equity markets were still open despite a 10-session period up to Feb. 8 when the S&P 500 dropped over 10 percent.     Still, experts said any selloff on the oil market that pushes crude prices below $60 could derail these plans to go public. After 20 IPOs worth $11.7 billion in 2014, the slump in oil from mid-2014 saw the subsequent three years raising just a combined $9.8 billion from 21 offerings, according to Thomson Reuters data. So far this year, five energy IPOs have raised $1.26 billion, according to Reuters calculations. Four of these five oilfield services IPOs had successful debuts, while IPSCO Tubulars pulled its offering due to the market selloff. Quintana Energy Services Inc (QES.N) priced its IPO below the guidance range and then saw its stock drop further upon opening. However, Cactus Inc (WHD.N) sold more shares than originally planned and traded higher on its first day. Unlike last year, when an initial flurry of energy IPOs was curtailed by a slump in crude prices, bankers hope stronger fundamentals will sustain interest in new offerings in 2018. Last year, services IPOs were based on forward earnings and lacked existing cash flows, meaning falling oil prices undermined investor confidence. “Now, companies are well supported by current earnings and trade at low multiples,” said Robert Santangelo, co-head of equity capital markets for the Americas at Credit Suisse. So far, exploration and production (E&P) companies have not shown the same willingness as services firms to accept a lower valuation that would restart offerings from that space, creating a “Mexican stand-off” between potential IPO candidates over who goes first, according to one energy banker who spoke on condition of anonymity. Covey has an incentive to go first: a financing agreement that becomes more expensive if it is not able to list this year, according to one of the sources aware of the IPO plans. Even as companies prepare for IPOs, M&A remains a viable exit option for buyout firms. “Private equity firms have been waiting for a better environment.

Aramco said in May 2017 it wanted to spend $18 billion in the next five years and was interested in adding petrochemical production capacity. The company’s 603,000 barrel per day plant at Port Arthur, Texas, is the largest refinery in the United States. “We’re evaluating investment, obviously.” Coffman said to reporters at the CERAWeek conference in Houston. “We’re looking at our options. Investing in petrochemicals, obviously, is one of things that’s on the books that we’re evaluating right now.” In response to a reporter’s question, Coffman said the possible impact of tariffs approved by President Donald Trump on an expansion was unknown. “Obviously it’s too early to tell that as well,” he said. “We don’t have the project approved.”  About the coming change to ultra-low maritime fuel in 2020, Coffman said those refineries with coking capacity would benefit the most. Cokers process residual crude, from which most maritime fuel is made. Cokers convert residual crude into fuel feedstocks or petroleum coke, a substitute for coal.

2018-03-09,"(Reuters) - U.S. energy companies this week cut oil rigs for the first time in seven weeks even as crude prices hovered near a three-year high, prompting more drillers to boost spending plans for 2018. Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to March 9, bringing the total count down to 796, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is much higher than a year ago when 617 rigs were active as energy companies have continued to boost spending since mid-2016 when crude prices began recovering from a two-year crash. U.S. crude futures CLc1 traded around $62 a barrel this week, close to levels hit in late January when prices rose to their highest since December 2014. That compares with averages of $50.85 in 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, futures were trading around $61 for the balance of 2018 CLBALst and $57 for calendar 2019 CLYstc1.

Cowen said those E&Ps that have reported spending plans for 2018 expected to spend a total of $80.5 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $72.4 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast the total oil and natural gas rig count would average 1,015 in 2018 and 1,128 in 2019.

2018-03-09,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday in Nairobi that he had shared his concerns with Kenya’s president about the importance of democracy and said the government should not stifle the media and threaten the courts. The Kenyan government shut down three television channels in January on the day opposition leader Raila Odinga took a symbolic presidential oath, then defied a court order to switch them back on. The stations had planned to live-stream the oath. “We believe that there are actions that need to be taken in Kenya and that they need to correct certain actions like shutting down independent TV stations and threatening the independence of the courts,” Tillerson told a news conference in the Kenyan capital.  “I know Kenya takes these matters seriously. A free and independent media is essential for safeguarding democracy and giving all Kenyans confidence in their government.” Asked at the news conference with Tillerson if Kenya could call itself a democracy in light of restrictions appeared intended to stifle dissent, Kenya’s foreign affairs minister, Monica Juma, said that “the notion that there is a restriction of the media is not backed by fact or reality. She said that only “three of more than 10s” of TV stations were temporarily shut down. The three stations taken off air reach the majority of viewers in the country.  In September, after Kenya’s Supreme Court overturned President Uhuru Kenyatta’s election victory and ordered a new poll, Kenyatta dismissed the judges as “wakora”, meaning “crooks” in Swahili. He also said the country had a “problem” with its judiciary that needed to be fixed. Tillerson, the top U.S. diplomat, praised Kenyatta and opposition leader Odinga for meeting on Friday and pledging to bring their people together after last year’s contentious and bloody elections. “All the credit” for the meeting went to the Kenyan political leaders, Tillerson said, in response to a question as to whether the U.S. had a role in organising it. As expected, Tillerson also emphasised the U.S. security partnership with Kenya and what he called “our shared fight against terrorism”. He said he would pay his respects on Saturday in Nairobi to victims of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 224 people. He also recognised the 4,000 Kenyan troops fighting al-Shabaab in Somalia as part of the African Union peacekeeping mission AMISOM.  Analysts say the Trump administration has focused mainly on security concerns in Africa at a time when China, Turkey and other nations are ramping up diplomatic and business links. “The U.S. is no longer the dominant external actor in Africa, and must compete for influence not only with China, but a host of other, increasingly assertive, states pursuing their own agendas, such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Turkey, Japan and India,” said EJ Hogendoorn, deputy Africa program director at the International Crisis Group think tank. At Tillerson’s two news conferences on Friday, in Djibouti and Nairobi, the typical arrangement for news conferences  involving the secretary and his counterpart in the host country were changed, American reporters travelling with Tillerson said. Typically, reporters with Tillerson and from the host country get to ask the same number of questions. But at both news conferences on Friday, the U.S. journalists were allowed only one question while local journalists in the two countries asked multiple questions. U.S. officials did not intervene to allow the U.S. journalists to ask questions, according to a Reuters witness.

2018-03-09,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. senators pushed President Donald Trump on Friday to be more nuanced in his approach to trade in the wake of his controversial decision to impose tariffs on most steel and aluminum imports. Republicans John Cornyn of Texas and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska made their remarks at an energy industry gathering in Houston, a day after Trump imposed tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent for aluminum, but exempted Canada and Mexico. The president offered the possibility of excluding other allies in the future. More politicians from both major U.S. political parties, as well as executives across industry sectors, have expressed concern that the tariffs could spark a global trade conflict and ravage the recovering U.S. economy.     Cornyn, Senate majority whip, advised Trump to be more “surgical” rather than treat most countries with the same approach. “I would hope that we would not treat every country like a one size fits all,” Cornyn said at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, one of the largest gatherings of energy industry executives. Murkowski, head of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the tariffs caught her by surprise and advised Trump: “Let’s be cautious here.” The tariffs, Murkowski said, “are not coming at a good time for us” given the materials that must be purchased to accomplish Trump’s push to spend more than $1 trillion to repair the U.S. infrastructure network. On Thursday, U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, a Republican of Arizona, said he would introduce a bill to nullify Trump’s tariffs, warning  that “Congress cannot be complicit as the administration courts economic disaster.” Cornyn and Murkowski advised Trump to seek better advice on trade and also communicate his decisions better.  Cornyn said he was “sorry to see” Gary Cohn resign this week as the president’s top economic adviser. He said economist Peter Navarro, another Trump adviser who favors protectionist measures and has been characterized as anti-China, “has a lot of wrong ideas when it comes to trade.” Murkowski said Trump and the White House must do a better job of making policy and communicating changes to Congress and the public. “I’m not one that believes that tweeting is a holistic communications strategy,” Murkowski told reporters after her speech. Trump regularly announces policy changes on the Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) social media platform.  The pair said they agreed with Trump that changes should be made to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), though both said they disagreed with scrapping the pact entirely.

2018-03-09,"ONITSHA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria’s immigration service has launched an investigation after two of its staff members were arrested on suspicion of trying to traffic girls out of the country, it said on Friday.  Thousands of girls are each year taken illegally out of Africa’s most populous country, where 70 percent of the 190 million inhabitants live on less than two dollars a day. A large proportion of them arrive in Europe. “We received information that two of our officers were arrested yesterday at Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, while trying to facilitate the trafficking of some underaged girls out of the country,” spokesman James Sunday said. “The comptroller general of immigration has been briefed about this and we have started investigations,” he added.  The spokesman did not say how many girls were involved, nor did he give their ages or say where they were allegedly being taken. The movement of people out of the country by criminal gangs, often by sea rather than air, has become a major problem for authorities in the west African country.  The British government says Nigeria is the fourth largest source of human trafficking to its shores and Nigerians are the largest national group among African migrants travelling to Libya and trying to cross from there to Italy in boats.  A report by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) published last year estimated that 80 percent of Nigerian girls arriving in Italy by sea might be trafficking victims.

2018-03-09,"* Domestic coal price for power stations capped at $70/T for 2 yrs * Indonesia is world’s top coal exporter * Pricing rule will be reviewed late next year * Miners can apply for 10 pct increase in output quotas * Domestic coal benchmark currently above $100/T (Adds comment from Adaro) By Wilda Asmarini and Fergus Jensen JAKARTA, March 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia has capped the price of domestic coal for power stations at $70 per tonne for two years, in new rules issued this week, a government spokesman said on Friday. The Southeast Asian nation is the world’s biggest exporter of the dirty fuel and the rules could hit miners currently enjoying coal prices at their highest level in five years. With elections looming in 2019, the government plans to keep electricity tariffs unchanged this year and next, and the cap on thermal coal for power is intended to shield state-owned utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) from price fluctuations. “The (maximum) price of coal ... for power stations is $70, fixed,” energy ministry spokesman Agung Pribadi told reporters on Friday at a news conference on the step and other new rules. That price is based on coal with a calorific value of 6,322 kilocalories, the same specification as in the Indonesian Coal Benchmark Price (HBA). The rule will be applied retroactively to Jan. 1, 2018, and will be reviewed in December 2019. Where the HBA drops below $70 per tonne, the domestic thermal coal price for power stations will revert to HBA, Pribadi said. The monthly HBA was set last week at $101.86 per tonne for the month of March, its highest since May, 2012. The new rule allows coal miners supplying PLN to apply for an increase to their approved production quota for the year of up to 10 percent. “Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Ignasius Jonan emphasises this setting of coal prices for power stations is so that electricity rates can be maintained, to protect people’s purchasing power and competitive industries,” Pribadi said. The rules are expected to generate savings of 18 trillion rupiah ($1.3 billion) for PLN if the HBA stays above $100 this year, PLN Strategic Procurement Director Supangkat Iwan Santoso told reporters. Under the new rules, PLN, which uses coal with a calorific value of between 4,200 and 4,500 kcal, will pay around $37 per tonne for coal while the HBA remains above $70, Santoso said. At the current HBA price, PLN pays around $55 per tonne, he added. PLN expects its coal demand to climb 18 percent this year to 90 million tonnes. The government has been working on plans to regulate domestic coal prices since late 2017, under pressure from PLN, and the discussions have knocked back some coal miners’ share prices. Over the past three months, the Indonesian mining share index has gained more than 22 percent, outperforming all other asset classes, and is up around 33 percent over the past year. But, in the past five days, the sector has fallen over 6 percent - more than any other. “We are still studying the impact (of the new rules). We want market prices,” said Indonesia Coal Mining Association Executive Director Hendra Sinadia. According to Suherman, corporate secretary for state-owned coal miner PT Bukit Asam, “the impact of the new price is not really significant on our target revenue and bottom line”. Adaro Energy, one of the biggest coal suppliers to PLN, will comply with the new rules, spokeswoman Febriati Nadira told Reuters by text message. “Of course, setting this price will impact contributions to the state and coal reserves for national energy security,” Nadira said, pointing to Adaro’s tax and royalty payments totalling $774 million in 2017. The government has said national coal output could reach 485 million tonnes in 2018, up from a realised output of 461 million tonnes in 2017. About a quarter of this - 118 million tonnes - is to be for domestic coal consumption, with the rest exported.

2018-03-09,"(Updates prices, changes comments, dateline from previous LONDON) * Crude prices rise after two days of losses * Wall Street up as wage data soothes inflation worries * Yen off as BOJ remains dovish By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - World stock markets advanced on Friday after U.S. job growth posted its biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years, but the U.S. dollar slipped against most peers except the yen as slowing wage gains indicated only a gradual increase in inflation this year. A planned meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, and Kim’s pledge to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests during the proposed talks, buoyed investor sentiment, boosting stocks in Asia and giving support to crude futures after two negative sessions for oil. Wall Street led global equity gains as the U.S. labor data landed in a sweet spot for stock investors. “The great news is the labor participation rate went up, the headline numbers are great, and the average hourly earnings has settled back down into consensus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. “It’s a great report across the board.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 288.05 points, or 1.16 percent, to 25,183.26, the S&P 500 gained 30.28 points, or 1.11 percent, to 2,769.25 and the Nasdaq Composite added 90.43 points, or 1.22 percent, to 7,518.37. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.32 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.80 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 1.06 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.91 percent higher, while Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.47 percent. The yen fell sharply versus the U.S. dollar after the Bank of Japan stuck to its dovish policy stance and as Kim’s denuclearization pledge boosted risk assets. Still, the greenback slipped against a basket of currencies as the slow U.S. wage gains supported a view that the Federal Reserve would not quicken its pace of raising interest rates. The Japanese yen weakened 0.66 percent versus the greenback at 106.93 per dollar. The dollar index fell 0.14 percent. The euro up 0.09 percent to $1.2321 while sterling was last trading at $1.3866, up 0.41 percent on the day. The Mexican peso gained 0.44 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.57. The Canadian dollar rose 0.54 percent versus the greenback at 1.28 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields advanced across the board after the strong jobs data. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.9048 percent, from 2.866 percent late on Thursday. The 30-year bond last fell 20/32 in price to yield 3.1655 percent, from 3.132 percent late on Thursday. “The headline (payrolls) print is sort of a shockingly strong number, the guts of the report are as good,” said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets in New York. U.S. crude rose 2.86 percent to $61.84 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.36, up 2.75 percent on the day. Spot gold added 0.1 percent to $1,322.72 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.12 percent to $1,323.30 an ounce. Copper rose 1.86 percent to $6,960.00 a tonne. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard

2018-03-09,"DUSHANBE, March 9 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan no longer objects to the construction of the world’s tallest dam in Tajikistan along a river shared by the two Central Asian nations, their presidents indicated after a meeting on Friday. Tashkent’s resistance - and its ability to put pressure on Dushanbe by disrupting the flow of goods into the impoverished country - has been one of the main risks for Tajikistan’s Rogun hydroelectric power plant project. Tajikistan hopes that Rogun, which it is building on the Vakhsh river, will help ease energy shortages and provide extra revenue by enabling power exports to Pakistan and Afghanistan after 2020. It awarded a $3.9 billion contract for dam construction to Italy’s Salini Impregilo in 2016, which started the work the same year. But Uzbekistan, which lies downstream, has long objected to the project, fearing it would disrupt the flow of water needed by Uzbek farmers. Tashkent has changed its position following the death of President Islam Karimov, its leader for 27 years, in 2016. Karimov’s successor, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, arrived in Tajikistan on Friday in a first official visit by an Uzbek president in 18 years. Karimov had only visited the neighbouring country for multilateral meetings since 2000. “We share the view that the existing hydropower facilities and those under construction will help resolve the region’s water and power issues,” Tajik leader Imomali Rakhmon told reporters after meeting Mirziyoyev. “In this regard, we welcome Uzbekistan’s support for the development of hydropower facilities in Tajikistan, including Rogun.” Mirziyoyev, in turn, said Uzbekistan would seek to boost the share of hydro power in its consumption by purchasing it from Tajikistan. “We will never leave our neighbours without water,” Rakhmon reassured him.

2018-03-09,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World shares up nearly 2 pct on week * Yen falls after BOJ, easing North Korean tensions * U.S. payrolls cools inflation fears By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - World shares hit their highest in over a week on Friday as a slowdown in wage gains in the United States helped cool fears about faster inflation and interest rate hikes this year. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries was up 0.7 percent on the day and 2 percent for the week, having also been buoyed by news Donald Trump and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un planned to meet by May. Nonfarm payrolls jumped by 313,000 jobs last month, data from the U.S. Labor Department showed, recording their biggest increase in more than 1-1/2 years. But average hourly earnings edged up only four cents, or 0.1 percent, to $26.75 which was a slowdown from the 0.3 percent rise in January. That also lowered the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in January. U.S. stocks gained after the data, with both the benchmark S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average each up 1 percent. “The great news is the labor participation rate went up, the headline numbers are great, and the average hourly earnings has settled back down into consensus,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at Wunderlich Securities in New York. “It’s a great report across the board and I think that moves markets higher.” Upbeat jobs data last month, particularly a stronger than expected rise in wages, fanned speculation about faster interest rate rises in the United States, causing a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at least three times this year, with some analysts even expecting four. The pan-European STOXX 600 index jumped to a session high. It was last up 0.5 percent, and Britain’s FTSE 100 rose 0.3 percent to a session high. Shares in Asia, which staged sharp rallies after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was prepared to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, potentially marking a major breakthrough in nuclear tensions between the two countries. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent and South Korean stocks gained more than 1 percent. In currencies, the Japanese yen was the biggest mover, falling more than half a percent against the dollar to its lowest in over a week following the news on North Korea. The drop was partly a anti safe-haven move but also followed a Bank of Japan meeting where it kept monetary policy unchanged and gave no hint of ending its massive stimulus drive. The yen has gained 7 percent against the dollar since the start of the year on concerns that the outbreak of a trade war would derail a global growth recovery. “We are trying to find a bottom on dollar/yen and the other thing to watch for is when the typical year-end repatriation flows that are made by Japanese institutions for the fiscal year end abates, and that might push dollar/yen even higher,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale. Despite its 0.6 percent individual gain on the yen, the dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was down 0.1 percent due to weakness against the Canadian dollar, the pound to a lesser extent the euro. Crude oil futures rose. U.S. crude rose 1.75 percent to $61.18 per barrel, and Brent crude futures rose 1.7 percent to $64.70 per barrel. Spot gold eased 0.1 percent to $1,320.16 per ounce, extending losses into a third session as demand for safe havens lessened. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-03-09,"PRAGUE/SOFIA (Reuters) - Czech utility CEZ (CEZP.PR) and Inercom agreed to study the possibility of the Bulgarian state taking a stake in assets that CEZ is selling to the small Bulgarian solar energy producer, CEZ said on Friday. CEZ signed a contract in February to sell a power distributor that provides electricity to over three million Bulgarians, together with other assets in Bulgaria, to Inercom for an estimated 320 million euros ($394 million). But Bulgaria’s government said last week it wanted a controlling stake in the assets after the deal prompted concerns across the political spectrum in Bulgaria that strategic energy assets were passing into the hands of owners which little was known about. CEZ said on Friday that Inercom representatives had asked if the Bulgarian state could take a role in the asset sale. “Although the Bulgarian government did not officially show interest in the sale process which was running last year, CEZ will comply with its business partner’s wishes and will examine this possibility,” it said in a statement. Both sides agreed to study the impact of the Bulgarian state taking a role in the transaction, CEZ said, adding that negotiations would continue in the coming weeks. Inercom, with assets of around 100 million levs ($63 million), is set to acquire a business with annual turnover of about 1.8 billion levs.  Last month, Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov urged the central bank and intelligence services to look into the deal. A week ago, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said Bulgaria’s government wanted a stake in CEZ’s Bulgarian assets. However, he, as well as Delyan Dobrev, head of the parliamentary energy commission, said later they did not think the government should get involved, as the state has enough instruments to control energy distribution companies. Goranov said this was his personal view. Energy prices are politically sensitive in the EU’s poorest member state, and a spike in electricity bills in 2013 toppled Borissov’s first government.      Inercom said on Friday it would be up to CEZ to decide whether to start talks between the companies and the Bulgarian state over a potential government involvement in the sale. In written responses to Reuters, Milena Stoeva, chair of the board of directors of Inercom Bulgaria, declined to reveal the value of the deal but said the company has made firm commitments to close the transaction and planned to deliver on them. Addressing concerns about the financing of the deal, Inercom said that it is holding talks with several global banks and that no offshore companies would take any part in the transaction.   The company said it has never discussed the financing of the deal with Russian banks and said it was ready to commit significant equity for the deal, but did not elaborate. Bulgarian Mane Capital is Inercom’s financial adviser. “Since signing the contract, the negotiations with the banks are progressing well,” she said, declining to name them. CEZ has taken Bulgaria to arbitration seeking hundreds of millions of euros for failing to protect its energy investments in the country and the ongoing case will complicate any eventual involvement of the state in CEZ’s assets. Hundreds of protesters, backed by opposition Socialists, rallied in Sofia on Wednesday demanding the centre-right cabinet stop the sale of CEZ’s assets.

2018-03-09,"LONDON/SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Falling industrial demand and mild weather have turned China’s energy giants into sellers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia for the first time since last year’s massive import spree. Chinese players were on the receiving end of last year’s doubling of LNG prices, largely driven by their rapid shift to gas to combat coal smog as well as elevated regional demand for the fuel. Although a CNOOC executive last week warned producers not to expect a similar payday in 2018, industry executives said they were not unduly concerned by the blip, saying Chinese demand would continue to grow. However, some traders were caught off guard by the speed of the demand downturn in the run-up to and aftermath of China’s Lunar New Year holidays last month, with three cargoes now on offer. LNG producer profits soared in tandem with spot prices hitting three-year highs above $11 per mmBtu as China’s buying spree peaked in December and January. But a slump set in as milder weather settled over Japan and other major gas consumers in the region and expectations that Chinese buyers returning from the Lunar New Year break would take up the slack fell through. Plunging demand turned national oil companies (NOCs) like CNOOC, Sinopec and PetroChina into sellers and they are now offering cargoes for late March and April delivery, trade sources said. Meanwhile, spot LNG prices have sunk to the mid $8 per mmBtu LNG-AS range. “The heating season is almost over and some buyers are getting more balanced, including small buyers so yes, Chinese companies have cargoes for offer,” a source at one said. LNG industry executives are unfazed, despite China’s role in reviving global cargo trade and boosting prices. “We expect LNG demand to continue to grow in China this year,” Royal Dutch Shell’s Steve Hill said on Friday, citing the government’s commitment to cutting back on coal. The brunt of China’s 2017 coal-to-gas programme has yet to play through as the delayed effect of last year’s switching meant the impact on demand was limited to six weeks, said Hill, who is responsible for Shell’s global LNG and trading business. However, Zheng Hongtao, vice president of trading at CNOOC Gas and Power, said LNG producers ought to rethink bullish 2018 forecasts and take into account factors such as pipeline outages, which drove up China’s LNG demand this winter. Daily shortfalls in piped gas deliveries from central Asia meant CNOOC and CNPC had to purchase 2-3 million tonnes of LNG equivalent supply via LNG spot markets, Hongtao said. “Without these emergent 2-3 million tonnes what would have been the (spot LNG) price?” he said. After exceeding quotas for converting households from coal to gas, Chinese provinces have plans to moderate the pace of conversions, which alongside ambitious targets to boost domestic gas output, could take pressure off LNG imports. Stabilising pipeline imports would also add relief. The frenzied build-out of gas demand last year sparked criticism of the central government after supply shortages ensued, prices rose and residents froze, making a repeat highly unlikely, LNG industry sources acknowledge. Hongtao said efforts to contain LNG demand are underway. “From one terminal in China we sold 400 LNG truck-loads, or 8,000 tonnes of LNG per day (this winter).” “Over the Chinese New Year we sold 80 trucks, or 1,600 tonnes per day... now it has recovered but is still less than half,” he said last week, adding it showed the changeability of China’s gas market.

2018-03-09," LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco’s [IPO-ARAM.SE] partial privatisation has loomed over the oil market for the last two years, influencing expectations about oil prices, but what if it never happens? The possibility of selling a minority stake in the giant oil company was first mentioned in a newspaper interview published in January 2016 by then-Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The possibility merited little more than a brief mention in a section about economic reforms, diversification and privatisation of state assets. (“Interview with Muhammad bin Salman”, Economist, Jan. 6, 2016). But this passing reference has spawned an enormous amount of activity from consultants, bankers, stock exchanges, governments and journalists all competing to benefit from the sale of the century. Saudi Aramco has reportedly prepared a set of corporate accounts to international standards and commissioned an external audit of its oil reserves ready for investors. The pending sale has triggered a scramble among stock exchanges, including in the United States, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, to secure a slice of the listing, with each receiving government backing. Technical preparations for a sale appear to have been largely completed over the last two years but the actual date for any sale has been repeatedly pushed back. The decision on whether, where and when to list shares lies with the government rather than Aramco, which means that it is in the hands of the newly promoted crown prince. But there is still no timeline for a decision, let alone an actual listing, and the timetable now appears to have slipped into 2019. Saudi policymakers have indicated shares will be listed on the domestic stock exchange but there is in fact no firm commitment to list them internationally. The government has a range of options, from a domestic-only listing, a private sale of shares to a strategic partner, an international listing, or some combination of any of these three. The longer the decision is delayed, the more likely it is that the sale will not occur, or will be scaled back to a listing on the domestic stock market.  Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2tvQ0GW It would not be the first time that a major strategic initiative has been substantially modified or quietly dropped. Saudi Arabia’s gas initiative was launched in 1998, another point when oil prices had slumped and the kingdom’s finances were under pressure. The gas initiative was part of a broader package of reforms aimed at diversifying the economy, reducing the role of the government and increasing the involvement of the private sector. The initiative attracted significant interest from international oil firms but meandered for several years without making progress before being quietly shelved around 2002. The question is whether the partial privatisation of Saudi Aramco will meet the same fate. Reform efforts in Saudi Arabia tend to be cyclical. Slumping oil prices and revenues push diversification and privatisation onto the political agenda, only for momentum to be lost when prices recover. Like the gas initiative, the proposal to sell shares in Aramco was made when prices were at cyclical lows, in early 2016. Now oil prices are recovering, the imperative to privatise is fading. From the very beginning, the rationale for selling shares in Aramco has never been clear. Part-privatising Aramco could lead to improvements in corporate governance. The deputy crown prince mentioned improving transparency and countering possible corruption as reasons in his interview. Selling shares on the domestic stock exchange could provide a means of giving more ordinary Saudis a sense of ownership and spur the development of a domestic financial services industry. Selling shares could be the first step towards a much more ambitious diversification of government assets and revenues away from the oil sector. Or it could simply be a revenue-raising exercise. The plan was mooted when government revenues were at a low point, the budget was running a heavy deficit and financial reserves were falling rapidly. The sale has always been controversial within Aramco itself, and in parts of Saudi society, with many people quietly questioning whether it makes sense. (“As Saudis prepare to sell shares in oil giant, some have misgivings”, Reuters, Feb. 24, 2017). Aramco leaders and employees bristle at the suggestion the company has been badly run, arguing that it is in fact one of the best-managed institutions in the kingdom. Selling shares on the domestic stock market or to foreigners could reduce the benefits of oil wealth for lower-income Saudis if it caused the diversion of funds to already-wealthy Saudi and foreign owners. Critics fear the decision to sell shares when oil prices are near the bottom of the cycle would undervalue the company. Finally, the sale is arguably too small to achieve meaningful diversification or raise significant sums of money for the government. Selling 5 percent of the company is not enough to achieve meaningful reduction in the government’s dependence on oil. Even if the sale valued the company at $2 trillion, as the crown prince has said it is worth, the sale of 5 percent for $100 billion would not raise enough money to make much of a difference. The kingdom still has foreign reserves worth almost $500 billion and an extra $100 billion would not be nearly enough to fund the ambitious social and economic transformation projects outlined by the government. As oil prices have risen, the government's budget deficit has narrowed and the kingdom's foreign reserves have stabilised. (tmsnrt.rs/2tvQ0GW) The kingdom has sought other sources of financing, including expropriating assets as part of the anti-corruption campaign, which the government hopes will raise $100 billion. As oil revenues grow again, the benefits from the sale will start to seem less compared with the inevitable problems and costs, making an eventual sale less likely. That said, the prospect of a sale has enabled the kingdom to drum up significant interest from bankers and professional services firms. And it has also allowed it to play off governments including the United States and Britain. With so many keen suitors, Saudi is likely to keep its options open for as long as possible, and is unlikely to shut the door on an international sale completely. Still, its leaders appear to be in no hurry to commit to a timetable or venue. In the end, they might settle for a simpler domestic listing, with or without the sale of a small strategic stake to an international investor. Ultimately, the decision will be taken by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, and on this issue, he appears to be in no rush.

2018-03-09,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday she was against nationwide schemes to let cleaner diesel cars operate in cities that restrict their use, saying municipalities should find individual ways to cut emissions. A German court ruled in February that cities can ban the most polluting diesel vehicles from their streets. Many German cities exceed European Union limits on atmospheric nitrogen oxide, known to cause respiratory diseases.  Speaking after talks with business leaders in the Bavarian capital, Munich, Merkel said the court decision was “very balanced”. But diesel technology was still needed while Germany shifts to greener options, she said. Some officials back a proposal to put blue badges on cleaner diesel vehicles equipped with the latest emissions technology. They could then be used even in cities that have introduced driving bans. But Merkel opposed that scheme. “Using identifiers nationwide like a blue badge as a first step would ease the pressure to find customized, relevant and specific solutions tailored to the individual city, and that’s what we’re prioritizing,” she said. The court made clear that uniform nationwide rules on diesel pollution are not necessary. Municipalities and federal states need to take action, Merkel said, and the national government would also do its part and also make the issue a priority. She suggested retrofitting local public transport. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since leading German carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests. The scandal has spread across the industry and boosted investment in electric vehicles. “Of course the automobile industry has a duty to make good on what it neglected in terms of software and to meet its commitments because mistakes have been made,” Merkel said.

2018-03-09,"CARACAS (Reuters) - U.S. philosopher Noam Chomsky and Hollywood star Danny Glover joined other activists on Friday in condemning U.S. and Canadian sanctions on Venezuela’s socialist government, saying they hurt the poor and torpedoed political reconciliation.  The two high-profile activists were among 154 signatories of an open letter to the Washington and Ottawa governments urging them to reconsider recent measures to pressure President Nicolas Maduro’s administration.  The United States and Canada have slapped individual sanctions on a handful of Venezuelan officials, including Maduro, over accusations of corruption, democratic abuses and human rights violations. The measures include freezing assets and preventing U.S. and Canadian nationals from dealing with them. The U.S. government has also imposed financial measures, intended to stop Venezuela from contracting new debt, and is considering oil sanctions. While critics say sanctions are aimed only at Venezuela’s “dictatorship”, Maduro says they are part of an international right-wing conspiracy intended to topple him and take control of the OPEC nation’s oil wealth.  “We are deeply concerned by the use of illegal sanctions, whose effect falls most heavily on the poorest and most marginal sectors of society, to coerce political and economic change in a sister democracy,” the letter said.  “Sanctions merely complicate efforts by the Vatican, Dominican Republic, and other international actors to mediate a resolution to the deep polarization in Venezuela.”    Former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez used to enjoy high-profile support from a raft of leftist personalities, but his successor Maduro has seen foreign opinion harden against him, particularly during opposition protests last year. “It is no secret that Venezuela — unlike Mexico, Honduras, Colombia, Egypt, or Saudi Arabia — is targeted for regime change by the U.S. precisely because of Venezuela’s leadership in resisting U.S. hegemony and the imposition of the neo-liberal model in Latin America,” the activists’ letter said.  Opposition supporters say Western celebrities are ingenuous in supporting Venezuela’s leftist government without understanding how its policies have spawned malnutrition, disease, and mass emigration.

2018-03-09,"(Adds reaction from implicated person, political parties) By Pedro Fonseca RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9 (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Friday served fresh search warrants in a new phase of the so-called “Car Wash” investigation that targeted a former cabinet minister and a consortium accused of corruption relating to construction of the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam. Federal police said in a statement they were serving nine search warrants in the states of Parana and Sao Paulo. Police have alleged that the Norte Energia SA consortium of companies made illegal payments to government officials and politicians to win the contract to build the dam, which has been in operation since 2016. A target of the raids is Antonio Delfim Netto, who served as Brazil’s finance, agriculture and planning minister during different administrations. He is also a former congressman, federal prosecutors said in a separate statement. Netto is accused of accepting bribes in connection with the contract to build the dam. In a statement, his attorneys denied any wrongdoing. The values received by Netto were fees for consultancy services, they said, referring to the bribery claims. Illegal payments were also allegedly made by the construction firms to political parties, including the Workers’ Party and President Michel Temer’s Brazilian Democratic Movement party, prosecutors said. Norte Energia did not have an immediate comment. The Workers’ Party said the prosecutor’s accusations were baseless and politically motivated in an election year. The Brazilian Democratic Movement party denied receiving bribes from the Norte Energia consortium. The investigation said that the companies responsible for building Belo Monte were “expected to pay bribes to political parties and their representatives equal to 1 percent of the value of the contract.” The Belo Monte dam on the Xingu River in the north of Brazil will have installed capacity of 11,233 megawatts when all generating units are turned on, according to Norte Energia’s website. That would be enough to supply electricity to 60 million people, it said.

2018-03-09,"BANGKOK, March 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A Lithuanian artist has carved a giant SOS message into an Indonesian palm oil plantation to draw attention to the damage done by deforestation. Ernest Zacharevic curated the ‘Save our Souls’ project as part of a campaign on the impact palm oil plantations have on tribal communities and endangered species such as the orangutan. “We, as consumers, are so detached from the source of our commodities that we are no longer able to see the consequences of our daily choices,” Zacharevic told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by email. “I wanted to communicate the magnitude of the problem.” The giant SOS signal, which he completed last month, runs for about a half-kilometre inside a plantation in North Sumatra, and can be seen from the air. The land will be replanted with native tree species, he said. Environmentalists say land-clearing for agricultural plantations in Indonesia, the world’s biggest palm oil producer, is responsible for forest destruction. Forest cover has dropped by nearly a quarter since 1990, according to World Bank data. Zacharevic’s SOS comes amid growing pressure on corporations to adopt sustainable practices. PepsiCo and British cosmetics firm Lush have committed to ending the use of palm oil - which is found in products from soap to cereal - or ensuring their supply is ethical. Last month, consumer goods giant Unilever said it had laid bare its palm oil supply chain to boost transparency. Indonesia has been a focus of global efforts to rein in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the deforestation of swampy, carbon-rich peatlands to make way for plantations for industries such as palm oil, pulp and paper. These forests are often in remote areas long inhabited by indigenous peoples, who might not have documents proving ownership or be able to contest land acquisitions in the resource-rich Southeast Asian nation.. The forests are also home to dwindling wildlife populations. There are only about 14,600 orangutans remaining in the wild in Sumatra, conservationists estimate. The Splash and Burn campaign - a play on the slash and burn method used to clear forests for plantations - is supported by the Sumatran Orangutan Society, a charity, and Lush. “We are all contributing to the destructive effects of unsustainable palm oil, whether it is by consuming products or supporting policies that affect the trade,” Zacharevic said. “This project is an effort to appeal to the consciousness of a wider audience.” (Reporting by Rina Chandran @rinachandran.

2018-03-09,"ANKARA/ISTANBUL, March 9 (Reuters) - Turkey’s first nuclear power plant is likely to miss its 2023 target start-up date as Russian builder Rosatom struggles to find local partners, two people familiar with the matter said. The $20 billion project is part of President Tayyip Erdogan’s “2023 vision” marking 100 years since the founding of modern Turkey. Rosatom is looking at four Turkish companies as possible partners, but little progress has been made so far, said one of the sources, both of whom declined to be identified because the information is not yet public. Rosatom said last month it was in talks with state-owned power producer EUAS after a deal with a consortium of three firms collapsed. “Concrete progress has not been made in the talks so far, and this includes EUAS from the government side,” one source said, adding that Rosatom was keen to have a government entity such as EUAS as a shareholder. Rosatom is looking for Turkish partners to take a 49 percent stake in the planned Akkuyu nuclear plant in southern Turkey. But the government is wary of EUAS taking on the 49 percent stake by itself. “A 49 percent stake still means $10 billion of funding even if it’s spread over years,” the source said. “It is a very big project, there are many details and issues that need to be worked on. We can’t expect this to be resolved soon.” The project is to be financed by Rosatom and its partners and will involve loans from export-import agencies and banks, Anastasia Polovinkina, director of Rosatom affiliate Rusatom Energy International told a conference in June 2017. The 4,800 megawatt Akkuyu plant is a intended to reduce Turkey’s dependence on energy imports but has been beset by delays since Russia was awarded the contract in 2010. But Turkish companies have been put off by the size of the financing required as well as by concerns they will not receive a sufficient share of the lucrative construction side of the deal, two industry sources said. The firms are also worried that the guaranteed electricity price could eventually be lowered, reducing future revenue, they said. Rosatom did not respond to a request for comment. Officials for EUAS and the government declined to comment. Rosatom last year said it would sell 49 percent of Akkuyu Nukleer AS, the company which will build and operate the plant, to a consortium made up of Kolin Insaat, Kalyon Insaat and Cengiz Holding - Turkish firms that have been awarded major infrastructure projects under Erdogan. However, the final agreement was never signed and Rosatom said Kolin and Kalyon had decided to pull out of the project. Cengiz remains as a contractor and Rosatom said last month that the two were in talks regarding other “partnership options”. Rosatom has said it expects to find new investors for the project this year, adding that could be a single investor for the entire 49 percent or several firms taking smaller stakes. At a November news conference with Erdogan, Russian President Vladimir Putin re-affirmed the 2023 launch for the plant’s first reactor, and said construction would begin in the near future. However, Rosatom has still not received a full construction licence from Turkey’s atomic energy authority. “Construction time for the plant is seven years. Even if it receives the licence today, the 2023 target is not very realistic,” one of the sources familiar with the matter said.

2018-03-09,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World shares up nearly 2 pct on week * Yen falls after BOJ, easing North Korean tensions * U.S. payrolls data in focus By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, March 9 (Reuters) - World shares hit a one-week high on Friday before easing a touch, as caution ahead of jobs data in the United States outweighed a potential breakthrough in nuclear tensions over the Korean peninsula. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries was flat on the day, but set for a weekly gain of almost 2 percent. Wall Street futures indicated a positive open. Investors’ focus was mainly on the U.S. jobs report due at 1330 GMT. Upbeat jobs data last month, particularly a stronger than expected rise in wages, fanned speculation about faster interest rate rises in the United States, causing a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities. The consensus expectation for average hourly earnings for the month is for a 0.2 percent increase, while the headline non-farm payrolls is seen to have grown by 200,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. “It’s expected to drop a little to 2.8 percent (year-on- year), which is still up there with the highest we’ve seen since the financial crisis, but if it can go above 3 percent, rate hike expectations could start to tick up again,” said OANDA analyst Craig Erlam. The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates at least three times this year, with some analysts even expecting four. After opening lower, pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.1 percent by 1244 GMT. Germany’s DAX was down 0.4 percent, while Britain’s FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent. Gains for world stocks, however, came largely from shares in Asia, which staged sharp rallies after U.S. President Donald Trump said he was prepared to meet North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, potentially marking a major breakthrough in nuclear tensions between the two countries. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.5 percent and South Korean stocks gained more than 1 percent. News that the United States is pressing ahead with tariffs on steel and aluminium imports did not seem to rattle investors as much as the initial proposals for them did last week. “So far the tariffs are mainly symbolic, as imports of steel and aluminium only account for 2 percent of total imports of goods in the U.S. and it remains our base case that this is not going to evolve into a full-blown global trade war, as it would hurt everyone economically,” strategists at Danske Bank wrote in a research note. In currencies, the Japanese yen was the biggest mover, falling more than half a percent against the dollar to its lowest in over a week following the news on North Korea. The drop followed the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting, where it kept monetary policy unchanged and stuck to its upbeat view of the economy. The yen has gained 7 percent against the dollar since the start of the year on concerns that the outbreak of a trade war would derail a global growth recovery. “We are trying to find a bottom on dollar/yen and the other thing to watch for is when the typical year-end repatriation flows that are made by Japanese institutions for the fiscal year end abates, and that might push dollar/yen even higher,” said Kenneth Broux, a currency strategist at Societe Generale. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.1 percent on the day. The euro was down 0.1 percent. Rising protectionism was a risk cited on Thursday by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank’s latest policy meeting. While the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding the bank’s stimulus. Crude oil futures rose. U.S. crude rose 1 percent to $60.71 per barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 1.2 percent to $64.36 per barrel. Spot gold eased 0.2 percent to $1,319.16 per ounce, extending losses into a third session as demand for safe havens lessened. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-03-09," LONDON (Reuters) - The platinum industry has been waiting for fuel-cell cars to lift demand for years. Now, just as the technology finally looks to be gaining traction, carmakers are finding ways to slash the amount of the expensive metal used. Cars using fuel cells, which generate electricity through a chemical reaction using hydrogen as a fuel and platinum as a catalyst, comprise just a small fraction of an electric-vehicle market dominated by battery power. Both technologies have their advantages, but a big obstacle to a wider rollout of fuel-cell vehicles has been a lack of hydrogen refuelling infrastructure. Now, however, plans are underway to build networks in the United States, Germany, Japan and, most significantly, the world’s biggest car market, China. A number of major carmakers are building fuel-cell cars, but they are radically reducing the amount of platinum used - meaning the technology may not deliver the surge in demand for the metal that has long been flagged by some platinum producers and analysts. The companies’ efforts are driven by cost; even at its current historically low price level, platinum is still an expensive ingredient. At spot prices XPT=, the 30-60 grams of the metal it can take to power a mid-range fuel-cell car may cost more than $1,800. The amount needed for a diesel autocatalyst, in comparison, is worth just over $200 at the top end. (For a graphic showing How platinum and other metals are used in fuel cells, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2t4Z7J9) Craig Scott, director of the advanced technologies group at Japan’s Toyota (7203.T), said the amount of the metal used in fuel cells - “platinum loading” - was falling across the industry, and could go further. Toyota’s Mirai, prices for which start at just over $58,000 in the United States, is the world’s best-selling fuel-cell car. “We have been making steady progress to reduce platinum loading,” he said. The company is targeting further cuts “that would result in levels below 50 percent of today”, he added. He declined to give a precise figure for the amount of platinum used in Toyota’s fuel cells, citing commercial sensitivities. Daimler’s new fuel-cell model, the Mercedes GLC F-Cell, already uses 90 percent less platinum than its previous fuel cell model, the B-Class F-Cell, which was launched in 2009. The automaker (DAIGn.DE) has reduced the size of its fuel-cell system by around one-third. “The latest model uses tens of grams per vehicle,” Dr. Joerg Wind, manager of energy systems analyses at the German carmaker, told an industry gathering in Tokyo last week. Wind said techniques such as increasing the platinum surface area used in catalysts could cut the amount of the metal needed in fuel-cell stacks. Japan’s Honda (7267.T) and Germany’s Audi (NSUG.DE) have said they are also looking into reducing the amount of platinum they use in their fuel-cell vehicles, though they did not specify by how much. However, eradicating platinum entirely from fuel cells is not currently viable, according to researchers. The large platinum reductions in fuel cells come at a time of uncertainty over the wider demand outlook for the metal in the auto industry, which accounts for more than 40 percent of consumption of the metal globally. Platinum is primarily used in catalytic converters, with the heaviest loadings seen in diesel-engine cars. Diesel’s market share has been shrinking in its main market Europe following the Volkswagen emissions scandal of 2015. The scandal raised consumer awareness of diesel’s high emissions of nitrogen oxides, which can contribute to breathing problems and smog. In a further blow, a court in Berlin ruled last week that some German cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars. Fuel-cell technology is still hugely overshadowed by battery power; globally over 1 million pure battery electric cars had been sold by 2016, the last year for which full figures are available, versus just 6,500 fuel-cell vehicles by the end of last year. Advocates of fuel-cell technology say it is the greenest form of transportation available, emitting only clean water - though critics point out that producing hydrogen itself is energy intensive. Fuel-cell vehicles are quicker to refuel than battery-powered cars, and typically have a longer range. In a major boost to fuel-cell technology, China last month rolled out plans to promote take-up, including hydrogen refuelling capacity. The Chinese push could lift fuel cells’ share of platinum automotive demand to as much as 5 percent by 2025, from less than 1 percent today, according to materials specialist Johnson Matthey. Johann Wiebe, lead analyst at precious metals consultancy GFMS, pointed to research from Stanford University that suggests platinum could be substituted for cobalt in some fuel-cell technology in development - though cobalt COB-CATH-LON too is becoming pricier due to demand from battery makers, hitting near-decade highs this year after surging 150 percent in 2017. Despite the search for substitutes, cutting platinum entirely from vehicle fuel cells currently doesn’t look commercially feasible, Wiebe said. In the meantime, thriftiness continues. “You need to get the costs down,” he said. “The aim is to get it down to around 10 grams - the eventual goal, however, is for fuel cells not to contain more platinum than a standard autocatalyst, which is ... approximately three grams.” “That would be a sizeable downward thrift.” Reporting by Jan Harvey in London; Additional reporting by Naomi Tajitsu in Tokyo; Editing by Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/platinum-fuelcells/analysis-platinums-fuel-cell-car-bonanza-proves-elusive-idUKL5N1QO3TC,09 Mar 2018,* Graphic-Platinum use in fuel cells: http://tmsnrt.rs/2t4Z7J9,ANALYSIS-Platinum's fuel-cell car bonanza proves elusive
2018-03-09,"* Move comes as U.S. slaps tariffs on steel, aluminium imports * Call is most explicit yet from China in trade spat * U.S. has accused China of dumping excess metal for years * China should target ags, coal and tech -metals associations * Threat aimed at coal sector, major supporter of Trump (Updating to recast) SHANGHAI/BEIJING, March 9 (Reuters) - China’s metals industry issued the country’s most explicit threat yet in an escalating trade spat with the United States, urging Beijing to retaliate by targeting coal and other sectors that are key to U.S. President Donald Trump’s support base. Two leading industry bodies representing producers in the world’s top steel and aluminium market said they strongly oppose duties imposed by Trump to counter cheap imports, especially from China. Trump slapped 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium on Thursday. The metals associations urged the government to take “resolute measures” against U.S. imports ranging from stainless steel to coal and electronics. A widely read tabloid said in an editorial China would not be bullied by threats of a trade war with the world’s largest economy and its main trading partner. The Ministry of Commerce said the nation would assess any damage caused by the U.S. move and “firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests.” It urged the United States to withdraw the measures as quickly as possible. The ramping up of rhetoric is a big shift away from the conciliatory tone struck in recent weeks when Chinese President Xi Jinping’s top economic adviser, Liu He, visited Washington for trade talks. The tactics suggested by the industry associations were the first time coal has been drawn into the spat, signalling that China has more options in its arsenal if the dispute descends into an all-out trade war. The threat also strikes at another sector central to Trump’s political base and an election pledge to restore American industries and blue-collar jobs. “I think the purpose of mentioning coal is more like a warning that China could also take measures on U.S. products,” said Wang Fei, coal analyst at Huaan Futures. When Beijing launched a probe last month into imports of U.S. sorghum, a grain used in animal feed and liquor, it was viewed as a warning shot that Beijing was ready to target farm states that voted for Trump. China has ramped up imports of U.S. coal over the past year, as its utilities have sought cheaper foreign fuel. That has helped to revive the fortunes of the U.S. coal industry, but the tonnage is not seen as critical to China’s power sector. In 2017, U.S. coal imports totalled 3.2 million tonnes, worth about $420 million and nearly five times the 694 tonnes taken in the previous year. The dispute has also fuelled concern that soybeans, the United States’ most valuable export to the world’s No. 2 economy, might be caught up in tit-for-tat trade actions. Experts say Beijing may not be ready to deploy that tactic, though, given China’s reliance on imports of the oilseed to make animal feed for its vast livestock sector. CHINA TO MEET TRADE WAR THREAT ‘HEAD-ON’ Trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies have risen since Trump took office. China accounts for only a small fraction of U.S. steel imports, but its massive industrial expansion has helped create a global glut of steel that has driven down prices. “Trump’s behaviour is a challenge to the global steel industry and will definitely encounter opposition from more countries,” the China Iron & Steel Association (CISA) said in a statement on its website. CISA appealed for “resolute measures” against imports of U.S. products, including stainless steel, galvanized sheet, seamless pipe, coal, agriculture products and electronic products. Its comments were echoed in a separate statement by the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. In an editorial on Friday, the Global Times said China would not be bullied by Trump’s threat of a trade war. “If the U.S. cannot adjust its own industrial structure to reduce its trade deficit and orders the world to follow its words, China and the rest of the world will have no choice but to meet the challenge head-on.” (Reporting by Adam Jourdan and Ruby Lian in SHANGHAI and Josephine Mason in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Muyu Xu; Editing by Richard Pullin and Tom Hogue)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-trade-steel/update-3-china-metal-producers-urge-beijing-to-retaliate-on-u-s-tariffs-idUKL4N1QR0A2,09 Mar 2018,"* Move comes as U.S. slaps tariffs on steel, aluminium

2018-03-09,"(Changes slug, adds background and Russian foreign minister comments) DJIBOUTI, March 9 (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take some weeks to arrange, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday. Trump said on Thursday he was prepared to meet Kim in what would be the first face-to-face encounter between any leaders of the two countries. It potentially marks a major breakthrough in easing tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons programme. “President Trump has said for some time that he was open to talks and he would willingly meet with Kim when conditions were right,” Tillerson said. “And I think in the president’s judgment that time has arrived now.” The decision was made by the president himself, Tillerson said during a visit to Djibouti. “Now it’s a question of agreeing on the timing of the first meeting between the two of them, and that will take some weeks before we get all that worked out.” Trump has derided Kim as a “maniac”, referred to him as “little rocket man”, and threatened in a speech to the United Nations last year to “totally destroy” North Korea if it attacked the United States or one of its allies. Kim responded by calling the U.S. president a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard”. Trump’s aides have been wary of North Korea’s diplomatic overtures because of its history of reneging on international commitments and the failure of efforts on disarmament by previous U.S. administrations. Some U.S. officials and experts worry North Korea could buy time to build up and refine its nuclear arsenal if it drags out talks with Washington. Tillerson said the United States was surprised at how “forward-leaning” Kim was in his conversations with a visiting South Korean delegation. He said it was the strongest indication to date of Kim’s “not just willingness but really his desire for talks”. Kim has committed to denuclearisation and to suspending nuclear and missile tests, South Korea’s National Security Office head Chung Eui-yong said on Thursday after briefing Trump on a meeting South Korean officials held with Kim earlier this week. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, called on the United States and North Korea to hold talks as soon as possible, saying that at a news briefing in Beijing on Thursday that things “will not be smooth sailing”. Russia believes that a possible meeting between Trump and Kim “is a step in the right direction”, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters while on a visit to Ethiopia.

2018-03-09,"LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to London will turn to defence and security on Friday as he meets British defence minister Gavin Williamson, touching on the most contentious element of his trip: arms sales. Britain and Saudi Arabia have set themselves a 65 billion pound trade and investment target for the coming years, with London looking for new post-Brexit markets for its services sector, and Prince Mohammed seeking to convince wary investors his country is a tolerant and modernising place. But, for now the beating heart of bilateral trade ties remains defence and security. Britain credits Saudi intelligence sharing with saving British lives and has licensed billions of pounds of weapons and ammunition sales to Saudi Arabia. That has provided a controversial backdrop to the warm diplomatic welcome for Prince Mohammed, with hundreds turning out on Wednesday to protest the arms deals and Saudi Arabia’s role in the Yemen war. Nevertheless, Friday’s meeting is expected to include talks on the sale of up to 48 Typhoon fighter jets made by British firm BAE Systems - a multi-billion pound deal which has been under discussion for years but has proven tough to seal. Prime Minister Theresa May defended the two countries defence ties on Wednesday, saying all arms sales were strictly regulated, but has also repeatedly raised concerns about humanitarian crisis in Yemen directly with Prince Mohammed. The thorny topic was due to be discussed at a private dinner inside May’s country residence on Thursday night, but was tempered with gifts: May’s office said she presented Prince Mohammed with a family tree showing the descent of the Al Saud dynasty.

2018-03-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has resisted a call by campaigners and lawmakers to impose a so-called “latte levy” on single-use coffee cups, opting instead to reduce the use of the cups through voluntary measures.     Less than 1 percent of coffee cups are recycled in Britain because of the tightly bonded plastic liner, the difficulties of recycling packaging which has been in contact with food and drink and a lack of facilities. A committee of lawmakers had recommended a 25 pence ($0.34) levy on the use of disposable coffee cups to try to cut on their usage.  The government has previously introduced a 5 pence charge on plastic bags, and in Friday’s response to the committee’s recommendations, it said the plastic bag levy showed that “these types of incentives can change consumer behavior and this is something we could consider amongst other policy options”.  But the government offered no concrete proposals to introduce a levy on the cups, adding that coffee shops were already offering discounts to customers who use reusable cups and better provision for recycling. “We are pleased that major coffee retail chains are taking action to reduce single-use coffee cups,” the government said in its response, adding that cup makers could also be encouraged to produce more eco-friendly products. “These potential incentives would all work towards the same overall outcomes of increasing recycling and reducing litter.” Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee which had recommended the levy said they had put forward “practical solutions to the disposable packaging crisis”.  “The government’s response shows that despite warm words they plan no real action,” she said.

The facility, which could be ready by next year, will be used to supply industrial demand through trucking in places that can’t access supply from the grid, said Steve Hill, executive vice president at Shell Energy.  “It has a big potential growth ... in India because energy supply reliability is a big issue in India,” he said at a media briefing in Singapore, referring to LNG being transported in trucks to industrial users. “There hasn’t been as much supply infrastructure in place, but some of the import terminals are now putting the truck loading facilities in place so that’s opening up that option.” Shell Gas B.V, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, holds a majority stake in the Hazira LNG Terminal and Port in a venture with a unit of France’s Total SA. LNG trucking works well for locations off-grid, with China and India the two obvious markets, Hill said.  Gas hauled by trailers is seen growing to a tenth of China’s total gas consumption of around 240 billion cubic metres (bcm) in 2017, from 5.6 percent in 2014, but is a new development in India. Shell expects LNG demand to rise again in China this year as the world’s second-largest importer of the super-chilled fuel extends a program to switch from coal to cleaner gas beyond the capital Beijing to large industrial cities, Hill said. “The underlying policy that’s driving this is basically community heating or small in-city industrial users switching (the) boilers from coal to gas,” he said. “This is structural demand conversion.”   The full effect of China’s drive to switch factories and millions of homes from coal to gas to curb harmful emissions will be felt this year, he added.  India had the potential to be the next biggest growth market as it faced similar factors to China, Hill said. “They are both countries with big populations, developing rapidly growing economies, (and) air quality challenges where gas has low penetration in the energy mix,” he said.  “It’s harder to predict the timing in India, but ultimately I’m quite confident we’ll see rapid growth in gas demand in India.”  Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shell-lng-asia/shell-looks-to-meet-growth-in-lng-trucking-in-asia-idUKL4N1QR33I,09 Mar 2018,"Royal Dutch Shell is

2018-03-09,"* Papua New Guinea quake triggers LNG force majeure by Exxon * But warmer weather approaches for North Asia, Europe * Gas demand to drop as spring breaks out in northern hemisphere By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Global liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices eased this week as the market digested the impact of the earthquake in Papua New Guinea that in late February knocked out ExxonMobil’s export facility just as extreme cold in Europe spiked heating demand there. The sudden shortages triggered a rush for spot cargoes in the Pacific and Atlantic as utilities scrambled to meet short-term demand, pushing up prices earlier in March. Exxon’s outage in Papua New Guinea will last for weeks after the company declared force majeure last Friday on its exports and has to assess damage to the remote gas processing facility and over 700 km (435 miles) of pipeline to the LNG export terminal. A company declares a force majeure when it is unable to fulfil a contract because of forces beyond its control. While some buyers reportedly bought LNG spot cargoes at around $10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the immediate wake of the Papua outage to meet short-term demand, multiple traders this week said overall LNG market conditions were easing due to the onset of the low demand spring season across the Northern Hemisphere. Asia spot LNG prices LNG-AS were around $8.50 per mmBtu on Friday, down from $8.80 the previous week. Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows temperatures in Tokyo, Beijing and Seoul - three core demand centres for LNG in North Asia - to rise to around double their seasonal norms within the next two weeks, implying a sharp drop-off in gas demand for heating. In Europe, where a spat of extreme cold caused prices to spike to records last week, temperatures have also returned to seasonal norms and are expected to rise further in the coming weeks as winter ends. Although LNG markets are expected to ease during the upcoming low demand spring in the Northern Hemisphere, Katie Bays, an energy analyst at U.S. Height Securities, said in a note that markets were overall getting tighter, due to structural demand increases, especially in China, where a government gasification programme is moving millions of households and factories from coal to gas. “Though prices have come in, they remain around $8.50/mmBtu, supported by outages in Papua New Guinea... and by a sudden cold snap in Northwest Europe, which sent UK gas prices soaring (last week),” Bays said. China’s natural gas imports surged by more than a quarter last year and it overtook South Korea as the world’s second-biggest importer of LNG. Only Japan buys more, although most analysts expect China to pass Japan in the coming years as well. Since China has significant domestic gas production, and also has large pipelines feeding it from Central Asia, its utilities only scale up LNG purchases in the spot market when their demand cannot be met otherwise, especially during peak demand in the winter. “The market will see a very tight winter next year with little new capacity set to come online,” Bays said. Low demand lulls during spring and tight winters triggering a wave of Chinese buying will likely result in “greater price volatility,” she added.

2018-03-09,"(Repeats from MARCH 8, no changes to text) By Libby George LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The first vessel that will pump and store oil for Angola’s 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) Kaombo project is en route to the West African nation, operator Total said. The Kaombo oil block will produce its first oil this summer, Total said on Thursday. Once it is fully up and running, it will add roughly 14 percent to the OPEC member’s average 2017 output of 1.632 million bpd. The Kaombo Norte floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel left Singapore earlier this week, Total said. It can pump 115,000 bpd, half the oil block’s eventual production. The $16 billion offshore project will add a significant amount of oil to Africa’s number two exporter at a time when it is bound by output limits under a deal orchestrated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. A source close to the project said the block was expected to pump roughly 100,000 bpd by August. Another FPSO, Kaombo Sul, is still in Singapore. OPEC is reducing output by roughly 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other producers that began in January 2017 and was extended until the end of 2018. So far, Angola has complied comfortably, pumping even less than the maximum agreed. Last month, its output of 1.6 million bpd amounted to 194 percent of compliance with promised cuts of 78,000 bpd. Declining production at mature fields has cut into Angola’s output, but the Kaombo addition could complicate efforts to maintain compliance. Angola’s state oil company Sonangol has said production will be roughly steady this year, and the above-target cuts earlier in the year could keep its average compliance for the year within OPEC’s limits. Longer term, Angola is expected to struggle just to maintain output, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning that only Venezuela will see a bigger drop in production over the next five years. Angola’s oil production peaked at 1.9 million bpd in 2008, the IEA said, warning in its five-year outlook that capacity will drop by some 370,000 bpd by 2023 even with the new projects. “Angola is expected to post the biggest slide in capacity after Venezuela as ageing oil fields lose steam and foreign investors, faced with relatively uncompetitive prospects, lose enthusiasm,” the IEA said.

2018-03-09,"* North Korea offers to end testing, Trump agrees to meeting * KOSPI jumps most in 10 months, Nikkei pares early surge * Safe-haven yen eases, BOJ sticks with stimulus * Trump goes ahead with tariffs, exempts Canada and Mexico * Other exemptions could come but perhaps with conditions By Wayne Cole and Swati Pandey SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Asian shares pared sharp early gains on Friday ahead of U.S. payrolls data which could hasten Federal Reserve rate hikes, and as some caution set in about the new entente between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump. Kim has committed to “denuclearisation” and offered to hold the first-ever U.S.-North Korea summit, marking a potentially dramatic breakthrough in the North Korea nuclear standoff. Trump’s aides have been wary of North Korea’s diplomatic overtures because of its history of reneging on international commitments. “Whether it comes to anything remains to be seen as we have seen this happen several times over the decades,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist for AMP. “Or maybe its development of nuclear weapons was all just negotiating ploy. At least it will be ‘quiet’ on this front for a while yet.” The jubilation about the informal alliance did not last long as equity investors booked profits while futures for the S&P 500 and FTSE inched lower. Japan’s Nikkei was last 0.3 percent firmer, having been up more than 2 percent at one stage. South Korean stocks eased too but were still 1 percent higher. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6 percent, while Australia firmed 0.3 percent. “What seems certain is that over the coming 6 to 9 months, unfolding negotiations should ensure greater geopolitical tranquility on the Korean peninsula,” said Aninda Mitra, senior sovereign analyst, BNY Mellon Investment Management. “The main risk is, of course, Trump mishandles the potential for a breakthrough resulting in even heightened risk of a mishap.” The mood had already brightened a little after Trump pressed ahead with tariffs but offered conditional exemptions for Canada and Mexico, offering at least the hope that a full-blown global trade war could be averted. The White House said other countries could apply for exemptions on the 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium, but details were sparse on when they might be granted and under what terms. Several major trading partners have said they will respond with tariffs or direct action of their own. “Markets have cheered up a little but exclusions are likely to come with caveats demanding reciprocity - that’s the kind of guy the President is,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at broker AxiTrader. Rising protectionism was a risk cited overnight by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank’s latest policy meeting. While the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding stimulus. The dovish tone was enough to see the euro fade back to $1.2310, having shed 0.8 percent on Thursday. That helped the U.S. dollar firm on a basket of currencies to 90.189. The dollar gained 0.4 percent on the yen to 106.63, amid the recovery in risk appetite. There was little immediate reaction to the Bank of Japan’s latest policy meeting where it chose to maintain its massive stimulus campaign unaltered. Investors will next focus on the U.S. jobs report for February due later in the day. The consensus expectation for average hourly earnings growth for the month is for a 0.2 percent increase, while the headline non-farm payrolls is seen to have grown by 200,000 jobs, according to a Reuters poll. It was the upbeat jobs data last month that fanned speculation of faster rate rises in the United States, causing a rout in the bond market and hammering world equities. The Fed is widely expected to raise rates at least three times this year, with some analysts even expecting four. Elsewhere, oil prices recouped some ground in Asia after slipping overnight. U.S. crude bounced 12 cents to $60.24 per barrel, while Brent crude futures rose 16 cents to $63.77 per barrel. Spot gold eased 0.3 percent to $1,317.74 per ounce, extending losses into a third session as demand for safe havens lessened. Reporting by Wayne Cole

South Korea’s national security adviser made the announcement at the White House, after delivering a letter from Kim.

There was little immediate reaction to the Bank of Japan’s latest policy meeting where it chose to maintain its massive stimulus campaign unaltered.

2018-03-09,"NAGPUR, India (Reuters) - Indian ride-hailing firm Ola’s pilot project to test a fleet of electric vehicles in the western city of Nagpur was expected to herald a coming revolution in the Indian autos industry. So far, though, it has only exposed fractures in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ambitions to make all new vehicles electric by 2030. With an initial investment of about $8 million (5.8 million pounds), Softbank-backed Ola launched the project last year at an event that had all the trappings of a state function, including a big gathering and flagging off by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari. But nine months later, the program has hit a snag: Ola drivers, unhappy with long wait times at charging stations and high operating expenses, want to return their cars and switch to fuel-guzzling variants. Out of 20 Ola electric car drivers interviewed by Reuters in Nagpur, more than a dozen said they have either returned their electric taxis and switched to diesel, or are planning to do so.  Ola had said it would make 50 charging points available across four locations in Nagpur - a city of about 2.5 million people - for its fleet of 200 electric vehicles, but on a visit to the city in late January, Reuters found only about a dozen charging points. Ola has since added 10 additional charging points but is still short of its target.  Ola did not respond to requests for comment for this article. Getting infrastructure built in the world’s biggest democracy where a not-in-my-backyard culture proliferates is a barrier for a lot of businesses in India. And it is proving to be the same for charging stations - Ola was forced to close one in Nagpur last year after protests by residents angered by traffic jams caused by drivers. It took more than five months to get government clearances to begin operating another station. The hurdles faced by Ola in setting up sufficient charging stations for a fleet of expensive electric cars with a limited driving range expose the challenges the Indian government and automakers will face if they are to get anywhere near realising the 2030 vision. Global auto makers have repeatedly warned that India is not ready for electrification, saying the government must first lay down a clear, long-term policy, provide incentives to encourage manufacturing of electric vehicles to bring down their cost and create the charging infrastructure.  Gadkari added to uncertainty when he said last month that the government will no longer draft a separate electric vehicle policy. He did not comment on the 2030 vision. The Ola project has not turned out to be economically viable for either the company or its drivers, said one industry source familiar with Ola’s strategy. “The project’s not flying as of now and the economics is not working out,” the source said. Electric car sales in India, one of the world’s fastest-growing auto markets, made up less than 0.1 percent of annual sales of more than 3 million passenger cars. The lack of demand is mainly because they are expensive - due to high battery costs - and as their range is limited and there isn’t a charging infrastructure. By comparison, in China in 2017, electric vehicles made up about 2 percent of annual passenger car sales of 24.7 million. The Indian government had been determined to promote electric vehicle use, starting with public transport and taxis, to combat rising pollution and reduce the nation’s dependence on imported oil. India’s 2030 ambition was part of a broader move by countries like China and the United Kingdom, which have set similar goals. This has spurred billions of dollars in investments by carmakers like Volkswagen and Ford Motor even as many in the industry say they are unsure who will buy the massive numbers of electric vehicles governments want them to produce.     Mahindra & Mahindra is the only electric carmaker in India and the high cost of even its entry-level model, which starts at 760,000 rupees (8,450 pounds) is a barrier for many first-time car buyers, and a non-starter for taxi drivers who can get a diesel or gasoline propelled car for about half the price. Ola has deep pockets and while it has tied-up with Mahindra for the pilot project, its struggle to make the fleet viable in a small Indian city with much less congestion and space constraints than the biggest cities like Mumbai, underscores the magnitude of the challenges. A shortage of stations and the limited range of cars - about 100 kilometres - has meant longer queues to recharge. During summer months when batteries discharge faster and need to be recharged more, the situation may worsen unless more charging points are added, said several drivers, none of whom wanted to be named as they feared retribution from the company. The cars are owned by Ola and leased to drivers for 1,000 rupees a day, but many complain that the amount is too high and they need to work for 12-16 hours to make a decent living, given they waste 3-4 hours a day on charging. One of the drivers said that after paying Ola the rent for the car and shelling out 500-600 rupees per day for charging, he is left with about 500 rupees at the end of a 14-hour day giving him little time to rest or spend with his family. “If they don’t give us the (charging) facility, why should we drive these cars,” said the driver, who had just spent an hour waiting for his turn to charge the car, and would have to wait for another 90 minutes while it charges. Ola founder and CEO Bhavish Aggarwal told Reuters last April that the company would pilot a few thousand electric vehicles in several Indian cities in 2017 and then scale up in a major way. However, almost a year later it has still to take the experiment beyond Nagpur. At India’s biennial auto show in February, electric cars took centre stage but most were at a concept stage or sold only in global markets as automakers like Toyota, Honda and Renault took a circumspect approach to the new tilt toward electrification.  “Once we make an investment there are huge risks,” said Akito Tachibana, managing director of Toyota’s India arm,  adding as of now there is no clarity on who would buy such cars and what incentives the government will offer. Charging infrastructure is a big piece of the puzzle that needs to be resolved for EVs to be viable - India has only about 222 charging stations with 353 charging points, according to a January report by global consultancy EY.  Analysts estimate it costs between $500 and $25,000 to set up a station, and that comes on top of expensive land purchases needed to build them. The ministry of heavy industries estimates  a subsidy worth 140 billion rupees will be needed to promote EVs and charging infrastructure. Automakers argue in the near-term the government should make land available and invest in building stations, while over the longer-term it would need to offer incentives to private investors. One additional problem is that, unlike in Western countries, most car owners in India do not have garages, or formal parking where chargers for cars could be installed. Another issue is lack of a long-term policy, outlining incentives, which has helped countries like China push electric vehicle sales. Government wrangling over policy formulation in India is making it difficult for carmakers to plan investments. “Any distraction from the single-minded focus to draw a plan for introducing electric vehicles is going to make this a long-lasting exercise that might not attract the attention of the right kind of investors,” cautions Guenter Butschek, managing director at Tata Motors.

2018-03-09,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has sued a group of oil trading companies through a U.S. trust over a multi-billion dollar corruption scheme to buy petroleum products below market value, the lawyer representing the trust said on Thursday.  The lawsuit accuses a small Miami-based company called Helsinge Inc of obtaining inside information and rigging bid proceedings by bribing PDVSA officials including current Vice President Ysmel Serrano in a scheme that yielded billions of dollars in illicit gains, according to the lawsuit. Helsinge also provided inside information to trading companies including Lukoil Petroleum Ltd (LKOH.MM), Colonial Oi1 Industries, Inc, Glencore Ltd (GLEN.L), Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL]  and Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL], which the lawsuit describes as “Oil Company Co-Conspirators” that also benefited.  Serrano, Helsinge and the other oil companies did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The suit follows a recent sweep at PDVSA that put dozens of employees in jail in what President Nicolas Maduro calls an anti-corruption crusade but critics dismiss as factional rivalries within a corrupt elite. “I think this lawsuit ... illustrates the extent to which PDVSA and the Republic of Venezuela are now prepared to go after corruption regardless of who the people involved are,” said David Boies, chairman of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner which is representing the trust, in a telephone interview. The suit was filed by a group called “PDVSA US Litigation Trust,” which will litigate claims against those accused of involvement in the bribery scheme, Boies said. Any proceeds will be sent to PDVSA. “If you’re thinking about this in terms of the layperson, this is a suit by PDVSA,” he said. PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

South Korea’s national security adviser made the announcement at the White House, after delivering a letter from Kim.

2018-03-09,"* Trump will accept invitation to meet Kim Jong Un -White House * Place, time of meeting yet to be determined -White House * But markets capped by soaring U.S. crude oil output * U.S. to soon overtake Russia as world’s biggest oil producer By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 9 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures rose on Friday as Asian stock markets gained on news that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump. The two will likely meet by May and Kim has pledged to refrain from further nuclear or missile tests, South Korea’s national security chief said late on Thursday after briefing White House officials on talks between Seoul and Pyongyang. The White House said Trump would accept the invitation at a place and time to be determined. The news lifted Asian stocks markets, and pulled crude oil futures along with them, traders said. Brent crude futures were at $63.95 per barrel at 0102 GMT, up 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their previous close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $60.39 a barrel, up 27 cents, or 0.45 percent. WTI also fell by more than 2 percent the previous session. Beyond geopolitics, oil markets were mainly concerned with soaring output from the United States C-OUT-T-EIA, which has risen by 23 percent since mid-2016, to 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s more than top exporter Saudi Arabia produces. Only Russia pumps more, at almost 11 million bpd. “It seems only a matter of time before the U.S. becomes the biggest oil producer in the world. The main question which keeps investors busy is when exactly this will be reached,” Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at Dutch bank ABN Amro, said in a note to investors. Unlike Middle East producers, where output is largely dictated by state-owned oil companies, U.S. producers drill and sell purely based on economics. If prices remain at current levels or rise further, U.S. drillers are profitable and will raise output; if prices stumble, U.S. production will fall. “The correlation between the U.S. oil production and the oil prices will remain considerable,” van Cleef said. As much as on production, oil prices will depend on demand. “Global demand will continue to grow by 1.5 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019. This would offer enough room for U.S. oil producers to increase production and for OPEC and her allies to minimalise the production cuts towards the end of 2019,” van Cleef said. The Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia since 2017 have been leading an effort to withhold production to prop up prices.

2018-03-09,"* North Korea offers to end nuclear, missile testing * Trump goes ahead with tariffs, exempts Canada and Mexico * Other exemptions could come but perhaps with conditions * Asia shares ex-Japan flat, Nikkei futures trade firmer * Euro dips as ECB cautious on policy, yen eases before BOJ By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Asian stock markets made guarded gains on Friday on news North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had offered to stop nuclear and missile testing and to arrange a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. South Korea’s national security adviser made the announcement at the White House, after delivering a letter from Kim to Trump. The chance of an easing in geopolitical tensions in the region helped Japan’s Nikkei climb 1.3 percent, while South Korean stocks added 0.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.15 percent, while Australia firmed 0.3 percent. The mood had already brightened a little after Trump pressed ahead with tariffs but offered conditional exemptions for Canada and Mexico, offering at least the hope a full-blown trade war could be averted. The White House said other countries could apply for exemptions on the 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium, but details were sparse on when they might be granted and under what terms. Several major trading partners have said they will respond with tariffs or direct action of their own. “Markets have cheered up a little but exclusions are likely to come with caveats demanding reciprocity - that’s the kind of guy the President is,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at broker AxiTrader. “Fears have been eased in the immediate term, but it’s clear that China, and to a lesser extent the EU, is about to come in for greater scrutiny.” E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were up 0.1 percent, after Wall Street got a late lift from the tariff news. The Dow ended Thursday with a gain of 0.38 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.45 percent and the Nasdaq 0.42 percent. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso inched higher, though both countries remain locked in tough negotiations with the United States over NAFTA. Rising protectionism was a risk cited overnight by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank’s latest policy meeting. While the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding stimulus. The dovish tone was enough to see the euro fade back to $1.2305, having shed 0.8 percent on Thursday. That helped the U.S. dollar gain 0.5 percent on a basket of currencies to stand at 90.129. The dollar nudged up 0.2 percent on the yen to 106.40 , amid a mild recovery in risk appetites. Attention now turns to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting later on Friday. Fears of a global trade war, recent market volatility and a strong yen give the bank plenty of reason to maintain its massive asset buying campaign, and to play down the prospect of an exit anytime soon. “Actual policy tweaks in terms of asset purchases or yield-curve control settings remain some way off, but words can be very powerful,” said analysts at ANZ. “Any more detailed hints about timing will move the yen,” they added. “The global liquidity being provided by the BOJ and ECB has taken on added importance for asset markets since the Federal Reserve starting winding back its own quantitative easing programme.” Oil prices steadied in Asia after slipping overnight, with sentiment still dogged by signs of building inventories, surging U.S. crude production and jitters about a potential trade war. U.S. crude bounced 18 cents in early trade to $60.30 per barrel. Brent crude futures had ended Thursday down 73 cents at $63.61 per barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole
