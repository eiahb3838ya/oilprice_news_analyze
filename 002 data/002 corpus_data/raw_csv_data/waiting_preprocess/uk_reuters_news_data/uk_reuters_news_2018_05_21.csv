2018-05-21,"CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Critics at home and abroad on Monday denounced the re-election of Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro as a farce cementing autocracy, while the U.S. government imposed new sanctions on the crisis-stricken oil-producing country. Maduro, the 55-year-old successor to late leftist leader Hugo Chavez, hailed his win in Sunday’s election as a victory against “imperialism.” But his main challengers alleged irregularities and refused to recognise the result. In response to the vote, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting Venezuela’s ability to liquidate state assets and debt in the United States, the latest in a series of sanctions that seeks to choke off financing for the already cash-strapped government. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition had boycotted the election, given that two of its most popular leaders were barred, authorities had banned several political parties, and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists.  Maduro won 68 percent of votes - more than three times as many as his main rival Henri Falcon. Turnout was a low 46 percent, significantly down from 80 percent in 2013’s presidential vote. “The revolution is here to stay!” Maduro told cheering supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas. He has not outlined firm policies, but has promised to prioritise economic recovery after five years of crippling recession that has seen many struggle with chronic shortages of food, medicines and other basic necessities. Maduro’s dwindling but often still fervent supporters, many of whom remember the generous welfare policies of the Chavez years, want to give him another shot. “We believe in the process and we’re giving President Maduro another chance,” said 45-year-old social security worker Maira Garcia, as she celebrated his victory in the poor Caracas hillside neighbourhood of 23 de Enero.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called the election “a sham - neither free nor fair.” In a statement sent from the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump called for Maduro to “restore democracy, hold free and fair elections, release all political prisoners immediately and unconditionally, and end the repression and economic deprivation of the Venezuelan people.” In recent months, Washington has imposed a series of sanctions on companies and individuals with ties to the Maduro government. Trump’s order on Monday prohibits involvement in the purchase of any debt owed to the Venezuelan government, including accounts receivable, particularly related to oil sold by the OPEC member.  The action appears to target in part Venezuelan-owned but U.S.-based oil refiner Citgo.  “Today’s executive order closes another avenue for corruption that we have observed being used: it denies corrupt Venezuelan officials the ability to improperly value and sell off public assets in return for kickbacks,” a senior administration official told reporters in Washington. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, called the new sanctions illegal, saying they were “madness, barbaric and in absolute contradiction to international law.” While the order applies only to U.S. citizens and residents, the official said the Trump administration had had “fairly pointed discussions” with China and Russia over the issuing of new credit to Venezuela. Maduro has counted on the support of China and Russia, which have provided billions of dollars in funding in recent years. “What these sanctions are seeking to avoid is that countries outside the Western hemisphere come rescue Maduro financially so that he can consolidate an autocracy,” said Venezuelan opposition lawmaker and economist Angel Alvarado. Other countries also hinted at sanctions, with Spain leading European Union criticism of the election. And the 14-nation “Lima Group” of countries in the Americas, from Canada to Brazil, said in a stinging statement it did not recognise the vote and would downgrade diplomatic relations. The group deplored Venezuela’s “grave humanitarian situation.” In contrast, Venezuela’s regional leftist allies, such as Cuba and Bolivia, sent congratulations.  In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed Venezuela could handle its own affairs and the choice of the people should be respected. The Venezuelan government used ample state resources to get voters out on Sunday and public workers were pressured to vote. Falcon called for a new election, complaining about the government placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands offering ‘prizes’ close to polling stations nationwide.   The main political opposition said its boycott had worked, but the disparate group did not appear to have a plan going forward other than calling for new elections - a non-starter given the pro-Maduro electoral council. Major protests, like those seen last year and in 2014, seem unlikely, given widespread disillusionment and fatigue.  Demonstrators did barricade some streets in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz, drawing teargas from the National Guard, witnesses said.  Maduro, a former bus driver whose second term in office starts in January, faces a colossal task turning around Venezuela’s moribund economy. The bolivar currency is down well over 99 percent over the past year and annual inflation is at nearly 14,000 percent, according to the opposition-led National Assembly. Venezuela’s multiple creditors are considering accelerating claims on unpaid foreign debt, while oil major ConocoPhillips (COP.N) has been taking aggressive action in recent weeks against PDVSA , part of a claim for compensation over a 2007 nationalisation of its assets in Venezuela. U.S. crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuela’s oil output could fall further following the election and sanctions.  Trading of Venezuelan government and PDVSA debt was mixed but volumes remained thin in New York on Monday afternoon, with election results considered a formality and offering little to change investor viewpoints.  The benchmark government bond due 2027 VENGLB27=RR was bid up 0.25 points to 29 cents on the dollar while the benchmark PDVSA 2022 recovered about half of its early losses to trade down 0.65 points in price to 26.851 cents on the dollar VE059352415=, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2018-05-21,"May 21 (Reuters) - China’s interest in reducing its trade surplus with United States through increased energy imports could advance plans for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, said energy executives involved in developing new facilities. The White House and China on Saturday said a U.S. trade team would travel to China to explore new energy and agricultural deals. The joint communique lowered trade tensions, lifting stock markets in Asia and the United States on Monday. There are over two dozen proposed U.S. LNG plants waiting for customer commitments to reach a final investment decision, many of them looking to China for deals. About 13 percent of U.S. LNG cargos went to China last year, according to data provider Genscape. China imported 5.6 billion cubic feet per day last year, making it the world’s largest buyer after Japan. “We see it as a positive development,” said William Daughdrill, director of health, safety and environmental at Delfin Midstream. Its chief executive was in Asia last week pursuing customers, Daughdrill said. Delfin is proposing a floating LNG facility in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and aiming for a final investment decision as early as this year to go ahead and produce up to 13 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) of LNG for export. “For us, it’s strictly been about marketing to China,” said Greg Vesey, chief executive of LNG Ltd, which is developing an LNG plant in Louisiana and another in Nova Scotia in Canada. It hopes to reach a final investment decision on the U.S. project by year-end and begin exports in 2022, he said. “If you look at some forecasts for 2035, there are really only two places that have significant increases in LNG imports. Europe goes up about 100 mtpa and China goes up about 200 mtpa,” Vesey said. Texas LNG, which is proposing a 4-mtpa export facility in Brownsville, Texas, and has five early-stage agreements with Chinese customers, hopes to make a final decision next year, about six months behind its original goal. “Sentiment in the LNG markets is heating up again,” said Langtry Meyer, co-founder of the company. Texas LNG is not considering developing an import terminal in China, he said, which would likely be needed to expand U.S. exports. Cheniere Energy Inc this month said it would soon make a final investment decision on a third liquefaction line at its Corpus Christi, Texas, facility. A spokesman on Monday declined further comment on its decision. Reporting by Scott DiSavino in New York; Writing by Gary

2018-05-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuela’s oil output could fall further following the country’s presidential election and potential sanctions on the OPEC-member nation. Prices firmed further as U.S. President Donald Trump had discussions with Russia and China about issuing new debt to Venezuela. Trump signed an executive order on Monday restricting Venezuela’s ability to liquidate state assets, a senior administration official told reporters.   Any restriction on Venezuela’s financing, logistics or power supply could further depress the country’s crude output. “It’s been going down for a bit, but there is an expectation that the decline will accelerate,” said Jamie Webster, senior director of the Center for Energy Impact at the Boston Consulting Group. “There’s increasingly a view that this could be as bad as Libya was in its worst days - that production could fall to a very small percent of what it is capable of doing.” U.S. crude futures settled 96 cents, or 1.4 percent, firmer at $72.24 a barrel, after touching $72.33, the highest since November 2014. In post-settlement trade, the benchmark hit a fresh 3-1/2 year high at 72.59.   Brent crude futures gained 71 cents, or 0.9 percent, to settle at $79.22 a barrel.  In post-settlement trade, the global benchmark rallied to $79.59, up more than a dollar from the previous close.  Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro faced widespread international condemnation on Monday after his re-election in a weekend vote his critics denounced as a farce cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken oil producer. The United States is actively considering oil sanctions on Venezuela, where output has dropped by a third in two years to its lowest in decades. “The spectre of U.S. oil sanctions on the embattled Latin American producer now looms large as Washington strives to tighten the financial noose,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said in a note.  Brent pushed past $80 a barrel last week for the first time since 2014, and the market may again try to clear that hurdle, said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.  “It seems as if the pull backs are just short-term profit taking and we will see whether people are going to be willing to drive the market through $80 again,” he said.  Beyond Venezuela’s production woes, geopolitical concerns that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the country’s crude exports have led prices to trade higher in recent weeks. Additionally, a possible U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s two largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, giving global markets a lift in early Monday trade. Stabilizing trade relations between the countries could boost oil demand, Tradition’s McGillian said.  Rising output from U.S. shale and key OPEC producers could end the rally, BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters.  Dudley said he expected a flood of U.S. shale and a possible reopening of OPEC taps to cool oil markets after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week. Dudley said he saw oil prices falling to between $50 and $65 because of surging shale output and OPEC’s capacity to boost production to cover a potential shortfall in Iranian supplies owing to U.S. sanctions.

2018-05-21,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A heatwave has killed 65 people in Pakistan’s southern city of Karachi over the past three days, a social welfare organisation said on Tuesday, amid fears the death toll could climb as the high temperatures persist. The heatwave has coincided with power outages and the holy month of Ramadan, when most Muslims do not eat or drink during daylight hours. Temperatures hit 44 degrees Celsius (111 Fahrenheit) on Monday, local media reported. Faisal Edhi, who runs the Edhi Foundation that operates morgues and an ambulance service in Pakistan’s biggest city, said the deaths occurred mostly in the poor areas of Karachi. “Sixty-five people have died over the last three days,” Edhi told Reuters. “We have the bodies in our cold storage facilities and their neighbourhood doctors have said they died of heat-stroke.” A government spokesperson could not be reached for comment. But Sindh province’s Health Secretary Fazlullah Pechuho told the English-language Dawn newspaper that no one has died from heat-stroke. “Only doctors and hospitals can decide whether the cause of death was heat-stroke or not. I categorically reject that people have died due to heat-stroke in Karachi,” Pechuho was quoted as saying. Nonetheless, reports of heat stroke deaths in Karachi will stir unease amid fears of a repeat of a heatwave in of 2015, when morgues and hospitals were overwhelmed and at least 1,300 mostly elderly and sick people died from the searing heat. In 2015, the Edhi morgue ran out of freezer space after about 650 bodies were brought in the space of a few days. Ambulances left decaying corpses outside in sweltering heat. The provincial government has assured residents that there would be no repeat of 2015 and was working on ensuring those in need of care receive rapid treatment. Edhi said most of the dead brought to the morgue were working class factory workers who came from the low-income Landhi and Korangi areas of Karachi. “They work around heaters and boilers in textile factories and there is eight to nine hours of (scheduled power outages) in these areas,” he said. Temperatures are expected to stay above 40C until Thursday, local media reported.

2018-05-21,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Monday accused countries with nuclear weapons of “threatening the world”, and criticised the United States’s withdrawal from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. “Those who have more than 15,000 nuclear warheads are currently threatening the world,” he said, referring to the approximate total number of warheads worldwide, most of which are held by the United States and Russia. Apparently referring to such states as Iran, he added: “Why are countries with nuclear warheads posing a threat to them?”  “If we are to be fair, to show a just approach, then the countries with nuclear weapons, which portray nuclear power stations as threats, have no credibility in the international community,” he said at an iftar dinner for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Erdogan said the Middle East had to be cleansed of all nuclear weapons, in an apparent reference to Israel, believed to be the only nation in the region to possess them. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States 10 days ago from the deal between Tehran and six major powers which limited Iran’s nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Trump ordered that sanctions be reimposed. Earlier on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanded Iran take additional steps such as pulling out of the Syrian civil war. Iran dismissed Washington’s ultimatum and a senior Iranian official said it showed the United States was seeking “regime change” in Iran. The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal comes as relations between NATO member Turkey and Washington have soured over a host of issues, ranging from U.S. policy in Syria to Trump’s decision to move the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. France, Germany and Britain have said they will try to save the nuclear deal with Tehran. “As Turkey, we do not accept re-igniting issues, including the Iran nuclear deal, that have been put to bed. We find the other signatories stating their loyalty to the agreement in the face of the U.S. administration’s decision very positive,” Erdogan said.

2018-05-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets rallied broadly on Monday after the United States and China agreed to halt a trade war, while oil hit multi-year highs on political uncertainty and potential sanctions on Venezuela.      The U.S. trade battle with China was put “on hold” after the world’s two largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats in favour of hashing out a broader deal, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday.  In addition to the trade truce, Wall Street indexes rose on news of $28 billion (£20.8 billion) in U.S. merger deals.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 298.2 points, or 1.21 percent, to 25,013.29, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 20.04 points, or 0.74 percent, to 2,733.01, and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.70 points, or 0.54 percent, to 7,394.04. The small-cap Russell 2000 index  hit a record high for a fourth straight session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.26 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.40 percent. In the short term, analysts said they expect stocks to continue to trend higher barring a major negative event.   “This is an indication of what we’ll see near term, because we are through earnings, relatively light on macro data, and with geopolitics it seems like some of the emotion has been reduced between now and the Korean summit,” said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. The U.S.-China trade news also boosted the U.S. dollar to a five-month high against a basket of currencies as investors pared short positions on the greenback before starting to sell off again.  The dollar index .DXY fell 0.12 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.14 percent to $1.1792. Gold, meanwhile, sank to a low for the year so far. The Japanese yen weakened 0.22 percent versus the greenback to 111.00 per dollar, while sterling GBP= was last trading at $1.3432, down 0.29 percent. The yen was pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, expectations of falling safe-haven demand with the easing of the U.S.-China trade war, and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said. The euro turned slightly positive after suffering from concerns about political uncertainty in Italy. Italy’s far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and to implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of the country’s debt pile.  Italy’s 10-year bond yield IT10YT=RR rose to its highest level since April 2017 before easing back. U.S. Treasuries, which were steady ahead of $99 billion in new supply scheduled for this week, were supported by safety buying prompted by the surging Italian borrowing costs. Meanwhile, oil prices soared to their highest level since 2014 after Venezuela’s presidential election spurred worries that the country’s oil output could fall further. The market is also weighing the possibility of additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela following its presidential election.  U.S. crude CLc1 rose 1.8 percent to $72.56 per barrel and Brent LCOc1 was last at $79.52, up 1.29 percent on the day. Crude prices climbed further on U.S. President Donald Trump’s discussions with Russia and China about issuing new debt to Venezuela. Expectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the country’s crude exports have also led crude prices higher in recent weeks.

The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the governments agreed to drop tariff threats and work on a wider agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday. Washington is especially keen to sell more of the United States’ surging oil and gas production. Yet infrastructure bottlenecks mean energy and commodity exports can grow only gradually, and only if U.S. oil, gas and other goods remain cost attractive against global competition. Morgan Stanley estimates it could take up to three years to increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods by $60 billion to $90 billion, with a rise in agricultural imports in the near term followed by energy. Total U.S. oil and gas exports to China in 2017 were worth $4.3 billion, based on average prices, a far cry from a deficit reduction target of $200 billion. But U.S. exports are rising, and China has spent $2 billion on U.S. oil in the first quarter of 2018 alone. Increased purchases of U.S. oil will help China replace Iranian supplies, which are expected to fall as the United States re-imposes sanctions on Tehran. “Buying U.S. crude would help with the Iranian situation in ... that these barrels from the U.S. would provide additional supplies at a time when buyers will be expected to cut Iranian volumes,” said Michal Meidan of consultancy Energy Aspects. China’s U.S. oil import bill this year could rise to $9 billion to $11 billion with purchases rising to 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of 2018, according to Energy Aspects. That would still be only a fraction of China’s import needs of 9.6 million bpd in April, worth around $20 billion. And while U.S. exports may grow somewhat, infrastructure bottlenecks for the time being hold back sales. U.S. oil export terminals are small by global standards and the biggest tankers - Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) - don’t fit through the Panama Canal. Having to take the detour around Africa, they are at a cost disadvantage against producers from the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Washington also wants the United States to export more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China. In 2017, China overtook South Korea as the world’s second biggest buyer of LNG, only behind Japan. China is looking to low cost sources of energy to reduce its use of coal and cut pollution. While LNG shipments have increased, there are only two major export facilities operating in the United States, both of which have largely contracted out their supplies. There are also restraints in China due to pipeline and terminal capacities. Additional liquefaction units are under construction at five U.S. locations. If Chinese companies were to become partners in the U.S. export projects still under development and in need of customers and financing, U.S. LNG exports to China could surge. “At least 13 percent of total U.S. LNG cargos went to China, and we expect this number to grow as more U.S. firms sign long-term agreements with Chinese buyers as their nation continues to develop its gas infrastructure,” said Charlie Cone, LNG Proprietary Analyst for energy data provider Genscape. China could direct its state-owned soybean crushers to buy more of America’s surplus oilseed, said Paul Burke, North Asia regional director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council. That would potentially add 14 million tonnes of imports worth $6 billion to this year’s trade bill, at the expense of major exporters, Brazil and Argentina. Soybeans were the United States’ second-largest export to China by value, worth $12 billion last year. China easing controls on processing imports of genetically modified strains of corn and fully allocating its low-tariff import quota for wheat would also add to grain shipments. Analysts reckon buying more poultry, beef and pork would be another way to boost trade, but tough import regulations would likely limit volumes without big concessions from Beijing. Beijing removed anti-dumping tariffs on U.S. poultry in February after eight years, but a ban due to avian influenza remains in place. Without the ban, the U.S.-China poultry business could be worth up to $600 million, an industry expert estimated. China has in the past made large purchases of American pork for its strategic reserves. There is also strong demand for imported meat among the country’s middle class consumers. But China has zero tolerance on the use of growth promoter beta-agonist ractopamine, widely used by U.S. pork farmers, and synthetic hormones used in U.S. beef. The government lifted a 14-year-old ban on U.S. beef last year, but it has only approved a dozen processors for export. In the first quarter, U.S. imports accounted for less than 1 pct of China’s total beef imports, but a pick-up in purchases would challenge Australia, Brazil and Uruguay. “Big (meat) purchases and shipments need time to put together. You can’t just turn on the spigot,” said an industry source who declined to be identified. Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE and Dominique Patton in

2018-05-21,"WASHINGTON/ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States on Monday demanded Iran make sweeping changes — from dropping its nuclear programme to pulling out of the Syrian civil war — or face severe economic sanctions as the Trump administration hardened its approach to Tehran. Iran dismissed Washington’s ultimatum and one senior Iranian official said it showed the United States is seeking “regime change” in Iran.  Weeks after President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran, his administration threatened to impose “the strongest sanctions in history,” and vowed to “crush” Iranian operatives abroad, setting Washington and Tehran further on a course of confrontation. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo demanded sweeping changes that would force Iran effectively to reverse the recent spread of its military and political influence through the Middle East to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The speech added to the tension between the two countries, which grew notably when Trump this month withdrew from the 2015 international agreement aimed at preventing Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. If Washington sees tangible shifts in Iran’s policies, it  is prepared to lift sanctions, Pompeo said. “The sting of sanctions will only grow more painful if the regime does not change course from the unacceptable and unproductive path it has chosen for itself and the people of Iran,” Pompeo said in his first major speech since becoming secretary of state. “These will be the strongest sanctions in history by the time we are done,” he added.     The European Union largely dismissed Pompeo’s speech and said it remained committed to the full implementation of the nuclear deal. Pompeo took aim at Iran’s policy of expansion in the Middle East through support for armed groups in countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.  He warned that the United States would “crush” Iranian operatives and proxies abroad and told Tehran to pull out forces under its command from the Syrian civil war where they have helped President Bashar al-Assad gain the upper hand.  Iran’s president summarily dismissed Pompeo’s demands. “Who are you to decide for Iran and the world?,” the semi-official ILNA news agency quoted Hassan Rouhani as saying. “The world today does not accept America to decide for the world, as countries are independent ... that era is over ... We will continue our path with the support of our nation.” A senior Iranian official said Pompeo’s remarks showed that the United States was pushing for “regime change,” a charged phrase often associated with the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the overthrow of President Saddam Hussein.             Pompeo warned that if Iran fully resumed its nuclear programme Washington would be ready to respond and said the administration would hold companies doing prohibited business in Iran to account. “Our demands on Iran are not unreasonable: give up your programme,” Pompeo said, “Should they choose to go back, should they begin to enrich, we are fully prepared to respond to that as well,” he said, declining to elaborate. Pompeo said Washington would work with the Defense Department and allies to counter Iran in the cyberspace and maritime areas. The Pentagon said it would take all necessary steps to confront Iranian behaviour in the region and was assessing whether that could include new actions or doubling down on current ones. Pompeo will have an uphill battle convincing European allies to sign on to the administration’s “Plan B” on Iran after its withdrawal from the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). “Secretary Pompeo’s speech has not demonstrated how walking away from the JCPOA has made or will make the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation or how it puts us in a better position to influence Iran’s conduct in areas outside the scope of JCPOA. There is no alternative to the JCPOA,” the EU said in a statement. Pompeo said if Iran made major changes, the United States was prepared to ease sanctions, re-establish full diplomatic and commercial relations and support the country’s re-integration into the international economic system. Any new U.S. sanctions will raise the cost of trade for Iran and are expected to further deter Western companies from investing there, giving hardliners, including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, an opportunity to cement their grip on power. Iran’s ruling elite are mindful of recent protests sparked by economic hardship, which is, in part, their calculation for working with the Europeans on ways to salvage the nuclear deal. Pompeo’s speech did not explicitly call for regime change but he repeatedly urged the Iranian people not to put up with their leaders, specifically naming Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif. “At the end of the day the Iranian people will get to make a choice about their leadership,” Pompeo said. Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the Brooking Institution think tank’s foreign policy programme, said Pompeo’s speech did indeed amount to a strategy of regime change. “There is only one way to read it and that is that Trump administration has wedded itself to a regime-change strategy to Iran, one that is likely to alienate our allies. One with dubious prospects for success,” she said. The administration’s approach “explicitly puts the onus on the Iranian people to change their leadership or face cataclysmic financial pressure,” said Maloney who has advised the State Department on Iran in the Bush administration between 2005-2007. Lebanese analyst Ghaleb Kandil, who has close ties to the pro-Iran Hezbollah group, said Washington’s demands have previously not worked. “These are conditions that were tested in previous phases of American pressures, before the nuclear deal, when Iran was in more difficult circumstances than it is in these days, and it did not surrender to these conditions or accept them,” said Kandil. Pompeo outlined 12 U.S. demands for Iran including to stop uranium enrichment, never to pursue plutonium reprocessing and to close its heavy water reactor.      It also had to declare all previous military dimensions of its nuclear programme and to permanently and verifiably abandon such work, he said. Pompeo’s demand that Tehran stop uranium enrichment goes even further than the nuclear deal. Iran says its nuclear work has medical uses and will produce energy to meet domestic demand and complement its oil reserves.  Washington’s regional allies, the Gulf Arabs and Israel, who were strong critics of the deal, praised the administration’s position on Monday. European parties to the nuclear deal - France, Britain and Germany - are working to find a way to keep the nuclear pact in effect after Washington’s exit.

2018-05-21,"CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Critics at home and abroad on Monday denounced the vote that re-elected Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro as a farce cementing autocracy and the U.S. government imposed new sanctions on the crisis-stricken oil-producing country. The 55-year-old successor to late leftist leader Hugo Chavez hailed his win in Sunday’s election as a victory against “imperialism.” But his main challengers alleged irregularities and refused to recognize the result. The vote was widely condemned overseas. U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order restricting Venezuela’s ability to liquidate state assets and debt in the United States, an action that appeared to target in part Venezuelan-owned but U.S.-based oil refiner Citgo [PDVSAC.UL]. Venezuela’s mainstream opposition boycotted the vote, given that two of its most popular leaders were barred, authorities had banned the coalition and several of its parties, and the election board is run by Maduro loyalists.  Maduro won 68 percent of votes - more than three times as many as his main rival Henri Falcon. Turnout was a low 46 percent, compared with 80 percent at the last presidential election in 2013. “The revolution is here to stay!” Maduro told supporters outside the presidential palace in Caracas. He promised to prioritize economic recovery after five years of crippling recession that has seen many in the OPEC nation of 30 million people struggle with chronic shortages of food, medicines and other basic necessities. “We mustn’t cave to any empire, or go running to the International Monetary Fund as Argentina did,” said government supporter Ingrid Sequera, 51. She wore a T-shirt with a logo featuring the eyes of Maduro’s mentor, Chavez. U.S. crude hit its highest level since 2014 on Monday amid rising concerns that Venezuela’s oil output could fall further following the election and the country could be hit with more sanctions.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence called the election “a sham - neither free nor fair.” The Maduro government had manipulated the election and was using hunger as a weapon, U.S. officials told reporters of the decision to impose further sanctions. In recent months, Washington has imposed a series of sanctions on companies and individuals with ties to the Maduro government. “Today’s executive order closes another avenue for corruption that we have observed being used: it denies corrupt Venezuelan officials the ability to improperly value and sell off public assets in return for kickbacks,” a senior administration official told reporters in Washington. Venezuela’s Information Ministry and state oil company PDVSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Other countries also hinted at sanctions, with Spain leading European Union criticism of the election. “Venezuela’s electoral process has not respected the most basic democratic standards. Spain and its European partners will study appropriate measures,” tweeted Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The 14-nation “Lima Group” of countries in the Americas, from Canada to Brazil, said in a stinging statement it did not recognize the vote and would downgrade diplomatic relations. The group deplored Venezuela’s “grave humanitarian situation” behind a migrant exodus. In contrast, regional leftist allies of Venezuela, such as Cuba and Bolivia, sent their congratulations.  Maduro can also count on the support of China and Russia, which have provided billions of dollars in funding in recent years. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed Venezuela’s government and people could handle their own affairs and the choice of the people should be respected. The U.S. official said on Monday that the Trump administration had had “fairly pointed discussions” with China and Russia over the issuing of new credit to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government used ample state resources to get voters out on Sunday and public workers were pressured to vote. Falcon called for a new vote, complaining about the government’s placing of nearly 13,000 pro-government stands called “red spots” close to polling stations nationwide.   The often divided opposition coalition appeared more united after the election and said its boycott had worked. “The fraud has been exposed and today the world will reject it,” tweeted opposition leader Julio Borges. It was not clear what strategy the opposition would now adopt, but major protests seemed unlikely given widespread disillusionment and fatigue.  Demonstrators did barricade some streets in the southern city of Puerto Ordaz, drawing teargas from National Guard soldiers, witnesses said. In Caracas, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado unveiled a Venezuelan flag in a small street protest where demonstrators sang the national anthem.  Maduro, a former bus driver whose second term in office starts in January, faces a colossal task turning around Venezuela’s moribund economy but has offered no specifics on changes to two decades of state-led policies.  The bolivar currency is down 99 percent over the past year and inflation is at an annual 14,000 percent, according to the opposition-led National Assembly. Venezuela’s multiple creditors are considering accelerating claims on unpaid foreign debt, while oil major ConocoPhillips has been taking aggressive action in recent weeks against PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], as part of its claim for compensation over a 2007 nationalization of its assets in Venezuela. Trading of Venezuelan government and PDVSA debt was mixed but volumes remained thin in New York on Monday, with election results considered a formality and offering little to change investor viewpoints.  The benchmark government bond due 2027 was bid up 0.25 points to 29 cents on the dollar while the benchmark PDVSA 2022 recovered about half of its early losses to trade down 0.65 points in price to 26.851 cents on the dollar, according to Thomson Reuters data.  “I would have been surprised if we had seen some move in the market because that would imply that some bondholders were holding out for a positive election result, which was a very remote possibility,” said Gregan Anderson, macroeconomic strategist at Bulltick LLC in Miami.

2018-05-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. small-cap stocks look poised to extend a breakout move higher, especially if oil prices rally further and drive gains in smaller energy companies that have provided leadership in recent weeks, analysts and investors said.  The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks was on track for a fourth consecutive record closing high on Monday and registered its third week of gains Friday, sharply outperforming large-cap stocks on Wall Street. All three major indexes posted losses for the week. The Russell is up 11.8 percent since its Feb. 8 low for the year, while the S&P 500 is up just 5.8 percent since that date. The S&P 600 small-cap index is also at a record high. Energy shares within the S&P 600 have led recent gains, thanks to a jump in oil prices, which analysts said should boost earnings forecasts for the sector. The outperformance of small-cap stocks has been driven partly by the December U.S. tax overhaul. The legislation included steep corporate tax cuts that particularly benefited smaller-cap companies, which had been paying higher rates than large-cap companies overall. Recent trade tensions have also lifted shares of small caps, whose business is largely domestic, along with stronger U.S. economic growth. Some of those benefits have been reflected in small-cap earnings growth, which has outpaced growth of larger names. First-quarter profit growth for Russell 2000 companies is estimated at 33.8 percent, while earnings for the S&P 500 companies increased 26.2 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data.     For a graphic on S&P 500 vs Russell 2000, click reut.rs/2Llq9WT The S&P 600 energy index is up 33.1 percent for the quarter so far, the best-performing group, followed by health care, up about 12 percent. U.S. crude futures rose on Monday, trading above $72 a barrel, after registering a third straight week of gains on Friday, lifted by falling Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Even though (energy stocks have) had a good run, estimates will be climbing because analysts are raising their oil forecasts. So even though the stocks go up, they can still look cheap because the earnings estimate is going to go up as fast as the stock,” said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York, which has been overweight energy since January. J. Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois, said he has been buying shares of small-cap energy service providers. “Some of the smaller energy service providers got banged up so badly when oil went down,” he said. “But the ones who survived have a real opportunity to grow and take market share now that oil is at $70 a barrel.” Several investors also said they favored financials within the small-cap space, particularly regional banks, which have risen sharply this year compared with bigger banks. The S&P 500 bank index is up 0.5 percent year to date, compared with an 8 percent gain in the KBW regional banking index. The prospect of regulations being reduced further for some smaller banks has been a positive. Regulations have “been a big headwind in the last couple of years,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. “Easing regulation would benefit small-cap banks.” The health care group has benefited from merger activity, including Zoetis Inc’s announcement this week to buy Abaxis Inc . Health care has been the best-performing sector within the S&P 600 so far this year, up 26.3 percent.

2018-05-21,"* Wall St rallies on trade war truce * Russell 2000 small-cap index hits record * Dollar gains, euro pressured by Italy uncertainty (Updates to afternoon trading) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - Global stock markets climbed on Monday, and the U.S. dollar rallied to a five-month peak while the Japanese yen weakened after the United States and China agreed to halt a trade war between the two countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Sunday declared the trade battle with China “on hold” after the two countries agreed to drop their tariff threats in favor of hashing out a broader deal. The trade truce encouraged investors on Wall Street, sending up equity indexes that were also buoyed by news of $28 billion in U.S. merger deals. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 314.5 points, or 1.27 percent, to 25,029.59, the S&P 500 gained 21.53 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,734.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.26 points, or 0.56 percent, to 7,395.60. The small-cap Russell 2000 index hit a record high for a fourth straight session. Investors were also encouraged across the world, with MSCI’s broad index of world equity markets gaining 0.50 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.26 percent. In the short term, analysts said they expect stocks to continue to trend higher barring a major negative event. “This is an indication of what we’ll see near term, because we are through earnings, relatively light on macro data, and with geopolitics, it seems like some of the emotion has been reduced between now and the Korean summit,” said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York. The U.S.-China trade news also boosted the U.S. dollar to a five-month high as investors further pared back short positions on the greenback. The dollar index rose 0.05 percent, with the euro down 0.03 percent to $1.1771. The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback to 111.09 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3413, down 0.43 percent on the day. The yen was pressured by recent weaker Japanese data, the U.S.-China trade war easing and elevated U.S. Treasury yields, analysts said. The euro has suffered amid concerns about political uncertainty in Italy. Italy’s far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and to implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of the country’s debt pile. Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose to its highest since April 2017 before easing back. Oil prices reversed course from choppier early trading and climbed on Iran and Venezuela concerns. U.S. crude rose 1.36 percent to $72.25 per barrel and Brent was last at $79.16, up 0.83 percent on the day. Expectations that U.S. sanctions on Iran could curb the country’s crude exports have led crude prices higher in recent weeks, and the market is now weighing the possibility of additional sanctions on Venezuela following its presidential election.

2018-05-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Pivot Power plans to develop a 2-gigawatt (GW) network of grid-scale batteries and rapid electric vehicle charging stations in Britain, it said on Monday. The British-based firm plans 45 sites, each with a grid-scale 50-megawatt battery, at sub-stations which are connected to the grid. The 1.6-billion pound programme will provide infrastructure to support the take-up of electric vehicles and help reduce strain on the grid from the demands of massive EV charging and intermittent renewable energy. Britain has said it will ban all new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040. Pivot Power said the network will be the world’s biggest, storing enough power to supply 235,000 average homes a day. It aims to have operational batteries at 10 sites in 18 months, while a site on the south coast of England could be up-and-running by the middle of 2019, subject to planning approval.

2018-05-21,"MOSCOW, May 21 (Reuters) - Bulgaria is reviving plans to develop its Belene nuclear power plant and is open to Russian participation in the project, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said on Monday after talks with Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow. Bulgaria cancelled the 2,000 megawatt plant in 2012 after failing to find investors. It had also faced pressure from Washington and Brussels to limit its energy dependence on Russia, which was under contract to build the plant. The Bulgarian government decided last week to ask parliament to lift a ban on the development of the nuclear project. “There are already announcements for the revival of the Belene nuclear project, which supposes Russian participation as well,” Radev told reporters on Monday after meeting Medvedev. Bulgaria had to pay more than 620 million euros ($729 million) to Russian state nuclear company Rosatom for cancelling the Belene project, but also received nuclear parts for two 1,000 megawatt reactors. As a result, the country has to decide what to do with the equipment. Separately, Radev also said he hoped that talks for direct Russian gas deliveries to Bulgaria could be resumed. The prime minister and government hold most power in Bulgaria and the president has a largely ceremonial role, but he can shape public opinion, appoint ambassadors and veto legislation. $1 = 0.8508 euros

2018-05-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC is looking closely at a drop in oil output from Venezuela to see if the loss of supply from the member state warrants action by the group, sources familiar with the matter said. This marks a shift from earlier this year, when OPEC officials downplayed the drop in Venezuelan production. And it follows a rise in prices and a decline in global inventories that is making tighter supply more significant. Falling Venezuelan output due to an economic crisis has helped the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries deliver a bigger cut than intended under its pact with Russia and other producers to curb supplies and remove a global glut. The pact, which began in January 2017 and runs to the end of 2018, will be reviewed when OPEC meets on June 22 to review policy. OPEC’s compliance with the deal reached an unprecedented 166 percent in April, meaning it has cut well above its target. “Maybe, if the market is tight, there will be a need to make some adjustment,” one OPEC delegate who declined to be identified said, referring to the June meeting. Global inventories have eased back close to their five-year average, the measure originally targeted by OPEC and its allies.  The output reductions combined with worries about supply disruptions due to U.S. sanctions on Iran pushed oil prices above $80 a barrel last week, the highest since November 2014. Brent LCOc1 crude, the global benchmark, was trading at $78.33 on Monday. Iranian supply has not yet been affected by the U.S. decision to withdraw from an international nuclear deal and its warning of that it would impose touch sanctions. The energy minister for the United Arab Emirates, which currently holds the OPEC presidency, said last week that OPEC had more significant issues to deal with than Iran. He cited Venezuela. LONG-TERM LOW Before ministers from OPEC and its allies meet, Venezuelan output will feature in technical meetings including the Joint Technical Committee, which meets in Jeddah on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as other such meetings expected in June. Oil output in Venezuela hit a long-term low of 1.505 million barrels per day in April, almost 500,000 bpd below its OPEC output target. Venezuela’s leftist leader Nicolas Maduro won a new, six-year term on Sunday. “It will be discussed at the next meeting, for sure,” a second OPEC delegate said of Venezuelan production. OPEC is looking more closely at Venezuelan output as global inventories approach the supply cut deal’s original target. Oil inventories in OECD industrialised nations in March fell to 9 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million barrels above the average in January 2017, according to OPEC figures. Drawing stocks back to that average was the supply deals main goal, but officials have since said other metrics, such as oil industry investment, need to be considered. When inventories were higher earlier this year, officials had downplayed lower Venezuelan output. In January, a senior OPEC source ruled out raising output “even if there was a supply disruption” from Iran or Venezuela. Although the tone has now shifted, OPEC is not yet convinced a change in June to the deal on cutting supplies is warranted. “We should let the agreement go on,” said a third OPEC delegate, adding that adjustments could be made later in the year if needed.

2018-05-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to decide whether states have the right to ban uranium mining for public health reasons in a dispute over a moratorium Virginia put in place on the radioactive metal in 1982.  The court will hear a bid by a Virginia Energy Resources Inc subsidiary and other owners of the largest U.S. uranium deposit to revive a lawsuit thrown out by a lower court that sought to invalidate Virginia’s ban because it conflicted with a federal law that regulates nuclear power generation. Uranium, a main source of fuel for nuclear power plants and material in nuclear warheads, remains a strategic resource for electricity and national defense. The case could clarify how far states can go in regulating access to uranium resources. The plaintiffs, Virginia Uranium Inc, a subsidiary of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Virginia Energy Resources, Cole Hill LLC and Bowen Minerals LLC, value the southern Virginia uranium deposit at up to $6 billion, according to court papers. Mining it could inject billions of dollars into the local economy, the plaintiffs said.  The dispute concerns whether the federal Atomic Energy Act of 1954 preempts Virginia’s mining ban under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law. The Atomic Energy Act gives the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission the sole power to regulate radiation safety standards for milling uranium ore and disposing of waste byproducts known as tailings, key steps in the production of nuclear fuel. But it does not cover conventional uranium mining on non-federal land.  The plaintiffs said the ban was motivated by concerns over radiation hazards, which is subject to exclusive federal oversight.  Virginia enacted its ban on uranium mining amid concerns about environmental and public safety hazards. After unsuccessfully lobbying Virginia legislators to allow it, the plaintiffs filed suit in 2015, arguing that the federal law regulates nuclear safety and preempts state laws that attempt to do so.  President Donald Trump’s administration has backed the companies in the case. Under the appeals court ruling, U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a brief, “States could, for example, pass laws that impede physical access to nuclear facilities, diminish the availability of source materials or equipment necessary for nuclear development, or erect financial barriers to the development of nuclear energy.” The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the plaintiffs last year, prompting their Supreme Court appeal.

2018-05-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday agreed to consider reviving a lawsuit by Indian villagers seeking to hold a Washington-based international financial institution responsible for widespread environmental damage they blame on a power plant it financed. The justices will hear an appeal by the villagers of a lower court ruling that the International Finance Corp was immune from such lawsuits under federal law. IFC, part of the World Bank Group, is an international institution with 184 member countries that helps secure financing for projects in developing nations. The case revolves around the IFC’s decision in 2008 to provide $450 million in loans to help construct the coal-fired Tata Mundra Power Plant in Gujarat, India. IFC loans include provisions requiring that certain environmental standards are met. The legal question before the justices is whether there are limits to immunity for entities like the IFC under the 1945 International Organizations Immunity Act, as there are for foreign countries under a 1976 law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Lead plaintiff Budha Ismail Jam and other fisherman and farmers who live near the plant sued in federal court in Washington in 2015, saying the IFC had failed to meet its obligations.  They said the plant’s construction and operations did no comply with the environmental plan set out for the project. The local environment has been devastated, according to the plaintiffs, with marine life killed by water discharges from the plant’s cooling system and coal dust contaminating the air. A district court in 2016 and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2017 ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the IFC is immune from such litigation under the 1945 law.  The court will hear arguments and decide the case in its next term, which begins in October.

RDIF leverages its own capital by investing in partnership with foreign funds. It will meet with President Vladimir Putin during the economic forum this week along with the heads of around 40 other investment funds from 20 countries which manage more than $13.5 trillion in assets. Russia will need to spend at least 8 trillion roubles ($130 billion) over the next six years to meet economic goals set in new decrees that Putin signed after being sworn into the presidency at the start of May. RDIF and its foreign partners plan to invest 1.5 trillion roubles ($24 billion) in the next two years. They have previously invested 1.2 trillion roubles in more than 50 projects, Dmitriev said. During the St Petersburg forum, RDIF plans to announce more than 10 projects for hundreds of million dollars with investment from France, Japan and Saudi Arabia in infrastructure, agriculture, chemicals and medicine.

2018-05-21,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s first-floating nuclear power plant arrived in the Arctic port of Murmansk over the weekend in preparation for its maiden mission, providing electricity to an isolated Russian town across the Bering Strait from Alaska. The state company behind the plant, called the “Akademik Lomonosov”, says it could pioneer a new power source for remote regions of the planet, but green campaigners have expressed concern about the risk of nuclear accidents. Greenpeace has called it the “nuclear Titanic”. Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, which developed the floating power plant, said that it docked the unit in Murmansk on Saturday where it was towed from St Petersburg, the city where it was built. In Murmansk it will take on board a supply of nuclear fuel. It will then will be towed to the town of Pevek in the Far Eastern region of Chukotka, separated from the U.S. state of Alaska by the 86-km (53 miles) wide Bering Strait. It will start operations there next year. The plant will replace a coal-fired power plant and an ageing nuclear power plant supplying more than 50,000 people with electricity in Chukotka, Rosatom said. Rosatom has long planned to launch the sea-borne power units, which, with their mobile, small capacity plants, are best suited to remote regions. It says they can help the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions blamed for global warming. The small plants were designed to make it possible to supply electricity to hard-to-reach areas of Russia. They can operate non-stop without the need for refuelling for 3-5 years. Environmental protection groups, including Greenpeace, have sent a letter to Rosatom boss Alexei Likhachyov demanding strict adherence to safety standards and saying they were watching the floating facility’s development “with great concern”. The letter calls for full and unrestricted regulatory oversight by the Russian nuclear regulator and an international study into the environmental impact before the reactors are loaded with fuel and tested. “Nuclear reactors bobbing around the Arctic Ocean will pose a shockingly obvious threat to a fragile environment which is already under enormous pressure from climate change,” Jan Haverkamp, nuclear expert for Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe, said in a statement last month.

2018-05-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Ukraine is likely to need a new IMF bailout programme in the coming years to plug an up to $5.5 billion-a-year (4.1 billion pounds-a-year) hole in its finances, the Institute of International Finance has warned. Ukraine is hoping to get a long-delayed $1.9 billion tranche from its current IMF package in the next three to six months, but new analysis from the Washington-based IIF on Monday laid out the country’s precarious longer-term picture. Real exports are now roughly half the level they were in 2008, economic growth is a better but not stellar 2.5 - 3 percent a year and its energy import bill is rising in tandem with global oil and gas prices.  It’s the country’s external finances that pose the biggest risk though, the IIF said. For Kiev to remain “comfortable” next year, bond market lenders will have to ‘rollover’ — re-lend — 100 percent of their loans to the country. However, if that ‘rollover’ rate stayed at last year’s 85 percent level the government would face a $3 billion funding gap and one of $5.5 billion if rate dropped down to 75 percent. “Unless capital inflows pick up substantially, Ukraine will likely need fresh IMF support in coming years,” to meet its needs, the IIF analysis said. “The cumulative financing gap for 2019-21 could reach $16.5 billion, or 90 percent of international reserves in a low rollover rate scenario.” Ukraine’s current IMF programme is due to finish next year. The country has so far received $8.4 billion of what was originally supposed to be $17.5 billion of aid. Its overall amount of short-term debt has fallen and its reserves have more than doubled during the programme, but both are projected to reverse these moves as it comes to an end. Between now and 2021 it has $20 billion of IMF and other ‘official sector’ debt payments due. The government’s revenues  will also be squeezed, the IIF said, as new gas pipes allow Russia to pump its gas around Ukraine rather than through it, meaning it will no longer have to pay transit fees.

Wall Street was set to open higher, with U.S. S&P mini futures up 0.6 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.3 percent, hovering near 3-month highs and London’s FTSE 100 hit a new record, up 0.5 percent following a positive session in Asia. “There’s certainly a ‘feel-good’ sentiment on risky assets” due to the U.S. trade announcement, said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared the U.S. trade war with China “on hold” following an agreement to drop their tariff threats that have roiled global markets this year. Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and U.S. negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. Barbier de la Serre cautioned, however, that given the lack of details available about the agreement between Washington and Beijing, it was too early to call it a definitive turning point. He added that a number of question marks, such as on the prospects for world growth, inflation and rising rates, should also keep investors on their toes. As safe-haven demand for debt fell, U.S. bond prices were under pressure, keeping their yields not far from last week’s peaks with the 10-year Treasuries yield at 3.072 percent, near a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit on Friday. In the currency market, higher U.S. yields helped to strengthen the dollar about 0.15 percent against a basket of currencies while the euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1762. Italian politics contributed to the pressure on the euro as the far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and implement spending plans seen by some investors as threatening the sustainability of Italy's debt pile. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh “It is something that creates a lot of nervousness, but of course on the other hand one has to wait”, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday morning. The Milan bourse started the day sharply lower but progressively clawed back losses and limited its fall to 0.8 percent. Italy’s 10-year bond yield rose to nearly three percent in early morning trade, its highest level since July 2017 but also eased back to about 2.28 percent. Oil prices, which had initially held firm near 3-1/2-year highs on the easing trade tensions, edged down. Brent crude futures were at $78.18 per barrel, down 0.4 percent. The market was also keeping an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro faces fresh international censure after his re-election in a vote denounced by his foes as a farce in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation. Oil prices had been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to a solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East.

Sunday’s spill left the port city, Kenya’s second largest city, cut off from the mainland for most of Sunday while police cordoned off the area to mitigate the risk of fire.  Thousands of road, plane and train travelers were stranded until the highway was reopened in the evening. It was unclear how much of the petrol the train was carrying spilled into the ocean, police said, adding they had begun an investigation into what caused the accident.  On Monday, a team of engineers and other local experts were at work recovering five train wagons that were submerged in the ocean, Mombasa police chief Johnstone Ipara told Reuters.  The water that the wagons had careered into was slick with a substance that appeared to be a petrol product, a Reuters witness said. The train, which had departed from Mombasa on Sunday, was traveling on a decades-old line that carries goods from ships that arrive at Mombasa’s port to the capital Nairobi.  A new cargo line opened in January, following the inauguration of a passenger line linking the two cities last year.

2018-05-21,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Li5RO7 By John Kemp LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - For all the bullish commentary about oil prices at the moment, hedge fund managers have continued to take profits after the recent rally and are trimming their net long positions rather than adding to them. Focusing on what people do rather than what they say is one of the most important lessons for any good analyst (actions always speak louder than words). Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 16 million barrels in the week to May 15 (tmsnrt.rs/2Li5RO7). Fund managers have cut their net long position in the petroleum complex in each of the last four weeks by a total of 71 million barrels, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. Liquidation has been concentrated in crude oil, where the net long position in Brent and WTI has been reduced by a total of 124 million barrels over the last four weeks. Net long positions in Brent have fallen by 84 million barrels over five consecutive weeks, while net length in NYMEX and ICE WTI has dropped by 53 million over four weeks. But, while portfolio managers have been reducing their bullish exposure to crude, they have been boosting their net long positions in refined fuels. Net length in refined fuels has risen by 53 million barrels since the middle of April, with increases in U.S. gasoline (+26 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+24 million) and European gasoil (+2 million). Portfolio managers have accumulated record net positions of 124 million barrels in U.S. gasoline and 160 million barrels in European gasoil, as well as a near-record 86 million barrels in U.S. heating oil. The rotation of positions from crude to fuels reflects strong consumer demand and shrinking inventories of products, coupled with profit-taking in crude oil after a strong rally since the end of June 2017. The rotation away from crude also likely explains the weakening of the nearby calendar spreads in Brent in recent trading sessions. The first three contract months nearest to expiry account for more than 42 percent of all open contracts in Brent futures and options, according to the Intercontinental Exchange. Assuming hedge fund positions are distributed in the same proportion, then the liquidation of hedge fund positions will have been concentrated in nearby months. In fact, hedge funds tend to focus disproportionately on nearby contracts, where liquidity and turnover is greatest, so the impact of hedge fund selling on nearby months will have been magnified. Momentum-following funds are especially likely to focus on nearby contract months because of the greater liquidity. As hedge funds accumulated a record long position in Brent and WTI between June 2017 and the first three months of 2018, the concentration of buying nearby helped push futures prices deeper into backwardation. But as fund managers trim those positions, it has removed much of the support for nearby prices, and caused the backwardation to narrow sharply.

2018-05-21,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Tatiana Bautzer SAO PAULO, May 21 (Reuters) - Rampant corruption scandals and a deep recession soured many foreign investors on Brazil in recent years, but one Canadian group saw opportunity. Brookfield Asset Management Inc and its subsidiaries have made nearly a dozen major acquisitions there since 2013. The companies have spent about $10 billion on energy, infrastructure and real estate assets few others would touch due to the legal, political and economic risks involved. “A crisis is a good time to find value,” said a person close to the group, who called Brookfield a “contrarian investor.” That includes buying assets from companies entangled in the blockbuster “Car Wash” investigation, which jailed dozens of businessmen and politicians. The deals confirmed Brookfield’s reputation as one of the strongest-stomached investors in Brazil. In 2016, for example, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP led a $5.2 billion acquisition of a pipeline operator from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company at the heart of the Car Wash scandal. Recently, another Petrobras pipeline network with half the capacity fetched a top bid of around $8 billion from other investors. Bargain-hunting Brookfield gave that deal a pass. The Canadians’ savvy is built on nearly 120 years of experience in South America’s largest economy. But the recent buying spree pushed the company to new extremes of due diligence and bulletproofing, according to interviews with six people involved in the deals. The company declined to comment on investments in Brazil, which account for about 15 percent of its $286 billion portfolio and represent its biggest market after the United States. Chief Executive Bruce Flatt, whom some call the Warren Buffett of Canada for his value-investing approach, called recent Brazil acquisitions “quality businesses from sellers in need of capital” in a February letter to investors. Brookfield’s purchase of gas pipeline operator Nova Transportadora do Sudeste SA (NTS) from Petrobras was part of a controversial divestment program aimed at trimming the oil firm’s massive debt load. Critics have decried the privatizations, and Ciro Gomes, a leading leftist presidential candidate, has pledged to reverse sales of state energy assets if elected this year. Foreseeing the risk, Brookfield tasked dozens of lawyers with drafting an ironclad agreement. Brookfield has a right to compensation if Petrobras changes the contracts in a way that hurts the Canadians’ cash flow, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The head of Brazilian investment banking at a global bank, who was not involved in the NTS deal, said it was an example of Brookfield’s willingness to bet big while protecting itself. “Everyone was stunned by their $5 billion bid at the time,” the banker said. That successful deal persuaded other investors to consider bidding on the other Petrobras pipeline unit, the person added. Analysts at Saibus Research raised their target price for shares in Brookfield Infrastructure Partners after the NTS deal, citing a boost to its recurring profit margins. Shares have climbed 18 percent to more than $38 in New York since the deal was reported. Started in 1899 as the Sao Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company, Brookfield grew into a diversified global investment firm. Until 2005, it went by the name Brascan, a reflection of its roots as a Canadian investment firm in Brazil. Brookfield, too, has grappled with graft allegations in Brazil. Its homebuilding unit was among around 30 developers accused of paying bribes to building inspectors in Sao Paulo between 2010 and 2012. Former employees of the unit, which later changed its name to Tegra, confessed to paying bribes and were cooperating witnesses in the trial of the building inspectors. Brookfield said the company was not a target of the investigation and cooperated with authorities. In a separate case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation in 2012 into accusations that Brookfield’s Brazil shopping mall unit bribed Sao Paulo officials to win construction permits. The SEC dropped the case in 2015 without bringing any enforcement action. Brookfield denied wrongdoing. One of Brookfield’s toughest recent deals will test its ability to avoid fallout from another municipal graft scandal. Last year it agreed to pay $1 billion for a 70 percent stake in a sewage and water utility owned by Odebrecht SA, an engineering group ensnared in the Car Wash probe. Prosecutors accused Odebrecht of paying bribes to secure contracts with some of the 186 municipalities where the utility operates. Odebrecht, which reached a leniency deal with prosecutors, said in a statement it is cooperating with law enforcement and “has created internal controls to detect and prevent unlawful behavior.” Some 60 lawyers working for Brookfield spent eight months assessing the risks. They arranged for $100 million of the purchase price to be set aside to cover potential liabilities if city governments break off contracts or demand compensation due to alleged kickback schemes. Since subsidiary Brookfield Business Partners LP closed the deal in April 2017, none of the municipal contracts held by the company, now called BRK Ambiental, were rescinded and only one is in litigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

2018-05-21,"(Repeats with no changes) By Caroline Valetkevitch and April Joyner NEW YORK, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S. small-cap stocks look poised to extend a breakout rally, especially if oil prices advance deeper into levels last seen in 2014 to drive further gains in the small energy companies that have provided leadership in recent week, analysts and investors said. The Russell 2000 index of small capitalization stocks closed at a record high for a third day in a row on Friday and registered its third week of gains, sharply outperforming large-cap stocks on Wall Street, with all three major indexes posting losses for the week. The Russell is up 11.1 percent since its Feb. 8 low for the year, while the S&P 500 is up just 5.1 percent since that date. The S&P 600 small-cap index is also at a record high. Energy shares within the S&P 600 have led recent gains, thanks to a jump in oil prices, which analysts said should boost earnings forecasts for the sector. The outperformance of small-cap stocks has been driven partly by the December U.S. tax overhaul. The legislation included steep corporate tax cuts that particularly benefited smaller-cap companies, which had been paying higher rates than large-cap companies overall. Recent trade tensions have also lifted shares of small caps, whose business is largely domestic, along with stronger U.S. economic growth. Some of those benefits have been reflected in small-cap earnings growth, which has outpaced growth of larger names. First-quarter profit growth for Russell 2000 companies is estimated at 33.8 percent, while earnings for the S&P 500 companies increased 26.2 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 600 energy index is up 31.3 percent for the quarter so far, the best-performing group, followed by health care , up 12.2 percent. U.S. crude futures edged lower on Friday but remained above $71 a barrel and registered a third straight week of gains, lifted by falling Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Even though (energy stocks have) had a good run, estimates will be climbing because analysts are raising their oil forecasts. So even though the stocks go up, they can still look cheap because the earnings estimate is going to go up as fast as the stock,” said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York, which has been overweight energy since January. J. Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois, said he has been buying shares of small-cap energy service providers. “Some of the smaller energy service providers got banged up so badly when oil went down,” he said. “But the ones who survived have a real opportunity to grow and take market share now that oil is at $70 a barrel.” Several investors also said they favored financials within the small-cap space, particularly regional banks, which have risen sharply this year compared with bigger banks. The S&P 500 bank index is down 0.3 percent year to date, compared with a 6.2 percent gain in the KBW regional banking index . The prospect of regulations being reduced further for some smaller banks has been a positive. Regulations have “been a big headwind in the last couple of years,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. “Easing regulation would benefit small-cap banks.” The health care group has benefited from merger activity, including Zoetis Inc’s announcement this week to buy Abaxis Inc. Health care has been the best-performing sector within the S&P 600 so far this year, up 26.8 percent.

2018-05-21,"* U.S. wants to sell China more oil, gas and food products * But U.S. exports constrained by bottlenecks, regulatory hurdles * Top Asia buyers of U.S. crude oil: tmsnrt.rs/2IRqD8Z By Florence Tan and Dominique Patton SINGAPORE/BEIJING, May 21 (Reuters) - China has pledged to buy more U.S. goods to reduce America’s huge trade deficit and help avoid exacerbating a trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, with energy and commodities high on Washington’s list of products for sale. The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the governments agreed to drop tariff threats and work on a wider agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday. Washington is especially keen to sell more of the United States’ surging oil and gas production. Yet infrastructure bottlenecks mean energy and commodity exports can grow only gradually, and only if U.S. oil, gas and other goods remain cost attractive against global competition. Morgan Stanley estimates it could take up to three years to increase Chinese purchases of U.S. goods by $60 billion to $90 billion, with a rise in agricultural imports in the near term followed by energy. Total U.S. oil and gas exports to China in 2017 were worth $4.3 billion, based on average prices, a far cry from a deficit reduction target of $200 billion. But U.S. exports are rising, and China has spent $2 billion on U.S. oil in the first quarter of 2018 alone. Increased purchases of U.S. oil will help China replace Iranian supplies, which are expected to fall as the United States re-imposes sanctions on Tehran. “Buying U.S. crude would help with the Iranian situation in ... that these barrels from the U.S. would provide additional supplies at a time when buyers will be expected to cut Iranian volumes,” said Michal Meidan of consultancy Energy Aspects. China’s U.S. oil import bill this year could rise to $9 billion to $11 billion with purchases rising to 300,000 to 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the second half of 2018, according to Energy Aspects. That would still be only a fraction of China’s import needs of 9.6 million bpd in April, worth around $20 billion. And while U.S. exports may grow somewhat, infrastructure bottlenecks for the time being hold back sales. U.S. oil export terminals are small by global standards and the biggest tankers - Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) - don’t fit through the Panama Canal. Having to take the detour around Africa, they are at a cost disadvantage against producers from the Middle East, Africa and Europe. Washington also wants the United States to export more liquefied natural gas (LNG) to China. While LNG shipments have increased, there are only two U.S. export facilities, both of which have largely contracted out their supplies. There are also restraints in China due to pipeline and terminal capacities. U.S. LNG exports to China could eventually surge if Chinese companies become partners in many of the U.S. export projects that still seek financing. China could direct its state-owned soybean crushers to buy more of America’s surplus oilseed, said Paul Burke, North Asia regional director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council. That would potentially add 14 million tonnes of imports worth $6 billion to this year’s trade bill, at the expense of major exporters, Brazil and Argentina. Soybeans were the United States’ second-largest export to China by value, worth $12 billion last year. China easing controls on processing imports of genetically modified strains of corn and fully allocating its low-tariff import quota for wheat would also add to grain shipments. Analysts reckon buying more poultry, beef and pork would be another way to boost trade, but tough import regulations would likely limit volumes without big concessions from Beijing. Beijing removed anti-dumping tariffs on U.S. poultry in February after eight years, but a ban due to avian influenza remains in place. Without the ban, the U.S.-China poultry business could be worth up to $600 million, an industry expert estimated. China has in the past made large purchases of American pork for its strategic reserves. There is also strong demand for imported meat among the country’s middle class consumers. But China has zero tolerance on the use of growth promoter beta-agonist ractopamine, widely used by U.S. pork farmers, and synthetic hormones used in U.S. beef. The government lifted a 14-year-old ban on U.S. beef last year, but it has only approved a dozen processors for export. In the first quarter, U.S. imports accounted for less than 1 pct of China’s total beef imports, but a pick-up in purchases would challenge Australia, Brazil and Uruguay. “Big (meat) purchases and shipments need time to put together. You can’t just turn on the spigot,” said an industry source who declined to be identified. Reporting by Florence Tan in SINGAPORE and Dominique Patton in

The pan-European STOXX 600 was up 0.4 percent, hovering near 3-month highs, London’s FTSE 100 hit a new record and rose 0.9 percent and U.S. S&P mini futures rose 0.6 percent following a positive session in Asia. “There’s certainly a ‘feel-good’ sentiment on risky assets” due to the U.S. trade announcement, said Stephane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared the U.S. trade war with China “on hold” following an agreement to drop their tariff threats that had roiled global markets this year. Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. Barbier de la Serre cautioned, however, that given the lack of details available about the agreement between the U.S. and China, it was too early to call it a definitive turning point. He added that a number of question marks, such as on the prospects for world growth, inflation and rising rates, should also keep investors on their toes. As safe-haven demand for debt fell, U.S. bond prices were under pressure, keeping their yields not far from last week’s peaks with the 10-year Treasuries yield at 3.072 percent, near a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit on Friday. In the currency market, higher U.S. yields helped to strengthen the dollar about 0.30 percent against a basket of currencies while the euro dipped 0.25 percent to $1.1746. The common currency was also under pressure as Italy's far-right League and the 5-Star Movement agreed on a candidate to lead their planned coalition government and implement spending plans which some investors believe threaten the sustainability of the country's debt pile. tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh “It is something that creates a lot of nervousness, but of course on the other hand one has to wait”, ECB governing council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday morning. The Milan bourse started the day sharply lower but progressively claimed back losses and limited its fall to 0.3 percent. Italy’s 10-year bond yield nearly rose to three percent in early morning, their highest level since July 2017 but also eased back to about 2.26 percent. Oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs also on easing trade tensions. Brent crude futures were at $78.97 per barrel, up 0.6 percent. The market is also keeping an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro faces fresh international censure after his re-election in a vote foes denounced as a farce, cementing autocracy in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation. Oil prices have been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to a solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East. The “risk on” sentiment on the market also spurred gains copper prices  with the exception of aluminium, which was pressured by more than 100,000 tonnes of inflow last week.

2018-05-21,"KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Unidentified gunmen killed five mine-clearance workers in Afghanistan on Monday who were preparing for construction of an international gas pipeline, while one worker was kidnapped, officials said. The $8 billion TAPI pipeline, intended to transport some 33 billion cubic metres of natural gas a year along an 1,800 km route from Turkmenistan through Afghanistan to Pakistan and India, is seen as vital for the future of Afghanistan’s economy. Daoud Ahmadi, a spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province, said the demining team was working in the southern province’s Maiwand district when attacked early on Monday. “The victims had told the district governor and district police that they had no problem with Taliban so they would not need any protection,” he said. The route of the Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India (TAPI) pipeline passes through large areas under Taliban control or influence. But when the Afghan section of the project was launched this year, the Taliban said they would cooperate because of its importance for the country. However, construction work will still have to pass through lawless areas of southern Afghanistan where armed groups with shifting loyalties operate and security is highly uncertain. A Taliban spokesman said the incident was being investigated and said the victims were not wearing the usual uniform worn by TAPI workers.

2018-05-21,"TOKYO, May 21 (Reuters) - Japan received its first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Monday from Dominion Energy Inc’s newly completed Cove Point export plant, the beginning of a jump in imports from the United States by the world’s biggest buyer of the fuel. The docking of the tanker LNG Sakura at Tokyo Gas Co’s Negishi terminal near Tokyo is another marker of shifting global energy flows as the United States ramps up exports of gas and oil from shale formations. The cargo is the first of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG a year Japanese companies are purchasing under long-term contracts from Cove Point in Maryland. A ramp-up of purchases now by Japan may draw some of the sting from President Donald Trump’s criticisms of the Asian nation’s trade imbalance with the United States. “The first cargo from Cove Point could not come at a more timely juncture for Japan in the light of trade tensions,” said Nicholas Browne, senior gas analyst at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie in Singapore. “U.S. LNG imports will reduce the trade deficit to an extent, while also helping Japan’s politicians demonstrate they are doing their part,” he said. Tokyo Gas said in a statement the 177,000-cubic metre Sakura docked earlier on Monday and is unloading about 70,000 tonnes of LNG. It passed through the Panama Canal, which was widened in 2016 to allow passage of large LNG tankers. Tokyo Gas has a contract to buy 1.4 million tonnes a year of Cove Point LNG for 20 years. Kansai Electric Power has contracted to take 800,000 tonnes a year. The Japanese companies, which have agreed to swap cargoes of LNG when needed, declined to say under what contract the shipment was bought. An industry source said the cargo was originally contracted to Kansai Electric. Japanese buyers have been buying cargoes on a spot basis from Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, which exported its first cargo in February 2016. Since then Japanese buyers have imported a little over 1.4 million tonnes of LNG total from the United States, paying about 93 billion yen ($835 million). Japan had previously bought cargoes from Alaska. U.S. President Donald Trump has singled out Japan and others countries, including China, for running trade surpluses with the United States, demanding that they take steps to reduce the perceived imbalance. To placate Trump, Japanese officials have suggested buying more U.S. energy supplies, although private companies have said they do not have the capacity to take in more. Japan’s trade surplus with the United States was 616 billion yen in April, up 4.7 percent from the same period a year earlier, official data showed on Monday. The Cove Point contracts were signed before Trump took office, but any increase in LNG imports may help Japanese officials show Washington they are responding to his demands. “The start up of Cameron and Freeport LNG (in the United States) next year, which also have contracts to Japan will further help,” said Woodmac’s Browne. Dominion Energy was not immediately available for comment outside operating hours. The company said recently the Cove Point terminal had entered commercial service for natural gas liquefaction and exports.

2018-05-21,"(Adds details, oil production, background) By Chijioke Ohuocha and Paul Carsten ABUJA, May 21 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s economic growth slowed in the first quarter of 2018 for the first time since the country pulled out of recession last year as the non-oil sector struggled, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Monday. The economy grew by 1.95 percent in the first quarter lifted by the oil sector. That was a slight dip from 2.11 percent year-on-year in the final quarter of 2017. The economy shrank 0.91 percent in the first quarter of 2017, the bureau said. Growth rates had been bouncing back since the third quarter of 2016, when the recession, its first in 25 years, bottomed out. Nigeria exited that contraction last year largely due to higher oil prices, with the country relying on crude sales for around two-thirds of government revenue. Last week parliament passed a record 9.12 trillion naira ($29.8 billion) budget for 2018 aimed at boosting growth in west Africa’s biggest economy nine months before the country’s next presidential election. President Muhammadu Buhari has been trying to diversify the economy away from oil by boosting the non-oil sector but those efforts are struggling. The oil sector grew 14.77 percent in the period, higher than the non-oil sector which rose 0.76 percent between January to March, the NBS said. Oil production stood at 2 million barrels per day in the quarter, up from 1.95 million in the previous quarter. The GDP data comes a day before the central bank announces its decision on interest rates, with recent economic data showing that there’s scope for a rate cut as inflation dropped to a more than two year low in April of 12.48 percent. The bank has kept its rate at 14 percent since July 2016 to support the naira and curb inflation.

AC Energy is in talks with potential partners that could be interested in taking a stake in its wholly-owned AC Thermal unit, company officials said, although they declined to identify would-be investors or give any indications on price. “We cannot go on record with respect to valuation,” AC Energy President and CEO Eric Francia said in an email to Reuters on Monday, declining to comment on local newspaper reports saying the sale may raise up to $1 billion. AC Energy’s assets are 80 percent thermal and 20 percent renewable, with a total value of 135 billion pesos ($2.6 billion), according to a recent CLSA report. Its thermal assets include the 632-megawatt GNPower Mariveles coal plant, a partnership with Aboitiz Power Corp’s (AP.PS) subsidiary Therma Power and Power Partners, and the 552-MW GNPower Kauswagan, in which it has an 85 percent economic stake. The company said it was open to a partnership with both local and foreign investors for the unit, and would make a final decision within the year. The company expects to expand its overall energy capacity to more than 5,000 megawatts by 2025 from 1,600 MW currently. Following its acquisition of Salak and Darajat geothermal assets in Indonesia in 2017, AC Energy is assembling a portfolio of renewable energy assets in the region this year, including a 75 MW wind project in Indonesia and over 300 MW of solar projects in Vietnam. AC Energy nearly doubled its net profit to 593 million pesos in the first quarter of this year, boosted by robust contributions from its Indonesia investment and from its coal and renewable platforms. “We will not stop investing in the Philippines, but we also see a lot of opportunities outside, within the Southeast Asian market,” a company spokeswoman told Reuters. “The objective is to reach a 50-50 mix by 2025.” Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz; Editing by Joseph Radford",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ayala-energy-sale/philippines-ayala-looks-to-sell-big-stake-in-coal-unit-turn-to-renewables-idUKL3N1SS2ME,21 May 2018,"AC Energy Inc, part of Philippine

2018-05-21,"DUBAI, May 21 (Reuters) - Property stocks in Dubai and Abu Dhabi rose in early Monday trading after the United Arab Emirates approved a system to grant residency visas of up to 10 years to investors and specialists. Emaar Properties rose 4 percent and DAMAC Properties climbed 1.3 percent, lifting the Dubai index by 1.3 percent. The UAE move “will surely boost the performance of the real estate sector and give comfort to the investors there and specially property owners,” said Marie Salem, director of capital markets at FFA Dubai. Investors and specialists in scientific, technical, medical and research fields will receive UAE residency visas for up to 10 years, the government said. The families of those categories of foreigners will also receive the same visa validity. The UAE cabinet also approved steps on Sunday that would allow for 100 percent ownership of UAE-based businesses by foreign investors by the end of this year. The Dubai real estate sector has been a drag on the market this year, with shares of Emaar down over 15 percent despite Monday’s surge. Residential property prices in Dubai have registered a 12-month decline of 2 percent on average, while rents have fallen  by up to 5 percent in some areas, according to real estate consultancy Cavendish Maxwell. In Abu Dhabi, Aldar Properties rose 1.4 percent, outperforming the Abu Dhabi index which was up 0.4 percent. The Saudi index was flat in early trading with some of the consumer stocks trading lower.

2018-05-21,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A pipeline across Australia and gas imports from as far away as the United States are on the drawing board as the country races to plug a domestic supply gap that is driving up east coast gas prices and threatening jobs. Although Australia is the world’s No. 2 liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, much of its east coast gas is tied up in long-term export contracts while mainstay supplies in the populated southeast are drying up more quickly than expected. Imports will be needed within four years, warn industry executives and experts, which means gas prices that have more than doubled in the past three years aren’t going to fall and could even rise another 50 percent to match global spot prices. “Some people still find the import of LNG to what is meant to be an energy superpower absurd, and they have a point, it does seem very weird,” said Tennant Reed, national public policy adviser at the Australian Industry Group. The government is under fire from angry household gas users and industry, particularly big gas users such as petrochemical and fertiliser manufacturers which have warned that high prices are making some businesses uncompetitive.  Coal seam gas from Queensland, which now supplies around 30 percent of the east coast market, costs around A$6 ($4.50) a gigajoule (GJ) to produce, then has to be piped at a cost of around A$1.85-A$2.45 per GJ, which has driven up gas prices to well above A$8. Shortages will grow from 2022 due to a steep output decline in the main gas field that has supplied southern Australia for five decades, the Australian Energy Market Operator has warned. In the longer term, gas is expected to flow from developments around the country, including more coal seam gas from Queensland, new finds off the coast of Victoria, and shale gas from the Northern Territory, but these are years from development. For a related graphic, click reut.rs/2LhzaAr The near term answer is to import LNG, either from west to east or from offshore. “Some imports will be necessary,” said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of advisory firm EnergyQuest. At least two groups – AGL Energy (AGL.AX) and a consortium led by iron ore mining tycoon Twiggy Forrest - are looking to import LNG to eastern Australia to meet demand from around 2021. Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the two big LNG producers in Western Australia, have expressed interest in supplying AGL’s proposed floating storage and regasification facility. LNG could also come from fields in Papua New Guinea and Indonesia to the country’s north or from as far away as the United States, where the country’s shale boom has led to gas exports, Bethune said. The government, meanwhile, is studying the feasibility of building a A$5 billion, 4,000 km (2,500 mile) pipeline from Western Australia. Consultants Rystad Energy estimated gas could be delivered by pipeline from west to east for around A$7.50 a GJ in 2023, well below imported LNG, which it estimated would cost A$12.90, including regasification costs, by then. But industry executives say a pipeline could only be built with government subsidies, given the huge cost. “You can ship Australian gas around to the east coast a hell of a lot cheaper than building a pipeline from the Pilbara to Moomba (in South Australia),” Santos Ltd (STO.AX) Chief Executive Kevin Gallagher told reporters this month. There are plenty of other projects in the pipeline. “I think you’ll start to see the upstream industry responding to higher prices,” said Beach Energy (BPT.AX) Chief Executive Matt Kay, whose company is looking to beef up production in South Australia and possibly offshore Victoria. Shale gas in the Northern Territory, which recently lifted a ban on fracking, is seen as a potential powerhouse source, but experts say it will take at least seven years to develop. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and PetroChina (601857.SS) could bring on new coal seam gas in Queensland from their Arrow Energy joint venture, but have yet to hit the go button, and the output may end up in north Asia to fulfil export contracts. Santos wants to develop a huge coal seam gas project at Narrabri in outback New South Wales state, but has yet to get state approval as it battles opposition from green groups.  But even if any of those start producing within the next five years, their high costs are unlikely to drive down prices.

2018-05-21,"NEW DELHI, May 21 (Reuters) - India is looking at ways to keep rising fuel prices in check, its oil minister said on Monday, with retail rates for diesel and petrol touching record highs in capital city New Delhi and financial hub Mumbai. Prices at the pump have surged on the back of rallying international markets for crude oil, which last week hit their strongest since late-2014 amid ongoing production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). “Various alternatives are being looked at,” Dharmendra Pradhan said in a televised speech, adding that he would “work out something soon”. He did not give details. Opposition leaders have criticised the government for failing to rein in rising fuel prices, a politically-sensitive issue in one of the world’s biggest economies. India is particularly at risk from stronger global prices for crude oil as it is the No.3 importer of the commodity, buying about 80 percent of its oil needs. On Monday, industry lobby group FICCI called for an immediate cut in the excise duty on oil imports. The cost of the growing thirst for oil around Asia will surpass $1 trillion this year, about twice as much as in 2015 and 2016, as oil prices touch $80 per barrel and continental demand hits a record.

2018-05-21,"* U.S. stock futures up 0.6 pct, China shares shine * U.S. bonds steady but seen vulnerable * Trade war truce seen as positive for risk sentiment * Oil up after Venezuelan election * European shares seen 0.4-0.7 pct higher By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, May 21 (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Monday after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declared the U.S.-China trade war “on hold” following their agreement to suspend the tariff threats that roiled global markets this year. U.S. S&P mini futures rose 0.60 percent in Asian trade on Monday. European stocks are expected to follow suit, with spread-betters seeing a higher opening of 0.7 percent in Britain’s FTSE and 0.4 percent in Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.45 percent, led by strong gains in greater China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.3 percent, Taiwanese shares 1.3 percent. The Shanghai Shenzen CSI 300 gained 0.7 percent, hitting five-week highs. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.4 percent. Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. “The weekend talks appear to have made progress. While they still need to work out details of a wider trade deal, it is positive for markets that they struck a truce,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. As safe-haven demand for debt fell, U.S. bond prices were under pressure, keeping their yields not far from last week’s peaks. The 10-year Treasuries yield stood at 3.076 percent , near a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit on Friday. “Recent data suggests the U.S. economy is very strong, hardly slowing down in Jan-Mar. The world economy slowed in that quarter but it appears to be rebounding. And recent rises in oil prices are likely to lift inflation expectations further,” said Tomoaki Shishido, senior fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities. “We expect more selling until the next Fed’s meeting in June,” he said. In the currency market, higher U.S. yields helped to strengthen the dollar against a wide range of currencies. The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.1748, hitting its lowest level since mid-December. The common currency was also hit after two anti-establishment parties pledged to increase spending in a deal to form a new coalition government in Italy. The dollar maintained an uptrend against the yen, rising 0.5 percent to 110.29 yen,, a high last seen in January. Some emerging market currencies remained fragile. The Indonesian rupiah dropped 0.3 percent to 2 1/2-year lows and the Turkish lira slipped 0.7 percent to record lows. Oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs, drawing support from easing trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. The market is keeping an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro won a new six-year term, an outcome that could trigger additional sanctions from the United States and more censure from the European Union and Latin America. Oil prices have been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to a solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East. U.S. crude futures rose 0.8 percent to $71.83 per barrel, near last week’s 3 1/2-year high of $72.30 while Brent crude futures notched up 0.8 percent to $79.10 per barrel. It had risen to $80.50 last week, its highest since November 2014. Venezuelan debt is barely traded in Asia but bonds issued by Venezuelan oil company PDVSA maturing in 2020 were quoted at a yield around 19.4 percent, a tad above last week’s low around 18.4 percent. Elsewhere U.S. soybeans jumped 2 percent on the Sino-U.S. agreement to drop tariff threats. In April, China proposed a 25 percent duty on U.S. soybeans as part of its response to Washington’s plans to impose tariffs on a range of Chinese products. Reporting by Hideyuki Sano

2018-05-21,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Rampant corruption scandals and a deep recession soured many foreign investors on Brazil in recent years, but one Canadian group saw opportunity. Brookfield Asset Management Inc and its subsidiaries have made nearly a dozen major acquisitions there since 2013. The companies have spent about $10 billion on energy, infrastructure and real estate assets few others would touch due to the legal, political and economic risks involved. “A crisis is a good time to find value,” said a person close to the group, who called Brookfield a “contrarian investor.” That includes buying assets from companies entangled in the blockbuster “Car Wash” investigation, which jailed dozens of businessmen and politicians. The deals confirmed Brookfield’s reputation as one of the strongest-stomached investors in Brazil. In 2016, for example, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP led a $5.2 billion acquisition of a pipeline operator from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled oil company at the heart of the Car Wash scandal. Recently, another Petrobras pipeline network with half the capacity fetched a top bid of around $8 billion from other investors. Bargain-hunting Brookfield gave that deal a pass.  The Canadians’ savvy is built on nearly 120 years of experience in South America’s largest economy. But the recent buying spree pushed the company to new extremes of due diligence and bulletproofing, according to interviews with six people involved in the deals. The company declined to comment on investments in Brazil, which account for about 15 percent of its $286 billion portfolio and represent its biggest market after the United States. Chief Executive Bruce Flatt, whom some call the Warren Buffett of Canada for his value-investing approach, called recent Brazil acquisitions “quality businesses from sellers in need of capital” in a February letter to investors. Brookfield’s purchase of gas pipeline operator Nova Transportadora do Sudeste SA (NTS) from Petrobras was part of a controversial divestment program aimed at trimming the oil firm’s massive debt load.  Critics have decried the privatizations, and Ciro Gomes, a leading leftist presidential candidate, has pledged to reverse sales of state energy assets if elected this year. Foreseeing the risk, Brookfield tasked dozens of lawyers with drafting an ironclad agreement. Brookfield has a right to compensation if Petrobras changes the contracts in a way that hurts the Canadians’ cash flow, according to three people with knowledge of the matter. The head of Brazilian investment banking at a global bank, who was not involved in the NTS deal, said it was an example of Brookfield’s willingness to bet big while protecting itself. “Everyone was stunned by their $5 billion bid at the time,” the banker said. That successful deal persuaded other investors to consider bidding on the other Petrobras pipeline unit, the person added.  Analysts at Saibus Research raised their target price for shares in Brookfield Infrastructure Partners after the NTS deal, citing a boost to its recurring profit margins. Shares have climbed 18 percent to more than $38 in New York since the deal was reported. Started in 1899 as the Sao Paulo Railway, Light and Power Company, Brookfield grew into a diversified global investment firm. Until 2005, it went by the name Brascan, a reflection of its roots as a Canadian investment firm in Brazil. Brookfield, too, has grappled with graft allegations in Brazil. Its homebuilding unit was among around 30 developers accused of paying bribes to building inspectors in Sao Paulo between 2010 and 2012. Former employees of the unit, which later changed its name to Tegra, confessed to paying bribes and were cooperating witnesses in the trial of the building inspectors.  Brookfield said the company was not a target of the investigation and cooperated with authorities. In a separate case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) opened an investigation in 2012 into accusations that Brookfield’s Brazil shopping mall unit bribed Sao Paulo officials to win construction permits. The SEC dropped the case in 2015 without bringing any enforcement action. Brookfield denied wrongdoing. One of Brookfield’s toughest recent deals will test its ability to avoid fallout from another municipal graft scandal.  Last year it agreed to pay $1 billion for a 70 percent stake in a sewage and water utility owned by Odebrecht SA, an engineering group ensnared in the Car Wash probe. Prosecutors accused Odebrecht of paying bribes to secure contracts with some of the 186 municipalities where the utility operates. Odebrecht, which reached a leniency deal with prosecutors, said in a statement it is cooperating with law enforcement and “has created internal controls to detect and prevent unlawful behavior.” Some 60 lawyers working for Brookfield spent eight months assessing the risks. They arranged for $100 million of the purchase price to be set aside to cover potential liabilities if city governments break off contracts or demand compensation due to alleged kickback schemes.  Since subsidiary Brookfield Business Partners LP (BBU_u.TO) closed the deal in April 2017, none of the municipal contracts held by the company, now called BRK Ambiental, were rescinded and only one is in litigation, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.

2018-05-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. small-cap stocks look poised to extend a breakout rally, especially if oil prices advance deeper into levels last seen in 2014 to drive further gains in the small energy companies that have provided leadership in recent week, analysts and investors said.  The Russell 2000 index of small capitalisation stocks  closed at a record high for a third day in a row on Friday and registered its third week of gains, sharply outperforming large-cap stocks on Wall Street, with all three major indexes posting losses for the week. The Russell is up 11.1 percent since its Feb. 8 low for the year, while the S&P 500 .SPX is up just 5.1 percent since that date. The S&P 600 small-cap index .SPCY is also at a record high. Energy shares .SPSMCE within the S&P 600 have led recent gains, thanks to a jump in oil prices, which analysts said should boost earnings forecasts for the sector. The outperformance of small-cap stocks has been driven partly by the December U.S. tax overhaul. The legislation included steep corporate tax cuts that particularly benefited smaller-cap companies, which had been paying higher rates than large-cap companies overall. Recent trade tensions have also lifted shares of small caps, whose business is largely domestic, along with stronger U.S. economic growth. Some of those benefits have been reflected in small-cap earnings growth, which has outpaced growth of larger names. First-quarter profit growth for Russell 2000 companies is estimated at 33.8 percent, while earnings for the S&P 500 companies increased 26.2 percent from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. The S&P 600 energy index is up 31.3 percent for the quarter so far, the best-performing group, followed by health care .SPSMCA, up 12.2 percent. U.S. crude futures CLc1 edged lower on Friday but remained above $71 a barrel and registered a third straight week of gains, lifted by falling Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Even though (energy stocks have) had a good run, estimates will be climbing because analysts are raising their oil forecasts. So even though the stocks go up, they can still look cheap because the earnings estimate is going to go up as fast as the stock,” said Steve DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies in New York, which has been overweight energy since January. J. Bryant Evans, portfolio manager at Cozad Asset Management in Champaign, Illinois, said he has been buying shares of small-cap energy service providers. “Some of the smaller energy service providers got banged up so badly when oil went down,” he said. “But the ones who survived have a real opportunity to grow and take market share now that oil is at $70 a barrel.” Several investors also said they favoured financials within the small-cap space, particularly regional banks, which have risen sharply this year compared with bigger banks. The S&P 500 bank index .SPXBK is down 0.3 percent year to date, compared with a 6.2 percent gain in the KBW regional banking index .KRX. The prospect of regulations being reduced further for some smaller banks has been a positive. Regulations have “been a big headwind in the last couple of years,” said Anthony Saglimbene, global market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Troy, Michigan. “Easing regulation would benefit small-cap banks.” The health care group has benefited from merger activity, including Zoetis Inc’s (ZTS.N) announcement this week to buy Abaxis Inc ABAX.O. Health care has been the best-performing sector within the S&P 600 so far this year, up 26.8 percent.

2018-05-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - After the near collapse of his company following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico disaster and a three-year slump in oil prices, BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley is hardly relaxed. “It doesn’t feel like we are in a serene time for any energy company,” Dudley told Reuters in an interview. BP is stronger today than at any other time since the 2010 Deepwater Horizon rig accident.  With oil prices at their highest since late 2014 and BP shares back to levels not seen in more than 8 years, it is once again in a position to contemplate boosting dividends and acquiring, Dudley said. Sitting in his office in BP’s central London headquarters in St James Square, Dudley, 62, said he intends to carry on leading the company into 2020 and navigate it through a phase of expansion and new uncertainty following a tumultuous eight years at the helm. The oil and gas sector is looking to retain its relevance as economies battle climate change by weaning themselves from their dependence on fossil fuels, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. For BP, it is a two-speed race. The 110-year old company is undergoing its fastest growth in recent history with new oil and gas fields from Egypt and Oman to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, riding a tide of higher oil prices following the 2014 downturn. It is gradually paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs for the Deepwater Horizon accident which left 10 employees dead. Regarding the danger of the company going bankrupt at the time, Dudley said: “The worst moment was when I heard that our debt was untradable back in the summer of 2010... To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible.” Dudley says he no longer sees BP as an acquisition target after facing years of speculation it could be bought out. The company is focused on increasing production and cash flow while reducing its large debt pile, after which it will consider boosting shareholder returns such as dividends although “we’re not at that point yet”, Dudley said. Longer-term challenges also loom.  Investors are increasingly pressing energy companies to find ways to adapt to the energy transition, and Dudley is looking to strike a balance between reducing a large carbon footprint while securing revenue. “This is the great dual challenge that the industry and BP faces: how to supply the world’s energy on multiple fronts of growing population and doing it with less emissions,” said Dudley, who was appointed to the helm of BP months after the April 2010 spill. BP, like rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell, is betting on natural gas, the least polluting hydrocarbon, to sustain an expected surge in demand for electricity as economies grow and transportation is electrified. Gas is also playing a key role as a back-up to renewable energy such as wind and solar in power generation. To that end, BP is expanding its gas production through new projects in Oman, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago.  Gas already accounts for over 55 percent of its production. “I am optimistic about the climate change if you can combine renewables wind and solar and natural gas. To me that’s part of the big answer,” Dudley said in an interview with Reuters. In the early 2000s BP introduced the slogan “Beyond Petroleum” and adopted a sunburst logo after launching an $8 billion expansion into renewables. The company was forced to write off its solar business 10 years later, but still retains a large U.S. onshore wind business and biofuels plants. Now, Dudley is taking a cautious approach, investing in smaller start-up companies in renewables, clean fuels and battery charging docks.  “We have to go slow and pick the right low carbon fuels,” he said. BP “will be a broad-based company that supplies all forms of energy that are needed that can be done economically.” The company will invest $500 million per year in low-carbon energy and technology in the coming years out of a total spending of $15 to $17 billion, a range which Dudley said the company could stay within. “If a shareholder or someone else came to BP tomorrow and said here is $10 billion to invest in low carbon energies for us, we would not know how to do that yet.” BP is also expanding its vast global network of petrol stations and investing in convenience stores and charging spots, hoping to retain its dominant brand as electric vehicles become more popular. “I’m not worried about BP in this area. The most strategic thing we can do is to get our balance sheet strong so that when we have the firepower we can do anything in these areas.” BP expects demand for oil to peak in the late 2030s, after which it will plateau and gradually decline. For BP, whose roots go back to 1908 with the discovery of Iran’s first oil field, the days of the black gold are far from dead.  While oil prices in recent weeks have hit their highest levels since late 2014 at $80 a barrel, BP are working on an assumption that prices will remain at a range of $50-$65 per barrel due to surging U.S. shale output and OPEC’s ability to crank up output. Mega projects involving complex, multi-billion facilities such as huge offshore platforms that came to symbolize the technological prowess of the world’s top oil companies are most likely a thing of the past, Dudley said. Instead, BP is opting for phased developments that require less capital and less time to construct, which make them easier to control at a time of uncertainty over oil prices. “Many of the companies in the industry are remembering the lesson learned during the $100 oil era (which) is take it in phases,” Dudley said.  BP is applying this approach in many of its main production hubs such as Egypt and Gulf of Mexico, where it can continue raising production into the early 2020s, Dudley said. BP’s oil and gas output is set to reach around 4 million bpd by the end of the decade, a level last seen in 2009, with more than a fifth of that coming from projects started since 2016. It is partnering with top oil producing nations which have some of the lowest costs of extraction such as Oman, Azerbaijan and most importantly Russia, where BP has a 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft and where it draws one third of its production. BP has a relatively small shale business, focused mostly on gas, but Dudley is considering growing in the sector, which has attracted billions of dollars in investments in recent years. “(Shale) comes down to economics and competitiveness on what is on offer. So far they feel overheated... it is not a burning need to fill that in the portfolio, but if it is attractive, we will.” BP could place a bid for BHP Billiton’s shale assets, Dudley said. BP’s position in Russia has put the firm in the spotlight as the United States and Europe tighten sanctions on Moscow.  Dudley, who sits on the board of Rosneft, believes BP can continue there and act as a bridge between countries. “We don’t apologize for doing business in Russia,” said Dudley. “Certainly today within the boundaries of the sanctions we can and do operate without issues.” BP will continue to operate in Russia and expand projects with Rosneft even though the company has had to turn down certain offers to develop projects offshore or in the Arctic, he said. Dudley also said BP remained committed to its stake in Rosneft, which it received following the 2013 sale of TNK-BP.

2018-05-21,"* AGL sticks to plan to shut Liddell plant in 2022 * Chinese-owned Alinta to look for other cheap power generation * Government urges AGL to commit funds to replace Liddell (Adds comment from government, Alinta) May 21 (Reuters) - Australia’s top power producer AGL Energy on Monday turned down a A$250 million ($188 million) offer for an ageing coal-fired energy plant from Chinese-owned Alinta Energy and shunned government pleas to keep the facility open beyond 2022. AGL’s Liddell power plant, which supplies 10 percent of the electricity used in Australia’s most populous state, New South Wales, is seen as crucial for energy security as the grid becomes more reliant on intermittent wind and solar power. A sale to Alinta would have kept the plant open for longer and increased competition in the market, keeping a lid on soaring electricity prices - a hot political potato with state and federal elections looming in the next 12 months. “AGL’s decision is disappointing,” Australian energy minister Josh Frydenberg said in a statement. He said AGL’s chief executive had first raised the prospect of selling Liddell in a meeting with the prime minister last year, although AGL has long said it had no plan to sell the plant as it needs the power to meet its customers’ needs. Alinta said it was disappointed with AGL’s decision but was not going to raise its offer. “We will now move on and progress other opporutnities to acquire low-cost generation sources in order to provide affordable and reliable energy to our customers,” an Alinta spokesman said. AGL paid virtually nothing when it acquired Liddell in 2014, but has since spent around A$920 million to keep the plant running reliably until 2022, when it will be 50 years old. It said the offer from Alinta was too low, based on the cash it could make running the plant for another four years and then converting the site for a battery installation. AGL last year outlined a A$1.36 billion plan to replace Liddell’s capacity after 2022, including building two new gas-fired plants, upgrading its Bayswater coal-fired plant, and building 1,600 megawatts of wind and solar farms. So far, it has only committed funding for a small portion of the total plan. “The government calls on AGL to financially commit to all other stages of its replacement plan,” Frydenberg said. $1 = 1.3291 Australian dollars

2018-05-21,"* China Daily says country did not give in * State media says China, U.S. have great potential for cooperation * Mnuchin says U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” (Adds comment from U.S. business leader) BEIJING, May 21 (Reuters) - Chinese state media on Monday praised a significant dialling back of trade tension with the United States, saying China had stood its ground and the two countries had huge potential for win-win business cooperation. A trade war is “on hold” after the world’s largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday. The previous day, Beijing and Washington said they would keep talking about measures under which China would import more energy and agricultural commodities from the United States to narrow the $335 billion annual U.S. goods and services trade deficit with China. The official China Daily said everyone could heave a sigh of relief at the ratcheting down of the rhetoric, and cited China’s chief negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, as saying the talks had proved to be “positive, pragmatic, constructive and productive”. “Despite all the pressure, China didn’t ‘fold,’ as U.S. President Donald Trump observed. Instead, it stood firm and continually expressed its willingness to talk,” the English-language newspaper said in an editorial. “That the U.S. finally shared this willingness, means the two sides have successfully averted the head-on confrontation that at one point seemed inevitable”, it said. During an initial round of talks this month in Beijing, the United States demanded that China reduce its trade surplus by $200 billion. No dollar figure was cited in the countries’ joint statement on Saturday. The ruling Communist Party’s People’s Daily said that in the energy and agriculture sectors the two countries had obvious synergies, with the United States having the capacity to satisfy the massive Chinese market. “The ballast stone of Sino-U.S. ties are an equal and mutually beneficial trade and business relationship. Its essence is win-win cooperation,” it said. But China was not being forced to increase imports as a way to ward off the trade tensions or because the country had submitted to outside pressure, the newspaper said in a commentary. China will naturally need to import more to satisfy demand from its increasingly affluent consumers, the newspaper wrote. “Trade wars have no winners,” it added in the commentary, published under the pen name “Zhong Sheng”, meaning “Voice of China”, used to give the paper’s view on foreign policy issues. However, some people in U.S. business groups, who had been pushing for tougher U.S. policies to pressure China to reform market barriers, expressed frustration and disappointment, saying it would be hard for the administration to rebuild momentum to take on Chinese industrial policies. James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based lawyer and a former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the Trump administration’s move to walk back its threatened trade actions was premature, and a “lost opportunity” for American companies, workers and consumers. “The Chinese are in a state of quiet glee knowing that Trump’s trade team backed off on sanctions without getting any real and meaningful concessions out of Beijing,” Zimmerman said.

U.S. S&P mini futures rose 0.60 percent in Asian trade on Monday. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.55 percent in early trade, led by strong gains in greater China. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 1.0 percent, Taiwanese shares 1.1 percent and mainland shares 0.4 percent. Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.4 percent. Mnuchin and U.S. President Donald Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said the agreement reached by Chinese and American negotiators on Saturday set up a framework for addressing trade imbalances in the future. “The weekend talk appears to have made progress. While they still need to work out details of a wider trade deal, it is positive for markets that they struck a truce,” said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities. As safe-haven demand for debt fell, U.S. bond prices were under pressure, keeping their yields not far from last week’s peaks. The 10-year Treasuries yield stood at 3.065 percent , near a seven-year high of 3.128 percent hit on Friday. “Recent data suggests the U.S. economy is very strong, hardly slowing down in Jan-Mar. The world economy slowed in that quarter but it appears to be rebounding. And recent rises in oil prices are likely to lift inflation expectations further,” said Tomoaki Shishido, senior fixed income analyst at Nomura Securities. “We expect more selling until the next Fed’s meeting in June,” he said. In the currency market, higher U.S. yields helped to strengthen the dollar against a wide range of currencies. The euro dipped 0.1 percent to $1.1756, hovering above Friday’s five-month low of $1.1750. The common currency was also hit after two anti-establishment parties pledged to increase spending in a deal to form a new coalition government. The dollar maintained an uptrend against the yen, rising 0.20 percent to fetch 110.97 yen,, close to Friday’s four-month high of 111.085. Oil prices held firm near 3-1/2-year highs also on easing trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies. The market is keeping an eye on Venezuela, where President Nicolas Maduro appeared to be set for re-election, an outcome that could trigger additional sanctions from the United States and more censure from the European Union and Latin America. Oil prices have been supported by plummeting Venezuelan production, in addition to a solid global demand and supply concerns stemming from tensions in the Middle East. U.S. crude futures rose 0.8 percent to $71.83 per barrel, near last week’s 3 1/2-year high of $72.30 while Brent crude futures notched up 0.8 percent to $79.10 per barrel.

2018-05-21,"BEIJING, May 21 (Reuters) - Top Chinese oil and gas producer PetroChina is stepping up natural gas supplies from both domestic fields and imports to meet customer demand, parent company CNPC said on Monday. PetroChina raised April gas supplies by 14 percent over a year earlier, CNPC said on its website, without giving specific volumes. Reuters reported on Friday the state major has since early May curbing the feed of gas to some users in the northern and western parts of the country to help head off possible shortages next winter. PetroChina lifted production in the first four months of this year at major domestic fields Changqing, Southwest, Tarim and Qinghai by more than 2 percent from the same time in 2017 to 30.5 billion cubic metres, CNPC said PetroChina also raised imports of natural gas by nearly 29 percent during the same period. The company also stepped up pumping gas to storage, with stock fill in April reaching 1.49 bcm, 33 percent more than a year earlier. It is expected to supply 10 percent more gas from the storage for next winter’s peak demand versus the previous heating season. Reporting by Chen Aizhu

Brent crude futures were at $78.87 per barrel at 0045 GMT, up 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. Brent broke through $80 for the first time since November 2014 last week. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $71.68 a barrel, up 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. The U.S. trade war with China is “on hold” after the world’s largest economies agreed to drop their tariff threats while they work on a wider trade agreement, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday, giving global markets a lift in early trading on Monday. “The U.S. and China agreeing to no trade war will be positive for oil prices given that the possibility of a full-out trade war would have dealt a significant blow to global growth,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. However, crude prices were some way off the November 2014 highs reached last week as many traders and analysts say there is enough supply to meet demand despite ongoing production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), plunging output in crisis-struck Venezuela and looming U.S. sanctions against major oil producer Iran. “Without a further escalation in geopolitical risk, oil might be due a pullback,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. BP’s Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters he expected a flood of U.S. shale and a possible reopening of OPEC taps to cool oil markets after crude rose above $80 a barrel last week. Dudley said he saw oil prices falling to between $50 and $65 a barrel due to surging shale output and OPEC’s capacity to boost production to replace potential falls in Iranian supplies due to sanctions. The U.S. oil rig count, an early indicator of future output, was at 844, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes. That was the same count as the week before, which marked the highest level since March 2015. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-05-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Seven years ago, two middlemen launched civil lawsuits to seek payment for helping arrange a $1.3 billion oil deal in Nigeria. Now, nine current and former executives or contractors from Italy’s Eni(ENI.MI) and British-Dutch giant Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), including ENI Chief Executive Claudio Descalzi, have been accused by Italian prosecutors of paying bribes to secure the license to explore a large offshore oilfield in 2011.    If found guilty, the individuals on trial face possible jail terms for bribery. All deny wrongdoing, as do Shell and Eni. The criminal trial will proceed in Milan on June 20 after a short initial hearing on May 14. Some of the key issues in the trial came to light during the two separate civil suits filed by a Nigerian, Emeka Obi, and a former Russian diplomat, Ednan Agaev, a Reuters review of court filings shows.  Both men said they were owed millions of dollars by a Nigerian company, Malabu Oil and Gas, for arranging meetings with Shell and Eni. The judge in Obi’s case upheld evidence that Obi arranged meetings between former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete, who was convicted of money laundering in an unrelated case in France in 2007, and representatives of Eni, and that he negotiated on Etete’s behalf with Shell.  In addition, documents produced in Agaev’s case showed that when Eni and Shell paid for the license, they deposited more than $1 billion into a Nigerian government escrow account in London but most of the money later ended up with Malabu, which was controlled by Etete, the judge said. The judges found that, in a conflict of interests, Etete had a stake in Malabu and was also oil minister when the Nigerian government awarded the company the license to explore the field in 1998, a decision that was reversed in 2001, reinstated in 2006 and later challenged by Shell.  These details helped Italian prosecutors put together their case, industry insiders say. Etete denies charges of bribery for channeling money from the deal to Nigerian politicians. He and his lawyers did not respond to requests for comment by phone and email. Shell said by email that if improper payments are shown to have taken place, they were not made with Shell’s “knowledge, authorization or on its behalf.” It said it believes the judges will find there is “no case” against Shell or its ex-employees. Eni said by email that it could not comment on the case. It has previously said it concluded the deal with the Nigerian government without the involvement of intermediaries and that it had no commercial agreement with Malabu.  Eni and Shell said they were unable to confirm who owned Malabu when they acquired Oil Prospecting Licence (OPL) 245.  But in her decision on Obi’s civil case in London in July 2013, Lady Justice Elizabeth Gloster upheld Etete’s control of Malabu, court records show. Basing her decision on testimony and documents, she said Etete had a stake in Malabu when it was awarded OPL 245 in 1998 and had been “the principal beneficial owner” since later that year.  She said Obi had meetings with Shell representatives before the OPL 245 deal, though she did not say how many, and that he frequently met officials from Eni.  On one occasion, Etete, Descalzi, Obi and Agaev sat together in a Milan restaurant at a dinner for the “the main personalities” to meet and assess the seriousness of their intentions, she said. She said Obi should be awarded at least $100 million for his work as a “dealmaker”, the court records show.  Agaev launched arbitration to seek a $65 million fee from Malabu for his work as a go-between and eventually reached an out-of-court settlement, details of which were not disclosed. While the arbitration was under way, he asked a court in New York to freeze a Nigerian government account in London that held $74 million, most of it due to be transferred to Malabu. The court said it had no authority to freeze the money but reviewed documents showing Eni and Shell had deposited just over $1 billion into the account as payment for OPL 245 in May 2011. A further $208 million was released from escrow as a “signature bonus” for the government, court records show. Around $800 million was transferred to Malabu in August 2011 and the rest was frozen pending the civil cases. Agaev declined to comment about his civil case or the Milan trial. Obi could not be reached for comment and attorneys who have represented him declined to pass on his contact details. Eni and Shell said their payments were above board as they went directly to the Nigerian government. JP Morgan Chase, which ran the escrow account, has denied negligence.
