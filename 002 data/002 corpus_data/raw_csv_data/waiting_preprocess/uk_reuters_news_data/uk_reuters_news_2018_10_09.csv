2018-10-09,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union nations, voicing concern over a U.N. report on global warming, agreed on Tuesday to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, as Germany warned that overly challenging targets risked harming industry and jobs. Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry competitiveness, EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg talked for more than 13 hours until nearly midnight to reach a compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on Europe’s powerful carmakers. “We saw a really complicated discussion,” Europe’s Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said of the compromise that gained the support of 20 nations, with 4 voting against and 4 abstaining. “I never believed in the beginning that such a strong support would be obtained.” The final rules will now be hashed out in talks beginning on Wednesday with the EU’s two other lawmaking bodies: the European Parliament, which is seeking a more ambitious climate target, and the European Commission, which proposed a lower one. In a joint statement earlier, the EU ministers expressed deep concern over a U.N. report calling for rapid and unprecedented action to contain global warming and renewed commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. Several countries had sought a higher, 40 percent reduction in car emissions, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers last week, but softened their position in talks. However, Ireland and the Netherlands were among those who voiced disappointment with the compromise deal, which also set a 30 percent target for cutting emissions from vans by 2030. Germany, with its big auto sector, had backed an EU executive proposal for a 30 percent cut for fleets of new cars and vans by 2030, compared with 2021 levels. Climate campaigners say Germany has still not learned to be tougher on the auto industry, despite the scandal that engulfed Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 when it admitted to using illegal software to mask emissions on up to 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. Germany had the backing of several eastern European nations early in the talks against more ambitious targets, EU sources said. But a last-minute amendment helped ease concerns over the new rules, which also create a crediting system encouraging carmakers to raise sales of electric cars. It would allow for a different accounting in countries where the current market penetration of zero- and low-emissions vehicles is less than 60 percent below the average in the bloc. Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace, leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. But a call by the EU’s climate commissioner and 15 EU nations for the bloc to increase its pledge to cut emissions by 45 percent under the Paris accord has met with resistance. Ahead of U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, the bloc’s 28 environment ministers reiterated their commitment to leading the fight to limit global warming. They said the EU was ready to “communicate or update” its Nationally Determined Contribution, the efforts by each country to reduce emissions, by 2020. Raising it would require the approval of all 28 nations.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets edged lower on Tuesday, with a decline in the materials sector offsetting rising energy shares, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields pulled back from multi-year highs and helped weaken the U.S. dollar. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a global benchmark, rose to a seven-year high at 3.261 percent before paring gains to trade at 3.2044 percent on worries about global growth. The International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, as well as its U.S. and China estimates for next year, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year. European shares closed higher in a choppy session, rising above six-month lows, as worries about a likely clash in Europe over Italy’s budget plans eased and energy heavyweights such as Eni SpA and Total lifted benchmarks.    The oil and gas index was the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe, up 1.5 percent after crude prices rose as more evidence emerged that Iran’s crude exports were falling. [O/R] Wall Street’s materials index fell 3.4 percent, with PPG Industries leading the decline after the chemicals company warned late on Monday that its earnings would be hit by higher raw material costs and softer demand in China. PPG fell 10.1 percent and the industrials sector, the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500, slid 1.5 percent. S&P 500 companies are vulnerable to global growth since  about half their business comes from overseas, noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “If industrials and materials are weighed on because of concerns about global activity, it’s going to cast a pall over the market at large,” Luschini said. Tech stocks edged off two-month lows in a sign the recent sell-off has dissipated as the speed of rapidly rising bond yields drove investor reactions. The strength of the U.S. economy has generated a rotation from the higher valuation areas of the market to more reasonably valued areas, said Andrew Acheson, director of U.S. growth equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 56.21 points, or 0.21 percent, to 26,430.57 and the S&P 500 shed 4.09 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,880.34. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,738.02. MSCI’s index of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.13 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.31 percent. The dollar dipped due to a fall in U.S. bond yields after touching a seven-week peak against a basket of currencies. Sterling rose after a report that rekindled hopes that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit deal. Ongoing worries about a stand-off between the European Union and Italy over the country’s budget had pushed Italian borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and had weighed on the euro. Investors dumped U.S. bonds last week on fears that domesticinflation might accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve tohasten the pace of interest rate hikes.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts first sentence with potential impact on Mexican oil production, adds comments by energy minister, Pemex CEO, other details) By Ana Isabel Martinez and Marianna Parraga MEXICO CITY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-run Pemex said on Tuesday it has discovered up to 180 million barrels of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico’s shallow waters, a find that is expected to help boost the country’s dwindling oil production. Pemex, whose oil and gas output has been declining since 2004, said light and heavy crudes were found in seven reservoirs along the Mulach and Manik fields in the southern Gulf of Mexico, close to existing infrastructure for production and transportation. “These are the reservoirs that will feed the country’s reserves,” said Mexican Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell at a news conference with Pemex executives. The discovery of proven, possible and probable reserves (3P) in Mulach and Manik follows discoveries announced by Pemex in recent years in four nearby fields. Together they will require $7 billion to $10 billion in investment, including drilling rigs, pipelines and at least one production platform. Even amid budgetary constraints, Pemex in recent years has increased exploration efforts, with a 25 percent success rate in confirming reserves, below rates registered in previous decades, according to the firm’s exploration chief Jose Antonio Escalera. Rising crude prices and an expanding budget now allow the company to do more to reverse the country’s falling proven reserves, which last year declined 7 percent to 8.48 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Pemex expects new production from the Xikin, Esah, Kinbe, Koban, Mulach and Manik offshore fields to add up to 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and 350 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas by the second half of 2020. The first field to add barrels would be Xikin, discovered three years ago, where early production is expected in 2019. The Esah field would follow in the first quarter of 2020. Mexico expects the downward trend in its oil reserves to turn positive in two years, following a constitutional energy overhaul enacted in 2013, said Joaquin Coldwell. The new fields will also contribute relatively quickly to Pemex output in shallow waters, where the vast majority of its production originates. Pemex has recently been facing production problems at one of its main shallow-water areas, the Xanab light crude field. “We still don’t have a specific production goal for this year. There’s an emergency plan to ease Xanab’s (output) declination,” Pemex’s CEO, Carlos Trevino Medina, said at the news conference.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts, adds minister comments, background) MILAN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will transport Russian gas to Germany will be completed on time even if new sanctions are imposed on Moscow, Russia’s energy minister said on Tuesday. “We hope there will be no additional sanctions but if there are the project will be completed anyway,” Alexander Novak said on the sidelines of an energy conference in Milan. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity, is led by Russian gas giant Gazprom and financed by five Western companies. The United States opposes the project and President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, saying it was wrong to support the Baltic gas pipeline. Divisions exist among EU member states over whether to do more business with Moscow despite its military incursions in Ukraine and Syria. “Everything is on time and as of today the first commercial gas will be ready by the end of 2019,” Novak said. Russia is keen to press ahead with Nord Stream 2 which will bypass traditional routes through Ukraine. Asked about the Gazprom-led Turkish Stream project to pipe Russian gas via the Black Sea to southern and southeast Europe, Novak said that was also on track for first commercial gas by end-2019. “The second marine-based part of the project is 85 percent complete,” he said. At the conference on Tuesday, Novak had a bilateral meeting with EDF’s Italian energy unit Edison. Last year, Gazprom signed an agreement with Edison and Greece’s state-controlled gas company DEPA to work on building a southern route for Russian gas supplies from Russia to Europe, across Turkey and Greece to Italy. “We agreed to continue this,” Novak said. Later on Tuesday an Edison spokeswoman confirmed the meeting. “It was a positive and warm meeting that we thank the minister for, ahead of the planned visit by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to Moscow later this month,” she said.

2018-10-09,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp’s latest shift on climate includes a $1 million donation to a political action committee’s lobbying campaign to promote a U.S. tax on carbon-gas emissions, a central factor in global warming. The contribution, made to the Americans for Carbon Dividends  political action committee of the Climate Leadership Council (CLC), was disclosed by the group on Tuesday, less than a month after Exxon agreed to contribute $100 million to oil companies’ efforts to develop technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.      “Applying a uniform cost across the economy is consistent with our principles on how to manage the risk of climate change,” Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri said in an email. “We’ve been supportive of a revenue-neutral price on carbon for a decade.”  The $1 million contribution will be spread over two years. Exxon, the world’s largest publicly traded oil company, has supported a carbon tax in the past and has stepped up efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in its operations. Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials  seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming.  The Climate Leadership Council’s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group. “We’re in the very early days of this organization,” said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40-a-ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money  raised to be returned to consumers.  The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said.  The council’s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose about one percent on Tuesday on growing evidence of falling Iranian crude exports before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions, as well as a partial production shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael.  Brent crude futures rose $1.09 to settle at $85.00 a barrel, a 1.30 percent gain. The global benchmark hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week but slipped as low as $82.66 on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 67 cents to settle at $74.96 a barrel, a 0.90 percent gain. Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, as buyers sought alternatives ahead of U.S. sanctions that take effect on Nov. 4. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, exported 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in that seven-day period, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. An industry source who also tracks exports said October shipments so far were below 1 million bpd. That is down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before U.S. President Donald Trump in May withdrew the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. A vessel carrying 2 million barrels of Iranian oil discharged the crude into a bonded storage tank at the port of Dalian in northeast China on Monday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and a shipping agent with knowledge of the matter. The country previously held oil in storage at Dalian during the last round of sanctions in 2014 that was later sold to buyers in South Korea and India.  Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, last week said it would increase crude output next month to 10.7 million bpd, a record. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday described a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports as “nonsense.” “There is growing concern that suppliers such as Saudi Arabia and Russia will struggle to compensate for potential production declines from Iran and Venezuela, which has supported oil prices in today’s trading session,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Meanwhile, producers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday cut oil production by about 40 percent as Hurricane Michael approached the Florida coast, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) said, citing reports from 27 companies. If forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major oil-producing assets, analysts said, but a change of track could widen the impact. The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying trade tensions and rising import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce while emerging markets struggle with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows.  Industry and government data on U.S. crude inventories will be delayed by one day this week because of Monday’s U.S. Columbus Day holiday. The American Petroleum Institute is due to release data on Wednesday, while the U.S. Energy Information Administration is due to publish on Thursday.

2018-10-09,"(Adds details from interview) By Ron Bousso and Ernest Scheyder LONDON/HOUSTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp wants to build or buy a refinery along the U.S. Gulf Coast to process crude oil from its rapidly growing Permian Basin operations, a senior executive said on Tuesday. The company would like to have refining operations on the Houston Ship Channel, in the western part of the U.S. Gulf, to complement an existing eastern Gulf refinery in Mississippi that makes lubricants and other materials, Pierre Breber, Chevron’s head of downstream and chemicals, said. “Something on the ship channel side could make a lot of sense for our company,” Breber said in an interview on the sidelines of the Oil & Money conference in London. Chevron is a major oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield. The company’s Permian production jumped 51 percent sequentially in the second quarter to 270,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. By expanding its refining capacity to Houston, Chevron would be able to process its Permian crude closer to where it is produced. Most of Chevron’s refineries are in California and use a heavier type of crude than the light, sweet kind pumped from Permian shale wells. “The ingredients to invest in the U.S. Gulf are very sound,” said Breber, who assumed his current role in 2016 and previously oversaw Chevron’s pipeline operations. Rival Exxon Mobil Corp said last year it would invest $20 billion on U.S. Gulf refining projects. The Houston Ship Channel links the busiest U.S. petrochemical port to the Gulf of Mexico and is home to dozens of refineries and chemical facilities. Mike Wirth, who became Chevron’s chief executive earlier this year, formerly ran the company’s refining arm and is widely seen by Wall Street as an advocate for expanding refining operations. Separately, Berber said Chevron’s existing Mississippi refinery has seen shipments from Venezuela drop 25 percent to 75,000 barrels per day over the last two years. Chevron is the only remaining major U.S. oil producer in the strife-torn country.

Those efforts came amid lawsuits brought by U.S. city and state officials seeking damages to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels that result from global warming. The Climate Leadership Council’s PAC aims to spend $5 million on an initial lobbying campaign to win support for the tax, said Greg Bertelsen, senior vice president at the group. “We’re in the very early days of this organization,” said Bertelsen, who said the PAC is looking to build legislative support for its carbon tax. It proposes an initial $40 a ton tax on carbon dioxide that would increase over time, with the money raised to be returned to consumers. The PAC, led by former U.S. Senators John Breaux and Trent Lott, also has raised $1 million each from Exelon Corp, First Solar Inc and the American Wind Energy Association, he said. It expects to reach its goal of a $5 million in coming months, he said. The council’s proposal was developed by former Secretaries of State James Baker and George Schultz. Council’s members include BP Plc, Total SA and General Motors Co .

2018-10-09,"* Power plant delivery bypasses Palestinian leader Abbas * Qatar says wants to prevent escalation of violence * UN Sec-General, United States, welcome fuel delivery (Adds United Nations, U.S. comments) By Saleh Salem GAZA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Two trucks brought fuel across Israel’s border into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in a Qatari- and U.N.-backed effort to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence. The shipment was a potential slap to the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which opposed the foreign relief plan. Gaza is controlled by Abbas’s rival, the Islamist Hamas group, and the Palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control. Under a blockade by Israel and Egypt designed to isolate Hamas, Gaza has plunged into poverty. Over the last half year it has seen weekly, often violent Palestinian border protests and lethal counter-fire by the Israeli military. “The Secretary-General expresses his deep appreciation to the Government of Qatar for its $60 million contribution, which made this delivery possible and will allow its continuation for the coming months,” U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in New York. Each of the two trucks entering Gaza carried some 35,000 litres of fuel and seven more trucks are expected on Wednesday, Dujarric said. Qatar’s donation is intended to provide fuel to Gaza’s power plant for six months, local sources said. The cash-starved plant has been providing Gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily. The United States’ Middle East envoy, Jason Greenblatt, tweeted: “The U.S. appreciates the efforts of the U.N., Egypt, Qatar and Israel to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Gaza and efforts to achieve the goal of an enduring ceasefire.” A spokesman for the Abbas-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery. “Any international financial aid to the Gaza Strip should be through, or with the coordination of, the Palestinian government,” he said, in order “to preserve Palestinian unity” and to stop any plans to separate Gaza from the West Bank. A Qatari official, speaking to Reuters on Sunday, said Doha planned to help with Gaza’s power crisis “at the request of donor states in the United Nations, to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster”. Israel’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Reuters on Monday that Qatar “was trying to help” prevent a Gaza flare-up. Steinitz accused Abbas, who has restricted funding for Gaza, of “seeking to make gains on two counts: by encouraging a conflict in which Israel will clobber Hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber Israel on the world stage”. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008. Months of Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Abbas have been held up by power-sharing disputes. “Abbas believes that if he keeps the Gaza closure tight, it will make Hamas accept his reconciliation plan, which would give the Abbas government full control - or the people in Gaza will launch a revolution against Hamas,” said Palestinian political analyst Hani al-Masri. “This is making it easy for others to bypass the Palestinian Authority ... They are trying to give them (Gazans) a sedative, sometimes through Egypt, and this time through Israel.” Palestinians launched the border protests on March 30 to demand an easing of the Gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948. Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since. Israel has lost a soldier to a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in cross-border incendiary attacks.

2018-10-09,"WASHINGTON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday plans to lift a ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blend of gasoline, known as E15, delivering a long-sought win to the Farm Belt ahead of November’s midterm elections and angering the refining industry. The move will be coupled with restrictions, a senior administration official said on Monday, on the multibillion-dollar biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules will seek stop parties from hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. The announcement will cap a months-long effort by the White House to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners. In the end, Trump is moving ahead without the support of the refining industry, who wanted more in return for agreeing to lift the summer E15 ban. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15, due to smog concerns. The EPA must now draft a rule ahead and potentially fend off lawsuits from the refining industry who argue the agency lacks the power. Biofuel advocates hope the lifting of the ban will lead to E15 replacing the year-round E10 grade that contains 10 percent of ethanol as the gasoline of choice for U.S. consumers, a move that could boost corn demand by some 2 billion bushels. And as ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes to lower pump prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. “It’s about time,” Warren Bachman, a 72-year-old corn and soybean farmer in Iowa. “With all the trade wars, tariffs and low crop prices, it seems like we are taking it in the shorts and bearing all the burden. So, it’s some good news.” Farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China; Trump has promised the trade war with China will eventually boost the U.S. economy. Trump will celebrate the move at a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later on Tuesday. Council Bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent Republican Dave Young, who is locked in a tight race in the mid-term Congressional elections on Nov. 6. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, which would hurt their market share. They say E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties, and have threatened to sue, arguing the EPA lacks the legal authority to strike the ban. The refining industry came out against the proposal, arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban. “The president has promised to broker a deal to reform the RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard) that works for all stakeholders. This isn’t it,” Chet Thompson, chief executive of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in an statement. The Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly, the White House official said. The agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits, and may require greater public disclosure as well. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, hitting nearly $1 each, drawing the Trump administration into the debate as merchant refiners said plants may be forced to close without presidential action. Credit prices dropped sharply in the past year, hitting a five-year low, due to EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. The credits were trading at roughly 12 cents each on Tuesday morning, traders said.

Stock markets in Asia and Europe trimmed earlier losses after a four-day selloff that had pushed shares in Asia to a 17-month low and knocked European shares to six-month lows. Ongoing worries about a standoff between the European Union and Italy over the country’s budget had pushed Italian borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and weighed on the euro, while Treasury yields hovered at seven-year highs. The Chinese yuan steadied near a seven-week low against the greenback as a liquidity squeeze in the offshore market for renminbi in Hong Kong helped stabilize sentiment. “The rise in U.S. yields is much more important” to the day’s foreign exchange trading than Italy’s fiscal problems, said Thomas Flury, head of currency strategy at UBS Global Wealth Management’s Chief Investment Office in Zurich. “The market needs to digest this to see whether it’s a long-term spike.” MSCI’s index of stock markets across the globe traded flat after paring losses, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.33 percent. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.81 points, or 0.05 percent, to 26,493.40. The S&P 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,887.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 26.47 points, or 0.35 percent, to 7,761.86. “Techs actually right now are strong today. That was weighing on the market and when that turned around that helped drive the market higher this morning,” said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading, in Chatham, New Jersey. “People are nervous and worried about growth. The IMF had the growth forecast going lower. But interest rates are going up because of the growth. That’s a good thing,” Saluzzi said. The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, saying trade tensions and import tariffs were taking a toll on commerce while emerging markets struggled with tighter financial conditions and capital outflows. U.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped from multi-year highs in choppy trading as investors took a breather from selling last week. Those sales had come on fears inflation might accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve to hasten the pace of interest rate hikes. The bond market was closed on Monday for the Columbus Day holiday. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 3.22 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 6/32 in price to pull the yield down to 3.38 percent. The dollar index rose 0.01 percent, with the euro down 0.06 percent to $1.1483. The dollar fell 0.09 percent to 113.10 yen. Oil prices rose on evidence of falling crude exports from key producer Iran, before the imposition of new U.S. sanctions and a partial shutdown in the Gulf of Mexico because of Hurricane Michael.

The maker Opel and British Vauxhall branded cars blamed new emissions rules for the cull, but the carmaker has struggled to reach sustainable profitability after racking up more than a decade of losses selling low-margin cars under previous owner General Motors. “In order to contribute to the CO2 compliance and to focus on high volume segments, the Opel ADAM, KARL and Cascada will not be replaced after the end of their life cycles, but will remain on sale until the end of 2019,” Opel said in a statement.

Obiageli Ezekwesili, 55, also a former cabinet minister and senior World Bank official, announced on Sunday she would run as the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN) in the February 2019 vote to decide who runs Agrefrica’s most populous country and top energy producer. “I am now fed up, like most Nigerians are, with the status quo and so we want to disrupt our political landscape,” Ezekwesili said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. She and other candidates will line up against President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler who is seeking a second term, and former vice president Atiku Abubakar who is running for the main opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Ezekwesili said the two main parties - the APC and the PDP, which have held power since the advent of civilian rule in 1999 - were all but indistinguishable. She called them “Siamese twins” that had done little to tackle endemic graft and poor governance. Political defections are common in Nigeria, where identity and patronage largely take precedence over ideology and specific policies. She said her campaign would seek to attract people who had not previously participated in elections - a group she said amounted to a majority of eligible voters. Independent Electoral Commission figures show that just 43 percent of people who registered to vote at the last election in 2015 actually went to the polls. Ezekwesili estimated that some 72 percent of eligible voters, including people who did not register, failed to turn out at the ballot box. “They simply decided that the candidatures of the two parties they were being asked to vote for were not appealing to them, so they just elected to stay home,” she said. “That base of 72 percent of people who should turn things around in the country, they are our target. We are going to activate that base,” said Ezekwesili. But her ability to challenge the main contenders seems questionable given their larger spending firepower and access to key patronage networks in the nation of 190 million people. Policy proposals Ezekwesili hopes will lure more first-time voters to her candidacy include reforms of the state-owned oil company NNPC, which has been beset by decades of mismanagement and is crucial to the OPEC member’s economic fortunes. Oil sales account for two-thirds of Nigerian state revenue. Ezekwesili also aims to enable the private sector to create more jobs and focus on developing skills in Nigeria’s workforce. She served in a PDP government between 2000 and 2007, first as minerals minister and later education minister. One of the founders of anti-corruption watchdog Transparency International, Ezekwesili also co-founded the Bring Back Our Girls campaign to promote efforts to free about 270 schoolgirls kidnapped in 2014 by Islamist militant group Boko Haram.

2018-10-09,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German auto parts supplier Bosch [ROBG.UL] is launching an electric van-sharing service in Germany, expanding its reach in rentals and pitting it against some of its customers who are also expanding into pay-per-minute mobility services. Bosch said on Tuesday it will team up with toom, part of German retailer REWE, to supply battery-driven vans which people can hire to transport bulky purchases from hardware stores.  German cities are banning older diesel vehicles, hastening the switch to electric and benefiting firms like Bosch, which  supplies components to electric vehicle makers. Combined with the emergence of smartphone-hailed rental technology, which allows people to use vehicles by the minute without owning them, this is turning the relationship between car manufacturers and their suppliers on its head. “A service for sharing electric vans has huge potential for growth,” Rainer Kallenbach, president of the Connected Mobility Solutions division at Bosch said in a statement. The Bosch electric vans will be supplied by StreetScooter, a German startup carmaker owned by logistics company Deutsche Post (DPWGn.DE), which uses powertrain components supplied by Bosch. StreetScooter on Tuesday unveiled a separate alliance with Ford (F.N) to build larger electric delivery vans for logistics company DHL.[L8N1WP4DL] SELF-DRIVING  The market for electric delivery vans is expected to grow after Germany’s highest court in February allowed cities to ban older diesel vehicles and after Berlin on Tuesday was forced to consider imposing bans to improve air quality. EU lawmakers last week backed a plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans by an ambitious 40 percent by 2030, a target which the car industry, already struggling to meet emissions standards, said is completely unrealistic. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), Europe’s largest carmaker by sales, and a large maker of diesel vehicles on Tuesday revealed that Europe sales had fallen 42.6 percent as it struggles to adapt engines to new clear air standards. Opel said it would discontinue its Adam, KARL and Cascada models in 2019 to help the carmaker meet emissions rules. Stuttgart-based Bosch said that if the electric van sharing service proves popular, its plans to expand it to other partners including supermarkets and furniture stores. The toom alliance marks a further step into on-demand vehicle rental services for Bosch, which already runs Coup, an electric scooter rental service, in Paris, Berlin and Madrid. Bosch has shied away from competing against traditional automakers in areas like vehicle manufacturing, fearing it could alienate components and systems clients like VW and Ford. But with new rivals like software company alphabet (GOOGL.O) developing fully fledged self-driving vehicles, auto suppliers and carmakers are ramping up efforts to understand smartphone-based mobility as a prelude to managing fleets of robotaxis. Self-driving cars will allow carmakers and software companies to offer ride-hailing without having to pay drivers.     Bosch is already collaborating with Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DAIGn.DE) to develop self-driving cars.

2018-10-09,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A Berlin court on Tuesday ordered Germany’s capital to ban older diesel vehicles from some of its roads, dealing a blow to the government’s attempts to avoid such restrictions while it strives to reduce air pollution.  On at least eleven stretches of road suffering from the highest levels of nitrogen oxide pollution, Berlin must ban vehicles meeting the Euro 5 or older emissions standards, the court said in a statement, adding the city-state had not done enough to keep air pollution within permitted limits. Beyond those streets, Berlin must analyze whether further bans are needed on a total 15 kilometers of road to lower nitrogen oxide concentrations in the city to 40 micrograms per cubic meter of air on average, the court said. Earlier this month, the federal German government outlined plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes in an attempt to avert further driving bans. Diesel bans have already been imposed in Hamburg and are planned for Frankfurt and Stuttgart, the home of Germany’s car industry. The case in Berlin was brought by environmental lobby group DUH in the latest attempt by activists to force regional governments in Germany to improve air quality.  DUH is pursuing legal cases seeking bans in 28 cities and has said it will file suits against six more cities this month.  Pollution from diesel cars has come under intense scrutiny after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 admitted to using illegal software to cheat emissions tests, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines. Environmental groups have been encouraged by a German federal court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars, dealing a blow to both automakers and commuters who rely on diesels to get to work. Berlin now has until the end of March to legislate on the bans, and a further two to three months to implement them. “This has been a good day for clean air in Berlin,” Juergen Resch, managing director of DUH, told journalists after the ruling. The ruling “shows that the government’s diesel compromise, which was not even to include Berlin, has failed.” However, Christian Amsinck, managing director of the UVB federation of business associations in the states of Berlin and neighboring Brandenburg, said the bans would do more harm than good, especially for businesses, adding: “Every closure hurts companies.” He urged the Berlin senate to appeal against the decision, adding: “The diverted traffic will cause more jams and emissions, which will worsen the air quality rather than improve it.” Reporting by Hans-Edzard Busemann; Writing by Maria Sheahan; Editing by Mark Potter and Michelle Martin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-emissions/update-2-german-court-bans-older-diesel-cars-in-parts-of-berlin-idUKL8N1WP3U5,09 Oct 2018,"* DUH welcomes ruling, businesses balk

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Energy companies are betting demand for natural gas will rise at break-neck pace for decades, undermining warnings that tackling climate change would require a rapid switch to renewable energy. Top oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) are adapting with growing urgency to the need to develop cleaner energy sources, investing more and more in solar and wind power, electric vehicle technology and even forestation. Still, they see oil, and especially natural gas, the least polluting fossil fuel, playing a major role throughout the decades of transition and beyond as demand for electricity and plastics grows. “Shell’s core business is, and will be for the foreseeable future, very much in oil and gas… and particularly in natural gas,” Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a speech at the Oil & Money conference.    	 By 2035, Shell expects global gas demand to grow annually by 2 percent, twice the pace of worldwide energy demand, van Beurden said. The United Nations said in a report earlier this week that limiting the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius means making rapid, unprecedented changes in the way people use energy. That will include the tripling of renewable energy to supply 70-85 percent of electricity by 2050. Technology to capture and store carbon emissions would further reduce the share of gas-fired power to 8 percent, the report said, while making no mention of oil in this context. It is unclear how the global economy will reach such goals. Natural gas is today around 22 percent in the global energy mix. But many energy company executives prefer to see it as part of the shift to low-carbon economies. Qatar, one of the world’s largest gas suppliers, is set to grow its liquefied natural gas (LNG) capacity by over 40 percent by the next decade to around 110 million tonnes per year, as demand for the super-chilled fuel is set to soar, particularly in fast-growing economies such as China and India. “We believe that natural gas will continue to play a key role, not as a so-called transition fuel but rather as a destination fuel,” Qatar Petroleum CEO Saad Al Kaabi said. Shell is investing more than any other of its peers in clean energy, spending $1 billion to $2 billion a year on renewables and low-carbon energy. That compares with a total annual spending budget of $25 billion-$30 billion. The investments “might even make people think we have gone soft on the future of oil and gas. If they did think that… they would be wrong,” van Beurden said.

2018-10-09,"NEW DELHI, Oct 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - It is not too late for countries to tackle global warming, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore said on Tuesday, a day after the United Nations warned that the world was battling against time to contain rising temperatures. Gore, who won an Oscar and shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 for his climate change documentary “An Inconvenient Truth”, said “ingenuity and technology” were key to capping the emissions that cause global warming. “Are we doomed to destroy ourselves? I refuse to believe that,” Gore said at an event in Delhi, the capital of India, which is the third biggest polluter in the world. “We have limitations ... but we also have the ability to transcend those limitations. Perhaps never with the speed necessary as now, as the IPCC alerted us again yesterday. But we do have the capacity.” To accelerate change, he said countries must overcome paralysis on curbing emissions, otherwise “we are headed toward 3- to 4 degree Celsius increase, which is associated with such utter catastrophes”. On Monday, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a report saying temperatures were likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) between 2030 and 2052 if global warming continues at its current pace. It urged rapid, unprecedented changes in the way people use energy to eat, travel and live to meet 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, rather than the 2C target agreed at global climate talks in Paris in 2015. “Some people are prone to go straight from denial to despair without pausing on the intermediate step of actually solving the crisis that is threatening the future of our civilisation,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris accord last year, invoking concerns for the economy, and has espoused pro-fossil fuel policies. But states, led by California, and many cities are living up to their commitments. India, one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change, is committed to reducing its carbon emissions by a third by 2030 with tougher emission norms, more electric vehicles and giant solar power plants to replace energy generated by coal. But scientists say current government commitments under the Paris pact, even if fully met, would still leave the world on track for about 3 degrees of warming. Gore said the solution was to invest heavily in renewable energy sources, which were becoming more and more affordable across the globe, fuelling a “sustainable revolution”. ""Here is the good news, we can change,"" he said. ""Relief is heaven-sent in the form of solar and wind and ingenuity and technology.""

2018-10-09,"HASANKEYF, Turkey, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people displaced by a huge dam in southeast Turkey fear they could go homeless because resettlement laws prevent them from moving into a new government-built town above the rising Tigris River waters. The Ilisu dam, which Turkey planned to fill this year, will generate 1,200 megawatts of electricity but has been criticised for water shortages it will create downstream in Iraq and for the tens of thousands of people it will displace in Turkey. For hundreds of residents of the 12,000-year-old town of Hasankeyf and its neighbouring village of Kesmekopru, both of which will be submerged, housing laws may also block them from finding new homes on the nearby mountainside. Those regulations bar unmarried adults and people with addresses registered elsewhere from claiming home ownership in the new site, residents and town officials told Reuters. Two Hasankeyf residents affected by the laws, siblings Fatime and Hizrullah Salkan, have filed legal petitions to find new homes when the waters rise and they are forced from their houses - built next door to each other by their parents. Fatime, 44, is not married and her 47-year-old brother, a father of four, switched his address to a neighbouring province while seeking work there five years ago, meaning they both fail to meet requirements for being rehoused. “They told us everything would be perfect - that everyone would own a house, there wouldn’t be any problems,” Hizrullah said. “But now we are doomed to be migrants.” Also uprooted by the dam waters will be Hasankeyf’s ancient tombs, minarets and monuments, which are being transferred to a tourist park. Ahmet Akdeniz, president of the local cultural association, said he supports the dam and the new settlement site, and expects Hasankeyf’s antiquities to be more easily accessible at their new location. But the home ownership restrictions, he said, are a disaster for hundreds of residents in Hasankeyf. “Whoever wrote these laws is brainless,” he said. “They’ll have to change them. There won’t be anywhere for these people to go.” Asked whether steps were being taken to address the needs of people deemed ineligible for new housing, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry, which is overseeing the Ilisu Dam project, said local authorities had planned to make some homes available for sale but “there is no demand”. Other state bodies, including the Environment and Urbanisation Ministry, which issued the home-ownership laws, declined or did not respond to requests for comment. Turkey briefly started filling the dam in June, but officials said it halted temporarily a week later after complaints from Iraq about reduced water flows in summer. Like Hasankeyf, which it faces across the Tigris River, the village of Kesmekopru will be forced to evacuate once the dam’s reservoir fills properly. But none of Kesmekopru’s more than 600 residents will be allowed to own homes in the new settlement site because it is not considered a neighbourhood of Hasankeyf, according to village headman Metin Dezen. When Dezen asked provincial authorities why his villagers could not move to the new site, they told him: “‘You’re village people, we can’t give you a city,’” he told Reuters. Asked about Dezen’s claim, the Agriculture and Forestry Ministry said residents of Kesmekopru had been paid for the loss of their land and had not applied for new housing from the government. For the approximately 20 families who have already moved from Hasankeyf to the new homes, however, their present living conditions do not resemble a city. Although authorities have said construction is 94 percent complete, the streets are still full of construction vehicles, the tap water is brownish, the air swirls with dust, and the area is barren. A clump of pine trees planted on a ridge above the site are brown and dead. Mazlum Cetin, 27, works as a local tour guide in Hasankeyf but moved to the new settlement site in April. He fears the local economy will worsen after the dam because tourists will not be as eager to see Hasankeyf’s artefacts away from their historical location. “In New Hasankeyf, people will just come and swipe their [museum entry cards] and see everything and leave,” he said. Mehmet Sait Tunc, 34, sells kebabs in the new settlement. As he stood at his food truck listing his grievances over the dirty water, dusty air and arid ground his seven-year-old son Adem ran past to add one more: the noise from the construction work. “The explosions are going off every day!” Viewing a photograph taken the previous day of his old house in Hasankeyf, now taken over by local donkeys, Tunc shook his head sadly, comparing the greenery around his old house to the landscape he now inhabits. “If the living conditions here don’t improve, we’ll think about moving,” he said.

The plant will primarily serve North American customers, the former plastics unit of Bayer said on Tuesday, with production expected to start in 2024. It will replace the company’s existing chemicals complex in Baytown and have more than five times the capacity. Demand for MDI, used in polyurethane foams that go into building insulation, refrigerators and wind rotor blades, has outgrown production capacity over recent quarters and companies are scrambling to build new plants over the next four years. They include BASF and China’s Wanhua and SLIC Ltd, as well as Sadara, a joint venture between DowDuPont and Saudi Aramco. “Even under a conservative scenario of those projects all progressing as announced, there is still an urgent need for us to invest further to meet the strong demand and to further develop our leading market position,” Covestro’s Chief Executive Markus Steilemann told Reuters. The new Baytown plant will have capacity to produce 500,000 tonnes per year, dubbed world-scale in size. The existing plant there, which produces 90,000 tonnes a year, will close. Longer-term demand for MDI is expected to increase by about 5 percent a year, which would absorb an additional world-scale plant about every 18 months in the industry, Steilemann said. Covestro’s recent investments had favoured Asia and Europe, creating pent-up capacity needs in North America, he said. The project is part of an enlarged investment budget unveiled in July. The group said at the time it would increase investment this year to between 650 million and 700 million euros, up from 507 million euros in 2017, with further annual expenditure over the next three years to reach as much as 1.2 billion euros. Annual expenditure on the Baytown project would likely peak over the 2021-2023 period, Steilemann said.

2018-10-09,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israelis will no longer be able to buy new gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles after 2030, the Energy Ministry said on Tuesday, unveiling a plan to replace them with electric cars and trucks that run on natural gas. The challenge will be creating an initial “critical mass” of cars that will move the local industry away from gasoline and diesel engines, Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said. “We are already encouraging by funding charging stations, more than 2,000 new charging stations around the country,” Steinitz told Reuters. The government, he said, will also “reduce taxation on electric cars to almost zero, so they are going to be much cheaper”. The electric vehicle campaign is part of a broader plan to completely wean Israel off gasoline, diesel and coal. Israel in recent years discovered huge deposits of natural gas, a cleaner-burning fossil fuel, and it is converting its power stations accordingly.  The plan was released a day after a U.N. report on climate change called for major changes in the way humankind uses energy. The tipping point is expected around 2025, when, according to the ministry’s target, there will be about 177,000 electric cars on the road in Israel. Today there are just a few dozen. After that, it will become easier and cheaper to own electric cars, so the ministry expects the number should jump to nearly 1.5 million by 2030. “From 2030 we won’t allow anymore the import of diesel or gasoline cars to Israel,” Steinitz said. All new cars will be electric. Buses and trucks will be either electric or run on compressed natural gas. “We are forcing companies to bring electric cars to Israel and for oil and gasoline companies to shift to charging stations in their gasoline or petrol stations,” he said. The government, he said, is expected to approve the plan by the end of the year.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will seek to lift a federal ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline on Tuesday, a senior White House official said, delivering on a move long sought by anxious Midwestern farmers ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. The move will be coupled with restrictions on the multibillion-dollar biofuel credit trading industry sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules would be aimed at retailers and oil majors accused by merchant refiners of hoarding the credits and driving up the cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15, due to smog concerns.  Because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes it will bring down retail prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association.  The announcement will mark the end of a months-long effort by the White House to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners. The rival camps cut across Trump’s strong base of rural voters and blue-collar workers,  The refining industry came out against the proposal, arguing they should have gotten more than trade restrictions in exchange for lifting the summer ban.  “The president has promised to broker a deal to reform the RFS that works for all stakeholders. This isn’t it,” Chet Thompson, chief executive of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in an statement. Trump plans to hold a closed-door event with ethanol producers in Washington before a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Tuesday to highlight the change. Council Bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent Republican Dave Young, who is locked in a tight race. “Rural America needs a shot in the arm, and this is it,” said Emily Skor, chief executive officer of Growth Energy, a biofuel trade association. Farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China; Trump has promised the trade war with China will eventually boost the U.S. economy. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly, the official said. The agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits, and may require greater public disclosure as well. Biofuel credit prices were near five-year highs last year, hitting nearly $1 each, but have dropped sharply to their lowest since 2013, due mainly to the EPA’s expanded use of waivers freeing small refiners from their obligations. The credits were trading at roughly 12 cents each on Tuesday morning, traders said.  About 400 million gallons of E15 are sold in the U.S. annually, a fraction of the roughly 142 billion gallons in U.S. gasoline sales last year.  The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, which would hurt their market share. They say E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties, and have threatened to sue, arguing the EPA lacks the legal authority to strike the ban. The National Association of Truck Stop Owners, or NATSO, came out against the trade restrictions, arguing they are solutions in search of a problem. The retailers can benefit from trading credits and the restriction could hurt profits. “The RIN market as it exists today is structurally sound; it provides the necessary price discovery and risk management vehicles for parties in the production, distribution, and blending of renewable fuels,” said David Fialkov, head of the association.

2018-10-09,"* Power plant delivery bypasses Palestinian leader Abbas * Qatar says wants to prevent escalation of violence By Saleh Salem GAZA, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A truck brought fuel across Israel’s border into the Gaza Strip on Tuesday in what sources said was a Qatari- and U.N.-backed drive to ease conditions in the enclave and stem any escalation in Palestinian-Israeli violence. The shipment was a potential slap to the Western-backed administration of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, which opposed the foreign relief plan. Gaza is controlled by Abbas’s rival, the Islamist Hamas group and the Palestinian president has been using economic pressure in order to wrest back control. Under a blockade by Israel and Egypt designed to isolate Hamas, Gaza has plunged into poverty. Over the last half year it has seen weekly, often violent Palestinian border protests and lethal counter-fire by the Israeli military. The truck that entered Gaza brought the first delivery out of a $60 million fuel donation by Qatar meant to provide the power plant with enough fuel to operate for six months, local sources said. The cash-starved plant has been providing Gazans with only around four hours of electricity daily. A spokesman for the Abbas-appointed Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, who is based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, voiced disapproval of the fuel delivery. “Any international financial aid to the Gaza Strip should be through, or with the coordination of, the Palestinian government,” he said, in order “to preserve Palestinian unity” and to stop any plans to separate Gaza from the West Bank. A Qatari official, speaking to Reuters on Sunday, said Doha planned to help with Gaza’s power crisis “at the request of donor states in the United Nations, to prevent an escalation of the existing humanitarian disaster”. U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Israel’s energy minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Reuters on Monday that Qatar “was trying to help” prevent a Gaza flare-up. Steinitz accused Abbas, who has restricted PA funding for Gaza, of “seeking to make gains on two counts: by encouraging a conflict in which Israel will clobber Hamas and over which he will then be able to clobber Israel on the world stage”. Israel and Hamas have fought three wars since 2008. Months of Egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks between Hamas and Abbas have been held up by power-sharing disputes. “Abbas believes that if he keeps the Gaza closure tight, it will make Hamas accept his reconciliation plan, which would give the Abbas government full control - or the people in Gaza will launch a revolution against Hamas,” said Palestinian political analyst Hani al-Masri. “This is making it easy for others to bypass the Palestinian Authority ... They are trying to give them (Gazans) a sedative, sometimes through Egypt, and this time through Israel.” Palestinians launched the border protests on March 30 to demand an easing of the Gaza blockade and the right of return to lands that Palestinian families fled or were driven from on Israel’s founding in 1948. Israeli forces have killed at least 195 Palestinians since. Israel has lost a soldier to a Gaza sniper and tracts of forest and farmland to fires set in cross-border incendiary attacks.

There was plenty to keep the stress levels high. Ongoing worries about Italy’s finances pushed its borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and the euro lower, while U.S. Treasury yields were hovering at a seven-year high. There was still strength in Europe’s oil stocks on higher crude prices, but most sectors had buckled to leave the Euro STOXX 600 down 0.7 percent at a six-month low and S&P 500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures down around 0.5 percent. If the S&P ends the day lower it will be its fourth red day in a row for the seventh time this year. It hasn’t seen five falls yet. “It all feels like it’s quite nervous here over whether things are going to break (out of ranges) or not,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. He also pointed to the rising U.S. and Japanese government bond yields, which tend to set the bar for borrowing costs globally, as well as the latest lows for China’s yuan. China’s central bank fixed its yuan rate at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that followed a 4.3 percent slide on Monday, which was the largest daily fall since early 2016. Asian shares overall fell to a 17-month low. Pakistan’s rupee slumped 7 percent in an apparent devaluation before an expected International Monetary Fund programme. The Indian and Sri Lankan  rupees both hit record lows. That also followed the IMF’s first downgrade to its global growth forecast since 2016. “U.S. growth will decline once parts of its fiscal stimulus go into reverse,” IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld predicted. Italian government bond yields rose to a 4 1/2-year high of 3.71 percent after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria’s address to parliament on the government’s budget plans did little to reassure nervous investors. Tria called for a constructive discussion with Brussels over the budget and said he did not think Italy’s deficit forecasts were so shocking. EU Commission Vice-President Jyrki Katainen said Italy’s situation is vulnerable and negotiations may prove difficult. “Maybe some people were expecting some reassurance from Tria, but he’s not calling the shots,” said Jan von Gerich, chief analyst at Nordea. “The general background is that the budget continues to cause uncertainty.” Back in Asia, Japan’s Nikkei had dropped 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen and as yields on Tokyo’s government bonds prodded the 0.15 percent cap the Bank of Japan effectively has on them . A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday had also expressed concern at the fall in the Chinese yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, the broad spread of red in futures markets came after growth and tech stocks were pressured on Monday by worries that rising bond yields, which raise borrowing costs, might ultimately hobble the economy. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper reached a seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent, but were edging back slightly ahead of U.S. trading. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now: rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. But the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the U.S. growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood up 0.4 percent at 96.128, from a low of 93.814 a couple of weeks ago. Against the safe-haven yen, the dollar pulled back to 113.15 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by Italy’s political troubles and loitered at $1.1436, well off September’s $1.1815 top. In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Industrial bellwethers copper and nickel jumped as much 1.4 and 2 percent. Oil prices also rose as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico. Brent crude added 60 cents to $84.51 a barrel and U.S. crude gained 41 cents to $74.70. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney and Virginia

Working with the Break Free From Plastic movement, Greenpeace said it orchestrated 239 plastic clean-ups in 42 countries around the world, which resulted in the audit of 187,000 pieces of plastic trash. The aim was to get a picture of how large corporations contribute to the problem of pollution. Coca-Cola, the world’s largest soft drink maker, was the top waste producer, Greenpeace said, with Coke-branded plastic trash found in 40 of the 42 countries.  “These brand audits offer undeniable proof of the role that corporations play in perpetuating the global plastic pollution crisis,” said Von Hernandez, global coordinator for Break Free From Plastic.  Overall, the most common type of plastic found was polystyrene, which goes into packaging and foam coffee cups, followed closely by PET, used in bottles and containers.  “We share Greenpeace’s goal of eliminating waste from the ocean and are prepared to do our part to help address this important challenge,” a Coke spokesman said in a statement. The company has pledged to collect and recycle a bottle or can for every one it sells by 2030.  All three companies have made pledges about their packaging for 2025. Coke says all its packaging will be recyclable, Nestle says it will be recyclable or reusable and PepsiCo says it will be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable.  They are all also working to use recycled content in their packaging.  Nestle, the world’s largest food and drink maker, said it recognized the issue and is working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics. It said it was also exploring different packaging solutions and ways to facilitate recycling and eliminate plastic waste.  PepsiCo was not immediately available to comment outside regular U.S. business hours.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two British-based researchers have created an award-winning new design for a mini wind turbine that looks like a volleyball and can catch a breeze blowing in any direction, which they say will make green energy more attainable for people who live in cities. The O-Wind Turbine, created by Nicolas Orellana and Yaseen Noorani from Lancaster University, is a small plastic sphere with vents that catch wind from any direction, causing it to spin on its axis like a ball balanced on the end of a finger. It is better suited than traditional turbines for harnessing the ever-changing winds that blow through built-up locations, the inventors say. “Cities are windy places but we are currently not harnessing this resource,” said Orellana, who is from Chile. “We hope that O-Wind Turbine will improve the usability and affordability of turbines for people across the world.”  The duo, who recently finished their master’s degrees in international innovation, say the 25 cm sphere can be attached to the side of buildings or balconies and provide green energy for the home or send it to the grid.  The duo’s interest in broadening the capabilities of wind turbines came after studying the limitations of NASA’s Mars Tumbleweed Rover, an inflatable ball designed to autonomously bounce across the surface of Mars. The O-Wind Turbine claimed the UK version of the James Dyson Award last month and is in contention next month for the international version of the prize, which was set up by Dyson, the billionaire British vacuum cleaner inventor and designer. The duo hope to have the product launched to market within five years and also plan to research the possibility of adapting the technology to generate wave energy from the sea.

2018-10-09,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Curbing emissions: tmsnrt.rs/2fd44vX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Coal-fired power has to end by 2050 to save the planet. That seemingly simple but bold sentiment is likely to set much of the political, social and economic agenda for the coming decades, but in the end it will come down to what China does. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a report on Monday that “unprecedented” changes will have to take place to limit the rise in the Earth’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), warning of devastating weather events and species loss if the target is exceeded. In order to achieve the goal, the IPCC said coal burning would have to drop to between zero and 2 percent by 2050, while even natural gas, coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), would have to decline to 8 percent of electricity generation by the middle of this century. While coal has long been the bogeyman of climate activists, the IPCC has effectively thrown down the gauntlet and given world leaders a little over 30 years to phase it out entirely. Initial reaction to the IPCC report has been predictable, with supporters of renewable energy cheering it, and backers of fossil fuels resorting to the familiar arguments that somehow the science is either wrong or a hoax. Australia’s Environment Minister Melissa Price told ABC radio on Tuesday that the IPCC was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050, and touted new technologies as a way of saving the polluting fuel. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and relies on the fuel for more than 70 percent of its electricity generation. Price isn’t alone in touting CCS and other technologies, with the World Coal Association responding to the IPCC report by saying in a statement on its website that CCS is “vital” and that the coal lobby group will push for it to be adopted. However, elsewhere on the group’s website it acknowledges that currently progress of CCS “is too slow to allow necessary emissions reductions goals to be achieved”. Its solution is to spend more on research and development. But it’s here that the coal lobby will run into problems. Already renewable technologies, which have benefited from subsidies, are becoming cheaper than conventional coal-fired power generation, a trend likely to continue. Coal-fired generation with CCS would likely require huge subsidies in order to be cost-competitive, and selling such largesse with public money will be incredibly hard for governments in democracies. It’s therefore likely that the scenario currently being played out in Europe will be extended to other parts of the world, with coal-fired power being replaced by a combination of renewables, battery storage, gas-fired back-up and even nuclear. Coal will further be hamstrung by the flight of capital from the sector, with commercial and development banks, insurers and trading companies starting to retreat from financing and insuring mines and power plants. While it’s likely that the developed world will witness ongoing bitter debates over policy toward fossil fuels, the actual key to the IPCC target is China, and to a lesser extent the rest of developing Asia. China is the world’s largest producer, consumer and importer of coal and any genuine attempt to remove coal from the world’s energy mix by 2050 will require massive commitment from Beijing. While the Chinese government has a policy of limiting the use of coal and of boosting the use of renewables and natural gas, it’s well within the realms of wishful thinking to imagine the world’s second-largest economy is on track to abandon the use of coal by 2050. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, China currently has 957 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power operating - more than four times India’s 219 GW. The positive news for both China and India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, is that the pipeline of coal-fired plant construction has been consistently shrinking and retirements of older units has been accelerating. But given that once built, coal-fired plants generally operate for at least 30 years, it would be imperative that virtually all construction is halted now, and no new plants commissioned. In reality, China currently has 126 GW of coal-fired power in construction and 76 GW either announced, in pre-permit phase or with permits already in place. India has 39 GW being built and 63 GW in the approval process. There are also new coal plants being built or planned in numerous other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. What the IPCC report may do is accelerate pressure on those countries to re-think their power generation plans, especially if renewables can be shown to be as cheap and as reliable. It’s also likely that any technological advances in energy in the next decades will not be in favour of coal, given that vast sums are being invested in renewables and comparatively little in CCS or other coal-friendly technologies. The IPCC report highlights that coal now has its back very much against the wall, but equally that the real power for change lies in Beijing. Natural gas also tends to get off lightly in much of the media reporting about climate change, especially given the obvious target of coal. But like silent flatulence in an elevator, eventually natural gas will be unable to avoid the attention that is making life so difficult for the coal industry.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Science shows that nothing does more to cause climate change than burning coal, a former head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said on Tuesday, a position in contrast to President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies. Trump announced last year that the United States would quit a 2015 global climate pact, citing concerns for the U.S. economy and touting fossil-fuel energy anew but alarming nearly 200 signatories to the accord including close U.S. allies. On Monday, a U.N. report said that even limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), below the 2 degree target agreed in Paris, would entail rapid and unprecedented changes across every aspect of society or the world risks even more extreme weather and loss of species.  Without real change, the world is not even on course to reach the 2C target, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the main scientific guide for governments on how to implement the Paris Agreement. “We have big challenges ahead of us and I think that is what the (report) has told us...a low-carbon future is better. From a climate perspective, nothing is worse than burning coal,” former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy told a Financial Times climate finance summit in London. “I would like to see climate change presented as what science is telling us rather than a political statement, which is what many in the U.S. are positioning it as,” she added, referring to the Trump administration. Under the Paris Agreement rules, the United States cannot actually pull out of the pact until late 2020. “The U.S. is pretty much on target to reach its (climate) targets at least in the short-term - the market is driving this,” said McCarthy, who ran the EPA under Trump’s predecessor Barack Obama from 2013-2017. “Markets drive change more quickly than regulation. Governments are not going to be the ones which make it run as fast as it needs to.” But Trump aims to roll back many environmental rules put in place by Obama, such as acting to replace a clean power plant policy with weaker environmental rules for such plants. The U.S. government also intends to freeze mandates that ensure new cars pollute less and cut limits on the greenhouse gas methane that is released during oil production. McCarthy said such moves, however, do not necessarily translate into action. “The announcements and proposals made by the new administration have not been finalised, they are not based on science and the law, and that is not exactly a winning formula when you go to the courts,” she said.  “There is a long process behind all of this and eventually they will end up in the courts for a long period of time. Those rules were solidly done and based on science and the law, and it will take a lot to do undo them.”   The IPCC report will be a talking point at the Katowice Climate Change Conference in Poland in December.

2018-10-09,"BERLIN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - A ban on older diesel vehicles is the only way to bring pollution down to within permitted limits, a judge in Berlin said on Tuesday, signalling he may rule in favour of a diesel driving ban in parts of the German capital. Judge Ulrich Marticke made his comments in court ahead of a ruling expected later in the day. While he said the level of harmful nitrogen dioxide in the air was declining, he added there was no reasonable doubt that a ban on older diesel vehicles was the only way to cut pollution to permitted limits. The case was brought against the city-state by environmental lobby group DUH, which wants Berlin to reduce air pollution by banning diesel vehicles up to the Euro 4 standard from the end of 2018 and for Euro 5 standard cars from September 2019. The latest standard is Euro 6. Local broadcaster rbb reported on Friday that Berlin authorities were looking at imposing driving bans on older diesel cars on 20 streets, including major routes in the city. Volkswagen’s admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceed pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. Environmental groups have been encouraged by a federal court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. A ban is due to take effect in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital, from February. The city of Hamburg this year voluntarily blocked diesel models that fail to meet the Euro-6 emissions standard from selected trunk roads.

2018-10-09,"SINGAPORE, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Gasoil refining margins could spike to $40 a barrel in 2020 as more shippers shift to middle distillate fuels when new rules limiting sulphur emissions take effect, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Tuesday. From 2020, the U.N. International Maritime Organisation will ban ships using fuels with sulphur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, to curb pollution. Shipowners could install a kit called a “scrubber” that strips out sulphur emissions, allowing them to use the dirtier fuel oil. They could also switch to using costlier, low-sulphur fuels such as marine gasoil, very-low-sulphur fuel oil, or shift to liquefied natural gas. With a majority of shippers eyeing a shift to marine gasoil or very-low-sulphur fuel oil, diesel cracks could rally as marine gasoil supply tightens into 2020 and “the expected 1.3-4 million barrels per day (bpd) surge in middle distillate demand could result in diesel cracks hitting $40/bbl in 2020,” the bank said in a note. The NYMEX crack spread for heating oil, or diesel, against WTI crude is currently trading at around $26.50 a barrel. HOc1-CLc1 “We expect less than 900 ships to have scrubbers before 2020. But we see installation capacity growing, and believe 7,000 ships could have scrubbers installed by 2025,” the bank said. With more ships complying, demand for high-sulphur fuel oil could grow by 1.5 million bpd in 2020-2025, it said. But supply of very-low-sulphur fuel oil is expected to remain in short supply and could potentially trade at parity with marine gasoil in 2020, said the bank. The bank estimated current global demand for marine fuels at 5 million bpd, of which 70 percent is comprised of dirtier fuel oil. Reporting by Roslan Khasawneh

2018-10-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A vessel carrying 2 million barrels of Iranian oil discharged the crude into a bonded storage tank at the port of Dalian in northeast China on Monday, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and a shipping agent with knowledge of the matter. Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is finding fewer takers for its crude ahead of U.S. sanctions on its oil exports that will go into effect on Nov. 4. The country previously held oil in storage at Dalian during the last round of sanctions in 2014 that was later sold to buyers in South Korea and India. The very large crude carrier Dune, operated by National Iranian Tanker Co, offloaded oil into a bonded storage site at the Xingang section of the port, according to a shipping source based in Dalian, adding this was the first Iranian oil to discharge into bonded storage in nearly four years.  The tanker left the Iranian oil port at Kharg Island on Sept. 12, according to ship-tracking data.  The Xingang area is home to several tank farms including commercial and strategic reserves. China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPC.UL] and Dalian Port PDA Co Ltd (601880.SS) both operate commercial storage in the area, according to information on their company websites. An investor relations official at Dalian Port declined to comment.  A manager at the bonded crude storage site operated by Dalian Port declined to comment whether Iranian oil were moved to the tanks, calling it the “worst time” to give any comment regarding Iranian crude because of the U.S. sanctions. A person at the CNPC-owned storage site who refused to identify himself when contacted by Reuters said it is “impossible” that the oil is stored there. A spokesman for CNPC said he had no information on this matter.   An executive with the China office of National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) declined to comment. NIOC also did not respond to an email request seeking comment if it is storing oil at Dalian. The shipping source said there is no buyer earmarked for the cargo. Three other NITC tankers are set to arrive in Dalian in the next week or two, the ship-tracking data shows. Some of those cargoes are also likely to end up in bonded storage as the refineries in the region, controlled by CNPC, are not equipped to process Iranian oil, said three sources at state-run Chinese refiners. China’s Iranian oil buyers, including state-owned refiner Sinopec (0386.HK) and state trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp, have shifted their cargoes to vessels owned by NITC since July to keep supplies flowing as the U.S. sanctions have been re-imposed.  Keeping oil in bonded storage gives the shipment owner the option to sell into China or to other buyers in the region.

2018-10-09,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A Dutch appeals court on Tuesday ordered the government to cut greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned, to ensure they are at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by the end of 2020. Last year, emissions of greenhouse gases were only 13 percent below 1990 levels in the Netherlands, which is among the most polluting countries in the European Union. “The government has done too little to prevent the dangers of climate change and is doing too little to catch up”, the court said, as it upheld a 2015 ruling by a district court.  Current plans to combat climate change are expected by the government to reduce emissions by 23 percent in 2020, with a further aim of halving them by 2030. “But uncertainty around the 2020 goal is very large”, the court said. “There is a clear chance that the reduction will fall far short of the 25 percent goal, which is unacceptable.” The government said it would abide by the ruling, and said the 2020 goal was “within reach”.

Strength in oil stocks on higher crude prices and a rise in banking stocks on increased global borrowing had initially lifted Europe’s STOXX 600 index, but it was back near a 6-month low as the early momentum faded. Italy’s benchmark 10-year government bond yield also moved towards a 4-1/2-year high as Economy Minister Giovanni Tria struck a resolute tone on his controversial budget plans in Rome’s parliament. There was plenty more to keep the stress levels elevated. The International Monetary Fund downgraded its global growth forecast on Monday for the first time since 2016. Asian shares had then fallen to their lows after China briefly allowed its currency to slip past a psychological bulwark. Pakistan’s rupee slumped about 5 percent in an apparent devaluation ahead of what looks likely to be another IMF programme. “It all feels like it’s quite nervous here over whether things going to break (out of ranges) or not,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. He pointed to the rising U.S. and Japanese government bond yields which tend to set the bar for borrowing costs globally as well as the latest pressure on China’s yuan. China’s central bank fixed its yuan rate at 6.9019 per dollar on Tuesday, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9120 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips edge up 0.3 percent. Yet that followed a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily fall since early 2016. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.3 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen and as yields on Tokyo’s government bonds tested the 0.15 percent cap the Bank of Japan effectively has on them. “Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the United States, currency weakness is the obvious release valve,” they warned. “A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.” A senior U.S. Treasury official on Monday expressed concern at the fall in the yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, futures were pointing lower again. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen for the third straight day on Monday and growth stocks were pressured by worries rising bond yields might ultimately hobble the economy. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper notched a new seven-year top on Tuesday at 3.252 percent. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now as rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. Yet recently the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the US growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored-in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood up 0.15 percent at 95.88, from a low of 93.814 a couple of weeks ago. The dollar had less luck on the safe-haven yen, pulling back to 113.16 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by political troubles in Italy and loitered at $1.1476, well off September’s $1.1815 top. Italy’s borrowing costs have surged as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country’s budget plans escalated. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds hovered at 3.615 percent, just off February 2014 highs, while Italy’s FTSE MIB clawed up 0.3 percent having hit its weakest since April 2017 on Monday. In commodity markets, gold got a modest safety bid at $1,191.10, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Industrial bellwethers copper and nickel jumped 1.4 and 2 percent. Oil prices also rose as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, are declining in the run-up to the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions and as a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico. Brent crude added 50 cents to $84.41 a barrel and U.S. crude firmed 41 cents to $74.70.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers started to take some profits after the strong rally in crude oil prices, even before details emerged last week of output increases from Saudi Arabia and sanctions waivers by the United States. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 19 million barrels to 1.081 billion barrels in the week to Oct. 2. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in NYMEX and ICE WTI by 13 million barrels to the lowest level for almost a year, according to exchange and regulatory records. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Pmbr3E) More significantly, funds cut their net long position in ICE Brent by 14 million barrels, the first reduction in six weeks, after increasing it by 172 million barrels since Aug. 21. Elsewhere, there were minor increases in net length in U.S. gasoline (+6 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (+7 million barrels) but a small offsetting reduction in European heating oil (-4 million barrels). The shift from accumulation to liquidation in Brent was especially notable because the fund managers had previously built the largest net long position since late May. Fund managers had accumulated long positions amid fears U.S. sanctions on Iran would leave the market short of seaborne crude, pushing Brent prices to their highest in almost four years. Brent long positions had outnumbered short ones by a near-record margin of 19:1 before long liquidation and some fresh shorting trimmed the ratio to 15:1. But the very stretched hedge fund position in Brent by the end of September significantly increased the risk of a reversal in prices, even before Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States issued statements to cool the market. U.S. officials have revealed they are actively considering sanctions waivers for at least some of Iran’s customers, which should ease fears about a potential supply crunch. And Saudi officials have confirmed the kingdom plans to raise its exports even further in October and November to relieve any shortfall from Iran. Hedge funds had pushed oil up until they discovered the pain threshold for the White House and Saudi Arabia, with prices above $80 per barrel forcing the United States and Saudi Arabia to take action to restrain prices.

2018-10-09,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - German utility RWE expects to reduce lignite output at its Hambach site in Germany, a spokeswoman for RWE said, following a court ruling that will delay plans to expand the mine by clearing an ancient forest. She was confirming a report by German magazine Der Spiegel that said output would decline by 10 to 15 million tonnes a year from its current level of 40 million tonnes. A court in the German city of Muenster said on Friday that RWE could not start logging in the Hambach forest until a separate court had reviewed environmental claims, which RWE said would push back mining until after 2020 and hit its earnings. The spokeswoman for RWE said on Tuesday that the forecast for a hit of more than 100 million euros on the 2019 operating profit of its Lignite & Nuclear division already took the expected output reduction into account. She added that no mining jobs should be affected in the short term and that RWE was sticking with its full-year guidance for this year.

2018-10-09,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has choked back on imports of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from the United States, traders and analysts said, turning to the Middle East for extra supplies amid the two countries’ trade dispute. China bought nearly 3.6 million tonnes of U.S. LPG in 2017, making the United States the country’s second-largest supplier of the fuel used in petrochemicals, as well as for cooking, transport and heating.  However, U.S. imports have come off dramatically over the course of 2018, before stalling completely in late August when China imposed an additional 25 percent tariff on over 300 U.S. goods, including LPG, in retaliation for U.S. tariffs. Consultancy IHS Markit estimates U.S. imports fell to barely 1 million tonnes during the first eight months of 2018, down from about 2.1 million tonnes for the same period last year, said He Yanyu, Executive Director for Natural Gas Liquids. (GRAPHIC: China LPG imports from top suppliers - tmsnrt.rs/2ynjtSn) The fall came as Chinese buyers wound back U.S. purchases of LPG amid uncertainty about the impact of buying product from the United States, said a trader who tracks the fuel.  No U.S. LPG cargoes have landed in China since tariffs were imposed in late August, said Ong Han Wee at consultancy FGE. “China has stopped shipping in U.S. LPG cargoes as they are now too expensive,” added a second trader who tracks LPG cargoes. The United States last year accounted for about 20 percent of China’s total LPG imports, which are currently running at about $1 billion a month, based on Thomson Reuters calculation.  The U.S. gap is being filled largely by Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, analysts said. The change comes as prices for the fuel, often a mix of propane and butane, spike in line with higher oil prices. State-owned Saudi Aramco, whose contract prices are used as benchmarks in Asia, fixed its propane and butane contract prices for October at $655 a tonne, the highest since 2014.   U.S. prices are also rising. The propane price at the Texan Mont Belvieu hub hit its highest since 2014 on Sept. 28 at around 108 cents per gallon before easing to around 104 cents on Oct. 9.  (GRAPHIC: LPG prices on the rise in line with crude oil - tmsnrt.rs/2ynl3nh) This works out to about $542 a tonne, based on Reuters calculations, but is above the Saudi Aramco price after taking into account freight and terminal charges and the additional 25 percent tariff. China’s LPG imports rose about 15 percent to nearly 18.3 million tonnes in 2017, driven partly by new petrochemicals plants which use the propane dehydrogenation method to produce the raw material for plastics..

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has granted BP (BP.L) and Serica Energy (SQZ.L) a new licence to run a North Sea gas field partly owned by Iran in a rare exemption by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration as it prepares to renew sanctions on Tehran next month. The waiver extension will allow Serica to complete the acquisition of BP’s stake in the Rhum, Bruce and Keith fields, as well as buying Total’s (TOTF.PA) stakes in Bruce and Keith, Serica said in a statement. Rhum, which supplies around 5 percent of Britain’s gas demand, is half owned by Iranian Oil Company, a subsidiary of the national oil company.  The U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control extended a licence for U.S. and U.S.-owned or controlled entities to provide goods, services and support the Rhum field. Renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which will take full effect on Nov. 4, ban U.S. companies and citizens from doing business with Iranian companies as well as transactions in dollars. The new licence is conditional on the setting up of an escrow account that will hold all profits from the field for as long as the sanctions are in place, Serica said.  A similar mechanism was set in place in the previous round of U.S. sanctions on Iran. The new licence is valid until October 31, 2019 and may be renewed upon application, Serica said.

2018-10-09,"NUSA DUA, Indonesia, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Indonesia is looking into converting two of the country’s older crude oil refineries into plants for producing biofuels, a cabinet minister said on Tuesday. The government is conducting a study with Italian energy company ENI, which has successfully converted one of its refineries to the production of biofuels, Rini Soemarno, the minister overseeing state-controlled companies, told reporters on the sidelines of the IMF-World Bank annual meetings in Bali. The move is part of a drive to reduce energy imports as the government tries to narrow the country’s current account gap amid emerging market volatility that has dragged the rupiah currency to its weakest in over 20 years. ENI is conducting a study on state energy company Pertamina’s Plaju and Dumai refineries, which were built around the 1930s, according to Soemarno. “We have been planning to modernise those refineries, but we found out that they could be turned (into biofuel plants) - most likely these two will be converted,” Soemarno said. According to Pertamina’s website, the Plaju plant has an oil refining capacity of 133,700 barrels per day (bpd), with Dumai at 170,000 bpd. Indonesia’s biodiesel drive also aims to absorb the country’s rising crude palm oil output amid sluggish global demand. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of the commodity. Starting in September, Indonesia enforced a mandatory use of B20 fuel, which has 20 percent bio-content mix, for all diesel machines in the country, including train locomotives and heavy equipment. Government officials have estimated the nation could save billion of dollars in energy imports per year through the B20 programme.

2018-10-09,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Coal-fired power has to end by 2050 to save the planet. That seemingly simple but bold sentiment is likely to set much of the political, social and economic agenda for the coming decades, but in the end it will come down to what China does. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said in a report on Monday that “unprecedented” changes will have to take place to limit the rise in the Earth’s temperature to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), warning of devastating weather events and species loss if the target is exceeded. In order to achieve the goal, the IPCC said coal burning would have to drop to between zero and 2 percent by 2050, while even natural gas, coupled with carbon capture and storage (CCS), would have to decline to 8 percent of electricity generation by the middle of this century. While coal has long been the bogeyman of climate activists, the IPCC has effectively thrown down the gauntlet and given world leaders a little over 30 years to phase it out entirely. Initial reaction to the IPCC report has been predictable, with supporters of renewable energy cheering it, and backers of fossil fuels resorting to the familiar arguments that somehow the science is either wrong or a hoax. (Graphic: reut.rs/2CzFPoz) Australia’s Environment Minister Melissa Price told ABC radio on Tuesday that the IPCC was “drawing a long bow” by calling for an end to coal by 2050, and touted new technologies as a way of saving the polluting fuel. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of coal and relies on the fuel for more than 70 percent of its electricity generation. Price isn’t alone in touting CCS and other technologies, with the World Coal Association responding to the IPCC report by saying in a statement on its website that CCS is “vital” and that the coal lobby group will push for it to be adopted. However, elsewhere on the group’s website it acknowledges that currently progress of CCS “is too slow to allow necessary emissions reductions goals to be achieved”. Its solution is to spend more on research and development. But it’s here that the coal lobby will run into problems. Already renewable technologies, which have benefited from subsidies, are becoming cheaper than conventional coal-fired power generation, a trend likely to continue. Coal-fired generation with CCS would likely require huge subsidies in order to be cost-competitive, and selling such largesse with public money will be incredibly hard for governments in democracies. It’s therefore likely that the scenario currently being played out in Europe will be extended to other parts of the world, with coal-fired power being replaced by a combination of renewables, battery storage, gas-fired back-up and even nuclear. Coal will further be hamstrung by the flight of capital from the sector, with commercial and development banks, insurers and trading companies starting to retreat from financing and insuring mines and power plants. While it’s likely that the developed world will witness ongoing bitter debates over policy toward fossil fuels, the actual key to the IPCC target is China, and to a lesser extent the rest of developing Asia. China is the world’s largest producer, consumer and importer of coal and any genuine attempt to remove coal from the world’s energy mix by 2050 will require massive commitment from Beijing. While the Chinese government has a policy of limiting the use of coal and of boosting the use of renewables and natural gas, it’s well within the realms of wishful thinking to imagine the world’s second-largest economy is on track to abandon the use of coal by 2050. According to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, China currently has 957 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired power operating - more than four times India’s 219 GW. The positive news for both China and India, the world’s second-biggest coal importer, is that the pipeline of coal-fired plant construction has been consistently shrinking and retirements of older units has been accelerating. But given that once built, coal-fired plants generally operate for at least 30 years, it would be imperative that virtually all construction is halted now, and no new plants commissioned. In reality, China currently has 126 GW of coal-fired power in construction and 76 GW either announced, in pre-permit phase or with permits already in place. India has 39 GW being built and 63 GW in the approval process. There are also new coal plants being built or planned in numerous other Asian countries, including Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines. What the IPCC report may do is accelerate pressure on those countries to re-think their power generation plans, especially if renewables can be shown to be as cheap and as reliable. It’s also likely that any technological advances in energy in the next decades will not be in favour of coal, given that vast sums are being invested in renewables and comparatively little in CCS or other coal-friendly technologies. The IPCC report highlights that coal now has its back very much against the wall, but equally that the real power for change lies in Beijing. Natural gas also tends to get off lightly in much of the media reporting about climate change, especially given the obvious target of coal. But like silent flatulence in an elevator, eventually natural gas will be unable to avoid the attention that is making life so difficult for the coal industry.

The IMF added to the malaise by cutting forecasts of global growth for both this year and next, including downgrades to the outlook for the United States, China and Europe. “Risk sentiment is in a foul mood and stocks are sinking everywhere,” said analysts at JPMorgan in a note. “With Chinese economic momentum continuing to weaken alongside increasing pressure from the U.S., currency weakness is the obvious release valve,” they warned. “A lurch through the 7.0 level by year end is possible.” China’s central bank on Tuesday fixed its yuan at 6.9019 per dollar, so breaching the 6.9000 barrier and leading speculators to push the dollar up to 6.9320 in the spot market. The drop should be a positive for exporters and did help Shanghai blue chips briefly edge up 0.1 percent in early trade before trading almost flat. Yet that follows a 4.3 percent slide on Monday which was the largest daily drop since early 2016. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased another 0.2 percent after ending Monday at its lowest point since May last year. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.2 percent, hurt in part by a rise in the safe-harbour yen. On Monday, a senior U.S. Treasury official expressed concern at the fall in the yuan, adding that it was unclear whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin would meet with any Chinese officials this week. On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen for the third straight day on Monday and growth stocks were pressured by worries rising bond yields might ultimately hobble the economy. The S&P 500 lost 0.04 percent and the Nasdaq Composite 0.67 percent, while the Dow rose 0.15 percent as defensive stocks found buyers. Yields on 10-year Treasury paper held at 3.24 percent on Tuesday, near a seven-year top. Treasuries have had a sort of safety net up to now as rising yields tend to dampen stocks and threaten the economic outlook, thus putting pressure on the Federal Reserve to go slow on policy tightening. Yet recently the Fed has sounded so bullish on the economy and so hawkish on rates that the net has become frayed. “The size and speed of the bearish bond impulse would suggest a collective shift in market thinking about the US growth prospects and policy projections,” said Damien McColough, Westpac’s head of rates strategy. “The Fed’s expected 2019 profile has moved from just below 2 hikes to 2.5 hikes being factored-in.” That shift has underpinned the dollar against a basket of currencies where it stood at 95.754, from a low of 93.814 just a couple of weeks ago. The dollar had less luck on the safe-haven yen pulling back to 113.07 from a 114.54 peak last week. The euro was undermined by political troubles in Italy and lapsed to $1.1490, well off September’s $1.1815 top. Italy’s borrowing costs have surged as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country’s budget plans escalated. The yield on Italian government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 3.626 percent, the highest since February 2014, while Italy’s FTSE MIB stock index fell to its weakest since April 2017. Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday. In commodity markets, gold got only a marginal safety bid at $1,189.41, having fallen 1.4 percent overnight. Oil prices were little changed as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran are declining in the run-up to the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, while a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico.

2018-10-09,"LUXEMBOURG, Oct 9 (Reuters) - European Union environment ministers will seek a compromise on Tuesday over how tough to be on curbing carbon dioxide emissions from cars and vans, with Germany warning too tough targets could harm industry and cost jobs. In a clash between concerns over the environmental risk of emissions and industry competitiveness, European Union governments remained divided ahead of talks over what 2030 limits to impose on Europe’s powerful carmakers. Germany, with its big auto sector, has backed the EU executives proposed target of a 30 percent reduction by 2030, compared to 2021 levels. France, Netherlands and a number of other countries, however, are pushing for a stricter limit of 40 percent, in line with higher climate targets backed by EU lawmakers last week. “It’s too close to call,” said Greg Archer, an expert with Brussels-based campaign group Transport & Environment, adding that a number of nations such as Spain have yet to chose a camp. Austria, which holds the EU’s rotating presidency, has proposed a compromise of 35 percent in hopes of reaching an agreement among the bloc’s 28 nations on Tuesday. If they reach an agreement, negotiations on the final law could begin with the EU’s two other lawmaking bodies, European Parliament and the European Commission, as early as Wednesday. EU sources said that Germany, with the backing of eastern European member states, may have the votes needed for a majority at the meeting. The limits in the transport sector - the only one in which emissions are still rising - aim to help the bloc meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. The debate comes a day after the release of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which warned that society would have to take “unprecedented” changes to meet a lower global warming target.

2018-10-09,"(Repeats Oct. 8 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2xBIs4T By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers started to take some profits after the strong rally in crude oil prices, even before details emerged last week of output increases from Saudi Arabia and sanctions waivers by the United States. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 19 million barrels to 1.081 billion barrels in the week to Oct. 2. Portfolio managers cut their net long position in NYMEX and ICE WTI by 13 million barrels to the lowest level for almost a year, according to exchange and regulatory records (tmsnrt.rs/2Pmbr3E). More significantly, funds cut their net long position in ICE Brent by 14 million barrels, the first reduction in six weeks, after increasing it by 172 million barrels since Aug. 21. Elsewhere, there were minor increases in net length in U.S. gasoline (+6 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (+7 million barrels) but a small offsetting reduction in European heating oil (-4 million barrels). The shift from accumulation to liquidation in Brent was especially notable because the fund managers had previously built the largest net long position since late May. Fund managers had accumulated long positions amid fears U.S. sanctions on Iran would leave the market short of seaborne crude, pushing Brent prices to their highest in almost four years. Brent long positions had outnumbered short ones by a near-record margin of 19:1 before long liquidation and some fresh shorting trimmed the ratio to 15:1. But the very stretched hedge fund position in Brent by the end of September significantly increased the risk of a reversal in prices, even before Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States issued statements to cool the market. U.S. officials have revealed they are actively considering sanctions waivers for at least some of Iran’s customers, which should ease fears about a potential supply crunch. And Saudi officials have confirmed the kingdom plans to raise its exports even further in October and November to relieve any shortfall from Iran. Hedge funds had pushed oil up until they discovered the pain threshold for the White House and Saudi Arabia, with prices above $80 per barrel forcing the United States and Saudi Arabia to take action to restrain prices.

2018-10-09,"TOKYO, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices held little changed on Tuesday, as more evidence emerged that crude exports from Iran are declining in the run-up to the reimposition of U.S. sanctions, while a hurricane moved across the Gulf of Mexico. Brent crude was down 7 cents at $83.84 a barrel by 0020 GMT. On Monday, Brent fell to a low of $82.66, but mostly recovered as investors bet China’s economic stimulus would boost crude demand. Brent hit a four-year high of $86.74 last week. U.S. crude was down by 1 cent at $74.28 a barrel, having fallen as low as $73.07 in the previous session to close the day just 5 cents lower. Iran’s crude exports fell further in the first week of October, according to tanker data and an industry source, taking a major hit from U.S. sanctions and throwing a challenge to other OPEC oil producers as they seek to cover the shortfall. The Islamic Republic exported 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in that seven-day period, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. An industry source who also tracks exports said October shipments were so far below 1 million bpd. That’s down from at least 2.5 million bpd in April, before President Donald Trump in May withdrew the U.S. from a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimposed sanctions. The figure also marks a further fall from 1.6 million bpd in September. Last week, Saudi Arabia announced plans to lift crude output next month to 10.7 million bpd, a record. Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh on Monday called a Saudi claim that the kingdom could replace Iran’s crude exports “nonsense.” “Iran’s oil cannot be replaced by Saudi Arabia nor any other country,” Zanganeh said, according to his ministry’s website. Gulf of Mexico oil companies shut down 19 percent of oil production as Hurricane Michael moved toward eastern Gulf states including Florida. If current forecasts prove accurate, the hurricane would largely miss major producing assets in the Gulf, analysts said, but any change of track could widen the impact.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will seek to lift a federal ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline on Tuesday, a senior White House official said, delivering on a move long-sought by anxious Midwest farmers ahead of November’s elections. The move will be coupled with restrictions on biofuel credit trading sought by merchant refiners like Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy Inc. Those rules would be aimed at retailers and oil majors accused by merchant refiners of driving up cost of complying with biofuels blending laws. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency currently prohibits summer sales of gasoline blended with 15 percent ethanol, or E15, due to smog concerns. Because ethanol is cheaper than gasoline, the administration hopes it will bring down retail prices, which currently average $2.91 a gallon, more than 40 cents higher than this time a year ago, according to the American Automobile Association. The announcement will mark the end of a months-long effort by the White House to bring rival corn and oil industries together over reforms to boost ethanol demand while alleviating compliance costs for refiners. Trump plans to hold a closed-door event with ethanol producers in Washington before a rally in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Tuesday to highlight the change. Council Bluffs is in a moderate congressional district represented by incumbent Republican Dave Young, who is locked in a tight race. “Rural America needs a shot in the arm, and this is it,” said Emily Skor, chief executive officer of Growth Energy, a biofuel trade association. Farmers have been frustrated with weak corn and soybean prices hurt by the trade war between the United States and China; Trump has promised the trade war with China will eventually boost the U.S. economy. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool annually, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that buy the credits have complained about volatile prices. The EPA will consider forcing blenders, retailers and trading houses to sell credits more quickly, the official said. The agency may only allow obligated parties like refiners to buy credits, and may require greater public disclosure as well. About 400 million gallons of E15 are sold in the U.S. annually, a fraction of the roughly 142 billion gallons in U.S. gasoline sales last year. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade association, opposes lifting the ban, which would hurt their market share. They say E15 gasoline ruins older cars and potentially voids warranties, and have threatened to sue, arguing the EPA lacks the legal authority to strike the ban.

Eyes were again on China, where blue chips shed 4.3 percent on Monday in the largest daily drop since early 2016. While the stock market in China is far from a reliable gauge of economic activity, sharp falls do spill over into sentiment across the region. “The latest round of selling in China can’t be dismissed and has resulted in Chinese stocks suffering their worst start to October in a decade,” said Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy & market research at broker FXTM. “We have seen a trend in the past where weakness in China has resonated on other global markets,” he added. “If the yuan continues to ease, it does paint a picture of more possible pain for emerging markets.” The yuan had slid to its lowest official close against the dollar in seven weeks on expectations Beijing would follow Sunday’s policy easing with more stimulus.

2018-10-09,"LONDON (Reuters) - The costs and operating expenditure needed to produce oil and gas in the British North Sea are set to rise both in overall and in per-barrel terms this year compared with 2017, the country’s regulator for the sector said on Tuesday. Overall operating spending in the mature North Sea oil and gas basin this year is estimated to rise almost 9 percent to 7.5 billion pounds ($9.8 billion), according to the Oil and Gas Authority. But this is still almost third lower than in 2014, when oil prices over $100 a barrel had pushed up costs. Unit operating costs, which means the sum of operating costs divided by the sum of barrels of oil equivalent produced, are estimated to rise by  around 5 percent this year to 12.2 pounds per barrel of oil equivalent, the watchdog said in a report. This unit cost level is also around a third lower than in 2014. (GRAPHIC: North Sea operating costs - reut.rs/2OMTBtq)  The watchdog forecast that total operating expenditure and unit operating costs would not keep rising after 2018 but would stay broadly flat or fall slightly through 2023 in a sign that  years of intense cost cutting by the oil and gas industry have come to an end. Total 2018 North Sea production is set to rise around 3 percent to 613 million barrels of oil equivalent. Oil and gas companies invested billions in the North Sea in the late 2000s to meet surging demand from Asia but the subsequent oil price rally masked huge inefficiencies and waste. When oil prices fell in 2014 as shale producers in the United States competed with OPEC for market share, North Sea output had already dwindled to around 1 million barrels per day from a peak of 2.6 million in 1999. Investments were drying up and many operators were focused on plugging wells and dismantling fields, but government and industry efforts resulting in significant cost cuts have attracted a renewed investment to the basin. And now the world’s biggest oil and gas companies are under growing pressure to loosen the purse strings to replenish reserves, halt output declines and take advantage of a crude price rally after years of austerity. In addition, oil services companies are now at loggerheads with producers as they battle for what they see as a fair share of the industry’s recovery. The oil market is cyclical by nature — if crude prices fall, so does investment and then output, which in turn drives up prices — and oil services companies ride the rollercoaster by using the upturns to raise their prices to offset the downturns.
