2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - The majority of senior energy industry executives expect to maintain or increase spending this year to meet demand for oil and gas after years of austerity, a survey by DNV GL shows. DNV, a technical adviser to the energy industry, surveyed 791 senior professionals from firms with annual revenue ranging from $500 million or less to those earning $5 billion and more. BP (BP.L), Shell (RDSa.L) and many other companies cut capital spending and costs in 2016 after the price of benchmark Brent crude fell to a 12-year low of below $30 a barrel. Helped by output cuts by Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, Brent climbed to an average price of $70 last year compared to $50 for the period 2015 to 2017. It was trading above $62 a barrel on Monday. DNV’s annual outlook of the global oil and gas industry showed 70 percent of respondents planned to maintain or increase capital spending in 2019, compared to 39 percent in 2017. Those expecting to sustain or increase operating expenditure also grew to 65 percent in 2019 from 41 percent in 2017. In addition, 67 percent believed more large, capital-intensive oil and gas projects would be approved this year. “Despite greater oil price volatility in recent months, our research shows that the sector appears confident in its ability to better cope with market instability and long-term lower oil and gas prices,” said Liv Hovem, who heads DNV’s oil and gas division. “For the most part, industry leaders now appear to be positive that growth can be achieved after several difficult years,” she added. The survey indicated that the industry’s focus on cost control was easing, with 21 percent of respondents saying cost efficiency would be a top priority in 2019, down from 31 percent in 2018 and 41 percent in 2016. The survey also indicated that more energy companies were preparing for a long-term shift to cleaner energy sources. More than half of respondents, or 51 percent, said they would focus on adapting to a less carbon-intensive energy mix in 2019, up from 44 percent last year, due to stricter regulation. One third said they aimed to increase investment in renewable energy in 2019, and 35 percent said their firms would lift investment in gas-related projects and portfolios. Despite growing momentum among energy firms to reduce their carbon footprint, DNV said its survey indicated “that companies today are more likely to be doing so because they are told to, rather than because they want to.” The report said 46 percent of respondents believed high oil prices could delay the industry’s shift towards decarbonisation, as firms sought to make short-term gains from more efficient practices and improved margins.

2019-01-21,"KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 22 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More of the billions of tonnes of materials the world uses each year must be recycled and reused to keep climate change in check, researchers said on Tuesday. Only about a tenth of the nearly 93 billion tonnes of materials utilised annually - including minerals, metals, fossil fuels and biomass - are currently put back into service, said a report by Amsterdam-based social enterprise Circle Economy. CEO Harald Friedl told the Thomson Reuters Foundation more efficient use of those resources could help avoid overshooting the goals adopted in the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit the average rise in global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6F), and ideally to 1.5C, above pre-industrial times. The Circle Economy report said 62 percent of heat-trapping emissions, excluding land use and forestry, are released during the extraction, processing and manufacturing of goods. To tackle climate change, government policy has so far focused on adopting renewable energies, boosting energy efficiency, and stopping deforestation, the report said. “It is like when you look in your closet on a morning and you only look for pants,” said Friedl by phone. “We need to change the whole system.” The amount of materials the world uses has tripled since 1970 and could double again by 2050 if no action is taken, the United Nations estimates. To reduce waste and emissions, economies should seek to become “circular” by reusing products, Friedl added. “To make things circular may be painful - from changing consumer and business habits to telling countries to put up the right regulations - but it is feasible,” he said. In Asia, fast-developing economies and urbanisation are driving huge investments in construction and infrastructure, offering chances to promote a circular economy, said Friedl. In Europe, the report urged countries to maximise the value of existing buildings by extending their lifespan, improving energy efficiency, and finding new uses for them. The report outlined three broad strategies to shift to a circular economy. The use of products should be maximised, such as through car-sharing or keeping vehicles for longer, it said. Recycling and reducing waste are also key, as is using natural, low-carbon materials in construction, like bamboo and wood instead of cement, it said. Governments should adopt taxation and spending plans that encourage a circular economy, raising levies on emissions and excessive waste production while cutting them for labour, innovation and investments, the report added. Financial incentives that promote the overuse of natural resources, such as fossil fuels, should be abolished, it said. ""It's a hands-on way to save the world,"" said Friedl.

2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday, reversing earlier losses, as investors shrugged off data that confirmed China’s economic growth is cooling and instead latched on to positive supply-side drivers for the market. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 were up 12 cents at $62.83 a barrel by 3:23 p.m. EST (1727 GMT) versus Friday’s settlement price, while U.S. crude futures CLc1 were up 19 cents to $53.99 a barrel. The U.S. financial markets are closed on Monday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Global equities fell after data pointed to a slowdown in Chinese economic growth in 2018 to a 28-year low. The numbers fed concern that the outlook for global growth may be darkening, particularly given U.S.-China trade tensions. “It remains quite likely that the trade spat with the U.S. has played a part in this latest slowdown,” CMC Markets chief market analyst Michael Hewson said. “But investors should also factor in that it simply isn’t possible for the Chinese economy to grow at the pace that it has over the last 10 years, in the next 10 years.” Stock markets are still up so far this month, which has given oil investors more confidence to bet aggressively on a rise in crude prices. Analysts said a more robust backdrop for financial markets and the prospect of slower crude production growth were the major drivers behind the rally in oil. “The stock market performance is one of the reasons why oil keeps marching higher. There also seems to be a general belief that the agreed cut in OPEC+ production will be sufficient to balance the market,” PVM Oil Associates said in a note. While there is concern that a slowing global economy could impact oil demand, production cuts implemented by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are likely to support crude oil prices, analysts said. “You can’t justify oil prices at these levels. We’re looking basically at an average of almost $70 a barrel for Brent in 2019,” ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson said. “I am getting increasingly concerned about how tight the market will be going into 2020.”  A separate report from China’s National Bureau of Statistics showed crude oil refinery throughput in 2018 climbed to a record 12.1 million barrels per day, up 6.8 percent from the previous year.             In the United States, energy companies cut the number of rigs drilling for oil by 21 last week, the biggest decline in three years, taking the count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday.

2019-01-21,"(Adds detail, quotes) LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Iran failed to find any buyers on Monday in its latest attempt to sell oil to private companies for export on the energy exchange, state media reported, in a setback to Tehran’s efforts to bypass U.S. sanctions. Crude oil trade is state-controlled in Iran, but to try to work around U.S. sanctions, the government last year started to sell crude to private buyers through the exchange. However, there were no buyers on Monday for the one million barrels the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) offered on the exchange at a starting price of $52 a barrel. In October, before U.S. sanctions came into force, Iran sold 280,000 barrels at $74 apiece of the one million barrels it offered on the exchange. Two weeks later it sold 700,000 barrels at $64 each. Iran has not revealed the identity of the private buyers in the energy exchange because they might be targeted by U.S. penalties. The buyers in the first two rounds had to settle 20 percent of the payment in rials and 80 percent in foreign currencies. However, in the last round, all purchases could be paid with rials. Washington re-introduced sanctions on Iran’s oil exports on Nov. 4 after withdrawing from a 2015 multinational deal that had lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme. Iran’s vice president on Monday said that Iran can still find buyers for its oil. “Despite U.S. plots to stop Iranian oil sales ... we have managed to sell as much crude as we need,” Eshaq Jahangiri was quoted as saying by SHANA, the oil ministry’s news agency.

2019-01-21,"* Ukraine earns transit fees from Russian gas * Russian gas no longer sold to Ukraine * Ukraine still important gas import route for EU * No threat to Russian gas supplies via Ukraine - EU (Adds details on meeting from sources) By Alissa de Carbonnel BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine will meet for further gas talks in May after an EU-mediated discussion in Brussels on Monday yielded no concrete results, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said. The talks have focused on Russian gas transit via Ukraine to Europe, the source of up to 3 percent of Ukrainian gross domestic product. With Russia embroiled in conflict with Kiev over breakaway regions in Ukraine’s east and the European Union reliant on Russian gas to fuel its industries, the future of gas transit - seen by Kiev as a crucial guarantor of its independence from Moscow - is the subject of intricate diplomacy. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said Moscow is ready to keep its transit of gas to Europe through Ukraine once the current deal with Kiev expires on Dec. 31, 2019 if supplies are economically viable. Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz accused Russia of delaying negotiations in order to get its Nord Stream 2 pipeline built first. Russia’s planned doubling of capacity on the Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany could help Moscow bypass exports via Ukraine. That would deny Kiev transit fees. “Gazprom is delaying real talks in terms of transit in order to build Nord Stream 2,” Naftogaz Deputy Chief Executive Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters before the talks on Monday. “Then they will say, ‘We are OK without any Ukrainian transits at all’.” Russian gas giant Gazprom’s partners in the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project include Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall and France’s Engie . THREE-WAY TALKS Sources familiar with Monday’s talks said European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, who chaired the three-way meeting with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and Novak, had floated a proposal for the two countries to agree a new 10-year transit contract, with a guaranteed minimum yearly transit volume of 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) and 30 bcm of additional flexibility. There was no immediate reaction from either the Russian or Ukraine delegations. Executives from Naftogaz and Gazprom also attended the meeting. Moscow and Kiev have clashed frequently over energy. Talks are complicated by a lengthy legal dispute between Gazprom and Naftogaz that led to a Stockholm arbitration court ruling in February 2018 that each company must compensate the other. Sefcovic said the Stockholm arbitration was the “elephant in the room”. Naftogaz emerged the net winner of that ruling, gaining $2.56 billion from Gazprom. Gazprom is challenging the decision - a process that could take years. “For the Russians, it is a huge stumbling block,” Sefcovic said. “For them, it is difficult to negotiate a good contract for the long term when they are still fighting the legal claims.” (Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel in Brussel and Vladimir Soldatkin in Moscow; Editing by Jason Neely/Dale Hudson/Susan Fenton)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ukraine-gas/update-2-russia-ukraine-to-hold-further-gas-talks-in-may-idUKL8N1ZL4MV,21 Jan 2019,"* No threat to Russian gas supplies via Ukraine - EU

2019-01-21,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s two major railways are rationing space on trains traveling to the country’s biggest port and recently prioritized some commodities over others to deal with congestion, the latest indication of their struggle to meet demand from new trade deals.  That move prompted Canada’s transport regulator last week to start an investigation into rail services around Port Metro Vancouver, after shippers complained of “discriminatory treatment of certain commodities” by Canadian National Railway (CN) (CNR.TO) and Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) (CP.TO). Canada is a top shipper of crops, fertilizer, oil and pulp, but has in recent years needed government intervention to keep commodities moving, from ordering railways to clear grain backlogs to Alberta’s crude oil curtailments this month due to full pipelines. Free-trade deals with the European Union and Pacific Nations are boosting demand for commodities, adding further strain to Canada’s transportation infrastructure. Currently, the United States and Mexico account for at least 75 percent of Canadian exports. Both railways last month rationed the volume of traffic around Vancouver by restricting movement of some commodities, such as peas, lentils, pulp and paper, according to shipper notices seen by Reuters.      The restrictions, called embargoes, are usually a tool of last resort for railways to ease congestion by temporarily limiting traffic. But in December, shippers allege that CN and CP used them more often than normal, harming some commodity sellers more than others in an effort to push through the maximum overall volume. CP imposed embargoes on three specific transloaders - facilities that empty rail cars into containers for loading onto vessels. These transloaders handle peas and lentils, but were prevented from doing so in December for days at a time, said Greg Northey, director of industry relations at Pulse Canada. The delays caused some containers to miss their vessels, triggering contract breach penalties, Northey said. “It was a total mess,” he said. Embargoes also added costs for pulp and paper producers, who are trying to bolster ties with Asian buyers amid ongoing tariff disputes with the United States. For a second consecutive year, the railways imposed more embargo restrictions on pulp and paper than usual in December, leading to shipping delays, according to the Forest Products Association of Canada, whose members include Canfor Corp (CFP.TO) and West Fraser Timber (WFT.TO). “We can’t do business like this if we want to diversify markets,” said association Chief Executive Derek Nighbor. “It’s just a missed opportunity.”   Poor rail service costs the forest products industry C$500 million ($376 million) annually, the association said. December’s problems cost mills as much as a further C$1 million each, it said. Several shippers said the transportation agency will be asked at a hearing in late January to consider whether the railways discriminated against shippers that fill manifest trains - those carrying a variety of products. The investigation could also consider whether the railways violated their common carrier obligations to haul a full range of freight. For CN and CP, the investigation raises the risk of further regulation in an industry where they already complain of too much government control. In a statement, CN said the transportation agency’s investigation should examine the full supply chain and take into account the impact that rain and wind had on operations late last year. CN said freight shipments are up 10 percent from November to mid-January year-over-year. CP Chief Executive Keith Creel said he takes “great exception” to CP being included in the agency’s investigation, adding in a statement that he is not aware of formal complaints. Since the railways’ embargo and permit system was implemented in December to clear backed-up freight, the flow of cars to grain terminals has improved. But it is unclear how the backlog happened in the first place, said Wade Sobkowich, executive director of Western Grain Elevator Association. It indicates that railways have failed to invest in adequate capacity to move goods at peak times, he said. Canpotex Ltd, the offshore sales arm of potash producers Nutrien Ltd (NTR.TO) and Mosaic Co (MOS.N) has also been affected by congestion and delays around Vancouver, spokeswoman Natashia Stinka said.

2019-01-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - European shares fell on Monday from six-week highs as a slowdown in China’s economy stalled a global equity rally, but sterling rallied to the day’s highs after Prime Minister Theresa May promised to be more “flexible” with lawmakers over Brexit. Trade in general was subdued with U.S. markets closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day but equity prices were hit after data showed the Chinese economy, the world’s second biggest, grew 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, matching levels last seen in early 2009 during the global financial crisis. The number was in line with forecasts, while factory output picked up stronger-than-expected in December and stronger services sector were some bright spots. That, along with expectations of more stimulus from Beijing, pushed Asian markets to the highest since early-December .MIAPJ0000PUS .CSI300. But the rally in world shares appeared to end there.  A pan-European equity index  fell 1.3 percent, below six-week highs hit on Friday while Germany shares .GDAXI, heavily exposed to exports to China, was 0.6 percent lower on the day. U.S. stock market futures, which offer an indication of how Wall Street shares will next open, were down roughly half a percent. ESc1 1YMc1 NQc1 “It seems that the optimism we saw in Asia did not extend into Europe,” said Brittany Baumann, macro strategist at TD Securities in London.  “And the start of this week is a reflection of the downside risk that still exist - Brexit and China/U.S. trade developments.” China’s economy faces deep and complicated changes, President Xi Jinping said on Monday. Growing signs of weakness in China — which has generated nearly a third of global growth in recent years — has fuelled anxiety about risks to the world economy in recent weeks and are weighing on profits for firms such as Apple. (AAPL.O) “On balance, the (China) data is relatively positive and does not point to a hard landing,” said Timothy Graf, head of macro strategy at State Street Global Advisors in London. “The consumption data being better than expected is the positive takeaway in that China is trying to engineer a move towards a consumer-led economy.”  But in other signs of caution, the Australian dollar AUD=D, often used a liquid proxy for China investments, nudged down to $0.7156. Oil prices also fell on further evidence that economic growth in China, the world’s second largest crude consumer, was easing. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 fell 0.2 percent to $62.57 a barrel. [O/R] In currency markets, sterling firmed after Prime Minister Theresa May indicated she would be more “flexible” with lawmakers, even though she refused to rule out a no-deal Brexit. There are few signs she can break a deadlock with parliament after her Brexit deal was rejected last week. May offered to tweak her defeated deal by seeking further concessions from the European Union on a backup plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Sterling fell initially as she spoke, then climbed to session highs, rising above $1.29 GBP=D3. Against the euro it touched a high of 88.07 pence, up 0.2 percent on the day, reversing earlier losses. “Her failure to detail Plan B could be the catalyst to the parliament to taking control of the process,” John Marley, a senior currency consultant at FX risk management specialist, SmartCurrencyBusiness, said. “Ultimately that makes an extension, a deal or even a second referendum more likely.”  Britain's FTSE index .FTSE traded around flat while British government bond yields slipped 3 basis points to 1.32 percent GB10YT=RR.

2019-01-21,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari’s government accused the main opposition party of planning violence ahead of next month’s election in a nation with a history of unrest and fraud allegations around votes.  The opposition called it a “ludicrous” pretext for repression. The Feb. 16 vote in Africa’s top oil producer pits Buhari, a military ruler in the 1980s who was voted into office in 2015, against main opposition candidate Atiku Abubakar, a businessman and former vice president. Reliable polls are hard to find in the nation of 190 million people, and analysts widely expect a tight race, partly because opposition stronghold states have seen a bigger increase in voter registration than ones where the ruling party is popular.  “We have credible intelligence that armed bandits andBoko Haram insurgents have been mobilised to engage in massive attacks and other acts of violence in several states,” Information Minister Lai Mohammed said, pointing the finger at Abubakar’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Mohammed, who did not provide details of evidence, said the opposition wanted to create a constitutional crisis and trigger an interim government because it could not win the election.  “It is imperative to state that the PDP finds the claims of Alhaji Lai Mohammed irresponsible and ludicrous. It is just a measure for building the ground for framing up and arrest of leading members,” said the PDP in an emailed statement.  In October, Buhari sought to reassure voters the election would be free and fair after the opposition and international observers raised concerns that a gubernatorial vote was marred by voter intimidation. Security has become a campaign issue due to an uptick in attacks by Islamist insurgents in the northeast.  Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram, the militant group from which it broke away in 2016, have both carried out attacks in the last few months.  The PDP in its statement also urged the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure a free election.  “The entire nation is worried and the palpable fear of every Nigerian today is whether (INEC chairman) Mahmood Yakubu can conduct an election, which will indeed be free, fair, credible and transparent,” it said.

Total is one of the strongest players in the African oil sector, holding more proven reserves on the continent than any of the other top global oil companies. The 60,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Ikike project is one of several projects the group has earmarked in Nigeria for a final investment decision, including the 70,000 bpd deepwater Preowei project, which would help Total increase its oil production. “There is a huge potential in Nigeria, it is probably the most prolific country in west Africa in terms of oil and gas and it is time to launch new projects and we are working on many of them,” Pouyanne told journalists. He was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of Nigerian and French businesses in Paris. This month, Total started production at the Egina oilfield off the coast of Nigeria. “On the same area as Egina, we have Preowei, which could be connected to Egina, We are working on that,” Pouyanne said. Total also planned to expand its Nigerian LNG project this year, he said. “The market is very good today to do that, it is a very interesting project and the partners are in line to develop it... 2019 should be the year of expanding Nigeria LNG,” he added. Pouyanne called on Nigeria to issue new exploration licences, saying the country’s oil and gas sector had been dormant in recent years in terms of exploration and new projects due to uncertainties and the ongoing discussions over Nigeria’s oil industry regulation. The last round of exploration licenses tenders was in 2011. “I hope the new government that will come after the election will launch new tenders for awarding new exploration licenses,” he said. Nigerians will vote on Feb. 16 in a presidential election with incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari seeking a second term. Total is also developing Uganda’s first oilfield with China’s CNOOC and Pouyanne said the company would make a final investment decision this year on whether to start production. Uganda has said it expects to start producing oil in 2021. Pouyanne said he recently told Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni that Total would also be willing to take a stake in a refinery to process crude from the field which is due to be built and operational by 2023. Uganda signed a deal with a consortium, including a subsidiary of General Electric, to build and operate a 60,000 barrel per day refinery that will cost $3 billion-$4 billion.

Crude oil trade is state-controlled in Iran, but to try to work round U.S. sanctions, the government last year started to sell crude to private buyers through the stock exchange. However, there were no buyers on Monday for the one million barrels it offered on the exchange at a starting price of $52 per barrel. In October, before U.S. sanctions came into force, Iran sold 280,000 barrels at $74 apiece of the one million barrels it offered on the exchange. Two weeks later, it sold 700,000 barrels at $64 each. Washington re-introduced sanctions on Iran’s oil exports on Nov. 4 after earlier in the year withdrawing from a 2015 multinational deal that had lifted sanctions in return for limits on Iran’s nuclear programme.

2019-01-21,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Fourteen miners were killed in an eastern Rwandan tin mine after a hill collapsed on them after heavy rains, officials said on Monday. “Because of recent rainfall in the area, part of the hill nearby collapsed and 14 miners who were getting ready for work were buried by land,” Fred Mufuruke, governor of Eastern province, said. The mining site is owned by the Rwandan business of Britain’s Piran Resources, John Kanyangira, the director of mining inspection at Rwanda Mines, Petroleum and Gas Board (RBM), said. It was an open mining site and a nearby hill collapsed, burying seven men and seven women, he told Reuters. Kanyangira said 81 people died last year in mining accidents. He said Rwanda’s mining industry, quarrying excluded, employs 43,000 people. Piran Resources has a 25-year mining licence in eastern Rwanda for two concessions. Piran Resources is part of Pella Resources, an Africa-focused natural resource and energy group. Last month, at another mining site in the southern part of Rwanda, five miners were trapped underground when the site collapsed. Soldiers and member of the public dug them out alive after nearly two days. Small-scale mining in Rwanda’s hilly landscape has led to landslides and mine collapses. Earnings from Rwanda’s mineral exports more than doubled to $373-million in 2017 up from  $166-million a year before. The government says revenues are expected to climb to $600 million in this year.

2019-01-21,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s ELN rebel group on Monday claimed responsibility for last week’s car bomb attack against a police academy that killed 21 as a legitimate act of war and urged President Ivan Duque to return to the negotiating table. The National Liberation Army (ELN) said in a statement that it conducted the attack against a “military installation” where officials are trained in intelligence and actively participate in the war. “The operation carried out against said installations and troops is lawful within the law of war, there were no non-combatant victims,” the ELN said, adding that the military attacked its camps during an ELN Christmas ceasefire.  In last Thursday’s bombing, a gray Nissan Patrol SUV carrying about 80 kilograms (176 lbs) of high explosive pentolite, broke through checkpoints onto the grounds of the General Santander School in the capital, Bogota, before it detonated. The blast killed 20 cadets between the ages of 18 and 23 and the driver, ELN explosives expert Jose Aldemar Rojas, officials said. The car bombing - the worst in almost 16 years - brought tens of thousands to streets nationwide on Sunday in protest against violence and solidarity with the police. The attack heightened fears that a new wave of bombings had been launched in reaction to right-wing Duque. “There’s not, nor can there be, any show of forgiveness or refuge to a group that’s now recognised authorship of this criminal act, of this act which has no justification whatsoever,” High Peace Commissioner Miguel Ceballos told reporters in Bogota. The ELN, made up of some 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist organization by the United States, began peace talks with the government of former President Juan Manuel Santos in February 2017 but were postponed by Duque until it stops attacks and frees hostages. Duque asked Cuba, which hosted negotiations, to capture and extradite 10 rebel leaders engaged in the talks. Foreign Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said extradition was Cuba’s “duty.”  The ELN, formed by radical Catholic priests in 1964, urged Duque to send a team of negotiators back to Havana to restart the talks. “President Duque, we reiterate that war is not the future of Colombia, it’s peace, so we remind you that the best thing for the country is to send your delegation to the table to give continuity to the peace process,” the ELN said. Cuba said it would respect the protocols of the negotiations and was consulting with both parties. The protocols provide security guarantees for guerrilla commanders to return to Colombia and prevent military attacks for an agreed period. In a tweet on Monday, Cuba’s Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez again condemned the attack.  “Cuba has never allowed, nor will it ever allow, its territory to be used for the perpetration of terrorist actions against any state,” he said. The ELN was the second biggest rebel group until peace was signed with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in late 2016.  The ELN, which has fought more than a dozen governments, seeks land reform and opposes oil and mining activities by multinational companies, saying they take advantage of natural resources without benefiting Colombians.

2019-01-21,"(Adds detail, oil price) By Ahmed Hagagy KUWAIT, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Kuwait on Monday projected a 4.7 percent rise in spending to 22.5 billion dinars ($74.15 billion) as part of its state budget for the year ending on March 31, 2020, as the major oil producer seeks to spur economic growth. The Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nayef al-Hajraf said he expected the average oil price to range between $55 to $65 per barrel, higher than the projected $50 a barrel in its last budget. Brent crude oil futures traded around $63 on Monday. Kuwait said the new plan aims to drive economic growth by maintaining a capital expenditure ratio of 17 percent of the budget, in line with last year’s figures, while tightening controls to curb wasteful spending. Al-Hajraf also promised to continue to gradually introduce fiscal reforms. The budget projects state subsidies of 3.97 billion dinars. Salaries and subsidies account for 71 percent of the budget, according to the budget statement. The budget deficit in the new fiscal year was projected at 7.7 billion dinars after accounting for a deposit of 10 percent of total revenue into the sovereign wealth fund. The finance ministry said the fiscal deficit is expected to decline by 2.1 percent compared to current budget figures. Kuwait’s finance minister said the deficit will be totally covered by general state reserves. The state transfers 10 percent of total annual revenue to the Future Generations Fund, which is managed by the Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA). KIA, a major global investor, manages about $592 billion in assets, according to the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which ranks it the world’s fourth-biggest sovereign wealth fund. The state’s budget projected 16.3 billion dinars in revenue, with non-oil revenue expected to rise by 5.4 percent compared to the current year’s budget. It did not provide revenue figures for the current fiscal year. The fiscal 2018/19 budget had projected a revenue of 15 billion dinars.

2019-01-21,"(Adds start of crude oil pumping, changes dateline, previous JUBA) By Denis Dumo UNITY OILFIELD, South Sudan, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Sudan started pumping on Monday an additional 15,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from its Unity oilfields, its oil minister said. Oil minister Ezekiel Lul Gatkuoth told Reuters on Sunday the country had begun to repair wells damaged in the civil war and that wells reopening on Monday would add 12,000 bpd to output, rising to 70,000 bpd by the end of 2019. Prior to the increase, production was at 160,000 bpd. “Today, officially, Unity Oil production is opened,” Gatkuoth said during a ceremony at the field, hailing cooperation with neighbouring Sudan which he said was “unbreakable” and would lead to the opening of new blocks. South Sudan’s oil infrastructure was badly damaged in its civil war, which broke out in 2013, two years after it had become independent from Sudan. Production plunged to less than half of pre-war levels, but wells are being repaired with the help of the Sudanese, said Gatkuoth. Malaysia’s Petronas, India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC Videsh) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) all have stakes in South Sudanese fields. “We promise that this is going to be on stream and we can expect the production to increase,” Sudan’s oil minister, Azhari Abdel Qader, said. Cargoes have been booked until the end of March, Gatkuoth said, but now there would be additional oil for sale. South Sudan’s Dar blend is currently being sold for $61 per barrel. Sudan receives between about $9-11 per barrel of oil that landlocked South Sudan pumps through its pipeline to the port, the minister said.

2019-01-21,"* Two sides negotiating new gas transit deal * Ukraine earns transit fees from Russian gas * Ukraine no longer buys Russian gas * Ukraine still important gas import route for EU BRUSSELS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian state energy company Naftogaz does not expect progress in gas transit talks on Monday with Russia which it says is delaying negotiations in order to get its Nord Stream 2 pipeline built first. Russia’s planned doubling of capacity on the Nord Stream pipeline across the Baltic Sea to Germany could help Moscow bypass exports via Ukraine. That would deny Kiev of transit fees that account or up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP). “Gazprom is delaying real talks in terms of transit in order to build Nord Stream 2 and then to have a different negotiating position,” Naftogaz Deputy Chief Executive Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters. “Then they will say, ‘We are okay without any Ukrainian transits at all’.” To ease market concerns, Vitrenko said the two sides should aim to reach an agreement by the beginning of the summer. The European Union is chairing Monday’s three-way meeting in Brussels with Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin and Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak. The Ukraine has stopped buying gas from Russia in the wake of Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in March 2014 and the EU has called on member states to lessen their reliance on Russian energy imports. “We need a strong commitment by the two sides to advance in the talks, given that the existing transit contract expires at the end of this year,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said ahead of the meeting, which executives from Naftogaz and Russian gas producer Gazprom will also attend. Moscow and Kiev have clashed frequently over energy. A lengthy legal dispute between Gazprom and Naftogaz led to court rulings in February 2018 which instructed each company to compensate the other. Naftogaz emerged the net winner, gaining $2.56 billion from Gazprom. Gazprom is challenging the ruling. Gazprom’s partners in the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project include Germany’s Uniper and Wintershall and France’s Engie.

2019-01-21,"* Southern exports so far in 2019 close to 3.6 mbpd - tracker * Northern exports hold steady * OPEC-led oil supply cut deal started in January * Iraq says it will stick to OPEC deal By Alex Lawler LONDON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Oil exports from southern Iraq are holding close to a record high so far in 2019, according to shipping data and an industry source, which could raise questions over whether OPEC’s second-largest producer is following through on a deal to cut output. Southern Iraqi exports in the first 21 days of January averaged close to 3.6 million barrels per day, according to tanker data on Refinitiv Eikon and separate tracking by an industry source. That’s close to December’s 3.63 million bpd - a monthly record. The figures suggest there is little sign yet of lower supplies from Iraq, despite a deal by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to reduce output by 1.2 million bpd as of Jan. 1 to support the market. “So far, no cuts,” the industry source said on Monday of Iraq’s export rate. The south is the main outlet for Iraq’s crude. An Iraqi official, the director of Iraq’s Basra Oil Company, on Jan. 11 gave similar figures for January exports to those suggested by the tanker data and source. Iraq, which has been expanding its oil export capacity, was reluctant to join a previous OPEC-led supply cut effort which began in 2017 and was at times OPEC’s least compliant member with the initiative. To be sure, the OPEC-led deal applies to production, not exports. It is possible that Iraq could have cut production and maintained exports from crude held in storage, or reduced supply to domestic refineries. Nonetheless, oil traders and analysts will be looking at exports to gauge whether the deal is lowering supply to the global market. So far, Iraq’s shipments abroad from the north haven’t declined significantly either. Iraq’s northern exports appear to have held steady in January at about 400,000 bpd, according to tanker data compiled by Reuters and the industry source. That is still far below levels of more than 500,000 bpd in some months of 2017. Baghdad says it will stick to the accord. Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Jan. 4 Iraq would keep production at the level of its OPEC target in the first half of 2019. Under the deal, Iraq agreed to cut production by 141,000 bpd to 4.512 million bpd as of Jan. 1.
