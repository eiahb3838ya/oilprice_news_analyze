2018-09-21,"(Adds background, quote) WASHINGTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Friday it had extended until Nov. 12 a deadline for investors to divest holdings of debt, equity and other assets in sanctioned Russian companies EN+ and Rusal. A deadline of Oct. 23 remained in force for divesting holdings of Gaz Group , the Treasury said. The U.S. Treasury in April imposed sanctions against billionaire Oleg Deripaska and eight companies in which he is a large shareholder, including aluminum exporter Rusal, in response to what it termed “malign activities” by Russia. Deripaska has held a controlling interest in EN+, which in turn controls Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer outside of China. Automaker GAZ is also part of his business empire. Deadlines for investors to divest their holdings in the companies was extended to Oct. 23 in late July. The current order moves the deadline for divesting holdings in Rusal and EN+ to Nov. 12. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the United States was in talks with Rusal to remove it from the sanctions list. “EN+ and Rusal have approached the U.S. government about substantial corporate governance changes that could potentially result in significant changes in control,” the Treasury said in a statement announcing the new deadline. “To allow sufficient time for review, we are extending these licenses until Nov. 12.” (Reporting by David Alexander; Editing by Mohammad Zargham and James Dalgleish)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-sanctions/update-1-u-s-sets-nov-12-deadline-for-investors-to-divest-holdings-of-rusal-en-idUKL2N1W71Q9,21 Sep 2018,"The U.S. Treasury said on

2018-09-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday issued an environmental assessment of a revised route for the Keystone XL crude pipeline that concluded it would not harm water or wildlife, clearing a hurdle for the project that has been pending for a decade.    Even if the pipeline spilled crude oil along its revised route through Nebraska, a top concern of environmentalists, there would likely be no impact to groundwater, the nearly 340-page draft review said.    “Prompt cleanup response would likely be capable of remediating the contaminated soils before the hazardous release reaches groundwater depth,” the review said. Last month a federal judge in Montana had ordered the State Department to conduct the review of a revised route of the project to take into account new information relevant to a permit it issued for the pipeline last year. The review also said implementing the revised route would have “no significant direct, indirect or cumulative effects on the quality of the natural or human environments.” U.S. President Donald Trump is eager to see the building of the pipeline, which was axed by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on environmental concerns relating to emissions that cause climate change. The project has galvanized environmentalists, tribal groups and ranchers in opposition to the $8 billion 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline that would carry heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. From there the crude would be sent to refineries and potentially for export.  Canadian oil producers, who face discounts for their crude due to transport bottlenecks, U.S. refineries and pipeline builders, support the project. TransCanada Corp plans to start construction in 2019, spokesman Matthew John said.  The company’s Chief Executive Russ Girling said last month that it could make a final investment decision on the project late this year or in early 2019, pending some regulatory approvals and court challenges. Robert Kwan, an RBC analyst, said the draft review was a “positive step” for Keystone XL. Environmentalists said the review was an example of the Trump administration trying to push through a project that would risk harming water resources and increase dependence on crude.  “We’ve held off construction of this pipeline for 10 years, and regardless of this administration’s attempts to force this dirty tar sands pipeline on the American people, that fight will continue until Keystone XL is stopped once and for all,” said Kelly Martin, the Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign director for Sierra Club.

2018-09-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rebounded and world shares hit a six-month high on Friday after China’s moves to boost domestic consumption bolstered a rally driven by investor bets that the latest U.S.-China trade dispute was unlikely to dent global growth. The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index and the Dow industrials climbed to record peaks for a second session, although the S&P 500 closed lower, as did the Nasdaq. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.30 percent to hit the highest level since March 13. Sterling tumbled and pushed the dollar up after British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had hit an impasse and that the European Union must offer an alternative plan after the bloc’s leaders rejected her plans. The pound fell 1.42 percent, marking its biggest daily loss since June 2017.  “Sterling bears are out in full force. They’ve pushed the pound quite aggressively down this morning,” said Dean Popplewell, a chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. The dollar rebounded from early lows but was still set for its biggest weekly drop since February, as the equity market rally and rising bond yields fuelled a rush to buy riskier assets. The dollar index rose 0.32 percent to 94.216 against a basket of major currencies.     A rally in Chinese markets helped lift MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan 1.24 percent, partly on expectations that Beijing will pump more money into its economy to weather a trade war with the United States. Miners and banks drove Britain’s top share index up 1.67 percent, while Germany’s DAX, home to some of Europe’s biggest exporters, rose 0.85 percent. The week’s euphoria underscored how over-valued U.S. stocks are, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group in New York.  U.S. capital markets are exuberant, with stock valuations high at 21 times trailing earnings and struggling economies around the world a risk for U.S. stocks, he said.  “There’s really been no bad news to cause this market to take a breather for weeks,” Geraghty said. “The risk for U.S. equity markets is what’s going on overseas.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 86.52 points, or 0.32 percent, to 26,743.5. The S&P 500 lost 1.08 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 2,929.67, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 41.28 points, or 0.51 percent, to 7,986.96. For the week, the Dow added 2.18 percent, the S&P rose 0.83 percent and the Nasdaq shed 0.29 percent. Shares of Boeing and 3M, among U.S. companies most exposed to a trade war, closed higher. However, semiconductor makers declined after top chipmaker Micron said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would weigh on its results for as much as a year.         U.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped, in tandem with those in Europe, as Brexit talks stalled between Britain and the European Union. U.S. 2-year yields, however, remained unaffected, hitting a fresh 10-year high in the run-up to an expected rate increase at next week’s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. Benchmark 10-year notes rose 4/32 in price to push yield down to 3.0628 percent. Oil prices rose ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other large crude exporters on Sunday that is expected to focus on production increases as U.S. sanctions restrict exports from Iran. Brent crude oil settled up 10 cents at $78.80 a barrel. U.S. light crude gained 46 cents to settle at $70.78. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled down $10 at $1,201.30 per ounce.

2018-09-21,"SAO PAULO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Biosev, the Brazilian sugar firm controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, sold a mill to pay down debt and is taking measures to boost ethanol stocks, the company’s chief financial officer said on Friday. Biosev sold the Estivas sugar mill located in the Rio Grande do Norte state, in Brazil’s northeast region, for 203.6 million reais ($50.38 million) to an investment fund whose name was not revealed. CFO Gustavo Lopes Theodozio told Reuters the company plans to use proceeds from the sale to pay down a debt that was not included in a recent debt restructuring that included a capital injection of $1 billion by Louis Dreyfus, who sharply increased its stake in the company to above 90 percent of shares. Theodozio said the company continues to focus on reinforcing its capital structure to reach a “more stable” operational level. But said there are not other deals expected for now. “We sold it because it was a market opportunity,” he said. The value of the deal could raise eyebrows. The mill has a capacity to crush 1.8 million tonnes of cane per year, which represents a value per tonne of processing capacity, a common metrics in the sector, of only $27. According to bank BTG Pactual, deals made during 2010 and 2012, a period of effervescence in M&A’s in the sugar sector, reached more than $100 per tonne of cane processing capacity. That amount has been falling as the financial situation of mills deteriorate. Recent deals reached slightly above $50 per tonne. “You can’t compare a mill in the center-south with a mill in the northeast, different metrics,” the CFO said. Biosev remains with nine plants in Brazil. It posted a loss of 506 million reais in the quarter ended in June versus 577 million reais a year earlier. The company’s debt increased to 6.28 billion reais at the end of June. The CFO said that as part of the strategy to increase profitability, the company has increased the volume of ethanol stocks, looking to sell the product in the between-harvests period in Brazil’s center-south from December to March. With global sugar prices near a 10-year low, mills in Brazil have allocated more cane to ethanol production than to sugar. Biosev reactivated the two ethanol tanks from its Maracaju mill in Mato Grosso do Sul, a plant that was idled late in 2017 as the company sought to optimize cane crushing operations. Each tank has capacity to store 20 million liters of ethanol. “They are already full,” Theodozio said. $1 = 4.0415 reais

2018-09-21,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Friday that turbine blade oxidation which forced Exelon Corp (EXC.N) to idle four electric power units in Texas also affects another model, widening the impact of the latest problem to hit GE’s ailing power unit. GE said the oxidation, which weakens metal turbines blades, also could affect no more than 75 of its 9FB turbines, in addition to some 51 HA-Class turbines that it warned earlier may have the problem. GE said that the 9FB “comprises less than 1 percent of the company’s global gas turbine fleet” of 7,500 turbines installed worldwide.  GE has said it sold its first 9FB in 2003.  GE shares were down 1.5 percent at $12.28.  The 9FB is part of a prior generation of turbines, known as the F-Class, in which GE holds a market share lead over rivals Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (7011.T).   For a graph showing GE's gas turbine market share and other details, click: tmsnrt.rs/2Fge6ra The 126-year-old, Boston-based company declined to say whether any 9FB turbines have been shut down due to blade oxidation. Industry experts and investors on Friday were trying to gauge the risk to GE power business, which has suffered steep declines in sales and profits.  News of the oxidation problem trickled out Wednesday when GE Power Chief Executive Russell Stokes mentioned it in a post on the LinkedIn website. GE said on Thursday that while four HA-Class units in Texas had been shut down, 10 other HA units in the U.S. were operating. GE’s website shows five HA units operating in U.S. GE said the other five have not yet started commercial operation.

2018-09-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were up slightly in heavy, seesaw trading on Friday, giving back most earlier gains after news that major producers would consider additional supply a day after U.S. President Donald Trump again blasted the cartel. Investors grappled with whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers will offset a shortfall from Iran once U.S. sanctions go into full force Nov. 4. Major producers are scheduled to gather in Algeria on Sunday. “The question is just how much oil is going to be taken off the market with U.S. sanctions on Iran,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. Compounding declining production in Venezuela, Iran’s production cuts could lead to a much tighter supply picture, he said. “I think that the market is building up energy for another try at multiyear highs.”      Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 settled 10 cents higher at $78.80 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 rose 46 cents to $70.78 a barrel, more than $1 below the session high of $71.80.  U.S. crude rose 2.5 percent in the week and Brent posted a 0.7 percent weekly gain.  In early trade, supply worries sent Brent $1.00 higher to $80.12 per barrel. Prices retreated after a source told Reuters that OPEC and its allies were discussing the possibility of raising output by 500,000 barrels per day. Then prices rebounded as investors bet Iran’s production cuts would be too great to be fully offset.  The market again reversed course, with traders citing worries U.S. crude would come under pressure in the fourth quarter as inventories build after driving season ends.  On Thursday, Trump linked American support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices and again urged OPEC to lower prices. His tweet, the coming OPEC meeting and concerns over looming sanctions on Iran made for jittery trading on Friday.  Prices jumped early after a report said OPEC and non-OPEC producers pumped less oil in August than July due to a drop in Iranian supply. “Iranian crude exports are coming (down) earlier and bigger than expected, at a time seasonal demand is strong. With spare capacity also falling sharply, the market remains exposed to supply-induced price shocks,” ANZ Bank analysts said in a note to clients. Investors piled into the trade, betting OPEC cannot compensate fully for the loss of oil from its No. 3 producer Iran. Traders also fretted that sanctions could prompt Iran to try to curtail crude transport on the strait of Hormuz. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards and army carried out a joint aerial military drill in the Gulf on Friday. The news that OPEC may increase production by a half-million barrels quickly quelled those concerns.  Jason Gammel, analyst at U.S. bank Jefferies, said he expects Saudi Arabia to try to keep the market well supplied into 2019, “but at the cost of spare capacity,” which he said “could fall below 1 percent of demand by year-end if Iranian exports fall below 1 million barrels per day, as now seems likely.”  Global supply worries minimized the market impact of weekly data showing energy companies cut U.S. oil rigs for a second week in three. The count dropped by one rig to 866, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. Hedge funds and other speculators cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options to the lowest level in about one month in the week to September 18, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.  The speculator group cut its combined futures and options position in New York and London by 15,972 contracts to 342,839 during the period.

2018-09-21,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - OPEC and other oil producers are discussing the possibility of raising output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) to counter falling supply from Iran because of U.S. sanctions, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. The development comes as oil reached $80 a barrel this month, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to call again on the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to help to bring down prices. OPEC, Russia and other allies agreed a deal in late 2016 to cut supply, but after months of cutting by more than the pact had called for, they agreed in June to boost output by returning to 100 percent compliance. That equates to an increase of about 1 million bpd. The current discussions are not finalised, but it would mean that oil producers would need to lower compliance to less than 100 percent, the source said on Friday.  Benchmark Brent oil prices fell by more than $1 on the news of a potential output boost, slipping to below $79 a barrel. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies will gather in Algeria over the weekend to review compliance with existing cuts.  Three OPEC and non-OPEC sources told Reuters on Friday that latest data has shown that OPEC and its allies supplied less oil in August to world markets than they did in July, mainly because of a drop in Iranian production. In July OPEC and non-OPEC producers reduced output by 9 percent more than called for in their pact. The cut in August was even higher, the three sources said without providing exact figures, which will be discussed in Algiers this weekend. OPEC sources said that any official action to raise output would require OPEC to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting - a proposal that is not on the table yet. But the joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial committee known as the JMMC, which meets on Sunday, can still recommend a further increase in output if needed, the sources said. “There are discussions to increase production by another 500,000 bpd. They (OPEC and non-OPEC) can increase output when they meet in December,” the source said, referring to the next formal OPEC meeting, scheduled for Dec. 3. On Thursday President Trump linked American support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices as he again urged OPEC to lower prices. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” Trump wrote on Twitter. OPEC’s July decision to raise oil production also followed a series of Trump tweets.  Rising U.S. gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped to boost the U.S. economy. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq, has pledged to block any supply increases. Tehran says the price rally was instigated by Trump himself when he decided to put additional sanctions on Iranian oil sales. It has also accused arch-rival Saudi Arabia of discrediting OPEC by following instructions from the United States, which is not part of the group. Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, does not plan to attend the meeting in Algiers. All OPEC production policy decisions must, in theory, gain 100 percent approval from its members.

National Guard soldiers later made protesters remove their vehicles from the middle of the street, but angry Venezuelans instead used branches, bottles, tires and garbage bags to snarl traffic. “We have had to take our pillows to the car to be able to sleep during a three-day wait for 40 litres (10.6 gallons) of gas,” said protester Cesar Mendez, 41, speaking next to a queue of hundreds of cars waiting for gas.  “We do not have money to eat the meat that the president eats,” added a tired-looking Mendez in reference to President Nicolas Maduro’s expensive steak dinner at a “Salt Bae” restaurant in Istanbul this month.  Venezuela, which has the world’s cheapest gasoline, has been plagued by intermittent fuel shortages in recent months as its oil industry struggles with lower production and problematic refineries.  Maduro’s leftist government blamed the shortages on power cuts in nearby Zulia, an oil-producing state that is suffering near-daily blackouts because government-owned power stations lack maintenance and spare parts.  Government critics say inept management of Venezuela’s oil industry, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves, is to blame for the shortages.  “Tachira without gas, thanks to failed communism,” tweeted Tachira opposition legislator Franklyn Duarte.  The government this month also rolled out a new payment system in eight states near the Colombian border, including Tachira where San Cristobal is located, in an attempt to halt widespread smuggling of Venezuela’s gas to Colombia.  Maduro says the payment system will pave the way for charging international prices for fuel - a massive increase given that gas is now almost free - as his government seeks to shore up state coffers amid a hyperinflationary economic meltdown. The pilot programme was designed to provide service stations with wireless devices that use a controversial state-backed identification document to carry out transactions. The document, called the Fatherland Card, is meant to provide subsidies to motorists to help soften the impact of the steep price increases. Maduro announced on Thursday night that the programme would be rolled out in the rest of Venezuela on Monday.

2018-09-21,"(Adds rig count in Permian basin in paragraphs 6, 7) By Scott DiSavino Sept 21 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies cut oil rigs for a second week in three as new drilling has stalled in the nation’s largest oil field, where production was forecast to grow at the slowest pace in nearly two years due to pipeline constraints. Drillers cut one oil rig in the week to Sept. 21, bringing the total count down to 866, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 744 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. But since June, the rig count has held mostly steady at above 860 rigs as crude prices in the Permian region in western Texas and eastern New Mexico have collapsed due to a lack of pipeline infrastructure needed to transport more fuel out of the region. The Permian is the biggest shale oil formation in the United States. Oil production in the Permian will rise 31,000 barrels per day, its slowest growth since late 2016, the Energy Information Administration said this week. More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian. Active units there increased by five this week to 488, the most since January 2015. With so many rigs operating in the basin, operators are drilling wells but are not completing them due in part to the transport constraints. Drilled-but-uncompleted wells (DUCs) - wells not connected to a pipeline - in the Permian will rise by 211 to 3,630, the largest monthly increase since the EIA began tracking the data in September 2016. This week, U.S. crude futures were up 1 percent to about $71 per barrel, putting the contract on track to rise for a second week in a row in volatile trade ahead of an OPEC meeting on Sunday. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.64 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading at nearly $71 for the balance of 2018 and above $68 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,053 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,018. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-09-21,"HOUSTON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - The owners of an idled oil refinery in the U.S. Virgin Islands that once ranked among the world’s largest have hired a former Hess Corp executive closely acquainted with the facility to oversee its return to service. Brian Lever, who ran the former Hovensa refinery on St. Croix for Hess and partner Petroleos de Venezuela until it filed for bankruptcy in 2012, joined Limetree Bay Refining this month as president and chief operating officer, according to his LinkedIn profile and a person familiar with the matter. Private-equity firm Arclight Capital Partners and Freepoint Commodities have pledged to invest $1.4 billion and overhaul the renamed Limetree Bay refinery to process up to 200,000 barrels of crude per day. The companies have said their goal is to begin producing low-sulfur fuels by early 2020. Construction activity and the recruiting of experienced refinery executives already signal the restart operation is moving ahead rapidly. In addition to hiring Lever as president, Limetree Bay is looking to fill positions including senior vice president of refining, vice president of refining operations, and heads of coker operations and maintenance, according to its website. “Six months ago it was a ghost town, you didn’t see anything moving inside the refinery. Now, there are a lot of workers there,” said Andrew Simpson, a St. Croix resident and admiralty law attorney familiar with activity at the project. “They’re been going (processing) line by line, getting each ready to go.” Arclight, which owns 80 percent of Limetree Bay Holdings, parent of the refinery and a 32 million barrel marine storage terminal, did not respond to requests for comment. A Freepoint Commodities spokesman declined to comment. Boston-based private-equity firm Arclight wants to produce fuels that meet an International Maritime Organization (IMO) emissions mandate that calls for large ocean-going vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur, down sharply from a current limit of 3.5 percent. Lever, who left Hess in 2016 and has since worked as an industry consultant, could not be reached for comment. The Limetree Bay refinery is the most prominent example of refiners ramping up spending to cash in on expectations of higher demand and better margins for low-sulfur fuels beginning in 2020, said Mark Broadbent, principal research analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie. “The spreads they’re looking to take advantage of will be highest in early 2020 when IMO takes effect,” Broadbent said. But he warned, “Even if they start (construction) today, there’s a good chance they’ll be delayed.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton Writing by Gary McWilliams; Editing by Tom Brown)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/refinery-virginislands/ex-hess-executive-to-lead-restart-of-idled-caribbean-refinery-idUKL2N1W61XF,21 Sep 2018,"The owners of an idled oil

Bulgaria’s Commission for Protection of Competition said in July the deal could help Inercom establish a dominant position in the country, hurting competition, as the company already has several photovoltaic (PV) projects in southern Bulgaria. “A restructuring was carried out within Inercom Group, as a result of which the companies producing electricity from photovoltaic power plants are not part of its portfolio,” Inercom said in a statement on Friday. It added that it expects a quick reaction from the regulator. The Commission for Protection of Competition said it needed time to consider Inercom’s statement. In February CEZ signed a contract to sell a power distributor that provides electricity to more than three million Bulgarians, together with other assets in the Black Sea state, to Inercom for an estimated 320 million euros ($375.49 million). The deal, however, prompted concerns that strategic energy assets in the European Union country were passing into the hands of owners about which little was known, and also raised worries about financing for the deal. With assets worth around 100 million levs ($60.03 million), little-known Inercom would have acquired a business with annual turnover of about levs 1.8 billion levs ($1.08 billion), which operates one third of Bulgaria’s power grid.

2018-09-21,"LONDON - Investors returned to equities in droves this week as they became convinced higher U.S.-China trade tariffs would cause only limited damage to the global economy, while greater risk appetite helped this year’s laggards rebound sharply. A net $13.9 billion flowed into equity funds as investors ploughed money back into risky assets, having pulled $5.6 billion from world equity funds last week, Bank of America Merrill-Lynch strategists said, citing data from EPFR. Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) drew in more than that total, with $18.3 billion inflows while mutual funds suffered $4.5 billion outflows, indicating the resurgence in risk appetite was partly driven by retail investors.  U.S. stocks again pulled in the lion’s share of inflows with some $14.5 billion added to the region’s equity funds. This included $7.3 billion into large caps and $3.9 billion into small caps. All the losers of 2018 so far bounced back strongly this week as the U.S. dollar weakened.  Euro zone stocks, emerging markets, banks and industrial metals all had a stellar week after being sold sharply most of the year.  The euro zone's leading stocks index .STOXX50E was on track for its 10th straight day of gains on Friday - its longest winning streak since 1997.  But the turnaround in performance still was not enough to coax investors back into Europe, which suffered further outflows of $1.2 billion - making it 27 of the past 28 weeks the region’s equity funds lost money.  EM equities saw modest outflows of $0.7 billion, while emerging market debt, on the other hand, had its biggest inflows in eight weeks - with $0.5 billion coming into the sector.  Tech was once again the most popular sector, drawing in $1.1 billion, while investors’ growing interest in defensive positioning was clear with $0.5 billion going into healthcare stocks. BAML’s “Bull and Bear” index of investor sentiment held at 3.6 - “still closer to fear than greed”, strategists said. With 40 rate rises this year, global central bank hiking is proceeding at its fastest since 2011, BAML strategists said.  Rising rates will start to turn the screws on markets as higher corporate debt levels increase defaults and credit spreads, they said.  Citing data from the BIS and IIF, they noted corporate debt has risen 62 percent since 2008 and government debt has risen 75 percent. “Corporates, not consumers or banks, will cause next recession,” BAML predicted. Corporates are also the largest buyers of equities, they highlighted, with $4.4 trillion of U.S. stock buybacks easily surpassing the Fed’s asset purchases of $3.6 trillion since Lehman’s collapse.  The strategists also noted that U.S. banks - which typically benefit from higher rates - have recently failed to rise along with U.S. 5-year Treasury yields.  Returns will stay low and volatile, and assets with strong cash flows would outperform those with weak balance sheets, they forecast.  In one more encouraging observation, BAML noted what they called a “watershed data point” in Japanese land prices rising 0.1 percent this year - their first price increase since 1991 - and a positive for Japanese lenders.  Japan’s equity funds drew in small inflows of $0.3 billion.

The U.S. benchmark S&P 500 stock index and the Dow industrials scaled record peaks for a second session, though the Nasdaq turned lower soon after the market opened. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.39 percent to hit six-month highs. Sterling tumbled and pushed the dollar up after British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks had hit an impasse and that the European Union must offer an alternative plan after the bloc’s leaders rejected her plans. The pound fell 1.36 percent, and was on course for its biggest daily loss since June 2017. “Sterling bears are out in full force. They’ve pushed the pound quite aggressively down this morning,” said Dean Popplewell, a chief currency strategist at Oanda in Toronto. The dollar rebounded from early lows but was still set for its biggest weekly drop since February as the equity market rally and rising bond yields fueled a rush to buy riskier assets. The dollar index rose 0.26 percent to 94.159 against a basket of major currencies. A rally in Chinese markets helped lift MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan 1.32 percent, partly on expectations that Beijing will pump more money into its economy to weather the trade war. Miners and banks drove Britain’s top share index up 1.6 percent, while Germany’s DAX, home to some of the continent’s biggest exporters, rose 0.53 percent. U.S. capital markets are exuberant, with stock valuations high at 21 times trailing earnings and struggling economies around the world a risk for U.S. stocks, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group in New York. “There’s really been no bad news to cause this market to take a breather for weeks,” Geraghty said. “The risk for U.S. equity markets is what’s going on overseas.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 48.39 points, or 0.18 percent, to 26,705.37. he S&P 500 gained 2.73 points, or 0.09 percent, to 2,933.48 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.76 points, or 0.27 percent, to 8,006.47. Shares of Boeing and 3M, among U.S. companies most exposed to a trade war, were higher. However, semiconductor makers declined after top chipmaker Micron said U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would weigh on results for as much as a year. U.S. long-dated Treasury yields slipped, in tandem with those in Europe, as Brexit talks stalled between Britain and the European Union. U.S. 2-year yields, however, remained unaffected as they hit a fresh 10-year high in the run-up to an expected rate increase at next week’s Federal Reserve monetary policy meeting. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 3.0683 percent. Oil prices rose ahead of a meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other large crude exporters on Sunday that will focus on production increases as U.S. sanctions restrict exports from Iran. Brent crude oil rose 2 cents at $78.72 a barrel. U.S. light crude gained 21 cents at $70.53.

2018-09-21,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a new finance bill into law on Friday, cutting in half a new fuel tax that had led to public anger and strikes but stopping short of demands to scrap or delay it. The government, under pressure to hit IMF-mandated fiscal deficit targets, had faced a fuel dealers’ strike, anger among commuters and a lawsuit after transport and fuel prices jumped when a 16 percent value-added tax (VAT) on all petroleum products entered into force on Sept. 1. Plans for the tax on fuel had been postponed several times since 2013. Parliament voted last month to delay it for another two years, but President Uhuru Kenyatta returned the bill to lawmakers with the suggestion they cut it to 8 percent instead. Parliament approved the bill with the lower rate on Thursday during an acrimonious session marked by loud protests from lawmakers. The bill also adds other new taxes, and authorises revenue collection and spending through June 2019. Kenyans have been angered by the new taxes, accusing authorities of forcing them to dig deeper into their pockets, while the government presides over wastage of its revenue through theft and corruption. “I will ensure proper utilization of public resources for a better Kenya. I will not relent on the war against corruption,” Kenyatta wrote on his Twitter feed. Courts have charged dozens of senior government officials and business people with crimes related to corruption in a new crackdown this year.  An IMF stand-by credit facility for balance of payments support expired last week, complicating Kenya’s economic outlook at a time when emerging markets have entered into turmoil as contagion from Turkey and Argentina spreads. Kenyan assets have had a mixed reaction to the wider emerging markets turbulence and the government’s fiscal challenges at home.  Investors who use dollars as their base currency would have lost 5.7 percent on Kenyan bonds since the start of the year, currently one of the worst performances across emerging markets this year barring the main trouble spots of Turkey, Argentina and Venezuela. The Kenyan shilling weakened against the dollar after the expiry of the IMF facility last week but it has since recouped its losses. On the stock market, the benchmark NSE-20 share index and the all share index are firmly in bear territory, having lost 20 percent of their value in recent weeks from their peaks this year. Yields on the local government debt market have however held steady mainly due to a cap on commercial lending rates, which market participants said was putting a lid on the yields. Out in the real economy, ordinary people said the new tax on fuel was already biting. “Customers are complaining because they have to spend more,” said John Thuita, a petrol pump attendant in Nairobi. “If a customer used to come after a week, now they are coming back before the week is over.” Additional reporting by John Ndiso in Nairobi and Marc Jones in London; Editing by Maggie Fick and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kenya-economy-taxes/update-2-kenyas-president-signs-finance-bill-with-contested-new-taxes-into-law-idUKL8N1W713V,21 Sep 2018,"* GRAPHIC-Frontier market dollar market performance https://tmsnrt.rs/2lKanJE

2018-09-21,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Friday placed one of the country’s most senior ethnic Uighur officials, head of the energy administration and a former governor of the restive region of Xinjiang, under investigation for suspected graft. The ruling Communist Party’s anti-graft watchdog said in a brief statement National Energy Administration Director Nur Bekri was being probed on suspicion of breaking the law and violating party discipline, the usual euphemism for graft but which could also refer to other legal problems. It gave no other details and it was not possible to reach Nur Bekri for comment. President Xi Jinping has targeted the energy sector as part of a wider war against pervasive graft that began when he came into office six years ago. Nur Bekri, 57, worked in Xinjiang until moving to Beijing in late 2014 to head the energy administration. He is also a deputy head of China’s powerful state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. Nur Bekri, a tall, jocular figure who speaks almost totally unaccented Mandarin and was known for being more open to foreign media than most Chinese officials, was the 12th senior official from the energy administration to be felled since it was founded in 2008. In Xinjiang, he had been a strong proponent of expanding the resource-rich region’s coal-mining sector, but his advocacy for the polluting industry was tempered in favour of promoting cleaner projects after he came to Beijing. He is one of the few Uighurs - a Muslim people who speak a Turkic language and who call Xinjiang home - ever to have broken through and made it to a top national-level job in Beijing. He had been in Moscow on Tuesday attending an official event on China-Russia investment, according to China’s state planner. Xinjiang has been one of China’s most violent regions, with hundreds killed in unrest between the minority Uighurs and the majority Han Chinese in recent years. Nur Bekri was Xinjiang’s governor from 2008 until 2014, a time that saw bouts of ethnic violence that included deadly rioting in the region’s capital, Urumqi, in 2009. During his time in that position, which ranks below the Communist Party secretary, Nur Bekri was a proponent of restrictions placed on religious practices of the largely Muslim ethnic minorities there, ostensibly to curb what the government said was the spread of extremist ideology. He said in the wake of the 2009 riots the government’s religious policies completely accorded with the interests of the people. Nur Bekri had also touted bilingual education for Uighurs in schools as a route to economic opportunity, although critics said in reality that meant marginalising the Uighurs’ own  language and culture in favour of Mandarin. Ilham Tohti, a Uighur economics professor and outspoken critic of Beijing’s policies towards his people, was jailed for life on separatism charges in 2014, a sentence that caused an outcry from human rights advocates. Nur Bekri called the evidence against him irrefutable before he was jailed. Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, a Munich-based advocacy group, said in an emailed statement that despite actively promoting Beijing’s policies, Nur Bekri had not been trusted by Beijing and was seen as “scum” by Uighurs. “I hope that Nur Bekri’s problems will awaken those Uighurs who are currently assisting Beijing’s repression. They will not be able to gain real political trust from Beijing,” he said. Nur Bekri’s tenure as governor ended under then party secretary Zhang Chunxian, who was replaced as Xinjiang’s chief by Chen Quanguo in 2016. Chen dramatically ramped up police presence and mass surveillance on minorities and ushered in the use of mass detention centres that have sparked a growing international outcry in recent months. China denies the abuses and says the “vocational”-style training centres, thought to hold potentially a million Uighurs and other Muslims, were designed to prevent extremism.  Calls are growing from Western countries for action on the camps and U.S. officials have said they were considering sanctions on Chinese officials and companies linked to the crackdown.

2018-09-21,"BEIJING, Sept 21 (Reuters) - China may issue an additional 3 million to 4 million tonnes of permits for refined fuel exports for 2018 to prevent state-owned refiners from having to slash throughput rates, according to three sources briefed on the matter. The government has been looking to keep fuel export quotas at around 43 million tonnes this year, steady with 2017 levels, to maintain overall trade balances. But the state refiners have been using the quotas already granted for this year faster than expected, rushing to ship more gasoline, diesel and jet kerosene overseas in the first nine months compared to the same period of 2017 because domestic refinery production has expanded faster than demand. While exports may not be as lucrative as sales in the domestic market, where margins are largely guaranteed, the overseas shipments helped bolster margins at home by thinning local fuel supplies. Refiners - including Sinopec Corp, PetroChina , CNOOC and Sinochem - will have already used about 35 million tonnes, or 81 percent of the total grants so far by end-September, according to a state oil executive with direct knowledge of the situation. “The big oil firms are trying this week to persuade the government to release more quotas, or they may be forced to cut runs in the fourth quarter as the remainder is far from enough,” said the executive. Most refiners would try to avoid reducing runs in the fourth quarter, when diesel fuel demand typically picks up with an increase in construction activities and the lifting of a summer fishing ban, and the Golden Week holiday of early October, which lifts gasoline and jet fuel consumption. The three sources at state oil firms estimated the government could issue an additional 3 million to 4 million tonnes of fuel export quotas as early as next week. The sources declined to be named as the discussions are not public. Representatives of CNPC, Sinopec, CNOOC and Sinochem did not respond to requests for comment. The National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) and Ministry of Commerce also did not respond to queries. Chinese customs data showed huge gains in transportation fuel exports this year. Gasoline exports in the first seven months grew 44 percent over the same period last year to 8.33 million tonnes, diesel rose 25 percent to 11.68 million tonnes, and jet kerosene gained 15 percent to 8.08 million tonnes. State-run refiners earned bumper profits this year as diesel demand firmed while many small fuel blenders were forced out of business and some independent oil processors slashed output over the summer months because of stricter government tax scrutiny enacted from March.

2018-09-21,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * MSCI ACWI hits highest since March 13 * Dollar slips as trade worries ebb * Oil prices edge higher By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Sept 21 (Reuters) - World shares hit their highest levels in over six months on Friday, as investors gravitated to the view that the latest exchange of tariffs between the United States and China may be less damaging than initially feared. Shares in Europe rose strongly at the open, extending a relief rally that began on Wall Street overnight and ran through Asian markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 0.6 percent. A rally in Chinese markets helped lift the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan 1.27 percent, buoyed in part by expectations that Beijing will pump more stimulus into its economy to weather the trade war. The index has rebounded 4.6 percent from a 14-month low on Sept. 12. Chinese shares, which had been hit the hardest by the trade war, rallied. The CSI 300 index of Shanghai and Shenzen shares , which slumped to a two-year low last week, rose 3 percent, on course for its largest weekly gain in more than two years. Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.8 percent, hitting an eight-month high. The broad strength across markets helped MSCI’s All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit its highest level since March 13. The index was last up 0.4 percent on the day, and was set to post its best weekly performance since early May. On Wall Street, trade-sensitive industrial stocks led the gains on Thursday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.95 percent while the S&P 500 gained 0.78 percent, both hitting record highs. The latest rally comes after new U.S. and Chinese tariffs on each other’s goods were set at lower rates this week than previously expected, raising hopes that hostilities between the world’s two largest economies may be easing. Earlier this week, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged on that Beijing will not engage in competitive currency devaluation, news that also helped calm investors who were worried about a further escalation in trade tensions. “The tariffs that were announced by both sides during the week were deemed to be not as harsh as originally suspected,” said David Madden, markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “The U.S. in particular showed restraint, but that was partially so the Trump administration would have more ammunition should they feel it is required down the line. Now that the latest series of tariffs are out of the way, investors fell back into their bullish routine.” Despite growing anecdotal reports from companies on both sides of the Pacific that the trade war is starting to impact their operations, the outlook for corporate profits remained solid in many markets on the back of strong global growth, keeping equity valuations relatively attractive. Still, some analysts cautioned that the reversals in various assets including U.S. industrial shares and non-U.S. developed markets could be driven primarily by position squaring ahead of the end of quarter, and not reflect a decisive shift in investor sentiment. In the currency market, the dollar slipped to a two-month low against a basket of major trading partners as easing worries on trade wars quelled bids for the U.S. currency. The euro last traded at $1.1785, after touching a 3-month high of $1.18030. It lost some steam after a euro zone manufacturing survey came in below forecasts. “The weakness in the dollar is prompting investors to unwind their short bets against other currencies such as the euro and this move may have further room to run,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole in London. The closely-watched summit of the European Union and the United Kingdom produced little progress on the thorny issues of trade and the Irish border. EU leaders have warned British Prime Minister Theresa May that they are ready to cope with Britain crashing out of the bloc if she does not compromise. At home, Britain’s former Brexit minister David Davis has said up to 40 lawmakers from the ruling party will vote against May’s plans to leave the European Union, meaning she may struggle to get her deal through parliament. The pound last stood at $1.3228, down 0.3 percent on the day . Amid positive risk sentiment, the yen slid to a two-month low of 112.88 to the dollar. Oil futures inched up on Friday amid concerns over supply as U.S. sanctions on Iran’s crude exports loom, although calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for lower oil prices dragged. In Europe on Friday U.S. light crude was up 0.1 percent at $70.36 a barrel. Brent crude oil ticked up 0.2 percent to $78.84 a barrel. Spot gold rose 0.1 percent to $1,208.93 an ounce.

2018-09-21,"* Flooding expected to worsen over coming days * At least 40 people killed, mostly in North Carolina * More than 60,000 customers still without power By Anna Mehler Paperny KINSTON, N.C., Sept 21 (Reuters) - Residents in Georgetown County, South Carolina, where five rivers flow into the ocean, will prepare on Friday for a deluge of water in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people. Lying on Atlantic Ocean between Myrtle Beach and Charleston, the county of about 60,000 people is one of several areas across the Carolinas waiting anxiously for rivers to crest, a week after Florence dumped some three feet of rain in the region. Flooding could begin early next week, officials said during a community meeting on Thursday. The city of Georgetown on Friday will hand out 15,000 sandbags as the county develops plans to evacuate residents. “Please heed the warnings,” Sheriff Lane Cribb said. “Protecting lives and property will be our goal ... You better pray. I think we all need to pray that it don’t happen.” More than three dozen flood gauges in North and South Carolina showed flooding. Some rivers had still not crested by Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. Thirty-one deaths have been attributed to the storm in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia. Some 4,700 people across North Carolina have been rescued by boat or helicopter since the storm made landfall, twice as many as in Hurricane Matthew two years ago, according to state officials. About 10,000 remain in shelters. The coastal city of Wilmington, North Carolina, remained cut off by floodwaters on Thursday. More than 200 roads across the state were closed or blocked as residents. Over 60,000 customers were without power in North Carolina early on Friday, according to Poweroutage.us. As floodwaters continue to rise, concerns are growing about the environmental and health dangers lurking in the water. The flooding has caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow in North Carolina, creating a risk that standing water will be contaminated, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country. Several sewer systems in the region also have released untreated or partly treated sewage and storm water into waterways over the last week, local media reported.

2018-09-21,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility RWE would lose as much as 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) if it cannot continue mining lignite by removing the last bit of an ancient forest in Germany, its chief executive told public broadcaster ZDF. The company has drawn heavy criticism from environmentalists over the planned clearing of Hambach forest, located in North Rhine-Westphalia, as Europe’s largest economy works on ways to phase out its coal-fired power plants. German riot police started to clear activists this month from treehouses at the site, which was bought by RWE decades ago to expand lignite mining. RWE has faced calls to delay or cease its activities. “Abandoning Hambach forest right away would mean about 4 billion to 5 billion euros,” RWE CEO Rolf Martin Schmitz said during a talk show late on Thursday, responding to how much revenues it would lose in such a case. Schmitz said that if Hambach forest were not cleared, the group would have to obtain enormous volumes of rubble to stabilize existing mining edges, something Schmitz said he believed was not technically possible at the moment. A man died this week after he fell from a bridge connecting some of the treehouses that are still standing at the site, police said.

2018-09-21,"* November price falls 50 cents/mmBtu * Rising crude prices and peak winter demand could lift prices * Quiet trading week amid trade show in Barcelona By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices weakened this week as demand slowed after a flurry of purchases in September and with many players attending a major trade conference in Barcelona. Spot prices for November LNG-AS delivery LNG-AS fell to $11.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 50 cents from the week before, industry sources said. October cargoes are likely valued at $11 to $11.30 per mmBtu, one source said. Rising crude prices and spot demand from Japan, South Korea and China ahead of peak winter demand for heating had pushed LNG prices up to multi-year seasonal highs. However, buying activity slowed this week as many LNG traders are in Barcelona for the Gastech trade show, where delegates said the outlook for the natural gas business was better than at any point since 2014. In the spot market, Malaysia’s Petronas may have offered an LNG cargo for late-October delivery from Bintulu, a second industry source said, though this could not immediately be confirmed. Malaysia’s LNG exports fell this year as domestic gas pipeline issues have plagued the country since January. Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company, a unit of Kuwait’s state-run oil group, may have offered an October-loading Wheatstone LNG cargo, though details about the price and buyer could not immediately be confirmed. Wheatstone is KUFPEC’s first investment in international LNG production. Commodities trader Vitol offered an LNG cargo to be delivered into Bilbao in Spain during price agency S&P Global Platts’ assessment process on Thursday, a trade source said. Vitol offered the cargo at $10 per mmBtu, but it did not attract buyers, the source said. The fall in spot prices could be temporary as buyers from North Asia are expected to enter the market to procure more cargoes for winter, traders said.

2018-09-21,"* Importers refilled in May, August after cold winter * Gassco transported 117.4 bcm to Europe in 2017 * Germany’s Emden terminal helped summer deliveries By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Norway’s gas exports hit a new high of 36.8 billion cubic metres (bcm) this summer and the annual deliveries will be on a par with the record annual figure achieved in 2017, gas system operator Gassco said on Friday. Between May and August, which is normally a season with fewer gas exports, Norway’s deliveries almost matched a normal winter level as European importers needed to refill depleted gas storages which drained during last year’s cold winter. “It’s too early to say exactly where we’ll end up this year, but we expect another good performance which will be roughly on a par with the 2017 record,” Gassco Chief Executive Frode Leversund said in a statement. Gassco transported 117.4 bcm through pipeline systems from Norway to continental Europe and Britain during 2017. This was the highest volume sold in 40 years of Norwegian gas exports. Exports to Germany via the Emden terminal, which became operational in 2016, made a strong contribution to this summer’s record deliveries, Gassco added. “Not only has Norway’s continental shelf delivered larger volumes than before, but the transport system has also handled these increased quantities well,” said Leversund. Later this year, Norway will open its new Polarled pipeline to carry more gas from its Aasta Hansteen field in the Norwegian Sea, said Gassco. “As operator of both Polarled and Nyhamna, we expect great interest in this region from a number of players. Our strong summer deliveries strengthen that belief,” it said. Aasta Hansteen is expected to start sending gas to Gassco’s Nyhamna processing plant from October, Equinor said earlier this year.
