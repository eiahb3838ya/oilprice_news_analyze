2018-09-03,"(Corrects headline to make clear Zimbabwe donating to Congo) HARARE, Democratic Republic of Congo, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Z imbabwe is donating 10 white rhinos to Democratic Republic of Congo to re-establish a population driven to extinction by poachers a decade ago, Zimbabwe’s wildlife authority said. The rhinos were being captured and would be moved from Victoria Falls later this week or early next, Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) spokesman Tinashe Farawo said on Monday. Congo’s white rhinos lived in Garamba National Park near the border with South Sudan but it was not clear where the animals would be located. Wildlife protection is complicated in Congo by lawlessness and militia violence that endures 15 years after the end of a war that killed millions, mainly from hunger and disease. “The Zimbabwean Government was satisfied that the pre and post-translocation conditions in ... (Congo) met the requisite standards for a successful re-establishment of rhinos,” a ZimParks statement said. ZimParks and conservationists said moving the rhinos from Zimbabwe would strengthen the gene pool. Zimbabwe had about 800 black and white rhinos in 2016 and is one of just four countries with nearly all the world’s white rhinos. Their horns are prized in China and southeast Asia. “Moving rhinos from one place to another is essential to ensure good genetic diversity across the population,” said Emma Pereira, a spokeswoman for Save the Rhino, a London-based group. “We hope any move between countries is done with the correct expertise and thoughtful planning.” Poachers also target mountain gorillas, one of the world’s most endangered species which is found only on a spine of volcanic mountains straddling Congo, Uganda and Rwanda. Their numbers have recovered in recent years thanks to intensive conservation efforts. The head of Congo’s wildlife authority could not be immediately reached for comment.

2018-09-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is allowing state refiners to import Iranian oil with Tehran arranging tankers and insurance after firms including the country’s top shipper Shipping Corp of India (SCI) (SCI.NS) halted voyages to Iran due to U.S. sanctions, sources said. New Delhi’s attempt to keep Iranian oil flowing mirrors a step by China, where buyers are shifting nearly all their Iranian oil imports to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC). The moves by the two top buyers of Iranian crude indicate that the Islamic Republic may not be fully cut off from global oil markets from November, when U.S. sanctions against Tehran’s petroleum sector are due to start. President Donald Trump ordered the reimposition of economic curbs after withdrawing the United States from a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers. No one trading with Iran will do business with America, he said. “We have the same situation (as most Western shippers) because there is no cover, so we cannot go (to Iran),” an SCI official told Reuters. New Delhi turned to the NITC fleet after most insurers and reinsurers had begun winding down services for Iran, wanting to avoid falling foul of the sanctions given their large exposure to the United States. SCI had a contract until August to import Iranian oil for Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) (MRPL.NS), two sources familiar with the matter said. Eurotankers, which had a deal with MRPL to import two Iranian oil cargoes every month, has also said it cannot undertake Iranian voyages from September, the sources said. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to talk to the media about commercial deals. “The shipping ministry has given refiners permission to buy Iranian oil on a CIF (cost, insurance and freight) basis,” a government source said.  Under a CIF arrangement, Iran would provide shipping and insurance, enabling Indian refiners to continue purchases of the country’s oil despite the non-availability of cover from Western insurers due to the restrictions imposed by Washington. The move would benefit Indian Oil Corp (IOC) (IOC.NS), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) (BPCL.NS) and MRPL, which plan to lift Iranian cargoes during the rest of the fiscal year ending on March 31. India wants to continue buying oil from OPEC member Iran as Tehran is offering almost free shipping and an extended credit period. State refiners, which drove India’s July imports of Iranian oil to a record 768,000 barrels per day, had planned to nearly double oil imports from Iran in 2018/19. India's oil imports from Iran - reut.rs/2KRHIwn Unlike their private peers, India’s state-run refiners need government permission to import oil on a delivered, or CIF, basis. Federal policy requires them to favor Indian insurers and shippers by buying only on a free on board (FOB) basis. The permission for CIF purchases applies only to existing annual contracts with Iran, the government source said.  India, Iran’s top oil client after China, will finalize its strategy on crude purchases from Tehran after a meeting with top U.S. officials this week, a senior government official told Reuters last week. SCI, Eurotankers, the shipping ministry, MRPL, IOC and BPCL did not respond to Reuters emails seeking comment.

2018-09-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global stock markets fell for a third straight day on Monday, hurt by worries over the escalation of trade disputes between world powers and a deepening sell-off across emerging market currencies. With U.S. markets closed for Labor Day, trading activity was generally subdued. European shares were largely flat  .GDAXI .FCHI, although London's blue-chip FTSE rallied almost 1 percent .FTSE thanks to a weak British pound. In Asia, MSCI's broadest index of shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS and Tokyo's blue-chip Nikkei .N225 shed about 0.7 percent each.  MSCI’s All-Country World Index, .MIWD00000PUS, a gauge of 47 markets, dipped 0.2 percent and the main emerging equity index fell 0.7 percent .MSCIEF, bearing the brunt of global trade fears. U.S. President Donald Trump said at the weekend there was no need to keep Canada in the North American Free Trade Agreement and warned Congress not to meddle with the trade talks. Worries about U.S. tensions with China were also kept alive by a report last week that Trump had told aides he was ready to impose tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of imports from China as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday. That would be a major escalation given the United States has already applied tariffs on $50 billion of exports from China. “As we head into a new week and month, trade concerns will remain front and centre of investors’ minds, along with increasing concerns about stability in emerging markets, after the sharp declines seen in Argentina and Turkey’s currency last week,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. There was also bad news on the economic outlook with surveys showing manufacturing activity took a hit from weak orders in August, a sign firms are feeling the pinch from an intensifying global trade war that could derail global growth. The surveys of purchasing managers showed mounting pressure on factories across Europe and Asia, with data later expected to show the United States is in the same grip. GRAPHIC - Share market divergence in August: reut.rs/2Nc9HvN “There are a few existential threats to the world and a broad based trade war is one,” said Marie Owens Thomsen, global head of economic research at Indosuez Wealth Management in Geneva. “We’re in a scary parallel to the 1920s and 1930s when there was piecemeal protectionism as we are seeing now.”  Across emerging markets, turbulence continued.  Turkey's lira led emerging currency losses after data showed inflation spiked to almost 18 percent in August, while the Indonesian rupiah fell IDR=ID to its lowest levels in 20 years. The Brazilian real weakened more than 1 percent against the U.S. dollar BRL=, while the Iranian rial was reported to have hit a record low against the U.S. currency. The lira, at the centre of emerging market turmoil in recent weeks, fell 1 percent to 6.62 per dollar TRY=D3. Central bank comments that the inflation outlook showed “significant risks” to price stability and that it would adjust its monetary stance at its upcoming meeting on Sept. 13 in line with this view helped contain the losses.  “This morning’s inflation number was very high and the authorities still haven’t got a credible strategy to deal with that,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Turkish Finance Minister Berat Albayrak told Reuters that the central bank was independent of government and it would take all necessary steps to combat inflation. Among major currencies, the British pound stood out as the big underperformer, hurt by comments by the European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, that he was “strongly opposed” to British proposals on future trade ties after it leaves the EU. News that British manufacturers had their weakest month in over two years and export orders suffered a rare fall in August exacerbated sterling’s fall. The currency was last down 0.7 percent at $1.2874 GBP=D3 and weakened 0.8 percent against the euro EURGBP=D3 to 90.24 pence, helping lift London's blue-chip FTSE 0.95 percent. Global trade concerns supported the U.S. dollar. The dollar index .DXY, which measures the greenback’s value against a basket of other major currencies, was flat at 95.13 after nearing its highest level since Aug. 27.  But gains were muted - safe-haven currencies such as the Swiss franc CHF=EBS and the Japanese yen JPY=EBS were supported against higher-yielding rivals. In European bond markets, Italian bond yields edged lower IT10YT=RR after Fitch Ratings left its credit rating unchanged at BBB on Friday, revising only its outlook to negative.  Oil prices meanwhile rose, supported by concerns that falling Iranian output will tighten markets once U.S. sanctions bite from November, but gains were limited by higher supply from OPEC and the United States. Brent crude oil LCOc1 was up 63 cents at $78.27 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 was 26 cents higher at $70.05.

2018-09-03,"(Repeats item published earlier with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 3 (Reuters) - One of the surprise packets in the commodity space this year has been uranium, with the spot price surging 30 percent in the past four months, a stellar performance that may not be justified by current fundamentals. Uranium stood at $26 per pound on Aug. 31, up from the low so far this year of $20, hit in mid-April. The year-to-date gain is 16.6 percent, and the metal used to power nuclear reactors is on track to record a second annual increase. This looks like a strong performance on the surface, but uranium isn’t quite like other commodity markets and it’s worth delving down to try and fathom the underlying dynamics. The most obvious factor driving the spot price has been supply cutbacks by major producers, namely Canada’s Cameco and Kazakhstan’s state-owned producer Kazatomprom . Cameco said in July it would extend indefinitely a shutdown of its McArthur River and Key Lake mines in Saskatchewan province, having initially announced a suspension of operations in November last year. Kazatomprom also said at the end of last year that it would reduce its output by 20 percent for three years starting from the beginning of 2018, as it battled a market that has been oversupplied since the nuclear shutdowns in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The Cameco and Kazatomprom cutbacks took about 16.5 percent of annual uranium ore supply from the market, but the price action in the wake of the cutbacks is instructive. The spot price took off after Cameco’s November announcement, jumping from $20 per pound to a high of $26 by Dec. 4, a date that coincided with the news of the Kazatomprom production curbs. Once the initial surge was over, however, spot uranium drifted back down to the April low of $20 per pound, the same level it was before the output cuts were announced. It did recover somewhat thereafter, and got another shot in the arm with Cameco extending the idling of its major mines indefinitely in July. But it does appear the uranium price has been driven by the news flow, and may struggle to sustain a rally. It’s also the case that rallies built on supply cuts are rarely as enduring as those prompted by increases in demand. If the price of spot uranium does rise to around $70 a pound, as some analysts forecast, it’s likely that Cameco and Kazatomprom will simply increase output from their idled mines. But is there a positive demand case to be made for uranium? The news headlines in recent years have tended to focus on the negatives, such as the closure of Japan’s and Germany’s reactors after Fukushima, and the cost blowouts and delays on several new power plants. Almost quietly, though, substantial nuclear capacity is being added in China and elsewhere in Asia. Data from the World Nuclear Association shows that 55 reactors with a capacity of 55 gigawatts (GW) are now under construction, which compares favourably to 455 operating reactors that produce around 400 GW annually. Of the plants being built, China is leading with 12.85 GW under construction, followed by the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, India and Russia. It is worth noting that, apart from South Korea, the countries expanding their capacity have far less organised public opposition to the use of nuclear energy than countries where activists are pushing for an end to the use of the radioactive form of power generation. China is pushing nuclear power as part of its efforts to lessen reliance on polluting coal-fired generation, notwithstanding the issues surrounding the long-term safe storage of spent fuel rods. The data does point to solid growth in demand for uranium for new power plants, but this increase will be gradual and probably can be met from existing mining operations. This means that uranium producers, some of whom have enjoyed strong rallies in tandem with the spot price, may be reaching overvalued territory. Shares in Paladin Energy, the Australian producer operating mines in Africa, have gained 77.2 percent since a recent low on May 15, and explorer Boss Resources has watched its stock prices jump 105 percent since March 21. These gains look overcooked, and Paladin and Boss aren’t the only players in the uranium space that have enjoyed rallies that appear somewhat disconnected to fundamentals. Even Cameco, which in effect has become a much smaller uranium producer, has seen its share price improve with a gain of 53 percent between November last year and a recent closing peak of C$15.85 in June. But Cameco has failed to maintain those gains, and its share price has eased back to C$13.56 on Aug. 31. This perhaps just goes to show that sustained rallies cannot be built by removing supply from an oversupplied market.

2018-09-03,"VIENNA, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Austria plans to appeal against a ruling by Europe’s second-highest court which rejected its objections to Britain’s plans for a nuclear power plant at Hinkley Point, the country’s sustainability minister said on Monday. “Our lawyers have examined this in detail in the past weeks. We believe the chances of an appeal remain intact,” Sustainability Minister Elisabeth Koestinger said in an interview with newspaper Kronen Zeitung. The ministry said it expects Austria’s cabinet to formally give the go-ahead for an appeal when it meets on Wednesday. French utility EDF and China General Nuclear Power Corp aim to have the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station on line in 2025 with costs for the project seen at 19.6 billion pounds ($25.3 billion). The European Commission cleared the project in 2014, saying it did not see any competition issues. But Austria took its objections to the General Court in Luxembourg, which dismissed them in July. One aspect Vienna objects to is a guaranteed price for electricity from the plant which is higher than market rates. It also opposes state credit guarantees of up to 17 billion pounds being provided for the project. Austria can appeal to the European Court of Justice but only on matters of law. Opposition to nuclear power is widespread in Austria, which built a nuclear reactor but never brought it on line. Voters rejected plans to bring it into operation in a referendum in 1978 and the reactor, at Zwentendorf on the Danube northwest of Vienna, now serves as a training centre. $1 = 0.7757 pounds

2018-09-03,"* Russia implements new oil tax policy, cutting export duty * Belarus has oil product surplus thanks to supplies from Russia * Minsk gets higher revenues from exporting oil products By Darya Korsunskaya and Vladimir Soldatkin MOSCOW, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Russia wants to curtail duty-free oil product flows to Belarus and is seeking a more transparent oil deal with the neighbouring country, Alexei Sazanov, head of the tax department in the Russian finance ministry, said in an interview. Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan have a duty-free arrangement under which Moscow has been sending crude oil and oil products to Minsk with no export fee. Belarus then re-exports some of those goods, pocketing the associated charges. Russia has long been trying to renegotiate the deal, under which it loses billions of roubles annually. Moscow’s finances are under pressure amid mounting Western sanctions and new social spending orders from President Vladimir Putin. “By supplying oil products to Belarus, the Russian budget loses out on export duties,” Sazanov said. Russia supplies Belarus each year with around 2 million tonnes of duty-free oil products but wants to cut that to 100,000-300,000 tonnes, Sazanov said. He did not say from when. Russia has used cheap energy exports and loans to Belarus as a way of keeping its former Soviet neighbour in Moscow’s geopolitical orbit, but the arrangement has become harder to sustain as Russia’s budget tightens. Russia is now seeking effectively to curtail re-exports of its refined products by limiting the volumes that can flow to Belarus. It has also introduced a new tax policy that will see oil export duty abolished within the next six years, meaning there will be no window for companies to save on taxes depending on shipment destination. “It is profitable for Belarus to buy Russian oil products ... and it is exporting products and transferring the duties to its own budget,” Sazanov said, calling the scheme a “covert subsidising” of the Belarus economy. “It is good that relations are becoming more transparent,” he said. Belarus expects to lose around $300 million from Russia’s new tax policy in 2019 alone. Sazanov said it is Moscow’s sovereign right to change its tax policy despite being part of the customs union.

The government is looking for extra money to implement President Vladimir Putin’s pledges of higher social spending and better infrastructure over the next six years, expected to cost around 8 trillion roubles. The new oil tax changes will see an increase in the mineral extraction tax and a gradual reduction in oil and oil products export duty. The changes will be introduced step by step over the next six years starting from Jan. 1, 2019. “The oil industry expects 2 trillion roubles worth of free cash flow this year. This is the money which they may send either for dividends, share buybacks or to redeem loans. Those are huge figures,” Sazanov said. “So we have found resources to additionally finance budget spending worth 1 trillion roubles over six years (from oil taxes).” Russia’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil both recently announced share buyback plans. Sazanov said the oil tax reform was unlikely to affect domestic oil production, which is close to a 30-year high of more than 11.2 million barrels per day. As a protective measure against Western sanctions over Moscow’s role in Ukraine’s conflict and alleged hacking in the United States, and part of the tax overhaul, oil refineries will be able to get compensation in the form of a negative excise tax. Sazanov said the negative excise tax would amount to around 600 roubles per tonne of oil on average under a scenario where the oil price was $60 per barrel and the rouble at 58 per $1. He said the level of negative excise tax, as well as some other components of the tax reform, were still subject to discussions and tweaks. The government in May decided to curb excise tax on fuel to rein in fast rising retail gasoline prices, which led to protests among drivers across the country. Sazanov said excise tax on fuel would rise in 2019, as initially planned. $1 = 67.5300 roubles

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.7 percent while Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.6 percent though trade could be subdued due to a U.S. market holiday on Monday. Most European shares are expected to fall with futures in Germany’s DAX  and France’s CAC falling about 0.2 percent. Britain’s FTSE futures bucked the trend to rise 0.15 percent. “It looks almost certain that (U.S. President Donald) Trump will impose 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of imports from China,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Trump said last week he was ready to implement the new tariffs as soon as a public comment period on the plan ends on Thursday, which would be a major escalation given the United States has already applied tariffs on $50 billion of exports from China. Shanghai shares, which fell 5.3 percent last month on trade war worries, dropped 0.9 percent to 2,700, edging back at the 2 1/2-year low of 2,653 set two weeks ago. “The markets tend to think ahead. After the tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese exports, they will worry what can come next. Unless the trade war anxiety is dispelled, you cannot rule out the possibility of shares falling further,” said Shenshen Wan, strategist at Tokai Tokyo Research. On the other hand, U.S. stocks - especially technology shares - have fared better, thanks in part to the strength of current economic data and corporate profits. The Nasdaq index rose 5.7 percent last month, with Apple gaining almost 20 percent, the biggest percentage gains since April 2009.

2018-09-03,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - One of the surprise packets in the commodity space this year has been uranium, with the spot price surging 30 percent in the past four months, a stellar performance that may not be justified by current fundamentals. Uranium stood at $26 per pound on Aug. 31, up from the low so far this year of $20, hit in mid-April. The year-to-date gain is 16.6 percent, and the metal used to power nuclear reactors is on track to record a second annual increase. This looks like a strong performance on the surface, but uranium isn’t quite like other commodity markets and it’s worth delving down to try and fathom the underlying dynamics. The most obvious factor driving the spot price has been supply cutbacks by major producers, namely Canada’s Cameco and Kazakhstan’s state-owned producer Kazatomprom. Cameco said in July it would extend indefinitely a shutdown of its McArthur River and Key Lake mines in Saskatchewan province, having initially announced a suspension of operations in November last year. Kazatomprom also said at the end of last year that it would reduce its output by 20 percent for three years starting from the beginning of 2018, as it battled a market that has been oversupplied since the nuclear shutdowns in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The Cameco and Kazatomprom cutbacks took about 16.5 percent of annual uranium ore supply from the market, but the price action in the wake of the cutbacks is instructive. The spot price took off after Cameco’s November announcement, jumping from $20 per pound to a high of $26 by Dec. 4, a date that coincided with the news of the Kazatomprom production curbs. Once the initial surge was over, however, spot uranium drifted back down to the April low of $20 per pound, the same level it was before the output cuts were announced. It did recover somewhat thereafter, and got another shot in the arm with Cameco extending the idling of its major mines indefinitely in July. But it does appear the uranium price has been driven by the news flow, and may struggle to sustain a rally. It’s also the case that rallies built on supply cuts are rarely as enduring as those prompted by increases in demand. If the price of spot uranium does rise to around $70 a pound, as some analysts forecast, it’s likely that Cameco and Kazatomprom will simply increase output from their idled mines. But is there a positive demand case to be made for uranium? The news headlines in recent years have tended to focus on the negatives, such as the closure of Japan’s and Germany’s reactors after Fukushima, and the cost blowouts and delays on several new power plants. Almost quietly, though, substantial nuclear capacity is being added in China and elsewhere in Asia. Data from the World Nuclear Association shows that 55 reactors with a capacity of 55 gigawatts (GW) are now under construction, which compares favourably to 455 operating reactors that produce around 400 GW annually. Of the plants being built, China is leading with 12.85 GW under construction, followed by the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, India and Russia. It is worth noting that, apart from South Korea, the countries expanding their capacity have far less organised public opposition to the use of nuclear energy than countries where activists are pushing for an end to the use of the radioactive form of power generation. China is pushing nuclear power as part of its efforts to lessen reliance on polluting coal-fired generation, notwithstanding the issues surrounding the long-term safe storage of spent fuel rods. The data does point to solid growth in demand for uranium for new power plants, but this increase will be gradual and probably can be met from existing mining operations. This means that uranium producers, some of whom have enjoyed strong rallies in tandem with the spot price, may be reaching overvalued territory. Shares in Paladin Energy, the Australian producer operating mines in Africa, have gained 77.2 percent since a recent low on May 15, and explorer Boss Resources has watched its stock prices jump 105 percent since March 21. These gains look overcooked, and Paladin and Boss aren’t the only players in the uranium space that have enjoyed rallies that appear somewhat disconnected to fundamentals. Even Cameco, which in effect has become a much smaller uranium producer, has seen its share price improve with a gain of 53 percent between November last year and a recent closing peak of C$15.85 in June. But Cameco has failed to maintain those gains, and its share price has eased back to C$13.56 on Aug. 31. This perhaps just goes to show that sustained rallies cannot be built by removing supply from an oversupplied market.

2018-09-03,"(Repeats story from Aug. 31 for wider readership with no change to text.) By Osamu Tsukimori and Aaron Sheldrick TOKYO, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Japan’s consumption of liquefied natural gas (LNG) is set to fall as the country’s nuclear reactors restart, with output from atomic power set for its highest since the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. Kansai Electric Power will restart the 870-megawatt (MW) No. 4 reactor at its Takahama station later on Friday, a spokesman told Reuters. The Kansai restart followed Kyushu Electric Power bringing back the 890-MW No. 2 reactor at its Sendai plant on Wednesday. Kyushu now has four reactors running. Each returning reactor will cut demand for LNG by as much as 1 million tonnes a year, said Kosho Tamura, a gas analyst at Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corp. The return of Japan’s nuclear capacity should lead to lower imports of fossil fuels, especially LNG. While that is a positive for Japan’s utilities, especially as LNG prices are near four-year highs in Asia, the loss of Japanese demand could undermine the demand outlook for the global market. Japan is the world’s biggest buyer of LNG. “It’s a good thing that the power utilities in western Japan have restarted nuclear plants, which is leading to the cuts in fossil fuel costs, primarily LNG, through the continued operations of nuclear plants,” said Tomoko Murakami, manager of the nuclear energy group at the Institute of Energy Economics, Japan (IEEJ). Kansai is Japan’s second-largest utility by sales and was the most reliant on nuclear power before the March 2011 Fukushima disaster, when a nuclear power plant owned by Tokyo Electric Power suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami. Before the disaster, Japan had the world’s third-largest reactor fleet which provided about one-third of its electricity. But the plants were shut down for relicensing after Fukushima highlighted regulatory failings. Kansai will have three units operating and expects to have another reactor at Takahama restarted in November after shutting it down earlier this month for maintenance and refuelling, its spokesman said. Those three units will save about $1.5 billion in fuel costs each year they are running, the Kansai spokesman said, declining to comment on what fuels it would substitute. Operating Kyushu’s nuclear units will save the company about $2.2 billion in annual costs based on current LNG prices, its spokeswoman said. With two more reactors likely to restart by the end of the year, when Japan enters its peak demand period, as much as 9 million tonnes of LNG demand could be replaced by nuclear operations. The country’s use of LNG in power generation has been declining this year as more reactors return. In June, LNG imports fell to the lowest monthly amount since May 2016 and for the year through to July are down 2.4 percent. The Fukushima disaster sparked the country’s worst energy crisis in the post-war period, forcing it to import record amounts of LNG and driving prices to record highs. Utilities also turned to cheaper coal imports. ($1 = 110.9600 yen)

International Brent crude oil futures were at $77.59 per barrel at 0046 GMT, down 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $69.81 per barrel, virtually unchanged from their last settlement. Output from the producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) rose by 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) between July and August, to a 2018-high of 32.79 million bpd, a Reuters survey found. Output was boosted by a recovery in Libyan production and as Iraq’s southern exports hit a record. Meanwhile, U.S. drillers added oil rigs for the first time in three weeks, energy services firm Baker Hughes reported on Friday, increasing the rig count by 2 units to 862. The high rig count has helped lift U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA by more than 30 percent since mid-2016, to 11 million bpd. Despite the dip, Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA said Brent was “supported by the notion that U.S. sanctions on Iranian crude oil exports will eventually lead to constricted markets”, which he said would likely push up prices. “Iranian production is already showing signs of decline, falling by 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) last month ... (as) importers of Iranian barrels will already be moving away from taking shipments,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank in Dubai. Many analysts have warned that an economic slowdown because of trade disputes between the United States and other major economies including China and the European Union would drag on oil demand. OANDA’s Innes said it was too early to say whether this would happen. “While the analysts continue fretting that $200 billion in tariffs could drag down oil demand, it isn’t at all clear that such type of economic headwinds will topple oil prices given ... the constant barrage of supply outages,” he said.

2018-09-03,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Rival Iraqi political factions said on Sunday they had each formed alliances capable of forming a government in the new parliament after months of political uncertainty following a May election. Lawmakers led by cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said they created an alliance that would give them a majority bloc in parliament. A rival grouping led by militia commander Hadi al-Ameri and former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responded by saying it had formed its own alliance that would be the largest bloc in parliament after it got some lawmakers to defect from the other group. Ameri and Maliki are Iran’s two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi is seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both American and Iranian influence. Iraq’s parliament contains 329 seats and is set to convene on Monday, when it will elect a speaker and launch the government formation process. Iraqis voted in May in their first parliamentary election since the defeat of Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, but a contentious recount process delayed the announcement of final results until last month. The new government will be tasked with rebuilding the country after a three-year war with Islamic State militants and balancing relations between Iraq’s two biggest allies: arch-rivals Iran and the United States. Uncertainty over the composition of the new government has raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State. The recount delayed the process by three months but showed little had changed from the initial results, with Sadr, a populist Shi’ite cleric, retaining his lead of 54 seats. Ameri’s bloc, made up of Shi’ite paramilitary groups, remained second with 48 seats. Abadi’s bloc remained third with 42. Maliki’s bloc came in fifth with 25 seats. The alliance led by Sadr and Abadi that was announced on Sunday included 20 electoral lists that collectively won 187 seats, a document published by the state news agency showed. It is now in the lead position to form a government. It includes the blocs of Vice President Ayad Allawi and Shi’ite Muslim cleric Ammar al-Hakim, as well as several Sunni Muslim lawmakers and ones representing Turkmen, Yazidi, Mandaean and Christian minorities. Ameri and Maliki held a news conference late on Sunday to say they in fact had the largest parliamentary bloc, with 145 seats. Neither alliance included the two main Kurdish parties, positioning them to reprise the kingmaker role they have historically played, as their combined 43 seats would give whichever alliance they join a sizable numerical advantage.  Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S. invasion, power has been shared among Iraq’s three largest ethnic-sectarian components. The prime minister is a Shi’ite Arab, the speaker of parliament a Sunni Arab and the president a Kurd.
