2018-02-24,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Investment Bank may ask Daimler (DAIGn.DE) to pay back loans extended for research and development in light of a report linking the Mercedes maker to diesel emission-test cheating, Welt am Sonntag reported. The company has received a total of 3.8 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in loans from the EIB since 2000, with around 2 billion still outstanding, the newspaper said. “The EIB is worried about the accusations against Daimler and their potential consequences for the bank’s credit financing of the company,” an EIB spokesman said in an article published on Sunday. The news comes after Bild am Sonntag reported last week U.S. investigators had found that Daimler’s cars were equipped with software that may have helped them pass emissions tests.  Daimler said it was cooperating with the U.S. authorities and had agreed upon strict confidentiality with the Department of Justice. It has not been charged with anything by the U.S. authorities. The EIB said it would need to wait for the outcome of official investigations before deciding whether Daimler should repay the loans, the newspaper said. A Daimler spokesman told Reuters it had received a request for information from the EIB and was cooperating with the bank.  Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) was found in 2015 to have illegally installed software “defeat devices” to dupe U.S. regulatory tests, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history. It settled the principal U.S. cases for $25 billion the following year, although a host of others are still pending. The Daimler spokesman declined to comment on the amount of outstanding loans from the EIB, while the bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Since 2009, the EIB has granted more than 8 billion euros  ($10 billion) in preferential loans to back development of vehicles with lower carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by carmakers, including VW. In France, the bank has asked investigators to find out whether 800 million euros of EU-backed loans to French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) could have been used to develop test-cheating diesel engines, according to documents seen by Reuters.

2018-02-24,"(Adds comment from the Association of Oil Pipe Lines) By Liz Hampton Feb 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge in Louisiana on Friday revoked a permit for Energy Transfer Partners’ Bayou Bridge crude oil pipeline, halting work on a portion of the project following protests by local and environmental groups. The decision by U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Baton Rouge underscores the growing clashes between energy pipeline operators expanding operations to accommodate new oil and gas flows from U.S. shale fields and environmentalists concerned about spills and other hazards. Energy Transfer Partners declined to comment, saying it would wait to review the judge’s opinion, which was not included with the order. Friday’s ruling granting a preliminary injunction requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to revisit its approval of the pipeline’s construction through the Atchafalaya Basin, according to the decision. Energy Transfer Partners has suffered construction delays and court challenges to several other projects, including its Dakota Access crude pipeline and Rover natural gas line, which recently restarted construction in Ohio after regulators halted work following a drilling fluids spill. Environmentalists and local Louisiana fisherman filed the lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, challenging its permit and citing risks to the environment, health and local economy. The pipeline route passes through the Atchafalaya Basin of southern Louisiana, a nearly 1 million-acre patch of swampland that is a critical component of the state’s flood protection system and a source of livelihood for the commercial fishing industry, according to the lawsuit. The groups argued that construction dredging in the swamp will contribute to so-called spoil banks, which build up inside the swamp and alter its water flows, disrupting ecosystems and making the area more prone to floods. Plaintiffs include the Atchafalaya Basinkeeper group, Louisiana Crawfish Producers Association-West, Gulf Restoration Network, Waterkeeper Alliance and Sierra Club. “The court’s ruling recognizes the serious threat this pipeline poses to the Atchafalaya Basin, one of our country’s ecological and cultural crown jewels,” said Jan Hasselman, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. The representative for the Association of Oil Pipe Lines, an industry group, on Saturday noted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found that minimization, avoidance and mitigation efforts made during construction of the pipeline would result in “zero net loss of jurisdictional wetlands.” It also said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service also said “the project is not likely to adversely affect any endangered species.” Construction on the $750 million, 162-mile pipeline has already begun. The line would transport crude from Lake Charles to St. James, Louisiana, connecting to an existing line that originates in Nederland, Texas. The project is 60 percent owned by Energy Transfer with the remainder owned by refiner Phillips 66 N>. Once complete, the Bayou Bridge system will have capacity to transport up to 480,000 barrels of oil per day to refineries along the Mississippi River. It is projected to start service by the second half of 2018. The line also would move oil from Texas and as far as North Dakota, through connections with Energy Transfer’s Dakota Access, to Gulf Coast refiners. Louisiana is home to around 3.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Energy Transfer’s 1,172-mile (1,885-km) Dakota Access crude pipeline was thrust into the spotlight following massive protests near its construction site in North Dakota.

Until now we could not invest in these firms because we did not have permission from the Norwegian government. We hope that will change this year,” Slyngstad said in an interview published on Saturday. “When you look at our investments relative to the economic power of the country, you can see that we have pent-up demand.” Slyngstad was also asked whether the Norwegian fund would invest in the planned $100 billion listing of Saudi national oil firm Saudi Aramco, given that the fund was considering stopping oil and gas investments.

2018-02-24,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s government, which has steadfastly opposed barring heavily-polluting diesel cars from cities, is working on changes to allow driving bans on certain routes on an emergency basis, documents seen by Reuters showed. Junior transport minister Norbert Barthle, a conservative, disclosed the shift in a reply to a parliamentary question by the Greens party, first reported by the Rheinische Post. The plans come days before a German court rules on whether cities can implement bans which carmakers say could cut the resale value of up to 15 million vehicles in Europe’s largest car market, forcing manufacturers to pay for modifications.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government is under pressure to help 70 cities whose emissions violate European Union standards and is keen to find ways to avoid broad bans. “A new legal basis is to be established that would allow ... driving bans or restrictions on certain limited routes to protect human health against particulates or emissions (nitrogen oxide),” Barthle said in the reply.     “That would make possible for the first time route-limited, emergency measures to protect against particulates,” he said. The new rules could be finalised by the end of the year. Merkel has stressed the need to find solutions quickly for the affected cities and said she wants to avoid driving bans, which could anger drivers, by focusing on switching fleets of taxis and buses to electric propulsion.  Germany is also considering plans to make public transport free in cities suffering from poor air quality. Germany’s highest federal administrative court is due to rule on Tuesday on an appeal brought by German states against bans imposed by local courts in Stuttgart and Duesseldorf over bad air quality. There has been a global backlash against diesel-engine cars since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. exhaust tests, meant to limit emissions of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide (NOx) which cause respiratory disease. While other countries are also considering restrictions on diesel cars, bans in Germany would be a big blow to the car industry, and an embarrassment for Merkel’s government, which has long backed the industry, which employs 800,000 people. German carmakers have invested heavily in diesel to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and meet climate change goals, but the VW scandal has forced manufacturers to increase efforts on electric cars and invest in making diesel engines cleaner. Oliver Luksic, transport expert for Germany’s pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), said the plans were a “disappropriation for millions of drivers” and a confession from the government that they had failed to tackle the diesel scandal.  “Many people have bought diesel cars in good faith, now their vehicles will lose value and won’t be used in many big cities. There is no way to avoid modifications of diesel cars at the expense of carmakers,” Luksic said.

2018-02-24,"(Adds more detail from statement) TUNIS, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Saturday it had declared force majeure on the 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) El Feel oilfield after a protest by guards closed the field. El Feel was shut after guards withdrew from the field to push demands over pay and other benefits earlier this week. The NOC said force majeure was declared on Friday after “members of Fazzan group from the Petroleum Facility Guards (PFG) threatened workers, entered the administrative offices in the field, tampered with official papers of the field administration and fired in the air”. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla was quoted in the NOC statement as saying the guards were attached to the ministry of defence, and it was up to the ministry to respond to their demands. “The NOC supplies the PFG members in the field with fuel and supplies but cannot supply hundreds of those who claim to be members of the PFG in areas far and away from the scope of the oil sector operations,” he said. The numbers of such claimants “are constantly growing”, the statement said. The field is operated by a joint venture between state-owned NOC and Italy’s Eni. Crude from El Feel is blended with condensate from the Wafa field to form the Mellitah blend, which is exported from the Mellitah terminal. Guards at Libyan oilfields are often drawn from local groups, and have repeatedly disrupted production over claims of late payment of salaries and demands for local development projects. Many at El Feel come from the Tebu ethnic group present in southwest Libya. “The NOC is in contact with all the social leaders of Tebu tribe to find a solution for the return of calm to the field and resume operations as soon as possible,” the statement said.

2018-02-24,"* Seeks permanent alliance among major producers * ‘Exceptional’ Jan compliance to output cut deal * Eyes buying stakes in new, existing Indian refineries (Recasts, adds details) By Nidhi Verma and Sudarshan Varadhan NEW DELHI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia hopes OPEC and its allies will be able to relax production curbs next year and create a permanent framework to stabilise oil markets after the current supply cut deal ends this year, its oil minister said on Saturday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers. The pact, aimed at propping oil prices, began in January 2017 and will run until the end of 2018. Saudi Arabian oil minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and its allies were committed to bringing balance and stability to the market and that he hoped it would be possible to ease output curbs next year. “A study is taking place and once we know exactly what balancing the market will entail we will announce what is the next step. The next step may be easing of the production constraints,” he told reporters in New Delhi. “My estimation is that it will happen sometime in 2019. But we don’t know when and we don’t know how”. Falih said OPEC was determined to translate the success of the deal to curb supply into a permanent framework with other major producers. “What we want is an evergreen framework that brings producers from OPEC and non-OPEC (countries) together in a market monitoring fashion that allows us to take quick decisions,” he said. “I think everybody has learnt, producers as well as consumers, that a market without a steering wheel is very destructive, very damaging to the interests of all,” he said. Falih said compliance with the output cuts in January was “exceptional.” Oil prices have doubled from their lows in 2015-2016 after the cuts. Falih said the market had absorbed rising U.S. shale oil production, as output from countries such as Venezuela and Mexico had declined. U.S. oil inventories fell last week. Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, in March cut production and exported less than 7 million bpd due to seasonally soft demand. Falih said that in January-March, Saudi Arabia’s oil production was well below the production cap, with exports averaging below 7 million bpd. State oil company Saudi Aramco has signed a preliminary deal to invest in India’s planned 1.2 million bpd West Coast refinery. Falih said Aramco was also looking at buying stakes in existing major refiners and expansion projects in India. He did not specify the size of stake Aramco will take in the west coast refinery, but added “the more the better.” India aims to expand its refining capacity by 77 percent to about 8.8 million bpd by 2030. Falih said Saudi Arabia would also sign oil supply deals as part of the agreement to buy stakes in Indian refineries, a strategy the kingdom has adopted to expand its market share in Asia and fend off rivals. Last year, Saudi Arabia pledged billions of dollars of investments in projects in Indonesia and Malaysia to secure long-term oil supply deals.

2018-02-24,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia received a long-awaited upgrade to its sovereign rating from S&P Global, a move set to bolster capital inflows into its financial markets just weeks before a presidential election. S&P Global Ratings raised Russia’s foreign currency long-term and short-term sovereign credit ratings to investment grade of ‘BBB-/A-3’ from so-called junk level of ‘BB+/B’ late on Friday night. The upgrade may be seen by financial markets and Russian officials as an approval of the oil-dependent country’s efforts to get back to economic growth path. Russian authorities also track ratings as a gauge of Western sentiment towards Moscow’s policies before the March 18 presidential election, which president Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, who called Russia’s rating downgrades in 2014 “politically motivated” amid the Ukrainian crisis, said on Saturday the S&P’s decision was anticipated and logical. “The assignment of the investment (grade) rating will certainly increase investors’ interest in Russia, not only in investing in state assets but also in private business,” Siluanov told reporters on Saturday. The S&P upgrade is Russia’s second investment grade rating.  Fitch also has an investment grade on Russia which it left unchanged late on Friday. Market players expect demand for Russian state bonds to increase as major international funds require two investment grades as a minimum to invest in a country’s financial instruments. LONG-AWAITED MOVE The Russian finance ministry had said before it expected international rating agencies to upgrade Russia after it lived through the peak of economic turmoil in 2014-2015. But the agencies avoided rapid moves as they contemplated Western sanctions and Russia’s tepid economic activity. In its report, S&P lowered Russia’s rating outlook to stable from positive, but said it expects “broad policy continuity and macroeconomic stability” after the election. “In the longer term, the limited track record and uncertainty surrounding the succession of power could undermine predictability of policy priorities,” it said. The agency praised Russia’s policy response to lower commodity prices and international sanctions, highlighting its  strong net external asset position, low government debt and the central bank’s monetary policy. It forecast economic growth at 1.8 percent this year, continuing to recover through to 2021, and noted that Western sanctions would remain in place through the forecast horizon. “Sanctions will continue to limit Russia’s trend growth and economic diversification efforts due to high investor uncertainty and constraints on technology transfer.” Reporting by Andrey Ostroukh in Moscow and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Clelia Oziel",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ratings-sp/update-2-sp-gives-russia-pre-election-boost-with-rating-upgrade-idUKL8N1QD6EE,24 Feb 2018,"Russia received a long-awaited

2018-02-24,"NAIROBI, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Power producer Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen) posted a 7 percent drop in pretax profit for the first half of its financial year to 6.08 billion shillings ($59.7 million) as depreciation expenses rose. The company said in a statement published in local newspapers on Saturday that its total revenue rose to 18.61 billion shillings in the six months ended December from 17.74 billion in the same period a year earlier. That was largely driven by electricity sales, which rose 2 percent to 14.92 billion shillings, with just over a third coming from geothermal power generation. It said depreciation and amortisation expenses were up 15 percent to 5.19 billion shillings due to the capitalisation of its geothermal wells and wellheads towards the end of last year. Kenya has an installed generating capacity of 2,370 megawatts (MW) and peak demand of about 1,770 MW. Of this, KenGen, which is 70 percent owned by the government, has an installed capacity of 1,631 MW, including 533 MW from geothermal sources. KenGen plans to add another 1,745 megawatts (MW) of electricity capacity from geothermal sources by 2025. It said operating expenses rose to 4.65 billion shillings from 4.39 billion shillings a year earlier due to maintenance costs at its power plants. Basic earnings per share fell to 1.86 shillings from 2.10 shillings a year earlier, the company said, adding it would not pay an interim dividend. $1 = 101.8000 Kenyan shillings

2018-02-24,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China exported barely any fuel to North Korea in January, data showed on Saturday, deepening months-long cuts in trade with its isolated neighbor amid growing tensions over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile program. Official data from the General Administration of Customs showed a fourth straight month of no diesel, gasoline or fuel oil shipments. China has traditionally been the main source of North Korea’s fuel. The only oil product sent to North Korea was 201 tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The export breakdown by product comes after data on Friday showed trade with North Korea fell to the lowest level in dollar terms on records going back to June 2014. China remains North Korea’s largest trading partner and sole major ally, though overall trade has fallen in recent months as the United Nations stepped up sanctions, banning imports of some major commodities and seafood in September and capping annual oil product shipments in December. China imported no iron ore, coal or lead from North Korea last month, according to the customs data, in line with those latest curbs, aimed at persuading Pyongyang to abandon its weapons program.     Cereal trade also slowed, with exports of rice totaling 180 tonnes to North Korea, down 4.3 percent from a year ago. It did not export any corn. The pace of that slowdown in business has accelerated in recent months with exports of petroleum and some grains almost grinding to a halt in November and December. The data release came after the Trump administration on Friday imposed its largest package of sanctions against North Korea in a bid to increase pressure on Pyongyang for its nuclear and ballistic missile tests. In a speech on Thursday, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said that the penalties are having an impact because North Korea now has less money to spend on its ballistic missile tests. Last year, North Korea conducted dozens of missile launches and its sixth and largest nuclear test in defiance of U.N. resolutions as it pursues its goal of developing a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States. China has repeatedly said it is fully enforcing all resolutions against North Korea, despite suspicion in Washington, Seoul and Tokyo that loopholes still exist.

2018-02-24,"* Indonesian imports recover in January after year-end delays * Arrivals from Mongolia sink due to border congestion BEIJING, Feb 24 (Reuters) - China’s coal imports from key supplier Australia surged in January from a year ago, customs data showed on Saturday, boosted by strong demand at utilities amid freezing weather. The world’s top coal consumer brought in 7.94 million tonnes of coal from Australia COA-AUCN-IMP last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed, up 9.4 percent from a year ago. That compares with 8.07 million tonnes in December. Indonesian coal supplies COA-IDCN-IMP jumped almost 40 percent in January from a year ago to 5.04 million tonnes, one of the highest monthly totals for the country since 2014. The surge is a big recovery from December when delays at loading ports in Indonesia as a result of heavy rain slowed arrivals to just 1.7 million tonnes. Buyers of Indonesian coal had also been holding back orders of the fuel as new shipping rules for coal and crude palm oil issued by Jakarta are expected to restrict exports to Indonesian vessels. The regulation will take effect at the end of April. With several bouts of freezing weather sweeping across China in late January and early February, some coal-fired power plants warned of tight supplies of the fuel as their inventories fell below critical levels due to record daily consumption. Data released this month showed that China brought in a total of 27.81 million tonnes of coal in January, the highest level in four years. “Imported coal will continue to play a key role as a supplement of domestic coal until mid-March as heating demand in northern China remain robust,” said a Zhengzhou-based trader, adding coal imports may tighten again afterwards. The heating season typically ends on March 15 in northern China. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts suggest China will import about 21.68 million tonnes of seaborne coal in February. China’s thermal coal prices on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange hit 679.8 yuan ($106.89) a tonne on Jan. 29, up from around 390 yuan a year earlier. To ensure stable coal supplies, state- and local-level authorities have ordered miners to ramp up production and asked ports to speed up the process of receiving seaborne coal. Prices of spot cargoes of thermal coal from Australia’s Newcastle port, touched a 13-month-high at $109.50 on Jan. 17. Shipments from Russia COA-RUCN-IMP also rose in January. It went up 43 percent to 2.53 million tonnes. That compares with 2.14 million tonnes in December. Imports from Mongolia COA-MNCN-IMP, however, were down 40.8 percent to 1.85 million tonnes from a year ago and down from December’s 2.83 million tonnes due to congestion at the border with China.

2018-02-24,"* Saudi Arabia loses number 2 position Angola in January * Iraq imports jump 28 percent * US arrivals exceed 2 mln t BEIJING, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Russia remained the top crude oil supplier to China in January, data showed, beginning 2018 on a strong note after the start-up of an expanded trans-Siberia pipeline and as Beijing released more crude import quotas to independent refiners. Angola and Iraq took the second and third positions for the month, leapfrogging Saudi Arabia, which was the second-largest supplier to China in 2017. Russian supplies came in at 5.67 million tonnes, or 1.34 million barrels per day (bpd), up 23.4 percent from a year earlier, data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs showed on Saturday. The January number compared with 1.194 million bpd in December. Last month, data showed Russia notched up its second year as China’s largest supplier in 2017, surpassing Saudi Arabia - OPEC’s top exporter - by some 150,000 barrels each day. The strong Russian exports to the world’s largest crude oil buyer came as a second East Siberia-Pacific Ocean (ESPO) pipeline, as well as expanded domestic connections in China, started commercial operation in January. In a reshuffle of the pack, Angola ranked second with 4.68 million tonnes, or 1.1 million bpd, of crude in January, down 5.4 percent from a year earlier. China imported 4.45 million tonnes, or 1.05 million bpd, of crude from Iraq, up 28 percent from a year ago. Saudi Arabia supplied 4.29 million tonnes, or 1.01 million bpd, to China in January. That was down 15 percent from the same year-ago rate and compared with 1.11 million bpd in December. Even so, exports from the kingdom are expected to rise to record levels this year as Saudi Aramco ramps up supplies to Chinese state oil firm CNOOC, as well as the Huajin refinery owned by defence giant NORINCO. China’s total crude oil imports last month soared 20 percent from the same month a year earlier to a record rate of 9.57 million barrels per day, beating the previous peak of 9.17 million bpd. Customs data also showed China’s oil imports from the United States soared to 2.01 million tonnes last month, or roughly 472,508 bpd. That compares with just 257,861 tonnes a year ago. In 2017, U.S. shipments, which benefited from OPEC-led supply cuts, averaged about 153,000 bpd.

2018-02-24,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration and key Asian allies are preparing to expand interceptions of ships suspected of violating sanctions on North Korea, a plan that could include deploying U.S. Coast Guard forces to stop and search vessels in Asia-Pacific waters, senior U.S. officials said. Washington has been talking to regional partners, including Japan, South Korea, Australia and Singapore, about coordinating a stepped-up crackdown that would go further than ever before in an attempt to squeeze Pyongyang’s use of seagoing trade to feed its nuclear missile programme, several officials told Reuters. While suspect ships have been intercepted before, the emerging strategy would expand the scope of such operations but stop short of imposing a naval blockade on North Korea. Pyongyang has warned it would consider a blockade an act of war. The strategy calls for closer tracking and possible seizure of ships suspected of carrying banned weapons components and other prohibited cargo to or from North Korea, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Depending on the scale of the campaign, the United States could consider beefing up the naval and air power of its Pacific Command, they said. The U.S.-led initiative, which has not been previously reported, shows Washington’s increasing urgency to force North Korea into negotiations over the abandonment of its weapons programs, the officials said.  North Korea may be only a few months away from completing development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, despite existing international sanctions that, at times, have been sidestepped by smuggling and ship-to-ship transfers at sea of banned goods, according to officials. “There is no doubt we all have to do more, short of direct military action, to show (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un we mean business,” said a senior administration official. The White House declined official comment. The effort could target vessels on the high seas or in the territorial waters of countries that choose to cooperate. It was unclear, however, to what extent the campaign might extend beyond Asia. Washington on Friday slapped sanctions on dozens more companies and vessels linked to North Korean shipping trade and urged the United Nations to blacklist a list of entities, a move it said was aimed at shutting down North Korea’s illicit maritime smuggling activities to obtain oil and sell coal. Tighter sanctions plus a more assertive approach at sea could dial up tensions at a time when fragile diplomacy between North and South Korea has gained momentum. It would also stretch U.S. military resources needed elsewhere, possibly incur massive new costs and fuel misgivings among some countries in the region. The initiative, which is being developed, would be fraught with challenges that could risk triggering North Korean retaliation and dividing the international community. China and Russia, which have blocked U.S. efforts at the United Nations to win approval for use of force in North Korea interdiction operations, are likely to oppose new actions if they see the United States as overstepping. A Chinese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such steps should only be taken under United Nations auspices. China’s Foreign Ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said they did not know anything about the plan, but that in principle China believes U.N. resolutions on North Korea should be fully and thoroughly implemented. “At the same time, we hope relevant countries act in accordance with Security Council resolutions and international law,” it added, without elaborating. But Washington is expected to start gradually ratcheting up such operations soon even if discussions with allies have not been completed, according to the senior U.S. official. U.S. experts are developing legal arguments for doing more to stop sanctions-busting vessels, citing the last U.N. Security Council resolution which they say opened the door by calling on states to inspect suspect ships on the high seas or in their waters. Washington is also drawing up rules of engagement aimed at avoiding armed confrontation at sea, the officials said. A Japanese ruling party lawmaker briefed by the government said discussions with the United States were focussed on the need for stepped up cooperation on surveillance and information-sharing between Washington, Tokyo and Seoul regarding ship-to-ship transfers suspected of violating sanctions, and on the need to notify authorities in ports of origin. The lawmaker as well as a Japanese defence ministry official involved in policy planning said that under current U.N. sanctions, the agreement of the flag state and ship captain was necessary to conduct inspections on the high seas. “I think it is unlikely that the U.N. will strengthen the sanctions so that inspections on high seas are possible without agreement,” the Japanese defence official said.  “From the viewpoint of the country in question, that would be an act of war,” he said, referring to North Korea. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters in Washington on Friday the United States does not rule out boarding ships for inspections.  But U.S. officials said privately that such action, especially the use of boarding crews, would be decided on a case-by-case and with utmost caution. Some U.S. officials believe the risk could be minimized if Coast Guard cutters, which carry less firepower and technically engage in law-enforcement missions, are used in certain cases rather than warships. The Coast Guard declined to address whether it might deploy ships to the Asia-Pacific region but acknowledged its ties to countries there. “Future ship deployments would depend on U.S. foreign policy objectives and the operational availability of our assets,” said spokesman Lieutenant Commander Dave French. A senior South Korean government official said there had been discussions over “intensified maritime interdictions,” including at a foreign ministers’ meeting in Vancouver last month where U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson pressed counterparts on the issue. “We are discussing with various countries including the U.S. and South Korea how to fully implement the sanctions, but I have not heard talk of creating a framework or a coalition,” said the Japanese defence ministry official involved in policy planning. Japan’s foreign ministry, in reply to a question from Reuters, repeated Tokyo’s call for “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang. The ministry declined to comment on specific discussions with other countries, but said Japan continued its “close collaboration with the U.S., ROK (South Korea) and the international community including China and Russia to secure the effectiveness of U.N. Security Council Resolutions” to achieve the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The Trump administration has also sought greater cooperation from Southeast Asian countries, which may have little military capability to assist but are seen as sources of intelligence on ship movements, U.S. officials said. “The more partners we have, the more resources we have to dedicate to the effort,” said Chris Ford, assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation. He declined to talk about discussions with specific countries. Washington is especially interested in detecting of ship-to-ship transfers at sea of banned goods, something North Korea has increasingly resorted to as vessels have faced greater scrutiny of their cargo in Asian ports, the officials said. Reuters reported in December that Russian tankers had supplied fuel to North Korea at sea in a violation of sanctions. Washington also said at the time it had evidence that vessels from several countries, including China, had engaged in shipping oil products and coal. China denied the allegation. U.S. interception of ships close to Chinese waters is something likely to be avoided, in favour of informing Chinese authorities of banned cargo onboard and asking them do the inspection, one official said. “It’s probably impossible to stop everything, but you can raise the cost to North Korea,” said David Shear, former deputy secretary of defence for Asia under President Barack Obama.
