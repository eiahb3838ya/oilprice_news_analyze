2018-02-15,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Pipeline operator TransCanada Corp (TRP.TO) (TRP.N) said on Thursday that it would go ahead with the C$2.4 billion ($1.9 billion) expansion of its NGTL natural gas system, boosting pipeline access for producers in Western Canada’s gas-rich basins. The Calgary-based company also reported a strong fourth quarter profit, beating market expectations, sending its shares up 5 percent to C$56.33 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. TransCanada said the expansion of its Nova Gas Transmission Line (NGTL), which moves gas from Alberta and British Columbia to markets all over North America, will boost basin export capacity by 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). The expansion will also connect new supply in the Montney and Duvernay formations, which Canadian producers and global oil majors say could rival the most prolific U.S. shale fields. Development has so far been hampered by weak prices and limited pipeline capacity. “This program will provide much-needed transportation solutions for Western Canadian natural gas producers and unlock access to existing Canadian Mainline capacity,” said Russ Girling, TransCanada’s chief executive, in a statement.   Girling later said on a conference call that TransCanada continues to work actively on its Coastal GasLink line, another possible outlet for stranded Canadian gas, and that it expects the Shell-led LNG Canada consortium to make an investment decision on its export terminal by year-end.      TransCanada also said it now expects to start construction on its $8 billion Keystone XL expansion in 2019, with the build taking about two years to complete. The company said in January customers committed to using about two-thirds of the capacity on the line, which has been delayed for more than eight years. “We do have some items that we have to attend to in ‘18, including securing additional land in Nebraska,” said Paul Miller, vice president of liquid pipelines, noting it is in talks with landowners, indigenous groups and stakeholders.  Nebraska regulators approved the project last year, but not TransCanada’s preferred route, choosing instead a more costly alternative. Greenpeace and Bold Nebraska said on Thursday that there are more than 100 landowners opposed to that alternative route.   Keystone’s attributable net income was C$861 million, or 98 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of C$358 million, or 43 Canadian cents, a year ago.     On an adjusted basis, the company earned 82 Canadian cents, beating the average analyst estimate of 77 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-02-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets surged anew on Thursday as investors shrugged off the latest sign of rising U.S. inflation, while strong global growth weighed on the dollar and pushed it to a 15-month low against the Japanese yen. U.S. producer prices accelerated in January, according to a Labor Department report that offered further evidence of growing inflation pressures in the world’s largest economy. The report came on the heels of data on Wednesday showing a broad increase in U.S. consumer prices last month.  Faster inflation, which reduces the return of fixed income, spooked the bond market and had sparked a selloff in equities on Wednesday. But stocks later rallied on the notion that strong economic growth can offset moderate inflation.    An index of world stock markets .MIWD00000PUS advanced more than 1 percent and major European indexes also rose, bolstered by strong results from Airbus SE (AIR.PA), the region’s largest aerospace firm. On Wall Street Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rose after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway disclosed in a regulatory filing that the iPhone maker is now its top common stock investment. Network gear maker Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) was among other technology stocks that rose, after its strong quarterly results and upbeat forecast. Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer at BNY Mellon Wealth Management in New York, said he was encouraged by the reaction to the inflation data. “There were a lot eyes fixating on the PPI number this morning, it came in a little hot. But much like yesterday, the market’s shaking it off,” Grohowski said. The equities selloff two weeks ago after an initial sign of an uptick in inflation had overshadowed earnings that are so strong estimates may need to be revised upward, he said. “We’re taking our earnings estimates and looking at them and saying we just increased them six weeks ago, but you know what? They’re feeling pretty conservative to us,” Grohowski said.   Of the 383 companies in the benchmark S&P 500 index that have reported fourth-quarter earnings, 76.5 percent have beat analysts’ expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. MSCI's all-country world index closed up 1.22 percent in a fifth straight session of gains while the FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 of leading shares in Europe gained 0.44 percent to close at 1475.50. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 306.88 points, or 1.23 percent, to 25,200.37, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 32.57 points, or 1.21 percent, to 2,731.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 112.82 points, or 1.58 percent, to 7,256.43. Rising interest rates need not be a worry as long as the economy is growing and the fundamental outlook does not change, Grohowski said.  “The market’s growing increasingly comfortable that maybe 3 percent on a 10-year Treasury note is OK,” he said. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR rose 1/32 in price to push yields down to 2.9077 percent. Earlier in the session yields had shot up to 2.944 percent. (Graphic: S&P 500 vs U.S. 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, reut.rs/2sy2r4e) The gap between German and U.S. 10-year borrowing costs reached its widest since April after the higher-than-expected U.S. inflation data triggered a sharp selloff in U.S. Treasuries earlier in the day.  While investors also shed European government bonds after Wednesday’s inflation data, political risks kept a cap on yields.  German 10-year government bond yields DE10YT=RR were a basis point higher at 0.76 percent. The dollar fell across the board.   “Forex markets rotate from theme to theme all the time. The theme right now is global growth and strong global growth has historically pushed the dollar lower,” said Greg Anderson, global head of FX strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. The dollar index .DXY fell 0.57 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.39 percent to $1.2497. The Japanese yen JPY= strengthened 0.87 percent versus the greenback at 106.10 per dollar. Oil prices were mixed. Brent pared losses and U.S. crude rebounded on a weak dollar and Saudi Arabia’s comments that OPEC and other producers were committed to cutting supplies, which offset record U.S. production and rising inventories. U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday, making the United States a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude and gasoline inventories rose last week, U.S. data showed. Brent futures LCOc1 fell 3 cents to settle at $64.33 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 settled up 74 cents at $61.34.

2018-02-15,"(Adds share movement in paragraph 6) By David French and John Tilak NEW YORK/TORONTO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc , Canada’s biggest pipeline operator, plans to accelerate its divestment program by selling assets valued at about C$8 billion ($6.4 billion) in 2018, more than twice its initial sale target, according to people familiar with the situation. Under pressure from both investors and rating agencies, the Calgary, Alberta-based firm wants to ramp up the sale of non-core assets from the previous C$3 billion it forecast in November, the people said on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Enbridge is trying to take advantage of favorable selling conditions to rid itself of unwanted units and pay down its C$61.4 billion long-term debt, the people said. Enbridge last year completed a $28 billion merger with Spectra Energy Corp. The company, which reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, declined to comment. Shares in Enbridge have lost 23 percent in the last 52 weeks, underperforming the broader market. Earlier this month, the stock hit its lowest in nearly two years. The shares rose about 1.6 percent on the news and closed up 0.9 percent, at C$43.23. As part of a strategic review announced in November, Enbridge said it has identified C$10 billion in non-core assets that it could sell over time. Enbridge is working with an investment bank to sell Canadian and U.S. renewable energy assets worth more than C$2 billion, the sources said. It is also looking to offload Canadian midstream assets, largely the result of the Spectra merger, that could fetch as much as C$4 billion, the sources said. Renewable energy assets have drawn interest from investor groups, including infrastructure and private equity funds, in recent years due to a steady return in a low interest rate environment and their increasing prevalence in North America’s energy make-up. Also, Enbridge has hired an investment bank to sell its Midcoast Gas Gathering and Processing business in the United States, the sources said. Enbridge hopes that selling non-core assets will help speed up debt reduction, enabling it to strengthen its balance sheet and raise its dividend. In December, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Enbridge's senior unsecured rating to Baa3 from Baa2, partly on concerns about its big debt. Enbridge's November measures were insufficient to improve its financial profile in a timely manner, Moody's said.

2018-02-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil markets were mixed on Thursday with Brent flat even though the dollar slid, while U.S. crude rose as investors covered short positions. “This is kind of an upside-down Thursday,” said Dominick Chirichella, co-president at the Energy Management Institute in New York. He said he was puzzled at why a weaker dollar did not boost Brent futures prices. “The rise we’ve seen in U.S. crude has been more of a short covering rally rather than a return to the uptrend,” he added. Global benchmark Brent LCOc1 slipped 3 cents to settle at $64.33 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained 74 cents, or 1.2 percent, to settle at $61.34. Those price moves cut the premium of Brent over WTI WTCLc1-LCOc1 to its lowest in six months. “If the Brent-WTI spread narrows, the big incentive to export U.S. crude oil starts to narrow,” Chirichella said, noting he did not expect U.S. prices to hold at these higher levels for long since “all of the fundamental snapshots ... over the past couple of weeks have been bearish.” The dollar .DXY slid to its lowest since it touched a three-year low in late January. [USD/] A weaker dollar often boosts prices for oil and other dollar-denominated commodities, making them cheaper for holders of other currencies.  “I’m surprised that (Brent) oil prices are falling today given the weaker U.S. dollar. Currently, the direction of the dollar is having a bigger impact on oil prices than fundamentals,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Energy. Oil had climbed on Wednesday and early on Thursday after Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC hopes to keep limiting crude output to leave the market tight. “Khalid al-Falih gave his strongest hint yet that exiting the current supply agreement is unlikely to be on the agenda this year,” said Tamas Varga of oil broker PVM. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other produces including Russia have agreed to cut output by 1.8 million barrels per day through the end of 2018. But surging U.S. production is offsetting OPEC’s efforts to curb supplies. U.S. crude output hit a record 10.27 million barrels per day last week, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, making it a bigger producer than Saudi Arabia.

2018-02-15,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s unpopular socialist president Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday his right-wing Latin American counterparts showed intolerance by trying to exclude him from an upcoming summit in Lima - and he vowed to go anyway.  “Do you fear me? You don’t want to see me in Lima? You’re going to see me. Because come rain or shine, by air, land, or sea, I will attend the Summit of the Americas,” Maduro told foreign journalists at the Miraflores presidential palace. Peru’s centre-right government this week said Maduro would not be welcome at the April summit, reinforcing his growing diplomatic isolation during a crackdown on dissent and a brutal economic crisis in Venezuela.  Later on Thursday, Peru’s Prime Minister Mercedes Araoz told journalists that Maduro “really needs to understand that in Peru we don’t want to receive him.”  Maduro also said Argentina’s president Mauricio Macri, with whom he has regularly sparred, should call a meeting of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) group of Latin American nations with him.  “Call a meeting, dare, don’t be scared of me, President Macri,” said Maduro. “If you want to talk about Venezuela, let’s talk about Venezuela.”  Government critics say Maduro for years has refused to listen to advice that he should reform Venezuela’s crumbling economy that has spawned shortages, hyperinflation, malnutrition, and the return of once-controlled diseases. They also say he refuses to acknowledge Venezuela’s humanitarian suffering, making it futile to meet. Maduro, a 55 year-old former bus driver and union leader, says right-wing regional governments are part of U.S.-led international conspiracy to topple him and take control of the OPEC member’s oil resources.  “They’re the most unpopular governments on the planet,” he said, naming Argentina, Colombia and Peru.  He lashed out at Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, whose parents were of Swiss and Polish descent and who studied at Oxford and Princeton, as particularly out of touch with Latin American realities.  “Kuczynski struggles to speak Spanish,” Maduro said.  Maduro can still count on support from leftist allies including Bolivia’s Evo Morales and Nicaragua’s Daniel Ortega. And Communist-run Cuba’s Foreign Ministry also said it rejected Venezuela’s exclusion from the summit and vowed “unshakeable solidarity” with Maduro’s government.  Venezuela, home to the world’s biggest crude reserves, has further backing from global giants China and Russia, which have both lent Caracas billions of dollars. Still, even their support has cooled somewhat during a fifth straight year of recession and widespread accusations of mismanagement and corruption.

The punk icon was joined by her son Joe Corre outside the central London offices of British petrochemicals firm Ineos, which is seeking to develop shale gas projects in Britain. The stunt a day before the start of London Fashion Week saw the 76-year-old designer strut along the street wearing a black graphic T-shirt dress emblazoned with the slogan “FRACKING CLIMATE CHAOS”. Models and activists wore similar outfits. “Fracking is over. The people in this country are not going to accept it,” Corre said at the event.     The company was granted an injunction in 2017 by Britain’s High Court, preventing anti-fracking protesters from interfering with its operations. Corre told crowd that activists were “not frightened of,” the injunction.  An Ineos spokesman said that activists’ assertions that their legal action had made all protest unlawful in the UK was not the case. “Our injunctions prohibit unlawful acts by protesters and in no way impinge on the right to peaceful protest. These injunctions simply protect Ineos and our people from hard core activists who game the system and treat the law with contempt.” Reporting by Helena Williams; Writing by Mark Hanrahan in London; Editing by Andrew Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/fashion-london-viviennewestwood/designer-westwood-stages-london-fashion-fracking-protest-idUKL8N1Q55U3,15 Feb 2018,"Fashion designer Vivienne

2018-02-15,"CARACAS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s unpopular socialist president Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday his right-wing Latin American counterparts showed intolerance by trying to exclude him from an upcoming summit in Lima and he vowed to go anyway. Peru’s center-right government this week said Maduro would not be welcome at the Summit of the Americas in April, reinforcing his growing diplomatic isolation during a crackdown on dissent and a brutal economic crisis in Venezuela. “Do you fear me? You don’t want to see me in Lima? You’re going to see me. Because come rain or shine, by air, land, or sea, I will attend the Summit of the Americas,” Maduro said during a press conference with foreign journalists. Maduro also said Argentina’s center-right president Mauricio Macri should call a meeting of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) group of Latin American nations with him. “Call a meeting, dare, don’t be scared of me, President Macri,” said Maduro. “If you want to talk about Venezuela, let’s talk about Venezuela.” Government critics say Maduro for years has refused to listen to advice that he should reform Venezuela’s crumbling economy that has spawned shortages, hyperinflation, malnutrition, and the return of once-controlled diseases. They also say he refuses to acknowledge the extent of Venezuela’s humanitarian suffering, so it is futile to meet with him. He says right-wing regional governments are part of U.S.-led international conspiracy to topple him and take control of the OPEC member’s oil resources. “They’re the most unpopular governments on the planet,” he said, naming Argentina, Colombia and Peru.

2018-02-15,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Lebanon on Thursday that the Iran-backed Hezbollah group’s growing arsenal and involvement in regional conflicts threatened Lebanon’s security.  Speaking alongside Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in a Beirut news conference, Tillerson also said the United States was engaging with Lebanon and Israel to ensure their border remained calm. Israel regards Hezbollah as the biggest direct threat on its borders and has repeatedly struck it in Syria, where the group is fighting alongside President Bashar al-Assad in a civil war now entering its eighth year. The Trump administration has taken a hardline position on Iran and has sanctioned several people and entities associated with Hezbollah in recent weeks as part of an effort to increase pressure on Iran. The heavily armed Shi’ite movement is part of the Lebanese coalition government led by Sunni Muslim politician Hariri, under a complex political system that promotes sectarian power-sharing. “Hezbollah is not just a concern for the United States. The people of Lebanon should also be concerned about how Hezbollah’s actions and its growing arsenal bring unwanted and unhelpful scrutiny on Lebanon,” Tillerson said. “Hebollah’s entanglement in regional conflicts threatens the security of Lebanon,” he added. Hezbollah has always rejected any demand that it give up its weapons, which it says are necessary to defend Lebanon against Israel. It has said its role in Syria is needed to stop any Sunni militant threat to Lebanon, and said in January it believes the war there will be over in one or two years. Tillerson’s visit, the first by a U.S. Secretary of State to Lebanon since 2014, got off to an awkward start as he waited several minutes in Baabda Palace for his meeting with President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally. The Lebanese president’s office denied any departure from diplomatic protocol and said Tillerson had arrived a few minutes early. Footage of him waiting aired on some Arabic TV channels throughout the day. Aoun later said Tillerson had listened and understood the Lebanese position regarding the Israeli border. Israeli-Lebanese tensions have spiked in recent months because of Israeli plans to build a wall at the border, and because of Lebanon’s decision to begin exploring for oil and gas in an offshore block in disputed waters. Hezbollah, which the United States deems a terrorist organisation, has increased its military strength since the last major conflict with Israel in 2006. Tillerson urged Lebanese leaders to uphold the country’s commitment to staying out of regional conflicts. Israel has accused Iran of seeking to set up weapons factories in Lebanon, and the Israeli military last month said the country had turned into one “large missile factory”. Lebanon is a big recipient of U.S. military support. Tillerson said Washington remained committed to supporting the Lebanese army and internal security forces. When asked about the maritime border dispute with Israel, including Lebanese media reports that Washington had asked Beirut to give up a portion of sea it claims, Tillerson denied the reports. “We will continue to be very engaged with both parties. We’ve asked no one to give up anything, rather we are looking for a solution,” he said. “We are engaging the governments of both Lebanon and Israel to ensure Lebanon’s southern border remains calm.” Reporting by Yara Bayoumy and Lisa Barrington; Editing by Tom Perry, Angus McDowall and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-tillerson-lebanon/update-4-tillerson-says-hezbollah-role-is-a-threat-to-lebanon-idUKL8N1Q550Z,15 Feb 2018,"U.S. Secretary of State Rex

2018-02-15,"OSLO/WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Seadrill’s main owner, billionaire John Fredriksen, is close to a deal with unsecured bondholders and South Korean shipyards on a restructuring plan for the rig operator, sources familiar with the talks said on Thursday. The Norwegian company, which last year filed for bankruptcy protection in a U.S. court, has been working with creditors since last month on a restructuring plan to bring in more than $1 billion in fresh funding, allow it to maintain its fleet of rigs and pay creditors and staff. “The deal hasn’t been signed yet, but I’m very hopeful... Seadrill has been really pushing for the last 10 days to get the deal,” one of the sources, a bondholder who did not wish to be identified, said.  Seadrill was not immediately available to comment. The breakthrough in the talks came after Seadrill agreed on claims from Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) and Samsung Heavy Industries under Seadrill-guaranteed newbuild contracts for four drillships, the two sources familiar with the matter said. The South Korean companies had previously claimed a total of $1.7 billion in contingent liabilities.  A lawyer for Samsung declined to comment, while lawyers for Daewoo could not be reached. Once the world’s largest drilling rig operator by market value, Seadrill filed for bankruptcy protection in Texas on Sept. 12 after being hit hard by cutbacks in investment in the oil industry following a steep drop in crude prices. Under the deal being negotiated, bondholders, represented by New York law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP and Rothschild, will get a bigger stake in the restructured company than a previously offered 14.3 percent after dilution, both sources said, but did not give a figure. Unsecured claim holders would be offered rights to invest more than $250 million in new secured notes and equity, up from the original proposal of $110 million, they said. “This is a much better deal than was initially offered... We are very happy with the company’s efforts to have a pragmatic discussion with bondholders,” the bondholder said. Seadrill, whose clients include Petrobras, ExxonMobil, Total and Statoil, has more than 30 drilling rigs.  The company said last Friday that it would update the Texas court on Feb. 16 on ongoing talks with a group of unsecured bondholders and Barclays bank, who submitted rival proposals to the original restructuring plan proposed last September, which was backed by Fredriksen, Centerbridge Partners and a group of hedge funds. One of the two sources said the parties were just left to  agree on how to raise a final $19 million of the billion dollars of new capital. Bondholders and other general unsecured claim holders would get a better deal at the expense of Hemen - Fredriksen’s investment vehicle and Seadrill’s main shareholder - and some parties behind the original plan, but Fredriksen will remain principal stakeholder, one of the sources said.  Hemen had around a 24 percent stake before Seadrill filed for creditor protection.  The deal has to be approved by Seadrill’s more than 40 bank lenders, who hold about $5.7 billion in secured debt.     The banks agreed to extend maturities for about five years provided that Seadrill raises about a billion dollars in new capital, Seadrill said in September.  Seadrill expects to hold the plan’s confirmation hearing on March 26, and to exit bankruptcy in August, it said in September.

2018-02-15,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s president, Nicolas Maduro, said on Thursday the country’s oil output was up 250,000 barrels per day at the beginning of 2018. The socialist leader, who is up for re-election in April, also said that a process of bond renegotiation and restructuring was “impeccable.”     Venezuela is undergoing an economic crisis, with quadruple-digit inflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine. Crude production is at its lowest levels in many years.     The OPEC nation is also behind on more than $1.6 billion in payments across sovereign debt and that of state oil company PDVSA, Japanese bank Nomura said in a recent note to investors.     “The negotiation and restructuring processes of our international debt is impeccable, going better than I could have hoped which demonstrates it was the correct decision,” Maduro told reporters.     Oil accounts for some 95 percent of Venezuela’s export revenue.     Venezuela said oil output rose in January to 1.8 million bpd, according to OPEC. However, the oil cartel’s secondary sources reported the true figure was just 1.6 million bpd, its lowest monthly figure in more than a decade and a half.     Crude production fell 13 percent in 2018 from the previous year, according to OPEC.     It was the biggest decline among OPEC members, who have pledged to restrain output through 2018.     But unlike voluntary cuts by other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries intended to stoke higher crude prices, Venezuela has been unable to stop a six-year-long production decline.     While the government has vowed to stay current on its debt, it has also deferred payments into grace periods and beyond. It blames U.S. sanctions for delays.     Critics blame the crisis on strict currency and price controls and deep corruption at high levels in government.

2018-02-15,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo’s oil minister on Thursday defended the country’s right to explore for oil anywhere on its territory after media reports that President Joseph Kabila approved drilling in Africa’s largest tropical rainforest reserve. Oil minister Aime Ngoy Mukena declined to confirm a report in Germany’s Die Tageszeitung newspaper that Kabila had this month authorized exploration inside Salonga National Park, but he said that no land should be off-limits. Salonga, a UNESCO World Heritage site, covers 33,350 sq km of the Congo Basin, the world’s second-largest rainforest. It is home to rare species including bonobos, forest elephants, dwarf chimpanzees and Congo peacocks.  The park in central Congo’s Cuvette Centrale also sits on peatlands that scientists say could release massive quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmsophere if disturbed.         Ngoy Mukena said the government was mindful of environmental considerations but was intent on developing its hydrocarbons sector. “The law permits us to (explore) in any part of the country,” Ngoy Mukena told Reuters.  “When oil is found in a restricted area or in an area that belongs to UNESCO, the government stops and brings together ministers ... and experts to see what the danger would be.” A UNESCO spokesman did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its World Heritage Committee has previously said that oil and mining exploration should not be conducted within World Heritage sites. UNESCO and environmental groups opposed oil exploration by British company Soco International in eastern Congo’s Virunga National Park, another World Heritage site. The company let its license lapse in 2015 after performing seismic testing.   Congo, Africa’s leading copper producer, has long aimed to boost its oil sector and is believed to have sizeable reserves in the Cuvette Centrale and near its border with Uganda, but output has remained flat at about 25,000 barrels per day.

2018-02-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Shipping stocks may still be in the doldrums in the view of many investors, but hedge funds have bet at least $675 million on signs of renewed buoyancy in the industry. Hedge funds made initial forays into shipping stocks in the third quarter of 2017, but significantly stepped up their bets in the final three months of the year, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings compiled by Symmetric show. “Shipping has been in a terrible trough for a number of years,” Chris Walvoord, global head of hedge fund research at investment consultant Aon Hewitt, said. “Hedge funds are starting to see opportunity ... and are calling the bottom on these companies and there are at least a couple out there getting into this space.” The move by hedge funds comes as signs of a fragile recovery in segments of the global industry are appearing, after a near-decade long slump caused in part by a glut of ships ordered. “You’re looking, over the next two years, for these stocks (in shipping) to rise 50 to 100 percent,” said William Homan-Russell, head of shipping at $1.5 billion hedge fund and shipping investor Tufton Oceanic (SHIP.L).  “When adjusting for our estimated shipyard costs, share prices are at the lowest prices they’ve been since 1999.” Dry bulk shipping - one of the hardest hit parts of the industry - is expected to see better prospects as fleet growth slows and an expected pick up in demand for commodities such as coal, iron ore and grains bolster employment for bulker vessels. By contrast, oil tankers are likely to see tougher times for now with weak freight rates hitting bottom lines of operators.  Hedge fund ownership of Nordic American Tanker (NAT.N), which ships oil, for example, rose to 27 percent at year-end, from 2.4 percent at end-September, according to the data from Symmetric, which tracks investment funds. Data for earlier periods was not immediately available.  And ownership by hedge funds of Dryships Inc (DRYS.O), which is active in dry bulk, tanker and offshore shipping markets, meanwhile, rose to 80 percent, from 10.3 percent.  Hedge funds had invested $308 million (218.97 million pounds) in Kirby Corp (KEX.N), $26 million in Nordic American Tanker and $9 million in Dryships. Dry bulk firm Golden Ocean (GOGL.O) and oil transporter Teekay Tankers (TNK.N) were also popular as well as Ship Finance International (SFL.N), which has a diversified fleet, the data showed.    Funds had also invested $35 million to their holdings of Golden Ocean and $77 million in Ship Finance International. Greywolf Capital Management, which initially invested in Tanker Investment before it merged with Teekay Tankers, is now among the hedge funds holding a combined $39 million in Teekay stock, and is bullish for the sector’s prospects. “We’re starting to see fundamental improvement in many shipping markets with rates moving up, not because of temporary events, but rather as a result of a true balancing of supply and demand,” a spokesman for Greywolf said.  “With global growth accelerating, this an industry we continue to focus on and that should deliver highly attractive returns in the coming years.” A spokesman for Blue Mountain declined to comment. Some hedge funds have started moving into liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker stocks, investing $4 million in Dynagas LNG Partners (DLNG.N), and $62 million in Golar LNG Partners (GMLP.O) after pulling back from the sector in the preceding three months.  Although other investors pulled back from LNG stocks, a pick up in transport demand has helped the outlook for vessel owners in the LNG sector.    editing by Alexander Smith",https://uk.reuters.com/article/shipping-hedgefunds/update-1-hedge-funds-hook-shipping-stocks-grappling-for-recovery-idUKL8N1Q56M0,15 Feb 2018,"* Nordic American Tanker and Dryships Inc among popular

Schulman Inc for $1.24 billion, doubling the size of its plastics business and moving into the packaging, electronics and building markets. LyondellBasell’s plastics business currently gets about 90 percent of its revenue from the automotive industry and the all-cash deal will lower that proportion to just over 50 percent, the company said. The rest of the revenue will come from plastic compounds – blending molten plastic with additives – used to make products such as headphones, mobile chargers, PVC pipes, water bottles and food containers among others. The plastics compounding industry has grown faster-than-expected over the past decade, with improving margins, while not requiring much capital, analysts and company executives said. Shares of A. Schulman surged 11 percent to $42.93 in morning trading, compared with the offer price of $42 per share. LyondellBasell’s shares fell 2 percent to $109.65. The deal will also marginally boost LyondellBasell’s exposure to the agricultural sector, which has been the focus of recent mega-deals among chemicals makers. Dow Chemical and DuPont completed their $130 billion merger last year to form DowDuPont, while ChemChina bought Swiss seeds group Syngenta for $43 billion. A combined LyondellBasell-A. Schulman had $4.6 billion in revenue and EBITDA margins of 9.5 percent over the last 12 months, with a majority of revenue coming from A. Schulman and the bigger margin boost from LyondellBasell, the companies said. The combined company is expected to hit $150 million in run-rate cost savings within two years. The deal will add to earnings within the first full year after closing, expected in the second half of 2018, LyondellBasell said. A. Schulman shareholders will also get one contingent value right per share that will allow them to get certain net proceeds recovered, if any, from ongoing litigation and government probes related to Schulman’s Citadel and Lucent acquisitions. Including A. Schulman’s existing debt, the deal is valued at $2.25 billion, the companies said. J.P. Morgan and Dyal Co are LyondellBasell’s financial advisers and Citigroup is advising A. Schulman.

2018-02-15,"(Adds details on Zerpa, PDVSA, replacement) By Alexandra Ulmer CARACAS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela state oil company PDVSA has removed Chief Financial Officer Simon Zerpa, who was sanctioned by the United States last year, a personnel move that could facilitate crude exports and bond renegotiations. Venezuela’s official gazette on Thursday said Zerpa was replaced by Iliana Ruzza, who has worked at the state economic development bank Bandes as well as PDVSA. Zerpa, a close ally of leftist President Nicolas Maduro, remains Economy and Finance Minister. The sanctions on Zerpa had led to some oil exports to the United States being blocked as banks and investment funds refused to provide letters of credit to potential buyers, three financial sources told Reuters last year. Two additional financial sources said having Zerpa as the company’s head of finance made it impossible for U.S. entities to assist PDVSA in debt refinancing. The sanctions have added to a glum outlook for the OPEC nation’s oil industry, which is already producing at near 30-year lows due to under-investment, a brain drain, and crime. A source close to PDVSA said Ruzza, a relative unknown, was Zerpa’s protegee. Zerpa, who is in his mid-thirties, rose to prominence by leading the bilateral Venezuela-China fund through which Caracas borrows from Beijing and repays loans in oil and fuel. Venezuela has borrowed over $60 billion from China, earning the young executive the nickname “Zerpa the Chinese.” PDVSA did not respond to a request for information about the change.

2018-02-15,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) drive to improve accountability has made zero progress in the view of a large number of its workers in Germany, the carmaker’s top labor representative said. Almost two thirds of staff see “no improvement” in Volkswagen’s (VW) corporate culture almost two and a half years after the diesel emissions fraud was revealed, works council chief Bernd Osterloh said on Thursday, citing results of a labor survey of more than 51,000 workers carried out in December at German plants. The attempt by Europe’s largest automaker to become more transparent and improve troubleshooting is seen by investors as a key part of VW’s ability to regain trust and avoid any future scandals. There is also the potential for VW employee discontent with management to prompt labor leaders to adopt a tougher stance in dealings with top executives.  “Culture change for us remains a permanent work site,” Osterloh said on Thursday in comments released on VW’s internal communications network. Group human resources boss Karlheinz Blessing, commissioned to lead the change in culture at Wolfsburg-based VW, said the transformation needs more broadbased support to succeed. “We have been saying all along that a culture change cannot be implemented over the short term and takes time and is also not the work of an individual or of individual participants,” he said in a separate interview published internally at VW.  “All stakeholders are urged to bring about this culture change.” Separately, Osterloh, who is seeking re-election as works council chairman next month, said that workers were critical of internal communication by management and expressed concerns about job safety and retirement conditions. Given the continued negative news flow about VW with the latest revelations of VW-sponsored diesel fume tests involving monkeys and humans and prosecutors’ raids on luxury brand Audi, it’s no surprise that sentiment among staff is declining, Blessing said.   “With the negative headlines that keep surprising us, it would be remarkable if sentiment was not affected,” he said. “We can only apologize to staff for what they have to put up with, even though we are not the originator of these headlines.” Reporting by Andreas Cremer and Jan Schwartz; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-emissions-labour/vws-german-staff-unconvinced-of-culture-change-labour-chief-idUKL8N1Q55QO,15 Feb 2018,"Volkswagen's drive to

2018-02-15,"WASHINGTON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s nominee for a top State Department energy position said on Thursday he would oppose Russia’s proposed natural gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany - the Nord Stream 2. “The United States’ position, it is my understanding, is to strongly oppose that pipeline,” Francis Fannon, who has been nominated Assistant Secretary of State for Energy Resources, said during his U.S. Senate confirmation hearing. Fannon said he would “continue to advance alternate ways” to decrease Europe’s need for Russian energy. As the Trump administration looks to energy exports as a way to strengthen the United States’ international influence, the United States sees the planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Russia and Germany as a threat to Europe’s energy security. Poland, Ukraine and Baltic states fear the pipeline would increase Europe’s dependence on Russian gas and provide the Kremlin billions of dollars of revenue to finance a further military build-up on Europe’s borders. But Germany and Austria have focused on the commercial benefits of having more cheap gas, arguing there could be little harm from an additional pipe.

2018-02-15,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African stocks index rose as much as 5 percent on Thursday, putting the main index on track for its biggest one-day gain in more than three years, on hopes the resignation of Jacob Zuma as president paves the way for new leaders to quicken the pace of economic growth. The currency remained on the frontfoot, soaring to its firmest since early 2015 in the wake of Zuma’s exit. Analysts have however warned the rally faces serious obstacles ahead of a budget speech next Wednesday.   Zuma quit late on Wednesday, reluctantly heeding orders by the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to bring an end to a nine-year tenure punctuated by scandals, stagnant economic growth and policy uncertainty. As of 1530 GMT, the blue chip Top-40 index .JTOPI surged 4 percent to 52,665 points, pulling back from a high of 53,072 achieved earlier but still on course for its biggest one-day gain since September 2015. The broader All-share index .JALSH was up 3.72 percent at 59,533 points. “The big news is that Zuma has now resigned and that has created a lot of euphoria ... South African incorporated, banks, retailers and the like are all looking sharply better as a result,” said Independent Securities’ trader Ryan Woods. South African banks, considered the barometer of both economic and political sentiment, were a feature on the gainers’ list. The banking index .JBANK surged 5.8 percent with Nedbank (NEDJ.J) rising 5.37 percent and rival FirstRand (FSRJ.J) up 6.4 percent.  Banks have largely borne the brunt of Zuma’s policy decisions that included the sacking of two respected finance ministers, Nhlanhla Nene and Pravin Gordhan. That, along with a weak economy, contributed to sovereign credit ratings downgrades to junk by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch.  In reaction to Zuma’s resignation, ratings agency Moody’s said it was focused on the new leadership’s response to economic challenges. S&P Global Ratings said the leadership change would not immediately affect the credit status. Cyril Ramaphosa, former chairman of African biggest telecoms operator MTN Group (MTNJ.J), was sworn in as president on Thursday.   Ramaphosa, who has vowed to fight corruption and revitalise the economy, is seen by business leaders and investors as well placed to turn around the economy. South Africa’s GDP is estimated to grow by less than 1 percent this year. Another key issue facing the 65-year-old is policy uncertainty in South Africa’s mining industry, an important economic engine which has been fighting in court with Zuma’s mines minister, Mosebenzi Zwane, over an increase in black ownership targets. But some analysts said that the former union leader’s to-do list is way too long to make an immediate impact. In the foreign exchange market the rand advanced to levels last seen in February 2015. “The good gains the rand has made could be extended toward 11.55/dollar, and move toward 11.00/dollar baring any further credit rating downgrades for S.A. and a credit positive budget,” said Investec’s chief analyst Annabel Bishop in a note.  At 1515 GMT, the rand ZAR=D3 was at 11.6600 against the dollar, having reached a session-best of 11.6025 earlier percent stronger than its New York overnight close and at levels last seen in February 2015. “The economy is coming off an extremely low base so there is good chance the optimism will be around for some time, but Ramaphosa has to very soon move from the honeymoon phase to the doing phase,” said chief executive of Canon Assets Management Adrian Saville.

2018-02-15,"(Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Encana Corp (ECA.TO) (ECA.N) posted a better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Thursday and said production rose 4 percent. Calgary, Alberta-based Encana, which produces gas and light oil, has benefited from whittling down its operations to focus on its four core North American assets: acreage in Montney and Duvernay in Western Canada and assets in the prolific Eagle Ford and Permian shale fields in Texas. Production from core assets jumped 32 percent to 313,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). The company said on Thursday total quarterly production increased to 335,200 boe/d, from 321,500 boe/d a year earlier. It realized $52.94 per barrel of oil production, compared with $50.78 a year ago. The company also announced a buyback of up to $400 million worth in shares. “We have further demonstrated our confidence in our five-year plan and our commitment to shareholder returns with the announcement of our share repurchase program which we plan to fund with cash on hand,” Chief Executive Officer Doug Suttles said in a statement. The company’s net loss narrowed to $229 million - and reflected a non-cash deferred tax charge primarily due to a fall in tax rates in 2017 related to the U.S. tax reform - from $281 million, a year earlier. Encana expects to spend between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in 2018, up from $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion it had forecast for 2017. Last month the company said it plans to invest nearly 70 percent of this budget to boost production in Permian and Montney, as oil investors pressure producers to improve production without significantly increasing capital budgets. Encana said it expects production for 2018 to be between 360,000 boe/d and 380,000 boe/d. Total production in 2017 was 313,200 boe/d. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 12 cents per share in the fourth quarter, above analysts’ average estimate of 10 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-02-15,"* Europe’s main bourse jump as much as 1 percent * MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 1.3 pct, Nikkei gains 1.5 pct * Dollar remains on defensive, hits 15-month low vs yen * Crude oil, gold supported by dollar weakness By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Stocks and commodities steamed higher on Thursday, suddenly shrugging off the angst that has burst out in recent weeks over higher global borrowing costs on the back of rising inflation. Economists were struggling to explain the shift except for the argument that historically it’s not unusual for stocks and bond market borrowing costs to rise in tandem with a rapidly expanding economy. Some just blamed the weather and time of year. They speculated that Wednesday’s strong U.S. inflation data that many had predicted could reignite the rout was probably distorted while Asian bears may be squaring up positions for Chinese new year. Whatever the reason though, the animal spirits were back for riskier assets like stocks. Big gains for Wall Street and Asia overnight put MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index back in positive territory for the year and Europe’s main markets followed with 0.6 - 1 percent gains. “For me it’s a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam. “The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,” he added. “2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that’s still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.” Wall Street futures were also pointing higher but just as big a puzzle as the sudden rebound in stocks sentiment was the break down in correlation between rising U.S. bond yields and dollar. U.S. Treasury yields on benchmark 10-year notes hit a fresh four-year high of 2.94 percent which also dragged gap to 0.786 percent German Bunds out to its widest in 10 months. The dollar tumbled though across the board, including to a 15-month low against the yen of 106.18 yen as worries about the U.S. government’s finances seemed to set again after a White House-led spending splurge and recent corporate tax cuts. That also marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen, while the euro and pound both climbed back above the $1.25 and $1.40 thresholds. “The story I hear most frequently from people is it’s the re-emergence of the twin deficits,” said RBC Capital Markets head of currency strategy Adam Cole, in London, of the dollar’s persistent weakness. “There seem to be concerns on the U.S. fiscal position and what that implies for the current account.” Asia’s stocks rally overnight saw Australian shares climb 1.15 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shrugged off the normal drag of a stronger yen to advanc 1.5 percent following three successive down day that had taken it to a four-month low. Volatility shrivelled back too. The VIX index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” and a measure of market volatility - fell all the way back to 18, less than half the 50-point peak touched last week. The dollar’s weakness also lifted emerging markets and commodities though there were a number of idiosyncratic stories in play too. After weeks of frenzied speculation, the resignation of South Africa’s President Jacob Zuma sent the rand to a 2-1/2-year high of 11.66 and put the country’s stock market on course for its best day in three years. In reaction to Zuma’s resignation, Moody’s, which is about to make a decision on whether to remove the country last investment grade credit rating, said it was focused on the new leadership’s response to low growth and implementing reforms. Brent crude futures shot up over 1 percent meanwhile to $65.06 per barrel before losing momentum and trudging back to $63.87. While the greenback’s woes were a big factor, the moves came after a surge the previous day triggered by supply data and comments from Saudi Arabia that major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early. Metals copper and gold both shone too. Gold rose to a 10-day top of $1,357 per ounce, while copper - seen as a sensitive indicator of the health of the global economy - was on track for a weekly gain of more than 6 percent.

2018-02-15,"* Saudi Investment Bank surges after raising dividend * Mobily continues falling after wider Q4 loss * Much of Gulf dampened by mediocre earnings * Real estate firms soft in Dubai * Abu Dhabi’s Aldar Properties slides after annual earnings drop By Andrew Torchia DUBAI, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s stock market rose on Thursday, encouraged by strong global bourses and a slight rebound in oil prices, while hopes for an interest rate cut boosted Egypt. But much of the Gulf was sluggish because of mediocre corporate earnings. The Saudi index gained 1.2 percent in a broad rally; gainers outnumbered losers by 140 to 39. Al Rajhi Bank added 2.9 percent in its second heaviest trading volume this year. Saudi Investment Bank rose 2.9 percent after saying it would pay an annual dividend of 0.6 riyal per share, up from 0.5 riyal for 2016. But telecommunications firm Mobily, which had plunged 7.1 percent on Wednesday after reporting its fourth-quarter net loss more than doubled, dropped a further 2.3 percent. In Dubai, the index edged down 0.2 percent as DAMAC Properties, which on Wednesday revealed a 47 percent drop in fourth-quarter net profit, lost 1.2 percent. The biggest real estate firm, Emaar Properties, slipped 0.3 percent after it reported a 16 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit to 1.36 billion dirhams ($370.3 million), below SICO Bahrain’s forecast of 1.61 billion dirhams. Union Properties edged down 0.1 percent after reporting an annual loss of 2.38 billion dirhams ($649 million) against a year-ago profit of 211.4 ‍​million dirhams; the figures implied a fourth-quarter loss of roughly 90 million dirhams. In Abu Dhabi, the index slipped 0.3 percent as telecommunications firm Etisalat fell 0.6 percent. It posted a 12 percent fall in quarterly profit to 1.97 billion dirhams, while SICO Bahrain had forecast 2.21 billion dirhams. Aldar Properties dropped 3.1 percent after reporting a 28 percent decline in full-year profit attributable to owners, partly because of a one-time charge of 495 million dirhams. The company raised its annual dividend to 12 fils per share from 11 fils in 2016. Qatar’s index fell 0.4 percent as Mesaieed Petrochemical lost 1.4 percent, despite reporting a slight rise in annual profit and a hike in its dividend to 0.7 riyal per share from 0.6 riyal. In Egypt, the index rose 1.1 percent as real estate developer SODIC surged 7.0 percent.

2018-02-15,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s new government will re-assess the previous government’s decision to end a $2 billion (£1.4 billion) Eurofighter jet programme early, the defence minister said, signalling willingness for talks amid a legal battle with the manufacturers. However, Austria will not consider a new deal with the Eurofighter consortium, which includes Airbus , Britain’s BAE Systems and Italy’s Leonardo before compensation for damages has been paid, the republic’s chief lawyer said. Defence Minister Mario Kunasek’s Social Democratic predecessor Hans Peter Doskozil started an unprecedented legal battle with Airbus and the consortium a year ago, accusing them of fraud and wilful deception in connection with a $2 billion 2003 Eurofighter order. Austrian investigators started a legal probe of the consortium and individuals including Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders based on the ministry’s allegations soon afterwards.  Airbus and the consortium deny the Austrian allegations. However, Airbus agreed to pay $99 million to settle a German investigation into alleged corruption surrounding the Austrian purchase earlier this month. Austria initially ordered 18 Eurofighter jets but reduced the order to 15 in 2007. Last July, Doskozil said Austria planned to end its Eurofighter programme early and replace it with a cheaper alternative fleet of aircraft bought or leased from another government. The defence ministry said then that Austria’s 15 Eurofighter jets could be phased out from 2020. The continued use of the planes for 30 years - the normal life span of such jets - would cost up to 5 billion euros ($6.24 billion), largely for maintenance. Kunasek, a member of the far-right Freedom Party, presented a new commission that will examine options for Austria’s air defence.  He said it will take into account the findings of a task force set up by Doskozil, but that he does not feel bound by Doskozil’s decision to end the Eurofighter programme early.  “Today, new information is available which requires a reassessment,” Kunasek said at a news conference in Vienna. The defence ministry said the Eurofighter consortium had offered to update the current jets and renegotiate operating costs since the former minister’s task force ended its work. It said it had also received new price information for Swedish and American jets, which will be taken into account. Asked about the possibility of a new deal with the Eurofighter consortium, Austria’s chief lawyer Wolfgang Peschorn said: “There will be no new procurement before compensation has been made.”  Airbus CEO Enders said on Thursday that further Eurofighter orders, both from new export customers and repeat orders by launch customers, could be on the cards soon. Britain submitted its final offer of Eurofighter Typhoon jets to Belgium on Wednesday, in a proposal which includes 34 planes and support services. Last December, Germany signalled readyness to buy the Eurofighter.

Hedge funds made initial forays into shipping stocks in the third quarter of 2017, but significantly stepped up their bets in the final three months of the year, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings compiled by Symmetric show. “Shipping has been in a terrible trough for a number of years,” Chris Walvoord, global head of hedge fund research at investment consultant Aon Hewitt, said. “Hedge funds are starting to see opportunity ... and are calling the bottom on these companies and there are at least a couple out there getting into this space.” The move by hedge funds comes as signs of a fragile recovery in segments of the global industry are appearing, after a near-decade long slump caused in part by a glut of ships ordered. “You’re looking, over the next two years, for these stocks (in shipping) to rise 50 to 100 percent,” said William Homan-Russell, head of shipping at $1.5 billion hedge fund and shipping investor Tufton Oceanic. “When adjusting for our estimated shipyard costs, share prices are at the lowest prices they’ve been since 1999.” Dry bulk shipping - one of the hardest hit parts of the industry - is expected to see better prospects as fleet growth slows and an expected pick up in demand for commodities such as coal, iron ore and grains bolster employment for bulker vessels. By contrast, oil tankers are likely to see tougher times for now with weak freight rates hitting bottom lines of operators. Hedge fund ownership of Nordic American Tanker, which ships oil, for example, rose to 27 percent at year-end, from 2.4 percent at end-September, according to the data from Symmetric, which tracks investment funds. Data for earlier periods was not immediately available. And ownership by hedge funds of Dryships Inc, which is active in dry bulk, tanker and offshore shipping markets, meanwhile, rose to 80 percent, from 10.3 percent. Hedge funds had invested $308 million in Kirby Corp, $26 million in Nordic American Tanker and $9 million in Dryships. Dry bulk firm Golden Ocean and oil transporter Teekay Tankers were also popular as well as Ship Finance International, which has a diversified fleet, the data showed. Funds had also invested $35 million to their holdings of Golden Ocean and $77 million in Ship Finance International. Blue Mountain Capital Management and Greywolf Capital Management were among the hedge funds to invest $39 million in Teekay Tankers. A spokesman for Blue Mountain declined to comment, while Greywolf could not immediately be reached. Some hedge funds have started moving into liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker stocks, investing $4 million in Dynagas LNG Partners, and $62 million in Golar LNG Partners after pulling back from the sector in the preceding three months. Although other investors pulled back from LNG stocks, a pick up in transport demand has helped the outlook for vessel owners in the LNG sector.

2018-02-15,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 15 (Reuters) - China’s new crude futures contract faces a mountain of obstacles to overcome if it is to establish itself as a viable benchmark for trading with the world’s largest oil importer. The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which is part of the Shanghai Futures Exchange, said on Feb. 9 it would launch the much-delayed contract on March 26. In theory, this will give China a powerful tool to shake up global crude trading by offering pricing and hedging in the heart of the world’s biggest market for imported crude. The reality is likely to be somewhat different, with potential market participants likely to be cautious until they see how the various dynamics play out. Some of the issues that will need to be addressed are: * How liquid will the contract be, given the limited number of potential buyers for physical delivery at the bonded storages in China? * How much government intervention is likely, given Beijing’s penchant for adjusting rules and regulations to influence pricing if the market moves in a direction deemed undesirable? * Will foreign-based traders be happy to work in a yuan-denominated contract, with the associated currency risk and convertibility issues? * Will trade in the new contract be dominated by the state-owned Chinese majors to the exclusion of opportunities for others? * Given the contract is deliverable in China, how will the inclusion of freight costs affect trading? But perhaps the biggest challenge face the INE contract is the fact that it is effectively based in a demand centre, rather than a production centre, as are the other major oil futures. The three main existing benchmarks, Brent, West Texas Intermediate and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s (DME) Oman, are based in production centres and the delivery points are close to where the oil is actually pumped. It’s actually difficult to find futures in the commodity world that are based in a demand centre, with most successful contracts being set up near points of supply, a system that has allowed producers, traders and consumers to hedge risks and discover prices. The INE contract will be pioneering a different type of future, with the specifications showing that each contract will be for a volume of 1,000 barrels, and the deliverable crudes being a mix of tradable Middle Eastern medium-sour grades, as well as Shengli, a domestic crude. The INE has approved six bonded storage sites at eight locations in China, with a total usable capacity of 19.8 million barrels. It appears that the contract has been well-designed and there is little to fault from a technical perspective, but this alone is unlikely to be enough to guarantee success. The 1,000-barrel per lot and the minimum transaction margin of 5 percent of contract value are probably large enough to deter day traders and small-scale speculators. However, this is a double-edged sword as it will limit liquidity and volatility, two things that can be attractive to traders. Some of China’s most successful commodity futures contracts, such as iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, are dominated by day traders, with the volumes they bring helping establish the derivatives as important regional price indicators. Overcoming the trust deficit between foreign market participants and the Chinese authorities also looms large, and it’s likely that many potential players will be keen for the INE to establish a track record before they become involved. Another risk for the new contract is that the Chinese authorities want it to succeed so much that they effectively force state-owned majors, and even smaller independent Chinese refiners, to use the INE. This could well boost volumes and give the contract the semblance of success, but it would be artificial and thus probably not as effective as it could be as a hedging tool. There is little doubt that China is seeking to play a bigger role in global crude trading, a reasonable ambition given it has overtaken the United States as the world’s biggest buyer. However, establishing a new price benchmark is extremely difficult, as the DME can tell you from their experience in trying to build the Oman futures as the main Middle East marker, despite it being a contract with arguably better technical specifications than both Brent and WTI. The INE deserves a shot at success, and ultimately it makes far more sense to have a price benchmark for Asia based in the region’s top consumer, rather than using contracts that reflect a few small fields in the North Sea or storage tanks in Oklahoma.

2018-02-15,"MADRID/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The world’s No. 2 maker of wind turbines, Siemens Gamesa (SGREN.MC), flagged 2 billion euros (1.78 billion pounds) in cost cuts by 2020, hoping to close a margin gap with bigger rival Vestas (VWS.CO). Wind turbine manufacturers are facing relentless pricing pressure globally, as governments slash subsidies for renewables to force them into competition with conventional energy sources, including coal and gas. Siemens Gamesa, the result of a merger between Siemens’ (SIEGn.DE) wind power business and Spain’s Gamesa completed last year, is betting on size and a more focused product portfolio to weather the crisis. It increased its estimate of synergies due to the merger on Thursday to more than 400 million euros by 2020, from 230 million by 2019, given when the merger was announced in 2016. “Scale is the matter of importance in that market,” Chief Executive Markus Tacke told journalists on Thursday after presenting the company’s three-year plan. “We are in a competitive industry.” Under the plan, the company set a target to increase its EBIT margin to 8-10 percent by 2020, helped by the cost savings, from 7-8 percent expected this year. Denmark’s Vestas unveiled its own ambitious outlook last week, forecasting an EBIT margin of 9-11 percent in 2018, with a mid-term target of 10 percent. Shares in Siemens Gamesa, in which Siemens has a 59 percent stake, were up 2.4 percent after the announcement, which also included reaching a dividend payout of 25 percent of net income by 2020. The company said restructuring efforts, including up to 6,000 job cuts already announced, as well as fine tuning of its product portfolio and procurement would also form the backbone of the cost cuts. The company also announced in November that it would only use more expensive direct-drive turbines in offshore wind projects, where Siemens Gamesa is the market leader, and use cheaper geared turbines in onshore. “We welcome the platform rationalisation based on the legacy Gamesa onshore technology, the improved synergy target,” analysts at Barclays said in a note. Siemens Gamesa, in which Spanish utility Iberdrola (IBE.MC) holds a 8.07 percent stake, had an order backlog of 21.3 billion euros at the end of December, with offshore accounting for more than a third.

Economists were struggling to explain the turnaround except for the argument that historically it’s not unusual for stocks and bond market borrowing costs to rise in tandem with a rapidly expanding economy. Some just blamed the weather and time of year. They speculated that strong U.S. inflation data on Wednesday that many had predicted could reignite the rout was probably distorted. They also said the looming Chinese New Year may have caused Asian traders to square up. Whatever the reason, the animal spirits were back. Big gains for Wall Street and Asia overnight put MSCI’s 47-country world stocks index back in positive territory for the year and Europe’s main markets followed with 0.6 - 1 percent gains. “For me it’s a clear indication that inflation is not as big a threat as people made it out to be over the past couple of weeks,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam. “The trend behind the market is still very strongly pointed upwards,” he added. “2017 was a very momentum-driven market, and if that’s still the case, which after yesterday it appears to be, then we will probably see new highs before too long.” Just as big a puzzle as the rebound in stocks sentiment was the break down in correlation between rising U.S. bond yields and dollar. U.S. Treasury yields on benchmark 10-year notes hit a fresh four-year high of 2.94 percent which also dragged gap to 0.786 percent German Bunds <DE10YT=TWEB to its widest in 10 months. The dollar tumbled though across the board, including to a 15-month low against the yen of 106.18 yen as worries about the U.S. government’s finances seemed to set again after a White House-led spending splurge and recent corporate tax cuts. That also marked a drop of 3.8 percent from its early February peak near 110.50 yen, while the euro and pound both climbed back above the $1.25 and $1.40 thresholds. “The story I hear most frequently from people is it’s the re-emergence of the twin deficits,” said RBC Capital Markets head of currency strategy Adam Cole, in London, of the dollar’s persistent weakness. “There seem to be concerns on the U.S. fiscal position and what that implies for the current account.” Asia’s stocks rally overnight saw Australian shares climb 1.15 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1.5 percent following three successive sessions of losses that took it to a four-month low the previous day. Volatility shrank back rapidly too. The VIX index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” and a measure of market volatility - fell all the way back to 18, less than half the 50-point peak touched last week. The dollar’s weakness also lifted emerging markets and commodities though there were idiosyncratic stories in play too. The South African rand traded at 11.73 per dollar and near a 2-1/2-year high of 11.66 set overnight after the country’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it would proceed with a vote to remove President Jacob Zuma from office. Brent crude futures shot up over 1 percent meanwhile to $65.06 per barrel before losing some of its momentum. While the greenback was a big factor as oil is priced in it, the gains also came after a surge the previous day triggered by supply data and comments for Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister that major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early. Gold shone too as it rose to a 10-day top of $7,195 per ounce and on track for a weekly gain of more than 6 percent.

2018-02-15,"(Corrects headline to say oil rises by 1 percent, not falls; no change to text) * Saudi Arabia says is committed to cut throughout 2018 * Storage tanks around Singapore have depleted noticeably * Weak dollar potentially spurs fuel demand * But U.S. crude inventories rise as production hits fresh record By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by around 1 percent on Thursday to extend gains from the previous session, lifted by a weak dollar and Saudi comments that it would rather see an undersupplied market than end a deal with OPEC and Russia to withhold production. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 83 cents, or 1.4 percent, from their last settlement at $61.43 a barrel at 0744 GMT, adding to a 2.4-percent gain from the day before. Brent crude futures were at $64.99 per barrel, up 63 cents, or 1 percent, extending Wednesday’s 2.6-percent climb. Prices rose on the back of ongoing weakness in the U.S. dollar, which on Thursday hit a 15-month low against Japan’s yen . A weaker greenback potentially stokes consumption of dollar-denominated commodities as it makes fuel and raw materials cheaper for countries using other currencies. “On commodity markets, everyone loves a lower U.S. dollar,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. More fundamentally, oil markets got a push from comments by Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), voicing support for output cuts backed by OPEC and other producers including Russia since 2017 in an effort to tighten the market and prop up prices. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday. “I think we are going to be sticking with our policy (to withhold production) throughout 2018.” Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said “the Saudi signal is reasonably convincing, suggesting OPEC and their partners are committed to maintaining an absolute floor on oil prices”. The OPEC-led effort to tighten markets is showing results. In Asia, the world’s biggest and fastest growing oil consumer region, storage tanks around Singapore’s trading hub have depleted significantly over the past half-year. However, threatening to undermine the OPEC-led effort to tighten markets is soaring production in the United States, which is not participating in the pact to cut. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA rose to a record 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), more than top exporter Saudi Arabia pumps and within reach of No.1 producer Russia. Consequently, U.S. crude inventories climbed by 1.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9, to 422.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. “Although we remain positive on crude oil prices until year-end, an interim correction into 1Q18 cannot be ruled out,” said Barnabas Gan, economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore.

2018-02-15,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Just over a year into production cuts lead by OPEC and Russia, oil markets in Asia have tightened noticeably as significant amounts of excess crude have been taken off tankers used for storage and delivered to customers across the region. Shipping data shows about 15 super-tankers are currently filled with oil floating off the coasts of Singapore and surrounding Malaysia, Asia’s main trading and storage hub for crude coming from the Middle East to Asia. That’s slightly less than last November, and half the number of tankers used for storage in mid-2017. Traders say onshore tanks in the region, including at Vopak’s site in Johor, Malaysia, are also not booked out any more, marking a turnaround from 2016/17 when a situation known as tank-top was feared in which oil markets are so bloated that they run out of storage. The fall in storage is a sign production restraint started by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies including Russia in January 2017 is having the intended effect of reducing a global glut.  The main impact of OPEC withholding supplies has been to change the structure of the oil price curve. During oversupply, crude prices for immediate delivery tend to be lower than those for later dispatch, a market structure known as contango that gives traders an incentive to store oil for later sale. With markets now tighter, spot prices are more expensive than those for later delivery, removing the incentive. “Most of the contango stocks afloat are sold,” said Oystein Berentsen, director for crude trading at Strong Petroleum in Singapore. The oil price curve shows spot prices to be almost $4 per barrel above those for delivery this time next year. “Floating storage is no longer economical,” Berentsen said. What’s more, shipping data shows the majority of tankers storing oil around Singapore are only part full. In 2016/17, by contrast, the armada of tankers was filled to the rims. The main factors that could flip oil markets back into oversupply are an end to OPEC’s and Russia’s production restraint and soaring U.S. output. But Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de-facto leader, says it is committed to withholding production. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday. U.S. output, however, is rising fast and its exports are increasingly appearing in Asia. U.S. crude production hit a fresh record of 10.27 million barrels per day this month, more than top exporter Saudi Arabia pumps, and within reach of top producer Russia. The International Energy Agency warned this week that supplies may start overtaking demand growth again later this year.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to also open higher, with Britain’s FTSE seen rising 0.5 percent, Germany’s DAX gaining 1 percent and France’s CAC advancing 0.8 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.3 percent. Australian stocks climbed 1.15 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1.5 percent following three successive days of losses that took it to a four-month low the previous day. U.S. shares surged on Wednesday, with the Dow up 1 percent and the S&P 500 climbing 1.34 percent, as investors shrugged off the stronger-than-expected inflation data and snapped up shares of Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple . S&P mini futures rose 0.4 percent on Thursday. The VIX index - Wall Street’s “fear gauge” and a measure of market volatility - has declined below 20, less than half the 50-point peak touched last week. U.S. consumer prices rose slightly more than forecast in January as Americans paid more for gasoline, rental accommodation and healthcare, further raising inflation concerns and worries that the Federal Reserve may hike interest rates more than earlier expected. That drove U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities higher, with those on benchmark 10-year notes hitting a four-year high of 2.928 percent. Other data on Wednesday showed U.S. retail sales fell 0.3 percent in January to mark the biggest decline in 11 months. This was well below forecasts for an increase of 0.2 percent, suggesting slower growth could accompany higher inflation. “The combination of stellar U.S. CPI and weak retail sales data leaves investors in a precarious situation,” wrote strategists at CitiFX. “Strong price data presents hawkish risks for the Fed’s dots at the March meeting. Three dots have been the baseline and now four seems a greater risk. Meanwhile, retail sales results have caused a downgrade of GDP estimates across the Street.” Dot plots represent Fed officials’ expectations for interest rate hikes. The dollar index against a basket of currencies slipped 0.3 percent to 88.879 after losing more than 0.6 percent overnight despite the strong inflation number. The recovery in broader risk sentiment was seen weighing on the dollar, which had gained during the market turmoil earlier in the month. The U.S. currency has been weighed down by a variety of factors this year, including concerns that Washington might pursue a weak dollar strategy and the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries start to scale back their easier monetary policy. Concerns about the growing U.S. fiscal deficit have also intensified. The dollar stretched overnight losses against the Japanese yen to touch a 15-month low of 106.300, having declined more than 2 percent so far this week, causing the Nikkei to underperform its global peers. “Japanese stocks could act as drag to their regional counterparts if the stronger yen hampers its performance. In that respect the strong yen could be seen as a factor preventing the stabilisation in global markets,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. The euro extended gains to reach a 10-day high of $1.2473 after surging 0.8 percent the previous day. The South African rand traded at 11.73 per dollar and near a 2-1/2-year high of 11.66 set overnight after the country’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it would proceed with a vote to remove President Jacob Zuma from office. The Australian dollar added to the previous day’s rally and reached a 10-day top of $0.7946. In commodities, Brent crude futures were up 1.1 percent at $65.06 per barrel after prices surged the previous day as U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early. Crude also benefited from the dollar’s weakness. Oil tends to move inversely to the dollar, and has also of late been trading in tandem with stocks. Spot gold rose to a 10-day top of $7,195 per ounce and on track for a weekly gain of more than 6 percent, supported by the sagging dollar and as the metal drew demand as a hedge against inflation following the rise in U.S. inflation.

2018-02-15,"(Repeats from FEB 14, no changes to text) * Top global hedge fund shows hand on European firms * Bridgewater founder cautioned of global confidence swing * Short positions in Germany, France hit $12 billion By John O’Donnell, Maiya Keidan and Lawrence Delevingne LONDON/FRANKFURT/NEW YORK, Feb 14 (Reuters) - Bridgewater has shown its hand in Europe with a $22 billion bet against some of the continent’s biggest companies, filings reviewed by Reuters show, part of a bigger shift by the world’s largest hedge fund manager. Although data was not available to show whether Bridgewater holds more European stocks than it “shorts” overall, an investor in the hedge fund firm’s Pure Alpha Major Markets strategy said that its position was slightly net “long” on Feb. 6. But Bridgewater had reduced that long exposure significantly this year, the investor added. Bridgewater, which declined to comment on its trading, bets on macro-economic events and has $160 billion under management. Unlike the United States, where hedge funds are not required to disclose short positions, European rules brought in as a result of the financial crisis require publication once they go above a certain threshold. Short selling is a mainstay of hedge fund investing and is driven by expectations that shares will fall, which means they can later be repurchased at a lower price to make a profit. Although the filings do not say when Bridgewater first took out its European short positions, many of its above-threshold disclosures are recent, with some in Germany, Italy and France in the past two weeks. Bridgewater’s billionaire founder Ray Dalio spoke last month of the end of a buoyant global investment market. “It just takes a little change in interest rates to have a bear market,” he told CNBC at the World Economic Forum, adding the late part of the cycle may still have quite a way to run. But in a post on Linkedin this week, he wrote: “Recent spurts in stimulations, growth, and wage numbers signalled that the cycle is a bit ahead of where I thought it was.” The European filings show Bridgewater has bet against firms ranging from Anglo-Dutch consumer giant Unilever to French oil group Total, and from Deutsche Bank and German industrial group Siemens to Italian bank Intesa. The group’s short positions have emerged piecemeal in a series of filings that were made public throughout January and February, although Bridgewater will likely have built up its trades in advance of those announcements. Bridgewater is not known for picking individual stocks and James Helliwell, chief investment strategist and director of the Lex van Dam Trading Academy, said he thought the manager’s position was the result of a view on the wider economy. “Whilst the extent to which it may be an outright short bet is uncertain, I suspect that it was seen as a relatively cheap hedge against existing global equity exposure.” A London-based equity sales trader at a large U.S. bank said the shorts could just be a bet on fund outflows as volatility increases – which could explain why there are fewer Bridgewater shorts on the UK market – as UK stocks are very under-owned. Bridgewater’s short positions amount to more than $4.5 billion in France and top $7.3 billion in Germany, while in Spain its shorts in four groups amount to almost 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) and in Italy include Unicredit and Enel. Stock markets, after years of steady increases, wobbled last week amid concern that central banks, which have printed money and cut interest rates to bolster economic activity following the financial crisis, will pare back their support. Bridgewater’s portfolio is fluid and it has been adjusting its trades, cutting back on shorts in the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland, while increasing them in Germany and Italy, the data reviewed by Reuters shows. Bridgewater is not alone in its cautious stance, with BG Master Fund, based in Dublin, last week disclosing a 0.4 percent short position against German lender Commerzbank, while London-based Marshall Wace has made similar bets across Europe.

2018-02-15,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s trading houses are scouting for assets as they enjoy their best profit outlook in six years, driven by higher prices for commodities from metals and coking coal to oil and natural gas. Equipped with a nearly $50 billion (£35.67 billion) war chest, trading houses are looking to bolster their global commodity supply chain networks, eyeing gas fields in Australia, oil in Iraq and coal and copper assets. But - still smarting from huge writedowns in the last investment cycle - big debt-fuelled acquisitions look to be off the agenda, with the focus on greenlighting undeveloped assets, taking bigger stakes in existing projects, and trading up to better quality operations. “Now we have a lot of money that we can invest. We didn’t invest so much in recent years,” said a senior executive from a major trading house on condition of anonymity, declining to be named. “We want to be in the driving seat in investments. We are searching for good projects,” he said. Known as shosha in Japanese, trading houses led by Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui & Co fulfil a quasi-national role by importing everything from oil to corn to sustain the country’s resource-poor economy.   Together with Itochu Corp, Sumitomo Corp and Marubeni Corp, the five major trading houses reported record April-December net profits this month, with many upping their full-year forecasts. Combined, they expect annual net income for the year to end-March, 2018 of 1.88 trillion yen (£12.4 billion), the most since 2011/12 financial year. Mitsui this month won a bidding war for Australia’s AWE Ltd with a $470 million offer that will give make it operator and 50 percent owner of the promising Waitsia gas prospect. Analysts described it as a low-risk investment, while Mitsui said becoming operator of a gas field for the first time would bolster its credentials to bid on other Australian gas assets. Mitsui has been expected to step up its spending in energy and metals, where it is the strongest of the top five trading houses, said Nomura Securities’ senior analyst Yasuhiro Narita. Itochu - the least exposed to natural resources of the five - is set to buy a stake in Iraq’s West Qurma 1 oilfield from Royal Dutch Shell. It is also eyeing coal assets to replace declining output from its current operations, Chief Financial Officer Tsuyoshi Hachimura said earlier this month. Mitsubishi CFO Kazuyuki Masu said this month the company was looking to invest in copper mines - one of its three focused assets along with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coking coal - to meet expected rising demand for electric cars.  This could include the bolstering its stake in mines in which it already has a share, such as Peru’s Quellaveco project, where it has invested with majority shareholder Anglo American, and which is awaiting for a final investment decision. The five trading houses combined had about $48 billion in cash and short-term investments as of end-March 2017, according to data in Thomson Reuters Eikon. Still, it was just two years ago that Mitsubishi and Mitsui posted their first ever annual losses, while in that same year to March 2016 the five houses combined wrote-off about 1 trillion yen after the commodities downturn of 2014-2015. They have since staged a recovery, also visible in the stock market where since 2015, seen as the lowpoint of the overall commodities downturn, they have outperformed even Glencore , a western listed commodity trading peer. Despite this, analysts say the Japanese traders remain cautious. “Trading houses are not spending like in early 2010s when they were making huge loans to buy assets with big price-tag,” said Masako Kuwahara, senior analyst at corporate finance group in Moody’s Japan K.K. “They have learned lessons from the commodities slump and they are making only selective investments, with the focus to maintain a positive cash flow,” she said, predicting that spending will have limited impact on their leverage.

South32, spun off from global mining giant BHP in 2015, said in a statement that underlying profit for the six months ended Dec. 31 grew to $544 million. That was short of the average estimate of $574 million from four analysts, and with company watchers saying costs had crept up, the stock slipped nearly 3 percent. Hoisting its interim dividend nearly 20 percent, South32 said it would also pay shareholders a special dividend worth $155 million and offered an upbeat outlook for a business that saw first-half revenue grow 8 percent to $3.49 billion. Demand for steel remains solid globally, chief executive Graham Kerr said during a call with reporters, driven by a robust Chinese economy and restocking ahead of the Lunar New Year that began on Thursday. “From our perspective, China continues to be strong in terms of the economy...Fundamentally steel looks good across the globe,” he said. “We are more positive on steel than we thought we would have been 12 months ago.” China’s drive to crack down on pollution has also burnished the global manganese outlook by driving down domestic supply, Kerr said. “We achieved record production at (unit) Australia Manganese and Mozal Aluminium, (and) increased production guidance at South Africa Manganese in response to favourable market conditions,” South32’s CEO said. The company last month said manganese ore output rose 22 percent in the December quarter from a year earlier. Still, investors’ response was negative. The shares were down 2.7 percent at A$3.60 by 0347 GMT, against 1.2 percent gains on the underlying S&P/ASX 200 index. Analysts said the slow pace of a previously announced $750 million share buyback, as well as rising costs, weighed on investors’ minds. “(I) Can’t help but feeling...like the special (dividend) component is really a ‘catch-up’ for the slow buyback program,” analyst Peter O’Connor at Shaw and Partners in Sydney said in a report. “(The) buyback (was) topped up by $250 million although we note that the first-half buying pattern has been below the required rate...$540m remains outstanding, to be purchased up to April 2019.” Meanwhile Kerr said South 32 is looking to bolster its supply pipeline, declining to rule out acquisitions in coking coal. Rio Tinto has started a sales process for its Queensland coking coal operations Kestrel and Hail Creek, industry sources say. “We have been clear from day one we will look at M&A opportunities but we will always look at it through the lens of value,” Kerr said, without disclosing South32’s budget for acquisitions.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1 percent. Australian stocks climbed 0.9 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 1.3 percent following three successive days of losses that took it to a four-month low the previous day.

U.S. consumer prices rose more than forecast in January as Americans paid more for gasoline, rental accommodation and healthcare, further raising inflation concerns and the prospect of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates more than initially expected. That drove U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities higher on Wednesday, with those on benchmark 10-year notes hitting a four-year high.

2018-02-15,"* Interim underlying profit surges to A$582 mln, meets forecasts * Raises energy markets earnings forecast * Cuts breakeven cost target for APLNG * Shares jump 6 pct (Adds CEO, analyst comments) By Sonali Paul Feb 15 (Reuters) - Origin Energy Ltd, Australia’s top power and gas retailer, more than tripled its half-year underlying profit on the back of soaring energy prices and raised its earnings forecast for energy markets, sending its shares up 6 percent. Origin also sharpened its target for cutting costs at its Australia Pacific liquefied natural gas (APLNG) project, aiming to break even at $45 a barrel by June, down from a target of $48. Analysts and investors applauded the result, which was in line with broker forecasts, as well as the better outlook for energy markets and APLNG, where costs have come down partly due to improved output from its coal seam gas wells. “We see this as a strong outcome for Origin,” Royal Bank of Canada analyst Ben Wilson said in a note. Origin’s shares jumped 6 percent outpacing a 0.9 percent rise in the broader market. Underlying profit after tax for the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to A$582 million ($461.12 million) from A$184 million a year ago, roughly in line with two analysts’ estimates around A$593 million, driven largely by strong power and gas prices. Power and gas prices have soared due to growth in wind and solar power, which need to be backed up by gas-fired generation, which has grown expensive as domestic gas supply has tightneed due to a sharp rise in LNG exports. As a result, Origin raised its full-year underlying earnings forecast for its energy markets business to between A$1.78 billion and A$1.85 billion from an earlier forecast of A$1.7 billion to A$1.8 billion. However, like arch rival AGL, Origin’s retail business was hit by a sharp rise in customer churn, after government pressure on retailers to drive down household energy costs sparked a price war. The company lost 47,000 customers in the December half, but has seen a pick-up over the past two months. Origin said it is on track to cut net debt to less than A$7 billion by June, as targeted, following the recently completed sale of its Lattice Energy business. Chief Executive Frank Calabria said debt reduction along with improving underlying returns would be key measures for reviving the company’s dividend. It suspended dividends in 2016 to focus on cutting debt, which peaked with the construction of APLNG just as oil prices slumped. “Clearly we’re getting closer every six months that we make that progress,” he told reporters. $1 = 1.2621 Australian dollars

2018-02-15,"* Saudi Arabia says it is committed to cut throughout 2018 * Weak dollar potentially spurs fuel demand * But U.S. crude inventories rise as production hits fresh record By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Oil prices on Thursday extended gains from the previous session, pushed up by a weak dollar and by comments from Saudi Arabia that it would rather see an undersupplied market than end a deal with OPEC and Russia to withhold production. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.02 a barrel at 0147 GMT, up 42 cents, or 0.7 percent from their last settlement, adding to a 2.4 percent gain in the previous session. Brent crude futures were at $64.64 per barrel, up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, extending Wednesday’s 2.6 percent rise. Prices rose on the back of ongoing weakness in the U.S.-dollar against other leading currencies, further supported by rising stock markets, traders said. A weaker greenback potentially supports consumption of dollar-denominated commodities as it makes fuel and raw materials cheaper for countries using other currencies. “On commodity markets, everyone loves a lower U.S. dollar,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader. More fundamentally, oil markets got a push from comments by Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), voicing support for production cuts backed by OPEC and other producers including Russia since 2017 in an effort to tighten the market and prop up prices. “If we have to err on over-balancing the market a little bit, so be it,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Wednesday. “I think we are going to be sticking with our policy (to withhold production) throughout 2018.” Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said “the Saudi signal is reasonably convincing, suggesting OPEC and their partners are committed to maintaining an absolute floor on oil prices.” Threatening to undermine the OPEC-led effort to tighten markets is soaring production in the United States, which is not participating in the pact to cut. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA rose to a fresh record of 10.27 million barrels per day (bpd), more than top exporter Saudi Arabia pumps and within reach of top producer Russia. Consequently, U.S. crude inventories rose by 1.8 million barrels in the week to Feb. 9, to 422.1 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

2018-02-15,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2svKweE By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - “The lexicon of exit is not found in our vocabulary”, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told reporters on the sidelines of a conference in Cairo on Monday. Ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been anxious to counter speculation about an early end to production curbs. Barkindo was reinforcing the message that the current curbs will be maintained until at least the end of this year and could be continued into 2019 (“Barkindo stresses ongoing cooperation, not exit”, Argus, Feb. 12). OPEC will review progress towards its goal of eliminating excess global inventories at its next regular meeting in June, but ministers have downplayed suggestions the review could lead to an early exit from the accord. The Declaration of Cooperation signed in December 2016 between OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, and selected non-OPEC producers, led by Russia, has become fundamental to OPEC’s strategy for managing the oil market. Both sides appear satisfied with the results achieved so far and keen to extend their cooperation in the medium term. Global oil inventories have been cut to just over 100 million barrels above the five-year average, down from 340 million at the start of 2017. Benchmark Brent prices have risen by around $20 per barrel, or almost 50 percent, since the production cuts were announced, and futures prices have swung from contango into backwardation. Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih and his Russian counterpart Alexander Novak are “apostles to the value of cooperation”, Barkindo told a separate conference in Riyadh on Wednesday. “They have proven to be the key strong pillars on which the historic OPEC and non-OPEC cooperation has been built” (“Introductory remarks by secretary-general”, OPEC, Feb. 14). The agreement between 24 OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers is therefore likely to be extended and evolve rather than terminated. In that sense, Barkindo is correct to note exit is not on the agenda. The critical question is how and when the agreement is modified not whether it is ended completely. The most likely outcome is that the agreement is eventually adjusted to include a new set of higher production limits while maintaining the framework of regular meetings between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. But with Saudi Arabia and Russia among the only signatories that have the capacity to boost output and benefit from higher production limits, securing a broad agreement is likely to prove tricky. Production restraint has been far more successful in drawing down excess global oil stocks than most analysts expected or indeed OPEC itself originally expected (“Egypt petroleum show”, OPEC, Feb. 12). Crude oil stocks remain around 100 million barrels above the five-year average, but if they were pushed down to that level the oil market would almost certainly feel very tight, given the growth in consumption since 2013. Stocks of refined products are already close to the five-year average, and in some cases below it, which has left many fuel markets feeling under-supplied. While OPEC insists stocks need to fall further, by most indicators the oil market has already rebalanced and is now firmly in the tightening phase of the cycle (tmsnrt.rs/2svKweE). If OPEC and its allies maintain their production curbs too long, oil prices will rise and spur an even more drilling and production from U.S. shale producers. The most recent forecasts for production and consumption show U.S. shale producers and other non-OPEC suppliers will essentially capture all the forecast demand growth in 2018. If OPEC and its allies maintain their production curbs, they may secure higher prices, but only at the expense of losing more market share. The dilemma of whether to prioritise the price defence or protect market share is familiar. OPEC has regularly alternated between price defence and market share protection for 40 years. Before June 2014, the organisation was focused on protecting prices above $100 per barrel, even at the expense of losing market share to U.S. shale producers. Between June 2014 and June 2016, the priority shifted towards recapturing market share, at the expense of a wrenching slump in prices. Since December 2016, the focus has been on cutting excess oil stocks and pushing up prices, even though it has cost some market share, especially in Asia. The strategy of cutting stocks and boosting prices has been successful, but the costs associated with it are starting to rise as U.S. shale producers capture more and more of global demand growth. At some point, OPEC and its allies will be forced to shift their focus back towards boosting output and stemming the erosion of their market share. The only question is when. OPEC and its allies will probably adjust the declaration at some point to include higher production limits with the aim of defending their market share without triggering a steep fall in prices. The challenge is to get the timing and the scale of the output increase right so the extra supply is absorbing by growing consumption. But experience suggests OPEC will leave the adjustment too late, tighten the market too much and send prices surging. The organisation will then increase supply at the moment when non-OPEC supply is accelerating and demand growth is already slowing. OPEC allowed the market to tighten too much after both the two previous slumps in 1997/98 and 2008/09 with the result that prices overshot its initial targets. Something similar is likely in 2018/19. The other challenge for OPEC is managing market expectations. Hedge funds and other money managers have built a record bullish position in crude in the expectation that OPEC and its allies will continue to restrain output and continue to tighten the market well into 2018. Position-building by fund managers has helped accelerate the accentuate the rise in oil prices and provided an early harvest for OPEC and its allies. Any sign that producers are preparing to increase their output could trigger a rush to exit from some of those bullish positions and a sharp fall in prices. TRICKY RE-NEGOTIATION Most OPEC members would prefer to tighten the oil market too much and benefit from a short-term revenue windfall rather than risk not tightening it enough and a renewed fall in prices. Saudi Arabia, the organisation’s de facto leader and the real swing producer, needs relatively high prices to balance the government budget and pay for ambitious social and economic modernisation programmes. The kingdom also needs high prices to help secure a favourable valuation in the forthcoming sale of sale of shares in its national oil company Aramco. Most other OPEC members also need higher prices to cut their budget deficits and maintain internal social stability. Among the non-OPEC signatories to the Declaration of Cooperation, Russia has expressed some reservations about the need to protect market share, but has so far agreed to continue with a price-defence strategy. Ultimately, most OPEC and non-OPEC members are aware of the dangers of pushing prices too high but negotiating revised production limits will prove tricky. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia are probably the only signatories with the capacity to boost their output significantly in the short term. Other OPEC and non-OPEC members have little to gain from higher production limits and would prefer higher prices instead. Saudi Arabia and Russia have the ability to raise production unilaterally, or in agreement with each other, but will probably want to maintain the broader framework of cooperation painstakingly built since 2016. Since negotiating an upward revision of production limits could prove contentious, it is easier for OPEC and non-OPEC producers to continue with the existing agreement for as long as possible.

2018-02-15,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Feb 15 (Reuters) - China’s new crude futures contract faces a mountain of obstacles to overcome if it is to establish itself as a viable benchmark for trading with the world’s largest oil importer. The Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), which is part of the Shanghai Futures Exchange, said on Feb. 9 it would launch the much-delayed contract on March 26. In theory, this will give China a powerful tool to shake up global crude trading by offering pricing and hedging in the heart of the world’s biggest market for imported crude. The reality is likely to be somewhat different, with potential market participants likely to be cautious until they see how the various dynamics play out. Some of the issues that will need to be addressed are: * How liquid will the contract be, given the limited number of potential buyers for physical delivery at the bonded storages in China? * How much government intervention is likely, given Beijing’s penchant for adjusting rules and regulations to influence pricing if the market moves in a direction deemed undesirable? * Will foreign-based traders be happy to work in a yuan-denominated contract, with the associated currency risk and convertibility issues? * Will trade in the new contract be dominated by the state-owned Chinese majors to the exclusion of opportunities for others? * Given the contract is deliverable in China, how will the inclusion of freight costs affect trading? But perhaps the biggest challenge face the INE contract is the fact that it is effectively based in a demand centre, rather than a production centre, as are the other major oil futures. The three main existing benchmarks, Brent, West Texas Intermediate and the Dubai Mercantile Exchange’s (DME) Oman, are based in production centres and the delivery points are close to where the oil is actually pumped. It’s actually difficult to find futures in the commodity world that are based in a demand centre, with most successful contracts being set up near points of supply, a system that has allowed producers, traders and consumers to hedge risks and discover prices. The INE contract will be pioneering a different type of future, with the specifications showing that each contract will be for a volume of 1,000 barrels, and the deliverable crudes being a mix of tradable Middle Eastern medium-sour grades, as well as Shengli, a domestic crude. The INE has approved six bonded storage sites at eight locations in China, with a total usable capacity of 19.8 million barrels. It appears that the contract has been well-designed and there is little to fault from a technical perspective, but this alone is unlikely to be enough to guarantee success. The 1,000-barrel per lot and the minimum transaction margin of 5 percent of contract value are probably large enough to deter day traders and small-scale speculators. However, this is a double-edged sword as it will limit liquidity and volatility, two things that can be attractive to traders. Some of China’s most successful commodity futures contracts, such as iron ore on the Dalian Commodity Exchange, are dominated by day traders, with the volumes they bring helping establish the derivatives as important regional price indicators. Overcoming the trust deficit between foreign market participants and the Chinese authorities also looms large, and it’s likely that many potential players will be keen for the INE to establish a track record before they become involved. Another risk for the new contract is that the Chinese authorities want it to succeed so much that they effectively force state-owned majors, and even smaller independent Chinese refiners, to use the INE. This could well boost volumes and give the contract the semblance of success, but it would be artificial and thus probably not as effective as it could be as a hedging tool. There is little doubt that China is seeking to play a bigger role in global crude trading, a reasonable ambition given it has overtaken the United States as the world’s biggest buyer. However, establishing a new price benchmark is extremely difficult, as the DME can tell you from their experience in trying to build the Oman futures as the main Middle East marker, despite it being a contract with arguably better technical specifications than both Brent and WTI. The INE deserves a shot at success, and ultimately it makes far more sense to have a price benchmark for Asia based in the region’s top consumer, rather than using contracts that reflect a few small fields in the North Sea or storage tanks in Oklahoma.

2018-02-15,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.4 pct, Nikkei gains 1.1 pct * Asia lifted as Wall St shrugs off strong US CPI and rallies * Dollar remains on defensive, hits 15-month low vs yen * Crude oil prices extend rally By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Asian stocks gained on Thursday after Wall Street brushed aside strong U.S. inflation data and surged, a counterintuitive move that also saw the dollar pinned at two-week lows even as Treasury yields jumped in anticipation of a quicker pace of U.S. interest rate hikes. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.4 percent. Australian stocks climbed 0.8 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 1.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei jumped 1.1 percent following three successive days of losses that took it to a four-month low the previous day. Wall Street surged on Wednesday, with the Dow up 1 percent and the S&P 500 climbing 1.34 percent, as investors shrugged off the stronger-than-expected inflation data and snapped up shares of Facebook, Amazon.com and Apple . U.S. consumer prices rose more than expected in January as Americans paid more for gasoline, rental accommodation and healthcare, further raising inflation concerns and the prospect of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates more than initially expected. That drove U.S. Treasury yields on most maturities higher on Wednesday, with those on benchmark 10-year notes hitting a four-year high. The dollar index against a basket of currencies was slightly lower at 88.980 after losing more than 0.6 percent overnight despite the strong inflation number. The recovery in broader risk sentiment was seen weighing on the dollar, which had gained during the market turmoil earlier in the month. The U.S. currency has been buffeted by a variety of setbacks this year, including from prospects Washington might  pursue a weak dollar strategy to the perceived erosion of its yield advantage as other countries part with easier monetary policy. Concerns about the growing U.S. fiscal deficit have also weighed on the greenback. The dollar stretched overnight losses against the Japanese yen to touch a 15-month low of 106.420, having declined more than 2 percent so far this week and causing the Nikkei to underperform its global peers. “Japanese stocks could act as drag to their regional counterparts if the stronger yen hampers its performance. In that respect the strong yen could be seen as a factor preventing the stabilisation in global markets,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief currency strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. The euro extended gains to reach a 10-day high of $1.2467 after surging 0.8 percent the previous day. The South African rand traded at 11.71 per dollar after surging to a 2-1/2-year high of 11.66 overnight after the country’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) said it would proceed with a vote to remove President Jacob Zuma from office. The Australian dollar was steady at $0.7929 after rallying 0.85 percent the previous day. In commodities, U.S. crude futures were up 0.35 percent at $60.82 per barrel after prices surged the previous day as U.S. crude stocks rose less than expected and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said major oil producers would prefer tighter markets than end supply cuts too early. Crude also benefited from the dollar’s weakness. Oil tends to move inversely to the dollar, and has also of late been trading in tandem with stocks. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro

2018-02-15,"(Reuters) - SunPower Corp (SPWR.O), the No. 2 U.S. solar panel maker, on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue, adding it would take measures to mitigate the blow from tariffs placed on imported solar panels by the Trump administration. San Jose, California-based SunPower, which manufactures its solar modules mainly in the Philippines, Malaysia and Mexico, is seeking an exemption from the import tariffs President Donald Trump imposed on imported solar panels in January. “Unfortunately, we are already seeing a negative near-term impact from the ruling as the increased cost due to import tariffs have delayed certain 2018 projects and made other projects uneconomical,” Chief Executive Thomas Werner said in a conference call. SunPower is considering significant cost saving initiatives to lower its overall expense structure, Werner added. President Donald Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on cheap imported panels was intended to protect American manufacturing jobs, but many in the solar industry have argued that tariffs will raise costs and trigger thousands of layoffs at the installation end of the industry. The company said it also plans to expand its internal international businesses, including its distributed generation business. The company posted an adjusted revenue of $824 million, beating analysts’ estimate of $791.29 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company earned 25 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, beating analysts’ estimate of 11 cents.     The beat was driven a healthy demand for solar modules in 2017 as the federal tax credit for solar installations was extended by the Congress. However, it will take time for companies to rebuild their project pipelines.   The company had reported total operating expenses rise 2.7 times in the quarter, largely due to a non-cash charge of $624 million related to its residential leases.     In the fourth quarter, the company’s net loss attributable to shareholders widened to $568.68 million, or $4.07 per share, from $275.12 million, or $1.99 per share, a year earlier. SunPower, majority owned by French energy giant Total SA (TOTF.PA), said revenue fell 35.8 percent to $658.1 million.     The company’s shares were up about 1.4 percent in after-market trading.
