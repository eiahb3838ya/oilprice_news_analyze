2018-03-01,"(Adds comments from agricultural and LNG interests) By Erwin Seba and Timothy Gardner HOUSTON/WASHINGTON, March 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. oil and gas industry on Thursday slammed President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on imported steel, saying the move would kill energy jobs by raising costs for big infrastructure projects. Officials at the nation’s top energy industry trade groups issued statements urging Trump to reconsider the idea, and a source familiar with Exxon Mobil Corp’s investment plans said the tariff could lead the company to curtail an expansion of one of the country’s biggest refineries. Trump said on Thursday he would impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel imports and 10 percent on imported aluminum next week, in a move intended to protect U.S. industry. But critics said it would fail to boost jobs and risked stoking a trade war with China. Pipeline trade groups noted that the cost for specialized steel needed to build arteries that carry petroleum would rise. “We are urging the administration to avoid killing U.S. jobs through a steel tariff that impacts pipelines,” said Andy Black, CEO of the Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL). The U.S. energy industry relies on imported steel for drilling equipment, pipelines, liquefied natural gas terminals and refineries. The tariff plan is “inconsistent with the administration’s goal of continuing the energy renaissance and building world class infrastructure,” said Jack Gerard, president of the American Petroleum Institute. A study by AOPL last year showed that a 25 percent increase in pipeline costs could increase the budget for a typical project by $76 million. TransCanada’s proposed Keystone XL expansion would cost at least $300 million more. A spokeswoman for the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America said the tariff could pose a problem because the type of pipe and steel used to make thick-walled interstate pipelines are hard to source domestically. Both groups said that about three-quarters of current pipeline project spending ends up in the pockets of American workers and business owners. The Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a trade group, said tariffs could have the “unintended effect of endangering much-needed U.S. LNG export projects,” which use special steel components not produced in the United States. LNG backers are trying to build a second wave of export facilities that cost billions of dollars each. The tariffs would have uncertain impacts on coal miners, who make up a portion of Trump’s base. Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, said if tariffs boosted domestic steel making it would be a boon for some producers of metallurgical coal - used in steel mills. But metallurgical coal miners also export to markets in Asia, a business that has soared this year. If Trump’s tariffs resulted in a trade war with Asian countries, it could harm U.S. coal miners, Popovich said. The Trump administration has sought to support all sides of the fossil fuel industry, but that has at times led to squabbling between drillers and miners. A source familiar with Exxon deliberations about a possible expansion of the Beaumont, Texas, refinery said an increase in steel prices could impact the company’s decision on whether to add a third unit for distillation of crude. The source said Exxon could bypass duties on imported steel by importing the components of a crude unit directly from a manufacturer overseas into the refinery, which is a foreign trade zone. An Exxon spokeswoman was not immediately available to discuss the company’s plans. The Beaumont refinery currently can process 362,300 barrels of crude a day; a proposed expansion would make it the nation’s largest. Meanwhile, a U.S.-based railcar manufacturing executive said the bulk of railcars made in North America come from U.S. or Canadian steel and fears the tariffs will trigger a trade war that leads to higher domestic prices. Roughly 60 percent of the railcar cost comes from steel, said the executive, who was not authorized to speak to the press. “I am real concerned. I think this is going to jack up prices and backfire,” the executive said. U.S. farmers said they also feared a potential trade war. “These tariffs are very likely to accelerate a tit-for-tat approach on trade, putting U.S. agricultural exports in the cross-hairs,” said Brian Kuehl, executive director of Farmers for Free Trade. The agriculture sector is already stinging from a global oversupply of crops and slumping farm incomes. China, which imports more than a third of all U.S. soybeans, could retaliate, heaping more pain on the sector, the American Soybean Association warned.

2018-03-01,"HANOVER, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) bosses missed warning signs ahead of its diesel emissions scandal, but did not break market rules by delaying the disclosure of its problems, the carmaker’s lawyers  said in a submission to a German court reviewed by Reuters. Investors from around the world are seeking 9 billion euros  (8 billion pounds) in damages from Volkswagen (VW), which they say did not inform shareholders quickly enough over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. tests on diesel engine emissions. About 1,600 lawsuits, nearly all from institutional investors, have been lodged at a regional court in Braunschweig near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, seeking damages over the sharp fall in VW shares that followed its admission of wrongdoing. In a 300-page submission to the court on Wednesday, lawyers for Europe’s largest automaker said it had no duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations prior to Sept. 22, 2015, when it issued an ad-hoc statement that the illegal software could be in around 11 million cars worldwide     Although the company had admitted its cheating to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2015, it believed potential fines from regulators and vehicle refitting costs would not exceed 300 million euros ($366 million) and therefore would not lead to a significant drop in the stock price, sources close to VW said. Had the company believed the financial cost of its cheating could have reached 1 billion euros or more, it would have considered an earlier ad-hoc release, the sources added. Since the “dieselgate” scandal became public, VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover fines, vehicle refits to remove the illegal “defeat device” software and other costs.  “In the past there have again and again been violations of the defeat device ban in U.S. environmental law but without the affected companies getting sanctioned in a draconian and hard way,” VW lawyers said in the submission.  “An escalation of the matter ... wasn’t expected, neither by the defendants nor by their advisers,” they added.  Led by investment management firm Deka, the plaintiff’s side includes another 2,000 individuals who have raised claims without suing VW, the sources said. Germany’s state of Lower Saxony, VW’s second-largest shareholder, on Thursday expressed concerns about the mounting legal challenges.  “The litigation risk for VW is huge,” Bernd Althusmann, the state’s economics minister and a member of VW’s supervisory board said late on Thursday on German ZDF television. The sources said former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who resigned within a week of the scandal breaking, was informed in an internal memo in May 2014 that VW models had violated U.S. emissions rules and U.S. authorities would check whether the carmaker was using illegal software. However, they said the implications of this were not grasped at the time. Winterkorn said when he resigned that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part.  Public hearings of the case at the Braunschweig court are due to start in early September.

2018-03-01,"* Emergency declared across Highlands provinces - PM * PNG government, Red Cross, Australia pledge quake aid * Rescuers and supplies yet to reach hard-hit areas - official By Tom Westbrook SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea has declared a state of emergency across its remote and rugged highlands, the country’s Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said on Friday, days after a deadly quake struck the region and killed at least 31 people. Rescuers have struggled to reach villages buried by landslides near the epicentre, and even hard-hit larger towns, since the 7.5-magnitude quake wrecked roads and runways on Monday and cloudy weather made helicopter flights difficult since. “This is an unprecedented disaster,” O’Neill said in a statement late on Wednesday, while promising 450 million kina ($135 million) in government aid and help from the military. “A state of emergency has been declared to expedite the restoration of essential public services including healthcare services, schools, road access, airports, power and communications facilities,” he said. At least 13 people died when landslides covered remote hamlets close to where the quake struck, some 560 km (350 miles) northwest of the capital, Port Moresby, an official told Reuters on Thursday. While the region has no major urban centres, around 670,000 people live within 100 km of the epicentre according to the Red Cross. Most of the other confirmed fatalities were in or around the provincial capital of Mendi and the town of Tari 40 km (25 miles) from the epicentre, where airports are closed and relief workers are yet to arrive. “Our people live in scattered hamlets and people are dying slowly - the only means of rescue is through helicopters and they are hardly coming,” Hela province’s administrator, William Bando, told Reuters from his office in a shipping container in Tari. “A lot of people are asking for tents, water and medical supplies. It’s a beautiful day here today, we hope a helicopter comes.” The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies said it released $221,000 in funds to help relief efforts and would send first aid, water, mosquito nets and shelters, to the region. Australia has also promised aid and sent a C-130 military plane to help with aerial surveys. Miners and oil and gas companies were also assessing damage to their infrastructure, including a 700-km (435-mile) gas pipeline that connects to a coastal liquefaction plant, which ExxonMobil Corp on Thursday said was not damaged. Earthquakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific Ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.

2018-03-01,"* Analyst Fry sees floor under palm prices at $500-600 a tonne * Palm markets often influenced by movement in crude oil prices * Palm-based biodiesel still unprofitable -Malaysia industry body By Emily Chow and Naveen Thukral KUALA LUMPUR/SINGAPORE, March 2 (Reuters) - Crude palm oil (CPO) prices will not drop below $500 a tonne this year if markets for crude oil stay around current levels, leading sector analyst James Fry told Reuters this week. Palm oil, grown widely in Malaysia and Indonesia, can be used to churn out biodiesel, so its price is often influenced by movements in crude oil markets. “Where crude oil sets the floor to CPO prices, Brent crude between $60 and $70 will mean that Rotterdam CPO will have a price floor of $500-$600 regardless of the level of CPO output,” Fry, chairman of commodities consultancy LMC International, told Reuters by email. That CPO price includes cost, freight and insurance (CIF). Benchmark Brent oil prices this week stood around $65 per barrel, buoyed as some producers crimp output to rein in a global glut. Prices for Malaysian CPO delivered into Rotterdam were at $700 per tonne CIF on Wednesday. The commodity is also used to make products such as soap or chocolate. PALM-MYCRD-P1 “Biodiesel demand in (Malaysia and Indonesia) depends ... on the competitiveness of local palm methyl ester with diesel prices,” said Fry, referring to the bio component of biodiesel that comes from palm oil. “Only if the extra CPO output pushes down the premium of CPO over gasoil is it likely that the extra CPO production will be translated into significantly higher biodiesel demand,” he added, speaking ahead of an industry event in Kula Lumpur next week. CPO was this week trading at a nearly $80 premium over diesel, also known as gasoil. Last month saw premiums of $93, the largest in three months. Meanwhile, the president of Malaysia’s Biodiesel Association said palm-based biodiesel production remained unprofitable at current crude oil prices. In Malaysia, biodiesel producers must follow so-called B7 production rules, meaning that biofuels must have a minimum bio content of 7 percent. “Malaysia’s biodiesel production in 2018 will be similar to 2017, unless a B10 mandate is implemented for the transport sector,” U.R. Unnithan told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday. He estimated that Malaysia produced 900,000 tonnes of biodiesel in 2017. Reporting by Emily Chow in KUALA LUMPUR and Naveen Thukral in

2018-03-01,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela on Thursday postponed its upcoming presidential vote to May 20 in a move cementing an opposition split as socialist incumbent Nicolas Maduro seeks re-election despite an economic crisis and global censure. The national election board said it had pushed the vote back from the original date of April 22 following a pact between Maduro’s government and some opposition parties. The main opposition coalition is boycotting the poll, saying it is a farce intended to legitimize a “dictatorship.”  Maduro’s two strongest opposition rivals, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, are both barred from standing, and most Venezuelans view the election board as answerable to Maduro. Western nations and a dozen Latin American neighbours have reprimanded Maduro’s government over unfair conditions for the vote, and the United States is considering imposing sanctions on the OPEC member’s crucial oil sector. Breaking with the main opposition coalition, however, one prominent opposition leader, Henri Falcon, has launched his candidacy. The 56-year-old former state governor believes he can win, even without the coalition’s election machinery behind him, by taking advantage of widespread dissatisfaction with the ruling socialists over a fifth year of gruelling recession. However, opposition supporters in the camps of Lopez and Capriles have called Falcon a “sellout” and are urging voters to stay away from the polls to isolate Maduro and de-legitimize what they say will be a rigged win. “Sadly, Falcon succumbed to the temptation of participating and playing the dictatorship’s game,” said Juan Pablo Guanipa, a leader in Capriles’ Justice First party.  Government stalwart Jorge Rodriguez said Thursday’s agreement with Falcon’s Progressive Advance party, and some other movements, was evidence of a reconciliatory spirit that undercut foreign criticism of autocratic rule in Venezuela. “Venezuela is a model democracy for the whole world,”  Rodriguez, who is communications minister, told reporters at the election board headquarters. Luis Romero, who leads Falcon’s party, said the only way to bring about change was via the polls, and not through protests similar to those that caused nearly 130 deaths last year. “Venezuelans want to get rid of Maduro, but not by killing each other in the streets,” he said, also speaking at the election board in downtown Caracas. As well as a change in the date, Falcon is demanding reforms of the pro-government election board, U.N. observers, and the end of state handouts close to voting booths on election days. He told Reuters he may pull out if guarantees are not given. A former military man who broke with the ruling socialists in 2010, Falcon styles himself a centre-leftist favouring business-friendly policies with strong social welfare programs. Maduro is campaigning on a pledge to stay loyal to predecessor Hugo Chavez’s self-styled “21st century socialism.” In a broadcast on Facebook on Thursday, Maduro said Venezuela’s minimum wage was rising 58 percent as of March 1 to 392,646 bolivars a month, or $1.84 according to DolarToday, a website that closely tracks the black market rate. Maduro also lifted Venezuelans’ food ticket allowance 67 percent to 915,000 bolivars a month, the equivalent of $4.29. Bucking most analysts’ consensus, several polls have shown Falcon stands a chance of defeating Maduro.  A survey of 1,000 people in early February by Datanalisis said that in a two-way race Falcon would defeat Maduro by 45.8 percent to 32.2 percent of likely voters. Maduro says Venezuela’s election system is clean, and accuses the United States of leading a right-wing international conspiracy to end socialism and take over his nation’s oil.  The election board said on Thursday that local and state legislature votes will also take place on May 20.

2018-03-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks tumbled on Wall Street while the U.S. dollar fell on Thursday after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, sparking fears of a harmful global trade war. U.S. steelmaker stock prices jumped on the news after Trump vowed to rebuild American steel and aluminium industries at a meeting of U.S. industry officials at the White House. But many stocks fell on concerns industry inputs would be as the cost of imported steel and aluminium rose, pushing up costs for consumers also.   “There’s always a concern with this president that you get into a series of trade wars that would hurt domestic or global growth,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors in New York. “It remains to be seen whether not there’s a response from the foreign government. That’s unknown and the market hates uncertainty,” Orlando said. Canada said it would retaliate if the United States imposes tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminium products, Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Thursday.  Canada’s main stock index fell to a more than two-week low on Thursday, partly on fears about the impact of more protectionist trade policies. Chuck Carlson, chief executive at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana said the market is nervous about future U.S. inflation and the imposition of tariffs may accentuate those concerns.  “You put a tax on something you are increasing the price, which is inflationary and then what is that going to do with the goods and products that we sell too?” he said. The three major U.S. stock indices fell more than 1.0 percent as Trump’s tariff announcement added to investors concerns about the pace of Federal Reserve interest rates rises as inflation edges higher.  Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Thursday the U.S. economy does not appear to be overheating, though the head of the New York Fed suggested a faster pace of interest rate increases may still be in the offing for 2018. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed down 420.22 points, or 1.68 percent, to 24,608.98. The S&P 500 .SPX lost 36.16 points, or 1.33 percent, to 2,677.67 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 92.45 points, or 1.27 percent, to 7,180.56.

The gap between short-dated U.S. borrowing costs and those in Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks by the Fed and European Central Bank for the two regions diverged. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 15/32 in price to push yields lower to 2.8114 percent but are still near four year highs. U.S. consumer prices increased in January as a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, but a survey showed the euro zone’s factory boom slowed a little further in February, pressuring euro zone yields lower. “In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. Crude oil fell more than 1.0 percent, hitting two-week lows on pressure from a strong U.S. dollar and worries that surging U.S. crude output might thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain global supply.

2018-03-01,"(Adds background) March 1 (Reuters) - A U.S. manufacturing trade group on Thursday urged the U.S. Department of Energy not to approve further liquefied natural gas (LNG) export applications, citing concerns that the country was consuming and exporting the fuel at a faster clip than it was finding new resources. The agency’s approval of LNG export volumes equal almost 70 percent of 2016 U.S. demand for periods of 20 to 30 years, which cannot possibly be in the “public interest,” the Industrial Energy Consumers Of America (IECA) said. After decades of importing massive amounts of natural gas, the United States became an exporter of the fuel in 2017 for the first time in 60 years due in part to growing liquefied natural gas exports. The United States is expected to become the third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2018. At the start of 2016 before Cheniere Energy Inc’s Sabine Pass LNG export terminal entered service in February of that year, the United States was not exporting LNG. Sabine Pass is still the only LNG export facility operating in the country, but by the end of the year, the nation’s LNG export capacity is expected to rise from 3 billion cubic feet now to 4.6 bcfd. One bcfd is enough gas to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes. Over the next few years, the nation’s LNG export capacity is expected to rise to 9.4 bcfd by the end of 2019 and 10.1 bcfd by the end of 2020 as facilities currently under construction enter service. In addition, there are dozens of projects under development that hope to get contracts from customers so they can also get built. It is these projects that the manufacturing trade group is targeting. The companies developing new LNG projects include units of Cheniere, Tellurian Inc, Energy Transfer Partners LP , Exxon Mobil Corp, Pembina Pipeline Corp , Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd, Kinder Morgan Inc and Sempra Energy.

2018-03-01,"(Fresh throughout, adds details on auction, previous tenders and background) By Adriana Barrera MEXICO CITY, March 1 (Reuters) - Mexico will auction development rights to shale blocks in September, marking the first time the country has offered private oil companies the chance to develop the resource, which has been booming in the United States for years. The National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH), Mexico’s oil regulator, on Thursday launched a call for bids for its first shale tender including nine contractual areas that will be awarded on Sept. 5. The blocks are in Mexico’s Burgos Basin, in the northwestern border state of Tamaulipas, where state-owned oil company Pemex has drilled some 20 exploratory wells in the past. CNH President Juan Carlos Zepeda said companies that win development rights will be able to tap conventional oil and gas deposits as well as shale formations that may lie above or below. “The auction’s winners will have the right to explore and carry out activities at any depth, throughout the column, involving shale formations as well as conventional sand formations,” said Zepeda. The nine blocks contain an estimated 1.16 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), plus another 53 million boe of conventional oil and gas resources, according to energy ministry data. The blocks are believed to mostly contain natural gas. Shale production will also carry a set of challenges. Mexico is racked by gangland violence in states where the shale lies, and it also lacks infrastructure from pipelines to weight-bearing roads sufficient to handle intensive shale projects. Additionally, the hydraulic fracturing used by the industry to break up shale deposits and get oil and gas to flow out also requires large amounts of water that arid northern Mexico lacks. Mexico’s total prospective shale resources have been estimated at some 60 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The shale potential is even larger than the country’s deepwater resources in its territorial waters in the Gulf, where Royal Dutch Shell is set to be the biggest producer in the years ahead after winning the most blocks at a January auction. The September auction will be the fourth for 2018, the final year of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s six-year term. Shallow water blocks will be on offer later this month and then conventional onshore areas in July. Since a landmark energy reform was enacted in 2013-2014, Mexico has conducted eight oil and gas auctions, awarding some 90 contracts covering onshore and offshore acreage, according the CNH, which conducts the auctions and supervises the contracts. If successful, the approximately 90 contracts could be worth more than $150 billion over their lifetime, according to energy ministry estimates. The energy reform ended Pemex’s nearly 80 years of monopoly control over the sector and paved the way for the auctions, ending a long-standing constitutional prohibition on private companies operating fields on their own. Despite a decade-long shale boom in the United States, including lucrative plays near the U.S.-Mexico border like the Eagle Ford Formation, similar petroleum-rich geology that almost certainly extends into northern Mexico has yet to take off. Eagle Ford has been heavily drilled and produces around 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of a total of 6.5 million bpd in output from the seven largest U.S. shale regions, U.S. government data shows. Interested companies might include Mexico’s Newpek, a unit of conglomerate Alfa, which has developed shale projects in Texas, and U.S. independent Lewis Energy, which has operated on both sides of the border. Alfa executives said on a February conference call that the company was in a good position to participate in Mexican energy projects, without specifying which ones.

2018-03-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian operatives attempting to discourage U.S. energy production posted thousands of messages on social media supporting environmental activists in their campaign to limit oil and gas projects, a report by Republican lawmakers said on Thursday. On Facebook and Instagram, for example, a picture of a real protestor fighting against Energy Transfer Partners’ ETP.N Dakota Access Pipeline was presented with a panel written by Russian operatives that said “Americans have been stealing from Native Americans for more than 500 years.”  The lawmakers’ report linked some 9,100 posts on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram between 2015 and 2017 to operatives including the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency, a Russian propaganda arm known for its trolling on social media. It was one of three firms indicted on Feb. 16 by a U.S. special counsel investigating intelligence agency allegations of Russian tampering in the 2016 election, charges Moscow denies. Thirteen Russians were also charged, the court document describing them as having “had a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system.” Representative Lamar Smith, the Republican head of the U.S. House of Representatives Science Committee and a denier of climate science, said that Russians benefit by stirring controversy about U.S. energy production because the administration of President Donald Trump is trying to expand oil and natural gas exports to Europe. Russia has traditionally been a major energy supplier to that market. Democrats on the panel and environmentalists criticized   Republicans for focusing on energy policy instead of election meddling. The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the panel’s report. “The American people deserve to know if what they see on social media is the creation of a foreign power seeking to undermine our domestic energy policy,” Smith said. The report said information provided by Twitter showed more than 4 percent of all tweets by the Internet Research Agency were related to energy or environmental issues, compared to 8 percent of its tweets on the elections. A specialist on energy and foreign policy said the postings likely had little influence on U.S. energy markets. “It’s almost impossible to change U.S. energy policy through a social media campaign,” said Brenda Shaffer, a professor at Georgetown University, “a campaign would have to affect both the state and federal levels to be effective.”  Trump has called investigations into possible cooperation between his presidential campaign and Russians a political “witch hunt.” “To ignore known meddling in the very foundation of our democracy while focusing solely on Russia’s influence on the U.S. energy market, a market that is currently booming, seems irresponsible at best,” said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, the top Democrat on the science committee.  Naomi Ages, a climate campaign director at Greenpeace, said Smith was “ignoring the very real threats of election interference and climate change to once again waste taxpayer money muddying the waters.” Reporting by Timothy Gardner; editing by Grant McCool",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-russia-energy/russians-used-social-media-to-stir-divisions-on-u-s-energy-policy-lawmakers-idUKL2N1QJ22J,01 Mar 2018,"Russian operatives

2018-03-01,"* Australia’s govt takes control of hydro scheme from states * Clears way for planned expansion of generation * States to spend $4.8 bln sale proceeds on infrastructure (Adds ministerial quote and background) SYDNEY, March 2 (Reuters) - Australia’s federal government said on Friday it had purchased hydroelectric assets from the states of Victoria and New South Wales for A$6.2 billion ($4.8 billion), clearing its path to proceed with a national scheme to expand hydro generation. Under pressure to plug power supply gaps which have led to blackouts, as well as cap soaring prices, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced plans last year to expand hydro generation in Australia’s southeast by around 50 percent. Owning the assets itself makes it simpler for the national government to go ahead without the states controlling Snowy Hydro Ltd, the holding company that runs the giant scheme. “It will enable ‘Snowy 2.0’ to go ahead,” Minister for the Environment and Energy, Josh Frydenberg, told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio, referring to the government’s expansion plan. “ will create 5,000 new jobs, more power for 500,000 new homes as well as lowering people’s power bill and helping to stabilise the energy system.” Under the deal Victoria state will receive just under A$2.1 billion and New South Wales will receive A$4.2 billion for their shares in Snowy Hydro Ltd, which operates a giant hydroelectric scheme in Australia’s Snowy Mountains. The states agreed to spend the proceeds on other infrastructure projects under the deal, which must be approved by the federal and Victorian parliament before it takes effect, a statement from the federal government said. The national plan would add 2,000 megawatts of capacity to what is already the country’s biggest hydro scheme, and cost as much as A$4.5 billion. A feasibility study last year found the project was viable and technically feasible, but it still requires a final investment decision in 2018, hinging partly on major upgrades of transmission lines. If approved, the first power is expected in late 2024 at the earliest. The federal government said it would keep Snowy Hydro Ltd in public ownership, and make no changes to employment levels or water allocation.

2018-03-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil slumped more than 1 percent on Thursday, touching two-week lows under pressure from a retreating stock market and worries about surging U.S. crude output. Brent, the global benchmark, settled at $63.83 a barrel, down 90 cents, or 1.4 percent. U.S. crude settled down 65 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $60.99 a barrel, after touching a low of $60.18. The session lows for both benchmarks were the lowest in two weeks. “Ever since we had that extreme sell-off by equity markets a couple of weeks ago, oil prices seem to have one eye on the activity of the equity markets and have been under a strong influence of the dollar,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.  U.S. stock markets fell more than 1 percent after President Donald Trump announced import tariffs on steel and aluminum. The U.S. dollar hit a six-week high early but retreated in the afternoon, which tempered losses in crude futures. A weaker dollar can boost oil and other greenback-denominated currencies.[FRX/] “One of the things that contributed to the strength of the (oil) market was the weakness of the dollar over the past couple months,” said Gene McGillian, manager of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford. On Wednesday, weekly data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. crude inventories and a rise in gasoline stocks. [EIA/S]  U.S. crude output slipped in the last month of 2017, but in November hit an all-time high of 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd). Weekly data showed another record and further gains are expected. “Yesterday’s report ... has reawakened concerns that U.S. production levels will offset OPEC production cuts,” said McGillian. OPEC officials will meet U.S. shale executives at a U.S. energy conference on Monday, underlining the influence of American output on global prices. “The standoff ‘shale versus sheikh’ continues to frame the oil market, with the former again gaining the upper hand,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of macro and commodity research at Julius Baer. “We see more downside for oil.” OPEC’s cut, which began a year ago, has helped boost prices from levels below $30 seen in January 2016.  A Reuters survey on Wednesday found OPEC production fell in February to a 10-month low.

2018-03-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering imposing sanctions on a military-run Venezuelan oil services company and restricting insurance coverage for Venezuelan oil shipments to increase pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said. With Maduro running for another term in an election that Washington and its allies regard as a sham, the United States is weighing sanctions that would target Venezuela’s vital oil sector beyond what has been done before, the official told Reuters on Wednesday. Some measures could come before the vote and others could be imposed afterwards. The official, who is close to U.S. internal deliberations on Venezuela policy and who spoke on condition of anonymity, would not rule out an eventual full-scale ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the United States, among the toughest of oil-related sanctions.  “I think (it would cause) a fairly strong shock to the oil market in the short term,” the official said. The official stressed that no decisions have been made and that any U.S. action would take into consideration potential harm to ordinary Venezuelans, already suffering from food shortages and hyperinflation, and the country’s neighbours as well as the impact on the U.S. oil industry and consumers. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on potential further sanctions. Maduro, himself subject to sanctions last year, regularly laughs off Washington’s disapproval and blames the U.S. “empire” for his country’s economic woes, saying it is trying to undermine Venezuela’s leftist government. Venezuela was the fourth largest supplier of crude oil and products to the United States in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Its crude oil sales to the United States last year were the lowest since 1991, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data.  “Oil sanctions are not taken lightly,” the official said. “This would be a fairly strong escalation for U.S. policy, whether it’s a complete oil sanction or salami slices of different graduated steps.” President Donald Trump’s administration is also considering possible sanctions against additional military and political figures, including Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello, the official said. Experts say sanctions on individuals have had little or no impact on the Venezuelan government’s policies.  Washington’s crafting of new sanctions comes as Venezuela’s main opposition coalition is boycotting the election, citing “fraudulent” conditions. Venezuela’s election board postponed the presidential vote from April 22 to the second half of May on Thursday after an agreement between the government and some opposition parties. Critics had accused Venezuelan authorities of holding the vote early in the year to wrong-foot the opposition. The U.S. official had said before news of the date change that even if Venezuelan authorities delayed the election by a month or two, it was not likely to prompt Washington to hold back on sanctions. The best tool for making the Venezuelan government feel economic pain, U.S. government sources say, is through “sectoral” sanctions, such as financial measures announced in August that barred U.S. banks from any new debt deals with Venezuelan authorities or state-run oil giant PDVSA. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said in Geneva on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions are making foreign debt renegotiation more difficult and causing “panic” at global banks. Among the possible new U.S. targets is Camimpeg, Venezuela’s military-run oil services firm, the official said. Camimpeg provides PDVSA with assistance in drilling, logistics and security and was founded by the military in 2016 although little is known about its activities. The opposition says the armed forces are a nest of corruption and accuse Maduro of trying to buy the support of military chiefs by giving them increasing control of the OPEC nation’s crude reserves, the world’s largest.  Another option would be sanctions aimed at putting restrictions on insurance coverage for oil tankers and oil cargos involving PDVSA, the official said. Oil exports are typically protected by insurance on tankers as well as on the cargo. Without insurance, a vessel cannot navigate in international waters, which means Venezuela’s oil exports would likely be curtailed. Sanctions on cargo insurance would also hurt because PDVSA has a limited tanker fleet. The Trump administration is still considering blocking the sale of lighter U.S. crude and refined products that Venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports, the official told Reuters. “There’s a host of additional sanctions that could be imposed. The president has all those before him,” U.S. Senator Marco Rubio said in an interview with Reuters. Rubio has pushed for Trump to take a tougher line on Venezuela than former President Barack Obama. In a commentary in the Miami Herald, Rubio called for a “united front of disaffected government insiders and military personnel, with popular support from the Venezuelan people, to remove Maduro.”  The U.S. official interviewed by Reuters reiterated the administration’s stance that it is not seeking “regime change.” The Venezuelan government did not respond to a request for  comment on Rubio’s remarks. Maduro and other senior officials have frequently accused the United States of trying to provoke a coup. The Trump administration has also pressed Cuba, Venezuela’s Communist-ruled ally, to stop “propping up” Maduro, the U.S. official said. Cuba has long depended on Caracas for cut-rate oil supplies that have fallen off amid Venezuela’s crisis. Cuba has provided Venezuela with doctors and other services. U.S. authorities have said that includes a political and security advisory role. Asked whether Washington could impose sanctions on Cuban officials, the U.S. official said, “I’m not prepared to comment on that,” but added that the administration was “looking at all options” necessary to pressure Venezuela. The Cuban government did not respond to a request for comment.

2018-03-01,"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - Kiev and Moscow plunged into a new gas dispute on Thursday after Russia’s Gazprom (GAZP.MM) unexpectedly decided not to restart supplies, forcing Ukraine to cut usage despite freezing weather. Ukraine’s state-owned energy firm Naftogaz said it would ask heating firms to use 5-10 percent less gas for four days from  Saturday. It also said it would seek compensation from Gazprom. The row threatens to open a new front in a long-running legal battle between the companies - a by-product of broader political tension following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. It follows Wednesday’s international arbitration court order for Gazprom to pay $2.56 billion to Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit. On Thursday, Gazprom said it had returned a prepayment to Ukraine and would not restart gas supplies as an additional agreement to the existing arrangements had still not been reached. It did not give further details. “Clearly, gas supplies to Ukraine’s Naftogaz will not be carried out from March 1,” Gazprom’s deputy head Alexander Medvedev said in a statement. The decision is connected to the Stockholm arbitration court dispute because, in one of its rulings, the court ordered Naftogaz to buy 5 billion cubic metres of gas from Gazprom annually from 2018.  The March deliveries would have been the first time Ukraine bought gas from Russia since November 2015, when it started buying gas from Europe via so-called reverse flows to try to cut its energy dependency on Moscow. Reverse flows refer to buying Russian gas that has first been exported to another country. Naftogaz said it would seek damages from Gazprom for its failure to restart daily deliveries of 18-20 million cubic metres of gas, which has forced it to take emergency measures to make up for the shortage at a time when a Europe-wide cold snap has blanketed most of Ukraine with heavy snow. These include cutting short-term consumption and buying extra supplies from Europe, Naftogaz Chief Executive Andriy Kobolev said in televised comments. “These steps should be sufficient in order not to create a gas deficit in the system,” he said. In later comments, Kobolev said Gazprom’s decision meant Naftogaz was no longer bound by a clause in their agreement that requires buyers to pay for gas whether they take physical delivery or not. “They cannot demand ‘take or pay’ from us in 2018,” news agency Interfax Ukraine quoted him as saying.  Meanwhile, Gazprom said earlier on Thursday it would contest the Stockholm order for it to pay Naftogaz $2.56 billion. “Gazprom will defend its rights by all available means in accordance with the applicable law,” it said in a statement.      Disagreements between Gazprom and Naftogaz predate the collapse in relations between Ukraine and Russia in 2014 following the pro-European uprising in Kiev that ousted a Moscow-backed president. Pricing disputes in the past led to Russian gas supplies disruptions to Europe via Ukraine, including in 2009 and 2006. Since then Russia has been pushing for new pipeline projects via the Baltic and Black seas to bypass Ukraine.

2018-03-01,"HOUSTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will exit some joint ventures with Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM), citing Western sanctions first imposed in 2014, in a move that the Russian company said would result in serious losses for its U.S. partner. Rosneft said it would welcome Exxon’s return to the projects in the future if the “legal possibility arises”. The decision is an about-face for Exxon, which had opposed the sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Crimea and argued they unfairly penalized U.S. companies while allowing foreign energy rivals to operate in the country, the world’s largest oil producer. The sanctions slowed work on a project by Exxon and Rosneft on what was hailed as a major discovery in the Kara Sea above the Arctic Circle.  Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil company, said last year that it planned to return to operations at the project in 2019.  Exxon’s exit will not affect the Sakhalin project off the eastern coast of Russia, Exxon and Rosneft spokesmen said. Sakhalin-1 operates under a Production Sharing Agreement struck in the mid-1990s and currently produces around 200,000 barrels of oil per day.  Representatives for the U.S. Department of State and Treasury Department did not have immediate comment. The joint ventures were reached when U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was Exxon’s chief executive.  Tillerson has taken a hard line on Russia as secretary of state, in contrast to his position while at Exxon. His tougher stance appears to be an effort to reassure U.S. allies and other friendly nations of Washington’s backing amidst concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump’s relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Tillerson has said U.S. sanctions imposed for Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea would remain in place until Crimea is returned to Ukraine. He has accused Moscow of imposing its will on other nations by force and employing disinformation and cyber attacks to subvert Western democracies. The State Department said on Thursday Tillerson had recused himself from issues involving Exxon, and did not discuss the withdrawal with Exxon. A spokesperson would not comment on the company citing U.S. sanctions for the withdrawal.    ‘SAKHALIN-1 J/V NOT AFFECTED’ Rosneft spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said Exxon had been forced to take what he called a predictable decision, but confirmed the move would not affect the Sakhalin-1 joint venture. “It (Exxon) will suffer serious losses as a result of this (decision),” said Leontyev.  Rosneft also said in a separate statement that it would continue with the projects without Exxon, and that work with Exxon on projects not subject to sanctions, as well as on future projects, would continue. Exxon said it will formally start the process of withdrawing from the joint ventures this year.  In 2012, Exxon and Rosneft detailed an exploration partnership with plans to invest as much as $500 billion in developing Russia’s Arctic and Black Sea oil reserves. Further deals were signed in 2014. Rosneft said that resources at the projects, from which Exxon decided to withdraw, total 12.3 billion tonnes of oil and gas condensate as well as 15.2 trillion cubic metres of gas. Exxon said in a financial filing on Wednesday that it recorded a fourth quarter after-tax loss of $200 million due to the withdrawal plan. The U.S. government also imposed sanctions on Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin in 2014. The sanctions prohibit U.S. citizens or people in the United States from dealing with those on the blacklist, such as Sechin. Rosneft itself is subject to narrower U.S. sanctions that still allow Americans to deal with the company on some transactions. The U.S. government fined Exxon $2 million for signing the joint ventures just after sanctions were imposed in 2014, saying the company showed a “reckless disregard” for the sanctions.

2018-03-01,"(Adds market reaction to Trump comments on tariffs) * Canadian dollar, Mexican peso fall against greenback * Rate worry keeps markets on edge as Powell testifies * U.S. yield curve steepens after Fed chief comments * Oil slides on worries about crude supply, dollar By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity performance tumbled and the dollar strengthened against the Canadian and Mexican currencies on Thursday after President Donald Trump said the United States would impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports next week. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso hit session lows after Trump vowed to rebuild American steel and aluminum industries at a meeting of U.S. industry officials at the White House. U.S. steelmakers jumped on the news, with AK Steel Holding up 9.7 percent, U.S. Steel Corp gaining 7.1 percent and Nucor rising 2.85 percent. The administration has said duties would protect U.S. companies, but critics say they would raise costs for industry and fail to deliver on a Trump campaign pledge to boost domestic jobs. Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia, called Trump’s proposed tariffs a “bombshell” announcement that might help the steel and aluminum industry but ultimately hurt U.S. stocks. “It’s helping about a dozen stocks in those industries but has raised the specter of trade wars, and trade wars don’t help the stock market,” Tuz said. Stocks on Wall Street had mostly traded lower before Trump’s actions, weighed by remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to the Senate Banking Committee in Congress and New York Fed President William Dudley in Sao Paulo, Brazil. While Powell tried to temper remarks he made on Tuesday that raised concerns about the potential for four interest rate hikes this year rather than the Fed’s forecast of three, Dudley was a bit more pointed and said four rate hikes would be “gradual”. “By and large (Powell) painted the picture of an economy that is doing well and even a little bit better than expected, and that’s prompted fears of rising inflation. Four (rate hikes) this year is now the consensus I think,” Tuz said. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York, said tariffs have not worked historically and they cause retaliation. “This is sort of working your way into a trade war which is a drag on the economy. It is also inflationary so if you are worried about inflation it is going to pump that up,” Hogan said. MSCI’s gauge of stock performance in 47 countries shed 0.88 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.26 percent to close at 1,468.47. European markets had already closed by the time Trump’s comments about tariffs was reported. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 265.07 points, or 1.06 percent, to 24,764.13. The S&P 500 lost 21.52 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,692.31 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 59.12 points, or 0.81 percent, to 7,213.89. The dollar index rose 0.07 percent, with the euro up 0.11 percent to $1.2206. The Japanese yen weakened 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 106.75 per dollar. The Mexican peso lost 0.29 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.89, while the Canadian dollar fell 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 1.29 per dollar. The gap between short-dated U.S. borrowing costs and those in Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks by the Fed and European Central Bank for the two regions diverged. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last rose 9/32 in price to push yields lower to 2.8351 percent. U.S. consumer prices increased in January as a gauge of underlying inflation posting its largest gain in 12 months, but a survey showed the euro zone’s factory boom slowed a little further in February, pressuring euro zone yields lower. “In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. Oil fell more than 1 percent, hitting two-week lows on pressure from a strong dollar and worries that surging U.S. crude output might thwart efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to drain global supply. U.S. crude fell 51 cents to $61.13 per barrel and Brent was last at $63.95, down 78 cents on the day.

2018-03-01,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian jihadist rebels took back some ground on Thursday from rival insurgent groups near Syria’s border with Turkey after losing control of several towns to them in recent days, rebels and residents said.  The rebel-held area in northwestern Syria is their biggest remaining stronghold, and since last year it has been in the grip of Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance spearheaded by a former affiliate of al Qaeda.  Last month two of its rivals joined forces in a new alliance of rebel groups affiliated with the Free Syrian Army and in the past 10 days they have pushed Tahrir al-Sham from several towns and villages.  Their attack on Tahrir al-Sham came against the backdrop of big street protests in some of the towns it controls in the area against the local civilian administration.  However, in fighting on Wednesday and Thursday, it regained some territory and strengthened its position along the border with Turkey - an important strategic possession - the rebels and residents said. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has gained momentum in the war since Russia joined on his side in 2015, and has seized advantage of rebel in-fighting at points in the conflict for military advantage.  Increased conflict in the rebel-held northwest, an area that includes Idlib province and parts of Aleppo province, risks worsening the already dire situation of a million displaced people from other parts of Syria who have fled there.  Turkey also closely watches developments in northwest Syria, where it has established several observation posts in recent months as part of an agreement with Russia and Iran to reduce warfare.  The new alliance fighting against Tahrir al-Sham is called Jabhat Tahrir Soria - the Liberation of Syria Front - and was formed by two powerful groups called Ahrar al-Sham and Nour al-Din al-Zinki.  The clashes across several towns in both Idlib and Aleppo provinces in the last 10 days have killed and wounded scores of people, according to rebels from both sides.     The fighting was close to camps where tens of thousands of civilians have taken shelter from recent heavy bombardment by the Syrian government and Russia’s air force.  More than two million people live in Idlib province, about half of them displaced people including rebel fighters and their families, according to the United Nations. In recent days Tahrir al-Sham pulled back many of its fighters to a string of positions along the Turkish border, witnesses said.  “They have moved to the area around the crossing, where they are reinforcing their presence,” said Bassam Haji Mustafa,  a senior official in the new alliance, Jabhat Tahrir Soria. They also launched counter-attacks to regain the village of Kafr Lusein, near the border, and to push back into other towns including Maraat Misreen.  Street protests against the civilian administrations linked to Tahrir al-Sham complained about financial levies imposed on local people, which range from the licensing of pharmacies to issuing number plates for vehicles.  “Let them first repel the regime and its militias from the doorsteps of Idlib before trying to burden already suffering people,” said Abdullah Sheikh, a trader in Atma town. In two other towns, Khan Sheikhoun and Saraqeb, local dignitaries have forced Tahrir al-Sham and other rebel groups to sign neutrality pacts to spare their towns from the in-fighting. But the fear of an all-out war among rebel factions long divided by both ideology and local power struggles has kept other insurgent groups on the sidelines, containing the violence.

2018-03-01,"TEPIC, Mexico, March 1 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A global effort to quantify the impact of disasters - from droughts to hurricanes - is underway to work out how countries can deal better with them, the United Nations said on Thursday. The U.N. Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNISDR) said compiling a complete picture of how countries were affected would protect the most vulnerable, and show which risk-reduction strategies worked best. “It is impossible to prevent disasters and to manage risk if a country is not measuring its disaster losses,” said Mami Mizutori, U.N. special representative for disaster risk reduction. “Such losses are a great setback for sustainable growth and development,” she said in a statement. UNISDR said that 144 countries had indicated that they would send their 2017 data by the end of March to its Sendai Framework Monitor online data capture system. That would show the impact of disasters, including the number of people affected, the number of deaths, infrastructure damage and economic losses. It would also indicate how countries were proceeding with local and national disaster-risk reduction plans, UNISDR said. The Sendai Framework, which was agreed three years ago, set ambitious targets for governments to cut deaths and economic losses from disasters by 2030. Countries taking part face a 2020 deadline to implement disaster plans under the framework, which aims to limit disruption to basic services such as health and education, and improve access to early warning systems. The U.N.’s Mizutori said 26 million people a year were at risk of being pushed into poverty by extreme weather events and climate change. ""The silent, small-recurring disasters such as floods and droughts can take a huge toll on communities which lack essential health services and other coping capacities,"" Mizutori said.

2018-03-01,"(Adds executive comment from interview, updates share price, paragraphs 5-8) By Rod Nickel March 1 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Canadian Natural Resources Ltd said on Thursday it will slow its output of heavy crude due to a steep price discount tied to tight transportation capacity from the landlocked Alberta province. CNRL, one of Canada’s largest heavy oil and gas producers, is delaying the completion and production ramp-up of some wells that produce heavy oil, President Tim McKay said on a conference call with analysts. “Although oil is moving, the (price) differentials are behaving as if the oil can’t move,” McKay said. The company is also considering reducing its heavy oil drilling program in the second half, and switching to more light oil drilling, McKay said. In an interview, McKay said he expects the cumulative effect of slowing heavy output from new wells and advancing the timing of planned outages at some production sites will be “quite minor” for overall production. “We look at the differentials all the time and our ability to start and stop our drilling program, based on what’s going on with the commodities,” he said. Earlier on Thursday, CNRL’s fourth-quarter profit beat estimates, boosted by higher oil production and higher prices. The company’s Toronto-listed shares were up 65 Canadian cents, or 1.6 percent, to C$40.40. Alberta oil producers have struggled to move crude to U.S. refineries due to strained pipeline and rail capacity, leading to a bigger-than-usual discount on Canadian heavy crude, called Western Canada Select (WCS), compared to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light oil. Heavy crude must be diluted to move through pipelines, adding cost. CNRL’s heavy oil output was 1 percent higher during the fourth quarter than the preceding quarter. The company expanded its Horizon oil sands site last year. WCS heavy crude was trading on Thursday at $24.70 per barrel below WTI, according to Shorcan Energy Brokers data. The Alberta government on Wednesday estimated that the higher-than-usual differential was costing heavy oil producers C$30 million to C$40 million in revenue per day. Overall daily production during the quarter rose 19 percent to 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). The company’s net income fell to C$396 million ($308.17 million), or 32 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from C$566 million, or 51 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 46 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 36 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-03-01,"HANOVER, Germany, March 1 (Reuters) - Volkswagen’s bosses missed warning signs ahead of its diesel emissions scandal, but did not break market rules by delaying the disclosure of its problems, the carmaker’s lawyers  said in a submission to a German court reviewed by Reuters. Investors from around the world are seeking 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in damages from Volkswagen (VW), which they say didn’t inform shareholders quickly enough over its use of illegal software to cheat U.S. tests on diesel engine emissions. About 1,600 lawsuits, nearly all from institutional investors, have been lodged at a regional court in Braunschweig near VW’s Wolfsburg headquarters, seeking damages over the sharp fall in VW shares that followed its admission of wrongdoing. In a 300-page submission to the court on Wednesday, lawyers for Europe’s largest automaker said it had no duty to disclose the possible financial damage of its manipulations prior to Sept. 22, 2015, when it issued an ad-hoc statement that the illegal software could be in around 11 million cars worldwide Although the company had admitted its cheating to U.S. authorities on Sept. 3, 2015, it believed potential fines from regulators and vehicle refitting costs would not exceed 300 million euros ($366 million) and therefore would not lead to a significant drop in the stock price, sources close to VW said. Had the company believed the financial cost of its cheating could have reached 1 billion euros or more, it would have considered an earlier ad-hoc release, the sources added. Since the “dieselgate” scandal became public, VW has set aside around $30 billion to cover fines, vehicle refits to remove the illegal “defeat device” software and other costs. “In the past there have again and again been violations of the defeat device ban in U.S. environmental law but without the affected companies getting sanctioned in a draconian and hard way,” VW lawyers said in the submission. “An escalation of the matter ... wasn’t expected, neither by the defendants nor by their advisers,” they added. The sources said former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, who resigned within a week of the scandal breaking, was informed in an internal memo in May 2014 that VW models had violated U.S. emissions rules and U.S. authorities would check whether the carmaker was using illegal software. However, they said the implications of this were not grasped at the time. Winterkorn said when he resigned that he was not aware of any wrongdoing on his part. Public hearings of the case at the Braunschweig court are due to start in early September. $1 = 0.8187 euros

2018-03-01,"(Adds U.S. markets open, dateline, byline; previous LONDON) * Rate worry keeps markets on edge as Powell testifies * European shares slide on poor results * US yield curve steepens after Fed chief comments * Oil slides on worries about crude supply, dollar By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose to a six-week high on Thursday on solid U.S. economic data, but remarks by the new Federal Reserve chief that there no evidence of an overheating economy pushed bond yields lower even as stocks wavered on Wall Street. In his second testimony in Congress this week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell also told the Senate Banking Committee that the U.S. central bank did not see any evidence of a decisive advance in wages. The remarks tempered market concerns from his testimony on Tuesday that sparked fears about a quicker pace of inflation. Larry Hatheway, chief economist at GAM Investment Management in Zurich, said there was a lack of conviction in the market as U.S. stocks traded above and below break-even and bond yields pulled back from a recent march higher. Trading was algorithmic or related to positioning, he said, as the market was pulled by inflation concerns on the one hand and sharply higher expectations for earnings growth that strong global growth was driving. “I don’t think that there are very many people who take a fundamental view on markets who are changing their views much. They’re all sitting back and basically watching but not acting,” Hatheway said. The dollar index, tracking the U.S. unit against a basket of major currencies, was flat, with the euro up 0.16 percent to $1.2212. The Japanese yen weakened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 106.97 per dollar. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.25 percent, but the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares lost 1.26 percent to close at a provisional 516.59.

Comments by New York Fed President William Dudley stoked the embers of rate-hike fears during remarks in Sao Paulo, Brazil, where he said four rate hikes - or one more than the Fed has forecast this year - would be gradual.

2018-03-01,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia has scrapped a peace agreement it signed with Turkey in 2009 in a failed attempt to normalise relations between the two countries, the Armenian president’s press service said on Thursday. Armenia and Turkey signed the landmark peace accord to restore ties and open their shared border after a century of hostility stemming from the World War One mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman forces. The deal needed parliamentary approval in both countries, but was never ratified, and the Armenian and Turkish governments have since accused each other of trying to change the deal. “As a result of discussions, President (Serzh) Sarksyan signed a decree and a national security council approved a procedure of annulling protocols which have been signed on October 10, 2009,” the press service said in a statement. The press service quoted Sarksyan as saying that Armenia did everything “not to leave the burden of the settlement of relations between Armenia and Turkey on the shoulders of future generations.” “But Ankara ... did not even make a single step towards ratification and implementation of protocols, but also left no doubt that it was not intending to do it,” Sarksyan said. He added that Armenia was ready to cooperate with Turkey in the future, if “there would be the same willingness from the Turkish side.” There was no immediate reaction from Turkey.     Armenia suspended its ratification following Turkish demands that it first reach terms over a breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, a condition Turkey set to appease its ally Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan feared it would lose leverage in negotiations to win back Nagorno-Karabakh, which it lost to Armenian-backed forces in the bloodiest of the ethnic conflicts which followed the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union. Armenian President Sarksyan also faced vehement opposition from nationalists at home and the powerful Armenian diaspora abroad. “The leadership of Turkey are mistaken if they think that those documents can be held hostage forever and ratified only at the most opportune occasion from their very point of view,” Sarksyan said in a speech at the United Nation’s General Assembly last autumn.

2018-03-01,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - A severe drought afflicting South Africa’s Western Cape province is expected to cut agricultural output by 20 percent this year, decimating the wheat crop and reducing apple, grape and pear exports to Europe, officials said on Thursday. South Africa has declared a national disaster in its southern and western regions including Cape Town, freeing extra funds to tackle the crisis. Cape Town itself faces “Day Zero” on July 9 when its taps could run dry. Alan Winde, Western Cape’s economic opportunities minister, projected losses of 5.9 billion rand ($495 million), up from a previous estimate of 4.9 billion, due to record wheat losses and a strong currency that has crimped exports. “If we compare the past quarter to the same time period last year, we see the severe impact that this drought is beginning to have on jobs and livelihoods,” Winde said, adding that 30,000 jobs had been lost. The drought has forced the Western Cape farm sector to cut water use by 60 percent, denting output, he added. Among the worst hit crops is wheat, whose output is projected to plunge to 586,000 tonnes in 2018 from 1.1 million tonnes harvested in the previous year - a 2.4-billion-rand loss for the grain sector. South Africa’s total wheat harvest has been put at 1.52 million tonnes in 2018, down from 1.90 million tonnes in 2017.  This will force a more than 100 percent rise in wheat imports to 2.1 million tonnes in 2018 from 935,000 tonnes last year, industry body Grain SA said on Thursday. Grain SA senior economist Corne Louw said South Africa has been a net importer of wheat for some years, mainly from Russia, Lithuania and other east European countries. The drought is also expected to curb exports of South African apples, pears and grapes, mainly to Britain and other European Union states, as well as Russia and the Far East by 13-20 percent this year.  Western Cape’s famed wine industry has also struggled under the prolonged drought, with forecasts indicating the next grape harvest could be the smallest since 2005.  South Africa normally exports around 440 million litres of wine annually and is the world’s ninth largest producer.  Cape Town, whose picturesque ocean front location with mountain backdrop is a major tourist draw, expects to run out of water on July 9 unless residents can stick to a rationing plan limiting them to a maximum of 50 litres per person per day. The city is drilling for underground water in three locations to help rebuild supplies and hopes this will yield a peak of 150 million litres a day by the end of 2018. A series of restrictions imposed over the past three years has cut collective consumption by over half since 2015, as city officials look to see out the hot summer months into winter, when rain normally replenishes reservoirs. “If each one of us continues to use 50 litres a day, we can not only beat Day Zero this year but also be in a better position to avoid it next year,” said Deputy Mayor Ian Neilson.

2018-03-01,"WARSAW (Reuters) - The Polish government’s proposal to merge the country’s two state oil refiners, announced this week, faces opposition from the mayor of Gdansk who said he would fight the plan as it would hit jobs and tax revenues in the city. Refiner PKN Orlen (PKN.WA) announced on Tuesday that it plans to buy a 53 percent stake in Gdansk-based Lotos (LTSP.WA), its smaller rival, within a year. A merger of PKN and Lotos has been mooted by Polish government officials on and off for years but never materialized mainly due to opposition from local authorities.  Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz, who is also a member of Poland’s biggest opposition party Civic Platform, said Gdansk authorities were also ready to fight the planned merger.  He told a press conference that he had written to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki calling on the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) to abandon the plan, which he said would see Lotos’s headquarters move from Gdansk and the region would lose a significant number of jobs and revenue from local taxes paid by Lotos. “We want Lotos to be based here, in Gdansk - and the decisions about its development to be taken here - as it has been for the last 40 years,” Adamowicz, who will stand for re-election as mayor in the autumn, said. “We will do everything in order (to get) PiS to withdraw this terrible decision,” he said.

2018-03-01,"EDINBURGH/DUBLIN (Reuters) - Snow storms from Siberia blasted Britain and Ireland on Thursday with the worst weather since 1991, trapping several hundred motorists on roads in Scotland, closing thousands of schools, grounding planes and halting trains. With up to 90 cm of snow and temperatures as low as minus 10.3 Celsius in Scotland, Britain and Ireland issued their most severe red warnings which advise people to stay at home as travel is too dangerous. Dozens of people were trapped in their cars on the M80 motorway between Glasgow and Edinburgh, with several hundred having been standed on the road overnight. Flights and trains were canceled across both Britain and Ireland - with similar transport problems in continental Europe.   More freezing snowy weather was forecast as Storm Emma approaches from Portugal and France, with warnings of treacherous weather across southern England and Ireland. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said people should remain indoors from 1600 GMT on Thursday until the storm, with winds forecast to reach 100 kph (60 mph), has passed. “The risk to life and limb presented by the severe weather conditions should not be underestimated by anyone,” he said following a meeting of the National Emergency Coordination Group. “It is not safe to be outside in such conditions.” All flights will cease from Dublin airport by 1600 GMT and the two carriers that use the airport, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, said they do not plan to fly from the airport at all on Friday. Trains and planes were canceled across Britain and Ireland. Emergency services also struggled on what many consider to be the first day of the Northern Hemisphere’s Spring. One doctor told Reuters that staff were snowed in at a hospital near Glasgow, and another doctor told the BBC of a surgeon colleague who walked almost three hours in the snow to the town of Paisley to perform a cancer operation.  Wholesale gas prices soared to their highest in at least 10 years on Thursday and the British power network regular, the National Grid, warned of a deficit in the market and sought to buy gas from market players to unblock bottlenecks. The cold spell, dubbed the “the Beast from the East”, has been caused by a jump in temperatures high over the Arctic which has weakened the jet stream that brings warm air in from the Atlantic to Ireland and Britain. Britain’s two busiest airports, Heathrow and Gatwick, both said that flights would be canceled. Police in Lincolnshire, eastern England, said that all roads were impassable. Britain’s Met Office warned that freezing rain was likely across southern England as Storm Emma pushes northwards from Portugal and France, adding that it looked set to be the coldest spell in Britain since 1991.  In Scotland, there were widespread road closures and no trains running on the two main lines to and from England. Police were rescuing stranding motorists, and found a vulnerable man in what they described as “life threatening weather conditions”. Both Edinburgh and Glasgow airports were closed. Some places in southern Scotland were under such heavy of snow, it affected funeral services in Hawick, near the border with England. “The issue for digging the grave is getting into the burial ground, and we’ve had about 3 feet (90 cm) of snow here,” Ross Walsh of Robson’s Funeral Directors told Reuters. Ireland was bracing for the biggest snow fall since 1982 with public transport halted and schools across the republic closed. The Irish stock market said it would close from midday on Thursday and remain closed all day Friday. In Switzerland, Geneva airport closed for several hours and dozens of flights were canceled. Snow also disrupted road and rail traffic. France had its share of snow too, even on the beaches of the Riviera coast in the southeast.  The worst was in the south where hundreds of cars and trucks were stranded on the A9 motorway, a strip that links southern France and Spain. The airport in Montpelier was closed for a period overnight but partially reopened on Thursday. Upwards of 15,000 homes along the Mediterranean were without power on Thursday morning, power network company Enedis said. It also snowed across much of northern Italy overnight, bringing fresh disruption to a rail network already hard hit by heavy snow across the south at the start of the week.  Schools in Florence were ordered to shut, while heavy goods vehicles were banned from the roads in the north.  In the Netherlands, strong winds caused problems. At Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport, only two of the six landing strips could be used on Thursday morning. Authorities had to close sea barriers south of Rotterdam to protect shipping.

2018-03-01,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia’s parliament is set to elect Armen Sarkissian on Friday as national president to succeed Serzh Sarksyan, who opposition leaders say could become prime minister and continue to wield power. Sarkissian’s election to a single seven-year term is unopposed because the ruling Republican Party supports him even though he is not a member of any party. One opposition party says it will back him while another has failed to gather sufficient votes to present its own candidate and will vote against. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy.      The country is in line with some other former Soviet republics and countries in eastern Europe in moving away from direct democracy and towards strong central leadership, according to analysts. Sarksyan became president at an election in 2008 and nominated former prime minister Sarkissian in January to succeed him as his term neared its end.     The legislature can elect a president with a three-quarters majority under the terms of a constitution approved in 2015 in a referendum that effectively abolishes direct presidential elections. Under that constitution, however, the presidency will become largely ceremonial and power will shift to the prime minister and parliament. “If I’m elected, I will put all my efforts and my experience into the solution of national problems,” Sarkissian told the parliament on Thursday. Members of the ruling party said Sarkissian, 64, a businessman and Yerevan’s ambassador to Britain, was the best candidate for the post given his experience as a diplomat and a manager as well as ties abroad. One opposition faction decided to vote against. “Your affiliation with a (ruling) political team and a responsibility, which you take, put us on different side fo barricades,” said opposition MP Ararat Mirzoyan. Sarksyan denies that the new constitution was engineered to allow him to continue to dominate Armenia, a country of around three million people. But many members of the ruling party say Sarksyan would be the best candidate for prime minister given his experience, especially in negotiations over neighbouring Azerbaijan’s breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Fighting between ethnic Azeris and Armenian separatists backed by Armenia first erupted in 1991 and a ceasefire was agreed in 1994. But Azerbaijan and Armenia accuse each other of violence around Nagorno-Karabakh and along their common border. Clashes over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians, have intensified in the past three years and turned into a violent flare-up in April 2016. Armenia’s ruling party won parliamentary elections last April with 49 percent of the vote while the opposition Tsarukyan Alliance took 27 percent.

2018-03-01,"PARIS (Reuters) - General Electric plans to invest more than $400 million over the next three to five years to develop the world’s biggest offshore wind turbine, which will have a capacity of 12 megawatts and stand 260 meters (853 feet) tall.  With 107-metre blades, longer than a soccer field, the Haliade-X turbine will produce enough power for up to 16,000 households, GE said in a statement.  “We want to lead in the technologies that are driving the global energy transition,” CEO John Flannery said. GE Renewable Energy will develop and manufacture the new turbine largely in France and aims to supply its first nacelle, - or power generating unit - for demonstration in 2019 and ship the first turbines in 2021. The firm will invest close to $100 million in a new blade manufacturing plant in Cherbourg, western France, which will open in 2018. It will also invest close to $60 million over the next five years to modernize its Saint-Nazaire factory, where the nacelles for the Haliade-X will be built.  GE, already a major global player in onshore wind, entered the offshore wind turbine market through its takeover of France’s Alstom in 2015.  GE said the new turbine - which will have a direct-drive power generator rather than a gearbox - will be 30 percent bigger than its nearest competitors.  In June 2017, MHI Vestas, a joint venture between Vestas and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, launched a 9.5 MW offshore turbine, currently the world’s most powerful wind turbine.  Standing 187 meters tall and with 80-metre blades, it is an upgrade of MHI Vestas’ 8 MW V164 turbine, which is already in operation at the Burbo Bank Extension and Blyth offshore wind farms in Britain.  MHI Vestas has also been named preferred supplier for Britain’s Triton Knoll and Moray East offshore wind farms for a total of 190 of the 9.5 MW turbines.  An MHI Vestas spokesman declined to comment on future turbine development.  The size of offshore wind turbines - which unlike onshore turbines is not limited by overland truck transport - has grown rapidly in recent years as bigger turbines capture more wind and reduce maintenance costs and capital spending. Onshore wind turbines in Europe have average capacities of about 2.7 megawatt, less than half the 6 MW average capacity of offshore turbines, according to trade group Wind Europe.

2018-03-01,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) By Susanna Twidale LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - British households were told to “carry on cooking” by the government on Thursday, as a warning of a gas supply deficit spooked the market and raised questions over the country’s gas policy. A nationwide cold snap with temperatures as low as minus 10.3 degrees Celsius and widespread snow has led to a sharp increase in gas demand which is used to heat as much as 80 percent of Britain’s homes and also for cooking. Prices for within-day gas delivery have more than quadrupled since the start of the week to 300 pence per therm on Thursday, the highest in at least 10 years. Energy minister Claire Perry said there would be no disruption to domestic supplies and encouraged Britons to “carrying on using your gas heating and cooking meals as normal”. National Grid, which maintains the country’s gas and electricity systems, also moved to calm the country and said its early morning alert over a potential gas deficit was a part of its “tool kit” to secure supplies from the market. But the warning has re-ignited concerns that Britain has become too reliant on imports of gas and is vulnerable to supply shocks, especially after the closure last year of the country’s largest gas storage site Rough. At its operational peak the more than 30-year-old site could hold 10 percent of Britain’s gas demand, but operator British Gas-owner Centrica announced its closure last year, and said its maintenance had become too costly. “Allowing Centrica to close (Rough) without consideration for supply during cold snaps ... put households and businesses at risk of shortages and price spikes,” said Jonathan Marshall an analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Britain has many sources of gas supply and Rough’s closure did not undermine the country’s security of gas supplies. “As part of our ongoing dialogue with the industry, representatives from across the storage industry will meet at the Department later this month to discuss the market’s investment in gas storage,” she said via email. “Ultimately, decisions on investment in gas storage are made by the market,” she said. Wholesale electricity prices in Britain have also soared by more than 20 percent to almost 100 pounds per megawatt hour on Thursday. The cold snap comes just days after a law was introduced in Britain’s parliament aimed a capping consumers’ energy bills, a move which Centrica said could hurt competition. BEIS said it did not expect the wholesale price rise to lead to higher prices for households as energy firms typically hedge their exposure to commodity prices many months in advance. “We would therefore not expect this short-term increase in wholesale prices to feed through to household bills,” the spokeswoman said.

2018-03-01,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s parliament demanded on Thursday that the government set a timeline for the withdrawal of foreign troops stationed in the country to help fight Islamic State (IS) insurgents, a ruling coalition lawmaker said. A U.S.-led coalition was formed in 2014 and with thousands of troops and air support helped Iraqi security forces and a Kurdish-led Syrian militia roll back IS across large swathes of Iraq and Syria and destroy the cross-border caliphate set up by the jihadists. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared victory over IS in December. IS has since reverted to a guerrilla-style insurgency and continues to carry out attacks on selected targets. The Iraqi parliament’s demand underscores the balancing act Abadi must conduct between the United States and Iran, his two biggest military allies who are themselves arch-adversaries.  There are no Iranian regular forces in Iraq but there are Iranian-backed Shi’ite militia allied with Abadi’s government. “Parliament voted for a decision to thank friendly nations for their support in defeating Islamic State and at the same time to demand the government set a timeline for the withdrawal of foreign troops,” lawmaker Husham al-Suhail told Reuters. “It is up to the government to decide how long we need them here - one year, two years, it’s up to them.” Thursday’s vote, backed by all but a handful of the 177 lawmakers present, was sponsored by lawmakers from the ruling Shi’ite Muslim bloc in parliament. “The timing of the vote, right before the election, is a message from pro-Iran parties that they do not want American troops in Iraq forever,” said political analyst Ahmed Younis. “They are achieving two things - pressure on Abadi’s government to expel foreign troops, as well as scoring political points before the election.” Abadi is seeking a second term in parliamentary elections scheduled for May. A spokesman for the coalition told Reuters the presence of its troops hinged on Iraqi government approval. “Our continued presence in Iraq will be conditions-based, proportional to need, in coordination with and by the approval of the Iraqi government,” said U.S. Army Colonel Ryan Dillon.  The coalition says it has begun a transition from focusing on retaking territory to consolidating gains. It has trained 125,000 members of the Iraqi security forces, 22,000 of which were regional Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, and helped retake almost a third of Iraq from Islamic State through air and logistical support. The coalition has drawn criticism, however, for the number of civilian casualties resulting from air strikes. At least 841 civilians were killed this way as of January 2018. It says it goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties.

2018-03-01,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The falling cost of wind and solar power puts higher renewable energy targets within reach, according to a European Commission study seen by Reuters, pressuring EU legislators to set more ambitious climate goals. Tough talks are now underway between EU nations and the European Parliament to set new targets for renewable energy’s share of the bloc’s overall energy use from 2021 to 2030. EU lawmakers are pushing for renewables to account for at least a 35 percent share by 2030, while national governments agreed a target of 27 percent. The new study by the EU executive, which updates 2016 policy cost projections, says lower costs together with other draft measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions could cut the cost of achieving a 27 percent target by 2.9 billion euros ($3.5 billion) a year. The cost of reaching a 30 percent target in today’s market would be comparable to reaching a 27 percent target under estimates in the 2016 assessment. “Such lower costs for the energy system are explained by lower investment needs for the same renewable electricity capacity,” the study says. It foresees a transition to lower-emission technologies in the power, building and transport sectors to reach the bloc’s climate goals. The draft measures are aimed at helping the European Union meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, following the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to no more than 2 degrees. Environmental campaigners said legislators must take the new economic modeling into consideration. “They should serve as a wake-up call,” said Jean-Francois Fauconnier of the Climate Action Network Europe lobby group.

2018-03-01,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s government wants a controlling stake in the Bulgarian assets of Czech utility CEZ (CEZP.PR), which are being sold, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said on Friday. CEZ has signed a contract with a small Bulgarian solar energy producer, Inercom, to sell a power distributor that provides electricity to over three million Bulgarians, along with other assets. The deal has raised concerns in Bulgaria over Inercom’s ability to finance and operate strategic energy assets. “The talks are at quite an early stage. We expressed clearly our will that we want to participate in this deal, one way or another,” Goranov told reporters after a meeting between Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Inercom’s owner, Ginka Varbakova.  When asked what stake Bulgaria would like to have, Goranov said, “at least a controlling stake.” The deal, whose value was not disclosed but is estimated at around 320 million euros ($390 million), has drawn headlines in both countries. Transparency International also said on Thursday the deal “raises red flags” and worries over the sources of funds for its financing. “Governments must ensure that state-owned enterprises and companies providing essential public services are held to the highest standards of transparency and accountability,” said Patricia Moreira, managing director of Transparency International.  Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said in a statement he had talked to Borissov and told his counterpart that CEZ management had assured him that, after its checks on Inercom and its financing, there was no reason the deal should not go through. Inercom’s Varbakova said she was leaving for Prague to hold talks with CEZ and she was willing to let the Bulgarian state in on the deal, provided that CEZ agrees. “If it will calm down the final consumers, yes, I am willing to accept state participation in the deal. I am willing to transfer the contract I have if the seller would agree to that. These talks are pending,” she said.    CEZ, though, said it had no information on Bulgaria’s intention to take a controlling stake in the assets. A spokesman said the company would wait to hear from Inercom but added the contract was already signed.

2018-03-01,"(Updates prices) * Fed chief Powell to deliver second part of testimony * World stocks weaker on first day of March * But dollar firm at six-week highs * U.S./German two-year bond yield gap widest since 1997 * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - World stock markets entered March on shaky ground on Thursday, falling for the third straight day before the second leg of U.S. Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell’s testimony to lawmakers. The testimony, due at 1500 GMT, will come two days after his hawkish comments ignited fears the Fed could deliver four U.S. rate rises this year instead of the three already priced in, triggering an equity sell-off and pushing up bond yields. The U.S. dollar rose to six-week highs against a basket of currencies while the gap between short-dated U.S. and German bond yields was at its widest since 1997. MSCI’s all-country equity benchmark fell 0.4 percent after snapping a record 15-month long winning streak in February, while European stocks lost 1 percent. Emerging Asian and Japanese shares also fell earlier, with the latter down 1.6 percent. Wall Street looked set for another weak open, futures signalled, after it ended February with its worst monthly performance in two years. Chinese shares bucked the trend, however, edging up after a private survey showed manufacturing sector growth picking up to a six-month high. Shanghai shares closed 0.4 percent higher. Fed chief Powell will deliver the second leg of his semi-annual testimony on Thursday, an opportunity to clarify comments made on Tuesday that rekindled speculation over U.S. monetary tightening this year happening faster than expected. Powell on Tuesday vowed to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates. For equity markets, the fear is that a pick-up in the pace of rate rises could crimp corporate activity and cool economic growth. Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec in London said Powell’s testimony was unlikely to change from the one he delivered on Tuesday, putting the focus on the question and answer session. “He (Powell) appears to have got an easy ride from lawmakers in the sense that the technical questioning on Tuesday wasn’t too heavy,” Shaw said. “He may not have such an easy time today with the Senate Banking Committee.” The dollar meanwhile has taken heart from the Fed chair’s comments. The dollar index rose to 90.818, a six-week high. It has clawed back from the three-year trough of 88.253 set in mid-February, as fears of a ballooning U.S. budget deficit and worries of a possible weak-dollar policy from Washington took a toll. The gap between short-dated borrowing costs in the United States and Germany was at its widest in over 20 years as the monetary policy outlooks for the two regions diverge. The U.S./Germany two-year bond yield spread widened to 281 basis points. In contrast to rising rate-hike speculation in the United States, data on Wednesday showing euro zone inflation slowed to a 14-month low in February highlighted that a rate rise from the European Central Bank remains some way off. “In the U.S. we have at least three rate hikes this year, but in the euro zone, there was some exaggeration about where the inflation was heading so that is now being priced out and yields are moving to the downside,” said DZ Bank strategist Daniel Lenz. That divergence in rate outlooks also weighed on the euro, which hovered at a six-week low at around $1.2173. The dollar was little changed at 106.69 yen, having slipped from the week’s peak of 107.680 as broader risk aversion favoured its Japanese peer. The Australian dollar was down 0.4 percent at $0.7730 after brushing $0.7710, its lowest since late December.

2018-03-01,"(Repeats story first published on Wednesday, no change to text) By Andrew Cawthorne and Vivian Sequera CARACAS, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Venezuelan presidential candidate Henri Falcon said on Wednesday he would like a Wall Street economist, who sees dollarization as the solution for hyper-inflation in Venezuela, to play a big role on his team if he wins the upcoming election. Falcon said Francisco Rodriguez, a Venezuelan who is chief economist at Torino Capital and advising him informally, would be the ideal leader of his economic team should he defeat socialist President Nicolas Maduro. “What is the cancer of Venezuela, apart from the government? The economy. So the economy is for specialists,” he told Reuters during an interview at his new offices in Caracas. “Francisco is a man with many qualifications, but he is also a politician recognized internally and abroad ... We need to build a really good team led by a great economist, that’s Francisco Rodriguez.” Rodriguez, one of the most influential analysts of Venezuela’s dysfunctional economy, has recently been suggesting the bolivar currency should be scrapped for the U.S. dollar as an extreme measure to fix runaway inflation by stopping the government from printing excess money. Rodriguez also believes Venezuela - in the fifth year of crippling recession that has left millions hungry and created widespread shortages - would receive major help from international loan bodies like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund under a new government. Speaking to Reuters earlier on Wednesday on the sidelines of a Caracas forum, Rodriguez confirmed he was giving informal advice to Falcon. “I’m a friend, I respect him,” he said. He told the forum Falcon would make an excellent president. “This country cannot survive six more years of Nicolas Maduro, this country doesn’t deserve that,” he added. Falcon, a former state governor who has broken with an opposition boycott to run against Maduro, said he would prioritize repairing relations with Washington should he win the vote slated for April 22. While most analysts give him little chance, some recent polls actually put him ahead of Maduro in voter preferences. “The United States would have a potential ally in a new Venezuelan government,” said Falcon, who defines himself as a center-leftist in favor of both market-friendly policies and strong welfare protection programs. Falcon implied he disagreed with possible U.S. oil sanctions against OPEC member Venezuela, saying he opposed any measures that “end up hurting the poor.” U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has already slapped some individual sanctions on officials it deems guilty of rights abuses or eroding democracy in Venezuela, and has also imposed measures to block new financing for the government. It is pondering measures against the oil sector if Maduro does not improve conditions for the election, which critics say has been rigged to legitimize “dictatorship.” Falcon, a 56-year-old former military man who supported the ruling socialists until a 2010 split, has drawn the wrath of Venezuela’s opposition coalition by throwing his hat into the ring and undercutting their boycott policy. “Abstention is no use,” he said, pointing to past boycotts that had given the socialists big uncontested wins and arguing that 80 percent of Venezuelans wanted change. “In world history, at least for the last two centuries, no government has won an election at a time of hyper-inflation,” he added, citing the price of a box of eggs equivalent to nearly two-thirds of the minimum monthly wage. Prices in Venezuela rose more than 4,000 percent in the 12 months to the end of January,  according to estimates by the country’s opposition-led National Assembly, broadly in line with independent economists’ figures. Falcon is demanding improved election conditions, including a later vote date, U.N. observers, an end to “harassment” of Maduro opponents, and the removal of government handout booths known as “red spots” to curry favor with voters often set up near polling centers. Without guarantees, he may withdraw his candidacy. Falcon said he would like veteran Venezuelan politician Eduardo Fernandez, a former presidential candidate for opposition party COPEI, to be his foreign minister. He would not be drawn on specific economic policy ideas, beyond saying he wanted to prioritize tackling inflation and supported a unified currency exchange system instead of the current mix of government and black market rates.

2018-03-01,"(Repeats to widen distribution) By Jarrett Renshaw NEW YORK, March 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday will gather rivals from the oil and corn industries for the second time this week as the administration seeks elusive common ground on reforms to the nation’s controversial biofuels law. The meetings come amid rising concern in the White House over the current state of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel, which has increasingly divided two of Trump’s most important constituencies. A refining company, Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania, last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy. A meeting earlier in the week ended with Iowa Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst calling the White House efforts to help refiners cope with the regulation a threat to farmers, and vowing to fight proposed changes. Grassley and Ernst, along with Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Pat Toomey of refining states Texas and Pennsylvania, will be in attendance again on Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the planning of the event. A number of companies will also be represented. Executives from refiners Valero Energy Corp, Delta Air Lines’, Monroe Energy and PBF Energy Inc will be there along with a union representative from the bankrupt PES, the largest and oldest refiner on the East Coast, the sources said. The biofuel industry will be represented by officials from major producers POET and Green Plains Inc, along with others, the two sources said. Trump will be joined by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who will be sitting in for U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he attends events in California, they said. Cruz’s office and POET confirmed attendance to Reuters. Representatives for the other parties, including the White House, either did not respond or declined to comment. Under the RFS, refiners must cover the costs of blending increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year. To prove compliance with the program, they have to acquire credits called RINs, either by earning them through blending or by buying them. The price of RINs has surged in recent years, meaning refiners without blending facilities have faced higher costs. At Tuesday’s meeting, Grassley and Ernst were asked to consider accepting a proposed ceiling on the price of RINs in exchange for a concession to the ethanol that would allow broader sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends. “Senator Ernst and I suggested specific policy changes that would be a win-win for biofuels and oil. But we’ve made it clear all along that a cap or waiver credit for RINs would not be a win-win,” Grassley said following the meeting. Perdue on Wednesday tried to calm fears among farmers that Trump is trying to reform the RFS in way that hurts the industry. “I can tell you Trump stands with corn farmers, biofuel farmers and the RFS,” Perdue told an audience at the Commodity Classic in Anaheim, California, according to a recording heard by Reuters. “I stand with him and with you.” (Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-trump/rpt-trump-wades-deeper-into-biofuel-debate-with-second-meeting-idUKL2N1QJ04J,01 Mar 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump on

2018-03-01,"WASHINGTON, Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering sanctioning a Venezuelan military-run oil services company and restricting insurance coverage for Venezuelan oil shipments to ratchet up pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Wednesday. With Maduro running for another term in an April election that Washington and its allies oppose as a sham, the United States is weighing sanctions that would target Venezuela’s vital oil sector beyond what has been done before, the official told Reuters. Some measures could come before the vote and others could be imposed afterwards. The official, who is close to U.S. internal deliberations on Venezuela policy and spoke on condition of anonymity, would not rule out an eventual full-scale ban on Venezuelan oil shipments to the United States, among the toughest of oil-related sanctions. “I think (it would cause) a fairly strong shock to the oil market in the short term,” the official said. The official stressed that no decisions have been made and that any U.S. action would take into consideration potential harm to ordinary Venezuelans, already suffering from food shortages and hyperinflation, and the country’s neighbors as well as the impact on the U.S. oil industry and American consumers. Venezuela was the fourth largest supplier of crude oil and products to the United States in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Its crude oil sales to the United States last year were the lowest since 1991, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. “Oil sanctions are not taken lightly,” the official said. “This would be a fairly strong escalation for U.S. policy, whether it’s a complete oil sanction or salami slices of different graduated steps.” The administration of President Donald Trump is also weighing possible sanctions against additional senior military and political figures, including Socialist Party No. 2 Diosdado Cabello, the official said. Experts say individual sanctions have had little or no impact on the Venezuelan government’s policies. Maduro, himself sanctioned last year, regularly laughs off Washington’s disapproval and blames the U.S. “empire” for Venezuela’s economic woes. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment on potential further sanctions. Washington’s crafting of new sanctions comes as Venezuela’s opposition coalition is boycotting the April 22 election, citing “fraudulent” conditions including a ban on its top two candidates from running. Even if Venezuelan authorities delay the election by a month or two, the official said, that likely would not prompt the U.S. administration to hold back on sanctions. The best tool for making the Venezuelan government feel economic pain, U.S. government sources say, is through “sectoral” sanctions, such as financial measures announced in August that barred U.S. banks from any new debt deals with Venezuelan authorities or state-run oil giant PDVSA. Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, said in Geneva on Tuesday that U.S. sanctions are making foreign debt renegotiation more difficult and causing “panic” at global banks. New sanctions under consideration, according to the administration official, would be intended to “to make the world a little smaller for these corrupt officials.” Among the possible new U.S. targets is Camimpeg, Venezuela’s military-run oil services firm, the official said. With Maduro’s approval, Venezuela’s powerful military in 2016 founded Camimpeg, which is geared to providing PDVSA with assistance in drilling, logistics and security. Little is known about Camimpeg’s activities. The opposition says the armed forces are a nest of corruption and the unpopular Maduro has sought to buy the support of military chiefs by giving them increasing control of the OPEC nation’s crude reserves, the world’s largest. Another option would be sanctions aimed at putting restrictions on insurance coverage for oil tankers and oil cargos involving PDVSA, the official said. Oil exports are typically protected by insurance on tankers as well as on the actual cargo. Without insurance, a vessel cannot navigate in international waters, which means Venezuela’s oil exports would likely be curtailed. Sanctions on cargo insurance would also hurt because PDVSA has a limited tanker fleet. In addition, the Trump administration is continuing to consider blocking the sale of lighter U.S. crude and refined products that Venezuela mixes with its heavy crude and then exports, the official told Reuters. “There’s a host of additional sanctions that could be imposed. The president has all those before him,” said U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who has played a key role in pushing for Trump’s more assertive approach to Venezuela than his predecessor, Barack Obama. “The goal here is to continue to pressure an illegitimate regime so that they would leave power or be removed from power,” Rubio told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.

2018-03-01,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Hedge fund petroleum positions: tmsnrt.rs/2FeruPe By John Kemp LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - Traditional commodity traders are lamenting the rise of a new generation of hedge funds who show little interest in the fundamentals of conventional supply and demand analysis. The newcomers are blamed for distorting prices, making markets impossible to trade, and forcing the closure of some long-established specialist commodity funds. The target of this criticism is not always well-specified: it variously includes high-frequency computer-driven traders, momentum-chasing hedge funds and macro funds dabbling in energy markets. But the newcomers are operating on a scale never seen before in energy markets, with record open interest in futures and options contracts linked to crude oil and refined products. Money managers, a category which includes many hedge funds and other investors, have accumulated record positions in crude, gasoline and distillates since the middle of last year, according to regulatory data. By the end of January, money managers had established a bullish position in futures and options contracts equivalent to almost 1.5 billion barrels of crude, gasoline and distillates. The net long position was more than 400 million barrels higher than the previous peak in February 2017 and almost 700 million barrels higher than the peak before that in June 2014. “Who trades oil is changing,” according to the Financial Times (“Fundamentals do not matter to a new breed of oil speculator”, Feb. 27). “Investors who bother little with details such as inventories and pipeline flows are replacing dwindling ranks of specialist commodity funds. The shift could alter the way prices are formed.” Criticism that outsiders are distorting the proper function of commodity markets is as old as commodity markets themselves. Computer-driven algorithmic and high-frequency traders have been blamed for exacerbating short-term price volatility for over a decade. Commodity specialists complain the prevalence of high-frequency trading has reached a tipping point, distorting prices and forcing the closure long-established hedge funds (“Data overload: commodity hedge funds close as computers dominate,” Reuters, Feb. 12). The complaints are an echo from a decade ago, when pension funds and other index investors, labelled “massive passives”, were blamed for driving up food and fuel prices in 2007 and 2008. It is worth noting that high-frequency traders and index investors have been blamed for opposite problems (one for trading too much, the other for trading too little) yet are often lumped together. Such criticisms are not new: I can remember similar comments when I first worked on a trading floor in the early 2000s. Commodity producers and consumers have long blamed “speculators” for distorting prices that should be set by physical supply and demand. In turn, specialist speculators blamed an influx of “hedge funds” and technical “black box” traders for worsening volatility. Now hedge funds blame high-frequency traders and “macro tourists”. It is the familiar cry of the incumbent establishment against innovators and insurgents, reinvented for each generation. “All traders on futures markets, other than hedgers, are speculators,” wrote economist Blair Stewart, almost 70 years ago, in what remains probably the most in-depth study of futures trading. “Frequently these speculators know little or nothing about the commodity in which they deal, and have little knowledge of the methods of producing, grading, shipping, storing and using the product,” Stewart noted. Stewart concluded that lack of specialist knowledge did not have much effect on the profitability of their trading (“An analysis of speculative trading in grain futures,” Commodity Exchange Authority, 1949). “Many traders are concerned almost entirely with very short-run price fluctuations,” Stewart discovered after analysing thousands of customer trading records from the 1920s and 1930s from a large brokerage in Chicago. Stewart noted that many traders implemented a strategy as if there was “a definite price level around which short-term fluctuations will oscillate”, buying when prices fell below it, selling when prices rose above. Others tried “to detect short swings in the market at their inception” and put on a position intended to benefit from continued movement in the same direction. Stewart termed these two groups “level” traders and “movement” traders. The modern equivalents are “mean-reversion” and “momentum”. But the strategies themselves have not changed. The critical point is that all these strategies were based on prices themselves rather than a detailed analysis of supply and demand fundamentals. The roles of speculation versus fundamentals was already controversial in 1949. “The role of the small speculative trader in the futures market has been the subject of much discussion,” according to Stewart. “On the one hand it has been held that such traders are a disturbing influence in the market, accentuating price swings, and on occasions contributing to wild and disastrous price fluctuations.” “On the other hand it has been maintained that such traders are a necessary element in the market since their presence makes it possible for the expert trader — who is presumed to exercise a beneficent influence on prices — to find traders to take the opposite side of his trades, and supply through their losses the income which is necessary to support the continued trading activity of the professional.” The debate has continued more or less unchanged in the intervening decades — in most cases generating more heat than light. While some researchers and commentators insist price movements are entirely explained by fundamentals, and others entirely by speculation, most accept prices are driven by a mix of both. Fundamentals clearly dominate price formation in the long term. Speculation likely drives price movements in the short term. And between the two time horizons fundamentals and speculation both play a role. Speculation can accelerate and exaggerate price movements, causing them to overshoot in the short term, but in the longer term, prices reflect underlying production and consumption conditions. Speculation likely adds to short-term volatility, but it may also dampen price fluctuations in the medium term by accelerating the price discovery process. There is a temptation to see fundamentals as the cause of good/stabilising/logical price moves while speculation is responsible for bad/destabilising/illogical ones. There is also an incentive for traders, analysts and journalists to ascribe price movements to fundamentals when they predict them correctly and agree with them, but blame speculation when prices move in the opposite direction. In practice, it is neither possible nor sensible to try to decompose price movements in this way, which makes the whole argument about fundamentals versus speculation somewhat empty.

2018-03-01,"WARSAW, March 1 (Reuters) - Demand for power and gas in Poland has set new records as freezing temperatures grip the country, electricity grid operator PSE and gas firm PGNiG said on Thursday. The cold snap has lasted a week and forecasters say it will continue until the weekend. The temperature in Warsaw was minus 10 Celsius on Thursday morning. “Day by day we beat historical records of daily gas sales,” PGNiG deputy head Maciej Wozniak said in a statement. State-run PGNiG said it had sold more than 78 million cubic metres of gas in the past 24 hours, which is around two thirds of a single shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) that PGNiG buys from Qatar. Imported LNG, via the terminal at the Baltic Sea, is gradually reducing gas imports from Russia’s Gazprom. Last year, around 70 percent of all gas imported to Poland came from Russia, compared with 90 percent in 2015. PGNiG also said its gas stores were almost 47 percent full, more than at the same time last year. Power grid operator PSE said on Thursday that electricity demand set a new record for a winter evening on Wednesday at 26.45 gigawatts (GW), up from 26.32 GW on Tuesday. Poland, which generates electricity mostly from ageing coal-fuelled power stations, faces the risk of power shortages when temperatures reach extreme levels as increased demand overloads the system. PSE said there were no risks to power supplies at the moment. Poland’s biggest power distributors also said they had not recorded any major incidents related to the freezing temperatures.

Travel Service this week announced it was raising its stake in the national carrier Czech Airlines to nearly 100 percent. —CEFC and Penta Investments, a Czech-Slovak financial group, have made a joint bid for Time Warner’s Central European Media Enterprises (CME). —Owns the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Le Palais hotel, the Florentinum office complex, and another historical building, formerly known as Zivnobanka, all in downtown Prague. —In August last year, acquired Zdas, a Czech producer of machine tools. —Agreed last September to acquire 14.16 percent stake in Russian oil major Rosneft for $9.1 billion. Executives say deal likely to close in the first half of this year. CEFC plans to raise $5.1 billion from Russian bank VTB for bridge loans and was in talks with China Development Bank to refinance the short-term credit from VTB. —Since start of 2018, has been a major marketer of Russian crude oil after winning an annual supply deal with Rosneft to buy some 12 million tonnes of Russian oil. —Won in February 2017 a 4-percent stake for $900 million in a giant onshore field majority-owned by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC). —Agreed in February 2017 to take a 25-percent stake in a $566 million crude oil terminal, storage project in east China. —Signed a deal in December 2016 with KMGI, a unit of the Kazakh state oil and gas firm KazMunayGaz to proceed with a $680 million deal. The assets acquired include the Romanian oil group Rompetrol, which owns Petromidia, the operator of Romania’s biggest oil refinery, at the port of Constanta.

2018-03-01,"MANILA, March 1 (Reuters) - There are at least four potential investors for the Philippine government’s planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) import facility, including Tokyo Gas Co Ltd, a government energy official said on Thursday. The Southeast Asian nation wants the terminal, estimated to cost $2 billion and located in Batangas province, south of the capital of Manila, built and operational ahead of the depletion by 2024 of its indigenous gas reserves at Malampaya off Palawan island. Tokyo Gas and the Philippines’ First Gen Corp , along with two other foreign companies, are looking to invest in the project, Leonido Pulido, assistant secretary at the Department of Energy, told reporters. Tokyo Gas made a presentation at the Philippines’ energy department on Jan. 15, a company spokesman said, but did not give further details. First Gen, which runs most of the Philippines’ natural gas-fired power plants, has expressed interest in joining the project, a company spokeswoman said. Pulido told the reporters he could not remember the names of the two other potential investors. “If it’s private-sector driven, we believe (construction) will be a lot faster,” he said, adding the project does not include the pipeline infrastructure that will also cost billions of pesos. In December, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi said state-owned Philippine National Oil Company (PNOC) may hold a minimum 10 percent stake in the project. PNOC wants to spearhead the LNG facility and has also been in talks with potential partners. Construction, which includes a 5 million tonne-per-annum LNG storage facility, will take about 30 months to complete, said Cusi, who said then he wanted to issue the project permit within the year. A similar project by Australia-listed Energy World Corp , built on Pagbilao island in Quezon province and capable of receiving 3 million tonnes of LNG a year, is now almost complete. It expects to phase in a 650-megawatt (MW) gas-fired power plant near the LNG terminal by the end of 2018 using imported LNG. Pulido believes both the Batangas and Pagbilao LNG facilities can be viable. “We feel the Energy World hub will not adequately supply the industry that we’re targeting,” he said, adding the government is envisioning the use of LNG for both power and industrial sectors. Imported LNG received via the Batangas facility is expected to fuel five nearby power plants that can produced up to 3,211 MW and currently run on Malampaya gas.

2018-03-01,"(Adds details, context) By Polina Devitt MOSCOW, March 1 (Reuters) - TMK, Russia’s largest maker of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, reported a 82-percent fall in its 2017 net profit to $30 million on Thursday due to one-off items such as a smaller foreign exchange gain. The company’s top-line increased, supported by strong demand in the United States and an improvement in the Russian market, TMK, controlled by Russian businessman Dmitry Pumpyansky, said. Its 2017 adjusted earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 14 percent to $605 million and were expected to continue their growth in 2018 due to further improvement in the U.S. market. Its 2018 EBITDA margin is expected to remain at around 14 percent. In February, TMK’s U.S. subsidiary, IPSCO Tubulars, halted an initial public offering (IPO) of its shares in New York, just as a sharp global sell-off in shares gripped global markets. On Thursday, TMK made no mention of whether IPSCO would come back to its share sale plan, but said that results at its U.S. division would improve in 2018 due to higher demand. TMK also expects improved results from its European assets in 2018 due to stable pipe demand, better product mix and pricing environment. In Russia, TMK believes consumption of seamless pipes for the oil and gas industry will remain strong in 2018 with some upside potential. (Reporting by Polina Devitt.

2018-03-01,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The chairman of China’s CEFC China Energy, the private firm that has agreed to buy a nearly $9.1 billion stake in Russian oil major Rosneft, has been investigated for suspected economic crimes, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. Ye Jianming, who founded the company in 2002, was taken in for questioning this year, the person said without saying which authorities were involved or whether the probe was continuing. The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. Shares and bonds related to CEFC China Energy plunged on the news, first reported earlier on Thursday by Chinese magazine Caixin. Detail on the probe comes after the Chinese government last week took control of insurer Anbang Insurance Group Co Ltd and said its chairman was being prosecuted for economic crimes, underscoring Beijing’s willingness to curtail big-spending conglomerates as it cracks down on financial risk. It also comes ahead of an annual meeting of parliament, which opens on Monday, when President Xi Jinping is likely to cement his hold on power with a proposal to remove term limits for the office. Given problems in China’s financial system, it was “distinctly possible” the government would assume control of more firms, said Professor Christopher Balding at the Peking University HSBC School of Business in Shenzhen. “They are trying to essentially ... build firewalls around each of these things so that people that are dealing with them say ‘OK the government stepped in, I’m going to get my money back’,” Balding said.       In just a few years, CEFC China Energy transformed from a niche fuel trader into a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China’s energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion. Aside from its energy assets stretching from Chad to the United Arab Emirates to Kazakhstan, it has also invested in a series of Czech companies. It has made investments there including real estate, a brewing group, a football stadium and an airline, with the apparent backing of Chinese and Czech political leaders. CEFC China Energy did not respond to requests for comment on the probe into Ye. The investigation casts further doubt on the timing of the completion of the Rosneft deal. A source with direct knowledge of the transaction told Reuters earlier this week he expected the deal to close in the first half of this year, suggesting a delay from previous expectations. CEFC China Energy executives had initially said the deal would close early this year. A spokesman for Rosneft said the company did not know anything about the Chinese investigation. “It (the investigation) is not related to us,” spokesman Mikhail Leontyev said. CEFC China Energy’s debt and lack of transparency over its ownership and financing have drawn scrutiny among international bankers and some regulators. Last month, the Czech National Bank rejected CEFC’s push to increase its stake in the country’s privately held J&T Finance Group (JTFG) because of a lack of information about the origin of the funding for the deal. In an interview with Caixin last year and published in the article on Thursday, Ye said CEFC’s total outstanding loans amounted to over 60 billion yuan ($9.5 billion).  More than half of that was owed to China Development Bank, he said, which sources told Reuters is the company’s single largest source of financing.  The company planned to repay debts by selling assets, including those in the aviation and trading sectors, to focus on core assets in oil and gas production and the finance sector, Ye told the magazine. CEFC related bonds slumped on the news. Traders said CEFC Shanghai International Group’s exchange-traded 3 billion yuan 2020 4.98 percent bond CN136093SH= plunged 33 percent on Thursday morning, prompting the Shanghai Stock Exchange to suspend trading for most of the day, citing unusual fluctuations.  Trade in the company’s 6 billion yuan 2021 4.08 percent bond was also suspended for most of the day after plunging 34.1 percent to 60.00 yuan. Shares in CEFC China Energy’s listed subsidiary, CEFC Anhui International Holding 002018.SZ, also slumped as much as 10 percent, the maximum allowed. Ye, born in 1977, set up the Shanghai-based company in his home town in Fujian province with big ambitions. In 2016, he said he wanted to create a second Sinopec, China’s second-largest energy giant and Asia’s top oil refiner. The businessman ranked second - and two spots ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron - in Fortune magazine’s ‘40 Under 40’ list of the world’s most influential young people in 2016. His influence goes well beyond China. Czech President Milos Zeman appointed him as an adviser on economic policies in 2015. A spokesman for Zeman did not respond for request for comment on Thursday.

CEZ has signed a contract with small Bulgarian solar energy producer Inercom to sell a power distributor that provides electricity to over three million Bulgarians along with other assets. The deal has sparked concerns in Bulgaria over Inercom’s ability to finance and operate strategic energy assets. “The talks are at quite an early stage. We expressed clearly our will that we want to participate in this deal, one way or another,” Goranov told reporters after a meeting between Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and Inercom’s owner, Ginka Varbakova. When asked what stake Bulgaria would like to have, he said “At least a controlling stake,” Goranov said. Varbakova said she was leaving for Prague to hold talks with CEZ and said she was willing to let the Bulgarian state in the deal, given that CEZ agrees. “If it will calm down the final consumers, yes, I am willing to accept state participation in the deal. I am willing to transfer the contract I have if the seller would agree to that. These talks are pending,” she said. (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova.

2018-03-01,"(Corrects spelling of Infestos) AMSTERDAM, March 1 (Reuters) - Dutch energy storage firm Alfen Beheer BV said on Thursday it intended to seek an initial public offering of shares on the Amsterdam Euronext stock exchange. Alfen designs and sells energy storage systems, smart grids and electrical car charging equipment. The company did not say what percentage of shares investment firm Infestos, its sole owner, intends to float. CEO Marco Roeleveld told reporters it was possible Infestos would sell a stake of more than 50 percent “depending on demand.” Alfen said it had 74 million euros in revenues in 2017 and expects revenues of more than 99 million euros in 2018. Alfen also said its book value is 6.8 million euros. “We are targeting annual compound sales growth of 40 percent,” Roeleveld said on a conference call. Roeleveld said the company is profitable, but would not disclose its full profit and loss and accounts for 2017 until it publishes its IPO prospectus later this month. Alfen said had adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 4.9 million euros in 2017, up from 3.1 million euros in 2016. The IPO proceeds will go to Infestos, and Roeleveld said Alfen was capable of financing itself from its current cash flow. He said the company was seeking an IPO in order to raise its international profile and enable it to grow more quickly in Germany and other countries outside the Netherlands. Alfen’s energy storage systems provide utilities with a means to help balance supplies from intermittent solar and wind power production.

2018-03-01,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian gas giant Gazprom said on Thursday it would  defend its rights after an international arbitration court found in favour of Ukrainian energy firm Naftogaz in the final stage of a long-running legal battle. The Stockholm arbitration court decided on Wednesday that Gazprom would have to pay $2.56 billion (1.86 billion pounds) to Naftogaz after weighing mutual claims and counter-claims related to gas supplies and transit, Gazprom said. The court had previously delivered a separate verdict in the dispute over gas supplies between Gazprom and Naftogaz. At the time, both companies claimed victory. On Thursday, Gazprom said the latest court ruling meant it was obliged to pay $2.56 billion to Naftogaz. But it said the court’s decision had created a “material imbalance, which infringes the basic principals of Swedish law, which regulates the (gas) contract.” Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the gas market. “Gazprom will defend its rights by all available means in accordance with the applicable law,” Gazprom said in a statement. The gas row is part of a broader political conflict between the two countries, which flared up after Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimea in 2014 and a pro-Russian separatist rebellion erupted in eastern Ukraine.

2018-03-01,"* MSCI Asia-Pac index down 0.5 pct, heads for 3rd day of losses * Asia weakens after Wall St suffers worst month in 2 years * Hawkish Fed prospects prompts dollar comeback * Spreadbetters expect European stocks to open lower By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were mostly lower on Thursday after Wall Street marked its worst monthly performance in two years as hawkish-sounding comments from new Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reverberated across the broader risk asset markets. Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE falling 0.7 percent, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.8 percent and France’s CAC retreating 0.75 percent. Investors have been on edge in recent weeks amid concerns that rising interest rates in advanced economies, led by the United States, could sap global growth. Powell, in his first public appearance as head of the Fed, vowed at a congressional hearing on Tuesday (U.S. time) to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates. Those comments rekindled speculation in equity markets over U.S. monetary tightening this year happening faster than expected, feeding concerns that higher borrowing costs could crimp corporate activity and cool economic growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.5 percent and headed for its third day of losses. Chinese shares bucked the trend and edged up after a private survey showed growth in China’s manufacturing sector picking up to a six-month high. Shanghai shares were 0.15 percent higher. Australian stocks fell 0.7 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI shed 1.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.55 percent. The losses in Asia came amid a broad selloff on Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 capped their worst months since January 2016 overnight after suffering sharp losses early in February. The Dow scaled an all-time high late in January, before falling about 12 percent from that peak at the start of February as a rise in U.S. yields to multi-year highs unnerved Wall Street. It went on to recover a bulk of those losses, but the rebound stalled in the wake of Powell’s comments. The Fed’s last round of economic projections in December pointed to three rate increases this year, but Powell’s remarks prompted investors to wager on four rate rises instead. “The markets will try to further price in prospects of accelerated Fed tightening if the U.S. employment report on March 9 and inflation data on March 12 point to growth in wages and a rise in prices,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. “In such a case we could see another round of rising long-term Treasury yields, dollar appreciation and decline in U.S. equities.” The dollar, which retreated to three-year lows last month, has taken heart from the Fed chair’s comments. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose to 90.744, its highest since Jan. 19 and last stood at 90.703. The index has managed to claw back from the three-year trough of 88.253 set in mid-February when fears of a ballooning U.S. budget deficit and lingering worries that Washington could pursue a weak dollar policy took a toll. “The comeback by the dollar could negatively impact crude oil prices and in turn cool inflation expectations. In that case, the equity markets could be forced to undergo significant adjustments,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. U.S. crude oil futures stood little changed at $61.65 per barrel after sliding more than 2 percent overnight. Brent crude lost 0.1 percent to $64.66 per barrel. A stronger greenback tends to weigh on commodities including crude as it makes them more expensive for non-U.S. buyers of dollar-denominated products. The euro was steady at $1.2192 and in close reach of a 1-1/2-month low of $1.2188 plumbed the previous day. The common currency came under pressure after data on Wednesday showed euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution over removing its monetary stimulus. The dollar was little changed at 106.750 yen, having slipped from the week’s peak of 107.680 as broader risk aversion favoured its Japanese peer. The Australian dollar was down 0.45 percent at $0.7728 after brushing $0.7717, its lowest since late December. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields stood little changed at 2.864 percent after declining about 3 basis points overnight on month-end purchases by investors rebalancing their portfolios and weaker Wall Street shares.

2018-03-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday will gather rivals from the oil and corn industries for the second time this week as the administration seeks elusive common ground on reforms to the nation’s controversial biofuels law. The meetings come amid rising concern in the White House over the current state of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel, which has increasingly divided two of Trump’s most important constituencies. A refining company, Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) in the key electoral state of Pennsylvania, last month blamed the regulation for its bankruptcy. A meeting earlier in the week ended with Iowa Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst calling the White House efforts to help refiners cope with the regulation a threat to farmers, and vowing to fight proposed changes.  Grassley and Ernst, along with Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Pat Toomey of refining states Texas and Pennsylvania, will be in attendance again on Thursday, according to two sources familiar with the planning of the event.  A number of companies will also be represented. Executives from refiners Valero Energy Corp , Delta Air Lines’, Monroe Energy and PBF Energy Inc  will be there along with a union representative from the bankrupt PES, the largest and oldest refiner on the East Coast, the sources said. The biofuel industry will be represented by officials from major producers POET and Green Plains Inc, along with others, the two sources said.  Trump will be joined by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who will be sitting in for U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue as he attends events in California, they said.  Cruz’s office and POET confirmed attendance to Reuters. Representatives for the other parties, including the White House, either did not respond or declined to comment. Under the RFS, refiners must cover the costs of blending increasing volumes of biofuels such as ethanol into the nation’s gasoline and diesel each year. To prove compliance with the program, they have to acquire credits called RINs, either by earning them through blending or by buying them. The price of RINs has surged in recent years, meaning refiners without blending facilities have faced higher costs. At Tuesday’s meeting, Grassley and Ernst were asked to consider accepting a proposed ceiling on the price of RINs in exchange for a concession to the ethanol that would allow broader sales of higher-ethanol gasoline blends. “Senator Ernst and I suggested specific policy changes that would be a win-win for biofuels and oil. But we’ve made it clear all along that a cap or waiver credit for RINs would not be a win-win,” Grassley said following the meeting. Perdue on Wednesday tried to calm fears among farmers that Trump is trying to reform the RFS in way that hurts the industry. “I can tell you Trump stands with corn farmers, biofuel farmers and the RFS,” Perdue told an audience at the Commodity Classic in Anaheim, California, according to a recording heard by Reuters. “I stand with him and with you.” Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-trump/trump-wades-deeper-into-biofuel-debate-with-second-meeting-idUKL2N1QJ02K,01 Mar 2018,"U.S. President Donald Trump on

2018-03-01,"KHANTY-MANSIISK, Russia, March 1 (Reuters) - Russia’s Gazprom Neft expects to start commercial production from Bazhenov formation, the world’s largest shale oil resource, in 2025 provided it can reduce lifting costs from current estimates for the project, company officials said. The International Energy Agency describes Bazhenov as the world’s largest source rock, a bed of ancient organic matter dating back to the Jurassic period which has given rise to most of the crude oil pumped from the fields of West Siberia. Production of such oil is more costly than the extraction of the oil from conventional reservoirs. “We understand that this is a very serious technological challenge,”  Alexei Vashkevich, head of geological exploration and resource base development at Gazprom Neft, told reporters. For the project to be viable, lifting costs needed to fall to 8,500 roubles ($151) per tonne, Vashkevich said, without disclosing current estimates. Kirill Strizhnev, who oversees the Bazhenov project for Gazprom Neft, said commercial production might start in 2025. Gazprom Neft, which estimates that it can potentially extract 400 million tonnes of oil equivalent (8 million barrels per day) from Bazhenov, currently produces 150 tonnes per day from the formation. The company initially planned to tap Bazhenov jointly with Shell but the international major withdrew from the project in 2014 following international sanctions against Russia for its role in Ukrainian crisis. $1 = 56.2600 roubles

2018-03-01,"YEREVAN, March 1 (Reuters) - Armenia’s parliament is set to elect Armen Sarkissian this week as national president to succeed Serzh Sarksyan, who opposition leaders say could become prime minister and continue to wield power. Sarkissian’s election to a single seven-year term is unopposed because the ruling Republican Party supports him even though he is not a member of any party. One opposition party says it will back him while another has failed to gather sufficient votes to present its own candidate. Armenia seceded from the Soviet Union in 1991 but remains dependent on Russia for aid and investment. Many Armenians accuse the government of corruption and mishandling an economy that has struggled to overcome the legacy of central planning. The country is in line with some other former Soviet republics and countries in eastern Europe in moving away from direct democracy and towards strong central leadership, according to analysts. Sarksyan became president at an election in 2008 and nominated former prime minister Sarkissian in January to succeed him as his term neared its end. Sarkissian, 64, is a businessman and Yerevan’s ambassador to Britain and the president said he had chosen him because of his experience as a diplomat and manager. The legislature can elect a president with a three-quarters majority under the terms of a constitution approved in 2015 in a referendum that effectively abolishes direct presidential elections. This week’s vote is likely to take place on Thursday or Friday. Under that constitution, however, the presidency will become largely ceremonial and power will shift to the prime minister and parliament. “Everything has been done to create a ‘super premier’ ... who will have the same rights as the current president and even more,” opposition MP Edmond Marukyan told reporters. Sarksyan denies that the new constitution was engineered to allow him to continue to dominate Armenia, a country of around 3 million people. But many members of the ruling party say Sarksyan would be the best candidate for prime minister given his experience, especially in negotiations over neighbouring Azerbaijan’s breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region. Fighting between ethnic Azeris and Armenian separatists backed by Armenia first erupted in 1991 and a ceasefire was agreed in 1994. But Azerbaijan and Armenia accuse each other of violence around Nagorno-Karabakh and along their common border. Clashes over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies inside Azerbaijan but is controlled by ethnic Armenians, have intensified in the past three years and turned into a violent flare-up of the conflict in April 2016. The ruling party won parliamentary elections last April with 49 percent of the vote while the opposition Tsarukyan Alliance took 27 percent.

2018-03-01,"MANILA (Reuters) - Any potential deals between Manila and Beijing on energy exploration in the South China Sea should be agreed with a company and not the Chinese government, a senior Philippine official said on Thursday. China claims most of the South China Sea, a key trade route and home to areas that are believed to hold large quantities of oil and natural gas. Along with China, parts of the South China Sea are subject to competing claims from Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan, Vietnam and the Philippines. “We might enter into an agreement with a Chinese-owned corporation, not the Chinese state itself,” Harry Roque, the spokesman for President Rodrigo Duterte, told ANC news channel. The two countries last month agreed to set up a special panel to work out how they can jointly explore offshore oil and gas in areas both sides claim, without needing to address the touchy issue of sovereignty. Pursuing a joint project would be extremely complex and sensitive, as sharing oil and gas reserves could be seen as endorsing the other countries’ claims. “We are not entering into a sovereign agreement for exploration. It will be an agreement, if we do, between two corporate entities,” Roque said. Duterte said late Wednesday that China had proposed joint exploration that was “like co-ownership” and better than the two fighting over it. Roque on Thursday stressed during a news briefing that the issue was about joint exploration and exploitation as a practical solution for the Philippines to access resources without conflicts over sovereignty. He said Duterte was using co-ownership as an analogy to try to simplify the issue. The Philippines suspended exploration in the Reed Bank in 2014 to pursue a legal challenge to China’s territorial claims. Included in a 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague was a clarification of Manila’s sovereign right to access offshore oil and gas fields, including the Reed Bank, within its 200 mile Exclusive Economic Zone. Negotiations are ongoing with a Chinese state-owned company, Roque said, declining to name the entity. The Philippines, China’s CNOOC Ltd and state-owned PetroVietnam jointly surveyed the Reed Bank in 2003 to 2008. Roque said, however, there were some doubts that a joint agreement would work because China did not favour joint activities. The Philippines’ ties with China have warmed under Duterte, who has put aside territorial disputes in exchange for trade opportunities and pledged financing for infrastructure projects.

2018-03-01,"SINGAPORE, March 1 (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum expects to conclude several sales and purchase agreements (SPA) by year-end for liquefied natural gas (LNG) from its new plant in Mozambique, a company official said on Thursday. Texas-based Anadarko is developing the first onshore LNG plant in the African nation, consisting of two initial LNG trains with a total capacity of 12.88 million tonnes per annum. “We have multiple ongoing negotiations with a variety of buyers ... everyone from Chinese to Indians to Japanese,” said Andrew Seck, vice president of Anadarko’s LNG Marketing and Shipping division. In all, Anadarko has agreed commercial terms including volume and price for 5.1 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG off-take deals from Mozambique, closing in on the 8.5 mtpa target needed to trigger its final investment decision (FID) on the project, Seck said on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Singapore. Deals so far include Anadarko’s first binding SPA with France’s Electricite de France, as well as an earlier SPA with Thailand’s state-run PTT that is still undergoing government approvals.

2018-03-01,"BEIJING, March 1 (Reuters) - The chairman of China’s CEFC China Energy, the private firm that has agreed to buy a nearly $10 billion stake in Russian oil major Rosneft, has been investigated for suspected economic crimes, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said. The person said Ye Jianming was taken in for questioning this year, without saying which authorities were involved nor whether the probe was continuing. The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. The privately held Chinese firm, focused on energy and other investments abroad, has emerged from a role as niche fuel trader to become a rapidly growing oil and finance conglomerate, with assets across the world and an ambition to become one of China’s energy giants. It agreed in September to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Rosneft for $9.1 billion. CEFC China Energy did not respond to requests for comment on the probe into Ye, reported earlier on Thursday by Chinese magazine Caixin without citing sources. Shares in the firm’s listed subsidiary CEFC Anhui International Holding slumped as much as 10 pct, the maximum allowed, to their lowest since Sept. 2014, on the report.

2018-03-01,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s top steelmaking city of Tangshan on Thursday said it would extend a level 2 or “orange” pollution alert until further notice, leaving steel and coke plants under tighter restrictions. Tangshan, located in China’s northern Hebei province, had originally put the alert in place from Feb. 24-28 due to heavy smog. An orange alert, the second-most severe in China’s pollution warning system after red, is issued when forecast readings of particulate matter with a width of 2.5 microns, known as PM2.5, are above 200 microgams per cubic metres for three consecutive days, including one day above 300 micrograms. The alert last week ordered Tangshan sintering plants to stop production for 48 hours and then operate for a maximum of 12 hours before stopping again. Coke plants must extend their production time to over 48 hours, meaning less dust will be produced during the process. Factories in heavily polluted Tangshan have been forced to cut production by as much as 50 percent during China’s 2017/18 winter months as part of a targeted environmental protection campaign. The city, which accounts for about 12 percent of the country’s steel output, said last month it would extend restrictions on production after the end of the winter heating season on March 15. It plans to ask mills to cut utilisation rates by 10-15 percent from March 16 to Nov. 14 to improve air quality. Shanghai’s most traded steel rebar contract was up 0.5 percent at 4,059 yuan (465.42 pounds) a tonne at 0303 GMT, reaching its highest in nearly three months.

2018-03-01,"* MSCI Asia-Pac index down 0.35 pct, heads for 3rd day of losses * Asia weighed after Wall St suffers worst month in 2 years * Hawkish Fed prospects prompts dollar comeback By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks fell on Thursday after Wall Street marked its worst monthly performance in two years as the impact from new Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell’s hawkish-sounding comments reverberated across the broader risk asset markets. Investors have been on edge in recent weeks amid concerns higher interest rates in advanced economies, led by the United States, could dent world growth. Powell, in his first public appearance as head of the Fed, had vowed on Tuesday at a congressional hearing to prevent the economy from overheating while sticking with a plan to gradually raise interest rates. Those comments rekindled speculation in the equity markets about the pace of U.S. monetary tightening this year being more rapid than expected, amid concerns that higher borrowing rates could crimp corporate activity and cool economic growth. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was down 0.35 percent and headed for its third day of losses. Chinese shares bucked the trend and edged up after a private survey showed growth in China’s manufacturing sector picking up to a six-month high. Shanghai shares rose 0.4 percent. Australian stocks fell 0.85 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI shed 1.2 percent Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1.6 percent. The losses in Asia came amid a broad selloff on Wall Street, where the Dow and S&P 500 capped their worst months since January 2016 overnight after suffering sharp losses early in February. The Dow scaled an all-time high late in January, before falling about 12 percent from the peak at the start of February as a rise in U.S. yields to multi-year highs unnerved Wall Street. It went on to recover a bulk of those losses before the rebound stalled following Powell’s comments. The Fed’s last round of economic projections in December pointed to three rate increases this year, but views expressed by Powell prompted investors to increase bets on four rate increases in 2018. The dollar has been supported after the Fed chair’s comments. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies rose to 90.744, its highest since Jan. 19 and last stood at 90.717. The index has managed to claw back from a three-year low of 88.253 set in mid-February amid fears of a ballooning U.S. budget deficit and lingering worries that Washington could pursue a weak dollar policy took a toll. “The comeback by the dollar could negatively impact crude oil prices and in turn cool inflation expectations. In that case, the equity markets could be forced to undergo significant adjustments,” said Makoto Noji, senior strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. U.S. crude oil futures stood little changed at $61.63 per barrel after sliding more than 2 percent overnight. Brent crude lost 0.17 percent to $64.62 per barrel. A stronger greenback tends to weigh on commodities including crude, as it makes it more expensive for non-U.S. buyers of the dollar-denominated products. The euro was steady at $1.2192 and in close reach of a 1-1/2-month low of $1.2188 plumbed the previous day. The common currency came under pressure after data on Wednesday showed euro zone inflation slowing to a 14-month low and underscored the European Central Bank’s caution in removing monetary stimulus. The dollar dipped 0.05 percent to 106.605 yen, having slipped from the week’s peak of 107.680 as broader risk aversion favoured its Japanese peer. The Australian dollar fell 0.5 percent to $0.7720, its lowest since late December. Long-term U.S. Treasury yields stood little changed at 2.866 percent after declining about 3 basis points overnight on month-end purchases by investors rebalancing their portfolios and weaker Wall Street shares.

2018-03-01,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s export growth slowed in February to its weakest in more than a year, government data showed on Thursday, showing the effects of a long Lunar New year holiday and a potential slip in overseas demand for Korean goods. The 4 percent year-on-year increase in exports was the slowest expansion since November 2016 and deeply underperforms a 22.3 percent jump in January, but was better than the median estimate for a 0.4 percent increase. Shipments were hit by fewer working days due to the change of the timing of the Lunar New Year. There were 19.5 working days in February this year, versus 22 last year.  “This slowdown is likely to be temporary, exports will continue to grow going forward on solid demand for Korean goods,” said Kim Doo-un, an economist at Hana Financial Investment. Economists expect South Korea’s exports to grow at a slower but steady pace in 2018 after 2017’s bumper growth, reflecting a statistical base effect from last year’s strong performance and ongoing trade friction with the United States.  Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said on Tuesday that the auto and steel industries could be hit hard if U.S trade curbs were to be further stiffened, because they run the biggest trade surpluses with the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department has recommended President Donald Trump impose steep curbs on steel imports, including those from South Korea, after slapping bigger taxes on washers and solar panels in January. “Further wild cards will be the renegotiation of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. How the talks unfold will affect export sentiment,” said Kim at Hana. Trump has criticised the current U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, while South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said the Korea-U.S. FTA benefits both countries by expanding their trade. Imports jumped 14.8 percent in February from a year earlier, exceeding the 13.1 percent expansion seen in the survey. Annual import growth in January was 21.1 percent.

2018-03-01,"TOKYO, March 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices extended declines on Thursday after official data showed a larger-than-expected increase in U.S. crude inventories and a surprise build in gasoline stocks. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for April delivery was down 11 cents at $61.53 a barrel by 0100 GMT after settling down $1.37. New front-month London Brent crude for May delivery was down 16 cents at $64.57, having ended down $1.79. The April contract expired on Wednesday, settling down 85 cents at $65.78. Some industry sources said Wednesday’s decline was also due to profit-taking by market participants at the end of the month after oil hit a three-week high earlier this week. U.S. crude inventories rose by 3 million barrels last week, compared with analyst expectations for a build of 2.1 million barrels, weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed. Gasoline stocks also rose by 2.5 million barrels against expectations for a 190,000-barrel drop, which pushed gasoline futures sharply lower. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 709,000-barrel drop. Soaring U.S. production has kept a lid on oil prices this year, even though the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia have reduced output. U.S. crude oil production rose to a record 10.057 million barrels per day (bpd) in November and retreated slightly in December to 9.949 million bpd, the EIA said on Wednesday. OPEC oil output fell in February to a 10-month low as the United Arab Emirates joined other Gulf members in over-delivering on a supply reduction pact, a Reuters survey found on Wednesday, pushing compliance with the deal to its highest at 149 percent.

2018-03-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Green energy technology development projects suffered staffing and investment problems last year due to a Trump administration review of Energy Department funding for companies and universities, a federal government report said on Wednesday. The Department of Energy implemented a program to review and approve aid on a rolling basis including funds from its branch called the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, or ARPA-E, from May to September. ARPA-E funds high risk but potentially transformational energy projects such as next generation batteries for electric cars and storing energy from wind and solar power.   The DOE review process was implemented to make sure that the aid was consistent with the Trump administration’s priorities, it said at the time.   But the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a watchdog unit of Congress, said that 10 recipients of ARPA-E funding it interviewed complained that uncertainties caused by the review  reduced private investors’ willingness to fund projects, delayed  equipment purchases and limited the scope of projects.  The GAO did not reveal whom it interviewed for the report. DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes said the aid review was launched to “ensure funding was being implemented in a fiscally responsible way.” The GAO report confirmed that “the department did not illegally withhold any funding” and that ultimately all ARPA-E commitments were honored, Hynes said. The Trump administration has pursued an energy dominance policy that aims to maximize exports of fossil fuels including coal, natural gas and oil, which critics complain does not do enough to promote renewable energy. The administration’s budget for fiscal year 2019 calls for the “termination” of ARPA-E and loan programs by the Department of Energy, while maintaining the existing loan portfolio and making sure existing awards are completed.  Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate energy committee, said the GAO report showed the Department of Energy created uncertainty for small business, risked millions of dollars of investments, and threatened jobs.  The report said DOE is conducting this year’s funding review before it issues funding announcements, which agency officials said should reduce uncertainties experienced last year.

2018-03-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain must maintain free trade and European Union regulatory alignment for the automotive industry as Brexit offers no upside for the sector, a committee of MPs said. As one of Britain’s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s, the car industry employs more than 800,000 people and generates turnover of 77.5 billion pounds.  But companies are worried that Britain’s exit from the single market could lead to customs checks, trade barriers and tariffs which would push up costs and risk the long-term viability of their factories.  “There is no credible argument to suggest there are advantages to be gained from Brexit for the UK car industry,” the chairwoman of Britain’s business committee Rachel Reeves, an opposition Labour lawmaker, said on Thursday.   “The Prime Minister now needs to ensure common sense pragmatism prevails and spell out the Government’s intention to seek continued regulatory and trading alignment with the EU in the automotive sector,” she said. Ministers have promised to align British regulations with EU ones in some areas, such as the automotive sector, and maintain free and unfettered trade with the industry’s biggest export market.  Toyota said on Wednesday it will build the next generation of its Auris car at its English plant, but warned that continued free and frictionless trade was “vital for future success.”  However, executives had told the committee that some firms such as Honda are considering building extra warehouses and stockpiling parts to protect their operations from any delays as a result of Brexit, which would add cost.  MPs also concluded that Britain should maintain existing certification arrangements, by which cars approved in Britain can be used on the continent and vice versa.  On Monday, the chief executive of Aston Martin told Reuters the luxury carmaker was using a regulator in the European Union rather than Britain’s own body to approve its new car due to uncertainty over future regulations.  “We recommend that the government... prioritise the continuation of existing arrangements for the Vehicle Certification Agency to authorise type approvals for the European single market, whether as part of a Mutual Recognition Agreement or some alternative arrangement,” the committee said.
