2018-10-02,"(Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is exploring the sale of many of its U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets, as higher prices prompt the world’s largest publicly traded oil company to review its portfolio, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Major oil companies have been looking to concentrate development operations in a few key areas. Irving, Texas-based Exxon is focusing on promising acreage in offshore areas such as Guyana and Brazil and onshore in the Permian basin of Texas.    Exxon has asked a small number of parties to gauge their potential interest in the company’s Gulf assets, ahead of deciding how to proceed, according to two of the sources, adding that any sale would likely happen next year. The company is considering selling deepwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico that currently produce about 50,000 barrels per day of oil, one of the sources added. The company has stakes in Gulf assets that produce the equivalent of more than 200,000 barrels of oil per day and 730 million cubic feet of gas daily, according to company data.  Exxon produces the equivalent of about 2.2 million barrels of oil daily. While Exxon is the most valuable publicly traded oil company, it is only the ninth-largest operator in the Gulf, trailing heavyweights like Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) and BP Plc (BP.L), along with smaller Gulf-focused independent oil companies like Fieldwood and Talos. The Gulf of Mexico, once considered a reliable basin for oil exploration and production, has become overshadowed by shale formations onshore and by new offshore plays like Guyana, where Exxon’s giant Liza field is expected to produce 120,000 barrels per day of crude in its first phase. “Exxon Mobil continually reviews its assets for their contribution toward meeting the company’s operating needs, financial objectives and their potential value to others,” a spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement. “We remain committed to conducting business in the U.S. Gulf region, as we have for more than 100 years.” The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Exxon’s positions in the Gulf of Mexico include a 50 percent stake in development of the large Julia oil field, and a 47 percent stake in the Hadrian South natural gas field, which it operates. The company also has a 9 percent piece of Heidelberg field and 23 percent of the Lucius oil and gas field, both of which are operated by Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N), according to Exxon’s latest annual report. Exxon’s partners in developing many of these sites could have a contractual right of first refusal on any opportunity to acquire Exxon’s interest, one of the sources said. Exxon has sold 29 leases or stakes in leases to other companies since 2014, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.  The company has not acquired any leases from other companies in that period. In the last 10 federal lease sales of oil acreage, Exxon has bid on 28 leases, compared with rivals like BP, which has bid on 52 leases.  Exxon shares were up 0.7 percent to $86.42 each on Tuesday. Shares have risen 6.5 percent this year, trailing broader equity averages. Qatar, which has a number of partnerships with Exxon, including in Brazil, would be well positioned to make an offer for the Gulf of Mexico assets, the sources said. Exxon has an extensive partnership with Qatar, including partnering with Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] to develop the world’s largest non-associated natural gas field off that country’s coast. Qatar Petroleum also bought a 30 percent stake in two of Exxon’s affiliates in Argentina in June, giving Qatar access to oil and gas shale assets in the Latin American country. Qatar Petroleum’s chief executive told Reuters in May that the company was expanding its upstream business and assets abroad, particularly in the United States. Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon and ConocoPhillips holding smaller stakes. It could not be established whether Qatar will indeed make an offer. Qatar government officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This week, Chevron Corp agreed to sell its North Sea holdings off the shore of Britain.

2018-10-02,"New York (Reuters) - Stock indexes around the globe weakened on Tuesday, European assets sold off and Italy’s bond yields hit multiyear highs after an Italian lawmaker made anti-euro comments, though Wall Street’s blue-chip index bucked the trend and set a new record. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS dipped 0.33 percent, paring Monday's gains that followed the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.57 percent. Two of Wall Street’s three major indexes closed lower on Tuesday, but shares of companies including Boeing (BA.N) and Caterpillar CAT.N pushed up the Dow, which closed at a fresh record high. [.N]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 122.73 points, or 0.46 percent, to end at 26,773.94, the S&P 500 .SPX dipped 1.16 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,923.43 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 37.76 points, or 0.47 percent, to close at 7,999.55. In Italy, the economics spokesman for the country’s ruling League party, Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency.  His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the yield spread between Italian debt and German Bunds to their widest in over five years. Shares in Italian banks .FTIT8300, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering some of their losses. “We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one side and Italy on the other,” said Valentin Marinov, Credit Agricole’s head of G10 FX Strategy. “There’s a lot of headline risk about.” Borghi and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down, calling the euro ""unrenounceable"", helping to calm markets and erasing losses for Italy's FTSE MIB .FTMIB. The euro EUR= fell to its weakest since Aug. 21 at $1.1505, before retracing to $1.1551, down 0.22 percent on the day. The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen the country’s debt and deficit problems, and by extension those of the European Union. In Asia, stocks were lower as the lift from the agreement to save the North American free trade deal faded. The deal had boosted optimism for a resolution of a trade row between the United States and China.  China’s financial markets are closed for the week of Oct. 1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory growth in China hit Hong Kong stocks. The United States and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index .DXY rise to 95.744 - its highest since Aug. 21 - and it was last up 0.17 percent. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index .MSCIEF, which fell 1.2 percent, setting it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month.  Gold rose to its highest level in more than a week as investors sought refuge in the safe haven after equity markets weakened. Spot gold XAU= added 1.3 percent to $1,202.69 an ounce. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 gained 1.32 percent to $1,207.40 an ounce.

2018-10-02,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy will host an international conference on Libya in Sicily next month to try to bring together opposing forces and forge dialogue in the warring nation, Foreign Minister Enzo Moavero Milanesi said on Tuesday. The meeting will be held in the Sicilian capital Palermo on Nov. 12 and 13, with key players from both within Libya and abroad expected to turn up, Moavero told parliament. “We want to find a common solution, even though there will be different opinions around the table,” Moavero said, adding that the goal was to help restore peace in Libya and facilitate an inclusive political process ahead of possible elections. Italy has been tussling with neighbouring France over how best to deal with Libya, which has been racked by violence for years following the NATO-backed uprising in 2011 that overthrew strongman Mummar Gaddafi. Libyan leaders announced at a conference in Paris in May that they would hold elections on Dec. 10 as part of a French drive to stabilise the North African country. Italy bristled at the move to fix a date in the face of continued clashes between rival factions, and few Western diplomats believe the vote can go ahead in the current climate.  Moavero said he did not expect the Palermo meeting would focus on specific dates. “No deadlines will be imposed or tasks set for the Libyans,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has given his blessing to the Italian conference and Moavero said he would fly to Moscow next Monday to discuss the situation in Libya with  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.  Rome expects high-level delegations from Libya’s neighbours as well as from the Gulf, Turkey and the European Union. However, it was still not clear if Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar, a dominant figure in the east of the country, would show up in Sicily. Haftar’s Libyan National Army (LNA) last year seized the country’s second largest city, Benghazi, by expelling Islamist and other fighters.  In an interview with Reuters published on Tuesday, Haftar said he still supported plans for national elections in Libya in December but accused other players of not fulfilling their promises that would have paved the way for a ballot. Italy has thrown its weight behind Haftar’s main rival, Prime Minister Fayez Seraj, who leads a U.N.-brokered transitional government based in the Libyan capital Tripoli. Moavero met Haftar last month and said on Tuesday that the commander had confirmed “his interest in the conference”.

2018-10-02,"SULAIMANIYA, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq’s parliament on Tuesday elected as president Kurdish politician Barham Salih, who immediately named Shi’ite Adel Abdul Mahdi prime minister-designate, ending months of deadlock after an inconclusive national election in May. The presidency, traditionally occupied by a Kurd, is a largely ceremonial position, but the vote for Salih was a key step towards forming a new government, which politicians have failed to do since the election. Under Iraq’s constitution, Salih - a 58-year-old, British-educated engineer who has held office in both the Iraqi federal and Kurdish regional governments - had 15 days to invite the nominee of the largest parliamentary bloc to form a government. He chose to do so less than two hours after his election. Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion, power has been shared among Iraq’s three largest ethnic-sectarian components.  The most powerful post, that of prime minister, has traditionally been held by a Shi’ite Arab, the speaker of parliament by a Sunni Arab and the presidency by a Kurd. A former vice president, oil minister and finance minister, Abdul Mahdi now has 30 days to form a cabinet and present it to parliament for approval.  He faces the daunting tasks of rebuilding much of the country after four years of war with Islamic State militants, healing its ethnic and sectarian tensions, and balancing foreign relations with Iraq’s two major allies - Iran and its arch-foe the United States. Abdul Mahdi, 76, is a trained economist who left Iraq in 1969 for exile in France, where he worked for think-tanks and edited magazines in French and Arabic. He is the son of a respected Shi’ite cleric who was a minister in the era of Iraq’s monarchy, overthrown in 1958. He will become the first elected prime minister in post-Saddam Iraq not to hail from the Shi’ite Islamist Dawa party. Abdul Mahdi was nominated by two rival blocs, one led by Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and outgoing Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, and the other by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri and former premier Nuri al-Maliki. Both blocs claim to hold a parliamentary majority but the dispute has been rendered irrelevant by their choice of the same man to be premier. “The nomination of Mr Adel Abdul Mahdi came after an agreement between the Binaa bloc and the Islah bloc to nominate him via consensus and not a majority bloc in order to get past the issue of which is the majority bloc,” said Ahmed al-Asadi, a spokesman for the Binaa bloc led by Amiri and Maliki. Ameri and Maliki are Iran’s two most prominent allies in Iraq. Abadi was seen as the preferred candidate of the United States, while Sadr portrays himself as a nationalist who rejects both American and Iranian influence. The rival claims to a parliamentary majority and uncertainty over the composition of the new government had raised tensions at a time when public impatience is growing over poor basic services, high unemployment and the slow pace of rebuilding after the war with Islamic State. Sadr’s bloc welcomed Abdul Mahdi’s nomination. The cleric earlier on Tuesday tweeted that “Iraq is bigger than the biggest bloc,” a likely reference to the compromise. Abadi issued a statement congratulating Abdul Mahdi and wishing him success. “Abdul Mahdi’s nomination represents the best choice to pleasing all the Shi’ite players who were about to reach a point of conflict and no return,” said Baghdad-based political analyst Ahmed Younis. “All the Shiite blocs reached the conclusion that their divisions could lead to an intra-Shi’ite conflict which would weaken their position in Iraqi,” he said. “Now with Abdul Mahdi there are no winners and losers, everyone is happy.” If the nomination of Abdul Mahdi diffused Shi’ite tensions, Salih’s election fuelled Kurdish ones. The presidency was fiercely contested between Iraqi Kurdistan’s two main parties - the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), which nominated Salih, and its traditional rival, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). Salih’s election raises concerns of destabilisation in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region because of escalating tensions between the KDP and PUK, who fought a civil war in the 1990s. The KDP and PUK were unable to iron out differences and agree on one candidate as they have traditionally done. They competed in a parliamentary election in their semi-autonomous region in northern Iraq on Sunday. Allegations of fraud have created tensions. Results have not been announced. “I promise to safeguard Iraq’s unity and safety,” Salih said as he was sworn in, affirming his commitment to the country’s unity a year after Kurds overwhelmingly backed a failed independence bid. He was the preferred candidate of most lawmakers because of his perceived softer stance on the thorny issue of Kurdish independence.  His opponent had served as the longtime chief of staff to former Kurdistan Region President and KDP leader Masoud Barzani, who ushered in the referendum on independence last year.  Barzani had struck alliances with several heads of major political blocs in parliament but they were unable to whip the votes for his candidate.  Salih’s election marked the first time in modern Iraqi politics that one of the three top posts was selected without a backroom deal. “Even though the heads of political blocs wanted to reach a backroom deal rather than leave it up to a vote, they couldn’t control their own MPs,” said Renad Mansour, a research fellow at Chatham House. “MPs voted for the candidate they thought was most qualified and was most in favour of a united Iraq.” Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed and Raya Jalabi; writing by Ahmed Aboulenein; editing by Andrew Roche and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iraq-politics/update-3-iraq-names-new-president-and-premier-ending-deadlock-idUKL8N1WI66I,02 Oct 2018,"Iraq's parliament on

2018-10-02,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday after rallying for three straight sessions, but remained close to four-year highs on worries that global supplies will drop due to Washington’s sanctions on Iran. “This is the market catching its breath,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. In addition to the worries that Iran, prices are being supported by global demand that has remained strong in the face of trade tensions.  Brent LCOc1 fell 18 cents to settle at $84.80 per barrel, a day after hitting a four-year high of $85.45. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were off 7 cents at $75.23 a barrel, after earlier touching a four-year high of $75.91. Analysts polled by Reuters forecast that U.S. crude stocks rose about 2 million barrels last week ahead of data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) due out at 4:30 p.m. and from the U.S. government on Wednesday morning.  Crude prices have roughly tripled from lows hit in January 2016 after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia cut output. Oil market sentiment was lifted by Sunday’s last-gasp deal to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada.  The U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil industry, which at its peak this year supplied nearly 3 percent of the world’s daily consumption, are due to go into effect on Nov. 4. A Reuters survey of OPEC production found Iranian output in September fell by 100,000 barrels per day, while production from OPEC as a whole rose by 90,000 bpd from August.  “Our oil analysts believe there is now a growing risk it (crude) could touch $100 per barrel,” HSBC said in its fourth-quarter Global Economics outlook.  Many analysts say OPEC will struggle to cover a decline in exports from Iran. Britain’s Barclays bank, however, said, “OPEC has ample spare capacity.” Soaring crude prices and weak emerging market currencies may erode economic growth. “Softening demand growth and new supply should cool the bullish sentiment and push prices lower by the end of the year,” Barclays said.

2018-10-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Half of Poland’s electricity generation will come from coal by 2040 though coal production should remain at current levels as energy demand is expected to increase, a senior government official said on Tuesday. Poland and Germany are jointly responsible for over half of the EU’s carbon dioxide emissions from coal. Currently, around 80 percent of Poland’s power production is provided by coal-fired plant generation. It aims to cut that to half by 2040, with renewables and nuclear providing much of the rest and gas-fired generation providing back-up. Earlier this year, Poland said it planned to lower the share of coal in its energy production to 60 percent in 2030 and around 50 percent in 2050. “We would like to keep the level of hard coal production at the level it is today. Some mines will be decommissioned but demand for energy will grow. All transition in the sector will be in cooperation with the European Commission,” Piotr Naimski, who is responsible for strategic energy infrastructure, told Reuters at the Bloomberg NEF future of energy summit. Under a long-term plan to restructure the coal industry, some of the oldest and most polluting coal-fired power units could be decommissioned and replaced with bigger, cleaner and more efficient units, he said. Poland is considering whether to open new fields of lignite - an intermediate between bituminous coal and peat - alongside new coal-fired power units which would take around 10 years or build a nuclear plant which would cost and take around the same. “We are considering which way to go. Existing lignite fields should last until the early 2030s,” Naimski said. Poland will host this year’s U.N. climate talks in the mining city of Katowice, where the implementation of a global pact to keep global warming in check will be worked out. The pact, called the Paris Agreement, was agreed in 2015 and seeks to wean the world economy off fossil fuels in the second half of the century. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact last year, saying it favored other countries. Research by Climate Analytics earlier this year said the European Union as a whole must shelve plans for additional coal capacity and shut down plants completely by 2030 to keep its carbon emissions in check. But Poland also has plans for renewable energy. It wants to have 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind installed in the long-term. It already has 6 GW of onshore wind. At the same time, it is trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas through the Baltic Pipe Project - a 10 billion cubic meter per year pipeline which will supply natural gas from Norway to the Danish and Polish markets.  Construction of the pipeline is due to start in 2020 and gas supply should start in 2022 when Poland’s gas contracts with Russia’s Gazprom are scheduled to end. Poland also plans to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by 2021 and expand its transmission grid. “We will get better security of supply and diversification of gas sources and routes. We get 100 percent of our gas from Russia now so we are looking for LNG and gas from the Norwegian shelf,” Naimski said.

2018-10-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and oil traders are now in fundamental disagreement about the market outlook and the standoff is fuelling a sharp rise in prices that could spell trouble for the global economy over the next 18 months. The overall balance between supply and demand is “healthy” according to a statement from the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month. The committee expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook, according to a press statement released afterwards (“JMMC meets in Algiers to monitor developments in the oil market”, OPEC, Sept. 23). But where the committee sees a balanced market and warned about downside risks to demand in 2019, traders see a market that is increasingly tight and are worried about the adequacy of future supply. Front-month Brent crude futures have jumped by almost $14 per barrel (20 percent) since the middle of August, including an increase of nearly $6 (7 percent) since the JMMC meeting, to their highest in almost four years. Brent’s six-month calendar spread, which has been a good proxy for the global supply-demand balance in the last 25 years, has risen by $2.50 per barrel and swung from a small contango into a pronounced backwardation. The recent intense backwardation in Brent futures close to delivery and the surge in Oman crude prices to a rare premium over Brent are all consistent with a market that fears physical shortages in the next few months. Hedge funds and other money managers have boosted their bullish position in Brent by 172 million barrels since late August, an increase of more than 50 percent, including 50 million barrels in the aftermath of the JMMC. Nearly all hedge fund managers expect oil prices to rise rather than fall in the short to medium term, according to exchange data. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OyHccI) Fund managers hold bearish short positions in Brent amounting to just 27 million barrels, the second-lowest level in the last five years. Across the entire petroleum complex, including crude and refined fuels, hedge fund short positions have fallen the lowest level since at least 2013. Where OPEC is worried about the potential for a slowdown in oil consumption growth as a result of rising prices and a possible downturn in the global economy, traders are more worried about the impact of sanctions on Iran. The standoff between the JMMC, in reality Saudi Arabia, its most powerful member, and oil traders about the state of the oil market is reminiscent of earlier periods of rising prices. OPEC and traders fundamentally disagreed for almost the entire run up in oil prices in 2007/8, with OPEC insisting the market was well-supplied while traders continued to bid up prices amid concerns about shortages. Experience suggests prices will continue rising until: (a) evidence of demand destruction becomes clear, or (b) the increase in prices forces a reaction from OPEC and its allies. OPEC tends to react to price changes rather than lead them (which is why its influence over the oil market is usually overstated by many commentators). In this instance, prices will continue rising until there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth, or an adjustment in production and sanctions policy from Saudi Arabia, Russia or the White House. Traders are hunting for the price threshold that forces one of those developments. In the meantime, the blame game is heating up, with the White House and OPEC each trying to claim the rise in prices is not their fault. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed OPEC for rising prices in a message on Twitter on Sept. 20 and in a high-profile speech to the United Nations on Sept. 25. Trump has also reportedly discussed oil supplies and prices in a phone call with the king of Saudi Arabia on Sept. 29 (“Trump calls Saudi’s King to discuss oil supplies”, Reuters, Sept. 29). Despite close coordination between the United States and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran sanctions, neither wants to be blamed for the escalation in fuel costs. The recent rise in oil prices confirms closely to the traditional boom-bust pattern. Oil prices are not inherently self-stabilising and display strongly non-linear and cyclical behaviour. The oil market cycles between periods of over- and under-supply. The market is rarely balanced or in equilibrium except by accident and not usually for very long. Experience strongly suggests oil prices will continue on a rising trajectory until softening consumption growth or an acceleration in production knocks them onto a new course. Position-building by hedge funds and other traders will accelerate and exaggerate the price movement in the short term but is not the underlying cause of volatility. If the past is any guide, and it usually is, OPEC and its allies will resist changing production, citing concerns about consumption and the growth in alternative supplies, until the political pressure on them becomes overwhelming. By that point, prices will already be close to peaking, extra OPEC and non-OPEC supplies will come too late, with consumption already slowing, and add to the subsequent slump.

2018-10-02,"* European stocks follow Asia lower * Italian bond yields rise, bank stocks sink * Oil near 4-year highs * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Helen Reid LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide and European assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments from an Italian lawmaker dented the single currency and sent Italy’s bond yields to multi-year highs. A boost to investors’ risk appetite from the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI world equity index falling back 0.4 percent, its biggest loss in a month. The leading index of euro zone stocks lost 1 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent, tracking Asian stocks lower and extending losses as Italian assets came under renewed stress. U.S. futures also traded down 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent. Claudio Borghi, the economics spokesman of Italy’s ruling League party, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency. His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German yields to the widest for more than five years. Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low, falling as much as 2.8 percent and Italy’s FTSE MIB tumbled 1.2 percent. Clarifying his remarks later, Borghi told Reuters that Italy’s government has no intention of leaving the euro. However, the spectre of a euro zone breakup and stern words from EU officials about Italy’s budget kept markets on edge. Euro zone banks also dropped 1 percent as the comments reignited investors’ anxieties about contagion in the euro zone from Italy’s higher-than-expected budget deficit plans, which the government set out on Thursday. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. “We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy.” The euro extended losses to fall 0.6 percent to its lowest since Aug. 21 at $1.1504 and was last trading at $1.1509. The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy’s debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European Union’s. “The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great fudges - think of the case of Greece,” the Saracen global income and growth fund’s manager, David Keir, said. “But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading. The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,” he said. Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free-trade deal faded. China’s financial markets are closed for the week of Oct. 1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index rise 0.4 percent to 95.718, its highest since Sept. 4. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index, which fell 1.5 percent - its biggest one-day loss for a month. Oil prices recoiled slightly, having hit nearly four-year highs in the previous session. Crude contracts had surged nearly 3 percent to $75.77 a barrel, their highest since November 2014, as the deal to salvage NAFTA stoked economic growth expectations, with impending U.S. sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. U.S. crude futures, having touched a high of $75.91, were trading flat at $75.30 a barrel. Brent crude edged down 0.5 percent to $84.52 a barrel, having rallied the previous day to $85.45, its highest since November 2014.

2018-10-02,"SEOUL/LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s leading climate scientists this week are preparing the final version of a cornerstone United Nations report to assess whether global temperatures can be kept in check this century to prevent the most damaging effects of global warming. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting this week in Incheon, South Korea, and plans to discuss the report, which will determine whether global warming this century can be kept to a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).  The IPCC aims to release the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C on Oct. 8.  “The main issue of the report discussion will be around how we can get to a 1.5 degree limit and what will be the carbon (emissions) budget available to do that,” said Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University.    In 2015, nearly 200 nations pledged in Paris to limit the global average temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for a tougher 1.5C goal. The IPCC report, seen as the main scientific guide for combating climate change, will provide guidance on the required actions to combat climate change. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid-1800s as industrialization produced rising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. According to a draft of the report seen in June but subject to change, governments can still limit temperatures below 1.5C but only with “rapid and far-reaching” action. The draft said current pledges in the Paris Agreement are too weak to limit warming to 1.5C. The document said there was a need to increase renewable energy output by 60 percent between 2020 and 2050, while energy from coal should be scaled back by two-thirds. By 2050, that means renewables would supply between 49 percent and 67 percent of primary energy. Since the agreement was reached, U.S. President Donald Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord. “On the policy side of reducing emissions I think there will be a lot of points of disagreement,” said Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London.  “If they fail to reach an agreement, it will be down to a fundamental division on climate justice between fossil fuel producers (and the U.S. administration) and more vulnerable countries such as small island states who feel their existence is under threat,” Grubb said.

2018-10-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - Half of Poland’s electricity generation will come from coal by 2040 though coal production should remain at current levels as energy demand is expected to increase, a senior government official said on Tuesday. Poland and Germany are jointly responsible for over half of the EU’s carbon dioxide emissions from coal. Currently, around 80 percent of Poland’s power production is provided by coal-fired plant generation. It aims to cut that to half by 2040, with renewables and nuclear providing much of the rest and gas-fired generation providing back-up. Earlier this year, Poland said it planned to lower the share of coal in its energy production to 60 percent in 2030 and around 50 percent in 2050. “We would like to keep the level of hard coal production at the level it is today. Some mines will be decommissioned but demand for energy will grow. All transition in the sector will be in cooperation with the European Commission,” Piotr Naimski, who is responsible for strategic energy infrastructure, told Reuters at the Bloomberg NEF future of energy summit. Under a long-term plan to restructure the coal industry, some of the oldest and most polluting coal-fired power units could be decommissioned and replaced with bigger, cleaner and more efficient units, he said. Poland is considering whether to open new fields of lignite - an intermediate between bituminous coal and peat - alongside new coal-fired power units which would take around 10 years or build a nuclear plant which would cost and take around the same. “We are considering which way to go. Existing lignite fields should last until the early 2030s,” Naimski said. Poland will host this year’s U.N. climate talks in the mining city of Katowice, where the implementation of a global pact to keep global warming in check will be worked out. The pact, called the Paris Agreement, was agreed in 2015 and seeks to wean the world economy off fossil fuels in the second half of the century. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the pact last year, saying it favored other countries. Research by Climate Analytics earlier this year said the European Union as a whole must shelve plans for additional coal capacity and shut down plants completely by 2030 to keep its carbon emissions in check. But Poland also has plans for renewable energy. It wants to have 8 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind installed in the long-term. It already has 6 GW of onshore wind. At the same time, it is trying to reduce its reliance on Russian gas through the Baltic Pipe Project - a 10 billion cubic meter per year pipeline which will supply natural gas from Norway to the Danish and Polish markets.  Construction of the pipeline is due to start in 2020 and gas supply should start in 2022 when Poland’s gas contracts with Russia’s Gazprom are scheduled to end. Poland also plans to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal by 2021 and expand its transmission grid. “We will get better security of supply and diversification of gas sources and routes. We get 100 percent of our gas from Russia now so we are looking for LNG and gas from the Norwegian shelf,” Naimski said.

2018-10-02,"Oct 2 (Reuters) - Repairs to a dock at Venezuela’s main oil export port will take at least another month to complete following a tanker collision more than a month ago, further restraining the OPEC member nation’s crude exports, according to sources and shipping data. A minor incident in late August forced state-run oil company PDVSA to shut the Jose port’s South dock, one of three used to ship heavy and upgraded oil to customers including Russia’s Rosneft and U.S.-based Chevron Corp, and to receive diluents needed for the exports. Jose port typically handles about 70 percent of Venezuela’s total crude exports, which in September declined 14 percent compared with the previous month to 1.105 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Oil exports are the financial backbone of Venezuela’s economy, which is struggling to overcome hyperinflation, a long-standing recession and scarcity of basic goods. PDVSA had estimated the berth would reopen by the end of September, but needed parts have not been obtained as PDVSA continues facing problems to pay foreign providers due to financial sanctions imposed by the United States, sources close to its operations said. PDVSA’s crews completed the removal of the damaged fences last week, but replacements have not arrived in the country. “The fences were bought, but funds to pay the provider were retained due to the U.S. sanctions. A new deal to buy them through a third party will take at least another month,” one of the people familiar with the matter said. PDVSA was not immediately available for comment. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration last year imposed financial sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA, affecting their ability to make transfers in dollars and complete payments through the U.S. banking system. PDVSA has neither resumed shipments from most of its Caribbean terminals, which remain frozen after U.S. producer ConocoPhillips’ legal actions earlier this year to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award, according to the data. Conoco and PDVSA in August struck a payment agreement, but the Venezuelan oil firm has yet to complete a $500 million installment due by the end of November to unlock its Caribbean operations. Venezuela’s crude output fell again in August to 1.448 million bpd according to official figures, putting its annual average at 1.544 million bpd, the lowest in over six decades. Economic measures recently announced by President Nicolas Maduro’s government, including a steep salary increase, have fallen short for Venezuela to regain access to sufficient foreign credit and reverse the downturn.

2018-10-02,"NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is expected to visit Iowa next week to deliver on a promise to lift a summer ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline, according to two sources familiar with the plan, aimed at helping Farm Belt Republicans in tight congressional election races. The move would cap months of fractious negotiations initiated by the White House over ways to help the oil industry deal with the cost of complying with the nation’s biofuel laws, without angering farmers in the nation’s heartland. Expanding sales of higher ethanol gasoline blends could help both constituencies by making it easier for the energy industry to hit annual blending quotas under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, while shoring up demand for the corn-based fuel. But the oil industry has long opposed the idea, which could cut into its market-share. The sources, who asked not to be named, said Trump plans to visit Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Oct. 9, to announce he is directing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to lift the summer ban on so-called E15 gasoline. They said he might also tighten restrictions on the trading of ethanol blending credits to keep prices down for merchant refiners struggling with the cost of complying with the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst said she was hopeful for such a visit. “I am optimistic something is going to happen,” she said in a phone interview on Tuesday. “It would not be good for the president to hint and hint about lifting the ban and do nothing. I think there would be peril if he came and did not deliver on the promise.” Iowa Republican Senator Chuck Grassley said he was also hoping the administration would deliver on the E15 measure. Council Bluff sits in Iowa’s 3rd District, where incumbent Republican David Young is locked in tight race with Democrat Cindy Axne. The move could also help Iowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds keep the governor’s mansion ahead of a potential 2020 Trump re-election campaign. The RFS is a 2005 law that requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels into gasoline each year or buy credits from competitors who do. But demand growth has slowed as U.S. government mandates have capped out and Trump’s trade war with China has cut out a key export market, hurting corn farmers. Lifting the ban on so-called E15 gasoline, a measure to reduce smog that has since been found ineffective, would motivate retailers to add pumps and grow the domestic market for ethanol. Iowa is the largest U.S. producer of ethanol. The American Petroleum Institute opposes both the E15 waiver and the proposed trade restrictions, which the group says will hurt consumers and damage liquidity in the credit market.

2018-10-02,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog’s independence is paramount and it does not take intelligence presented to it at face value, it said on Tuesday in response to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s description of a “secret atomic warehouse” in Iran. Netanyahu - who vehemently opposes the nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that the International Atomic Energy Agency is policing - made the statement in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly last week. He urged the IAEA to visit the site in Tehran.  A U.S. State Department official seconded that call, but a U.S. intelligence official called Netanyahu’s assertions “somewhat misleading”, adding that the facility does not contain anything that would enable Iran to accelerate activities banned under the deal. “The agency sends inspectors to sites and locations only when needed. The agency uses all safeguards relevant to information available to it but it does not take any information at face value,” IAEA chief Yukiya Amano said in a statement.  Amano’s statement made no specific reference to Israel or the statement but it is his first public pronouncement since Netanyahu’s speech. He said the IAEA has carried out so-called complementary access inspections, which are often at short notice, at all locations in Iran it has needed to visit. The IAEA has repeatedly reported that Iran is implementing the restrictions placed on its nuclear activities under the deal, which also lifted international sanctions against Tehran. President Donald Trump has, however, pulled Washington out of the accord and U.S. sanctions are being re-imposed. “All information obtained, including from third parties, is subject to rigorous review and assessed together with other available information to arrive at an independent assessment based on the agency’s own expertise,” Amano said.      “In order to maintain credibility, the agency’s independence in relation to the implementation of verification activities is of paramount importance,” he added. Netanyahu’s office, however, doubled down on Tuesday and called for the IAEA to visit the location he described immediately. Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman also told reporters Israel would “expose additional facilities” at a time of its choosing. “There is not reason to wait,” Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. “The IAEA should check the site and immediately send inspectors with a radiation detector and the prime minister’s statement will be found to be the whole truth.” Reporting by Francois Murphy; additional reporting by Dan Williams in Jerusalem; Editing by Matthew Mpoke Bigg",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-iaea/update-2-iaea-says-it-wont-take-intelligence-at-face-value-after-netanyahus-iran-speech-idUKL8N1WI2M6,02 Oct 2018,"The U.N. nuclear watchdog's

2018-10-02,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has terminated Audi CEO Rupert Stadler’s contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions cheating by the German group. Munich prosecutors are investigating Stadler and another member of Audi’s senior management for suspected fraud and false advertising related to illegal emmissions by its cars and manipulation of vehicle tests. The departure of Stadler came as the German government presented a plan to cut pollution from diesel vehicles in the country’s continuing efforts to negotiate the aftermath of the VW emissions scandal that surfaced three years ago. Stadler is leaving his posts as management board member of the Volkswagen group and as CEO of Audi with immediate effect, VW said in a statement. He had been suspended after he was taken into custody in mid-June on suspicion of interfering with an emissions investigation. Sales executive Bram Schot is acting as interim replacement. Both VW and premium brand Audi have said that Stadler is presumed innocent unless proven otherwise. “Mr. Stadler is (leaving) because, due to his ongoing pre-trial detention, he is unable to fulfil his duties as a member of the management board and wishes to concentrate on his defence,” VW said in its statement on Tuesday. Following his arrest, Munich prosecutors said that Stadler, the most senior active VW official to be remanded in custody since the scandal broke, was being held on fears he might hinder their investigation. Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group’s controlling Piech clan. A statement from acting Audi chief Schot thanked Stadler for his 11 years at the helm, noting that the company had almost doubled its sales in that time and that Stadler had also pushed for development of electric cars. Peter Mosch, works council chief and deputy head of Audi’s supervisory board, said the move gave the company more clarity for the future. In July Volkswagen recruited BMW engine development and purchasing expert Markus Duesmann, who has been touted as a potential successor to Stadler as VW looks for clean-engine expertise to help it to shake off the scandal. A source familiar with the matter said that severance payment terms for Stadler would depend on the investigators’ findings. Stadler’s VW contract was due to run to the end of next year and his Audo CEO contract to the end of 2023.

2018-10-02,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government presented plans to cut pollution from diesel vehicles by asking carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes, prompting objections from environmental groups and grudging concessions from the industry. After marathon talks, Chancellor Angela Merkel and leaders of her coalition partners announced in the early hours of Tuesday they had agreed on a way to cut pollution in the worst-affected German cities while avoiding unpopular driving bans. Owners of millions of older diesel vehicles in Germany’s 14 most polluted cities should be able to choose between trade-in sweeteners and hardware upgrades for their vehicles. Carmakers, however, did not all commit to covering the cost of retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which could run into billions of euros. They said instead the focus should be on encouraging car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices. Daimler (DAIGn.DE) gave arguably the strongest backing, saying it was prepared to participate in the retrofit programme and offering incentives of up to 10,000 euros ($11,564) for those swapping old cars for new Mercedes models. “We are convinced that emissions of nitrogen oxide can be controlled in cities with modern diesel and without driving bans,” said Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche, referring to diesel byproducts that can cause respiratory ailments. BMW also said it would offer a trade-in incentive of 6,000 euros in the most polluted parts of the country. France’s Renault (RENA.PA) said earlier on Tuesday it was offering owners of older diesel vehicles in Germany incentives of up to 10,000 euros if they bought new cars. However, the chief executive of France’s PSA Group (PEUP.PA) said the retrofit approach “doesn’t work”, although the trade-in approach was more viable. “Who’s going to pay is not clear. We believe it’s not the carmakers’ responsibility because at the time when those cars were sold they met all legal requirements,” Carlos Tavares told Reuters at the Paris Motor Show.   The government cannot force the carmakers to pay for hardware upgrades, but shares an interest with the industry in preventing further driving bans for polluting cars, which have already been imposed in Hamburg and are planned for Frankfurt and Stuttgart, the home of Germany’s car industry. On the other side of the argument, green groups argued that the government should have been tougher on the industry, three years after the “dieselgate” scandal broke out at Volkswagen. Volkswagen’s (VOWG_p.DE) admission in 2015 that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests led to the discovery that diesel vehicles from several manufacturers routinely exceeded pollution limits in normal driving conditions, prompting a regulatory crackdown. Environmental groups have been heartened by a court ruling in February that allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. “Driving bans will not be avoided with this double failure to come up with a solution,” said Juergen Resch, managing director of environmental group DUH, noting upcoming rulings in a number of major cities. Ministers were keen to trumpet a deal that they said would mean a big investment by carmakers in getting drivers into cleaner cars. “We are talking about a significant billion (euro) contribution that German carmakers will bring for these models,” Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said. German Environment Minister Svenja Schulze said that the car industry should take the chance of avoiding driving bans. “My impression is that the car industry has a big interest in restoring the image of diesel,” she said.  Carmakers have said they expect only a small proportion of owners of the affected vehicles to opt for a retrofit rather than a trade-in, and raised practical objections over the plan. Volkswagen said whether retrofits were possible would depend on suppliers developing systems that were good enough, and it did not commit to covering the cost of hardware upgrades. Costs for the industry could be as high as 12.5 billion euros, estimated Stefan Bratzel, director of Germany’s Center of Automotive Management. “If around 2.5 million vehicles take up retrofits or trade-in incentives with costs between 2,500 and 5,000 euros, the total cost would be between 6.3 and 12.5 billion euros,” he said.   There are 3.1 million diesel cars running to the Euro 4 standard, and 5.7 million Euro 5 diesels, out of a total of 46.5 million cars on the roads in Germany, according to figures from the German KBA transport authority. Environmental group Greenpeace accused the industry of exploiting the situation. “The carmakers are trying to turn their cheating on emissions into a sales bonanza for new cars - a strategy that will continue to damage the climate and waste resources,” it said. Klaus Mueller, head of Germany’s Consumer Protection Association told the Sueddeutsche newspaper that many customers would not be able to afford to change their cars even with the trade-in incentives. The proposals apply to diesel vehicles meeting the older Euro 4 and Euro 5 emissions standards. The current standard is Euro 6. Some leading figures in the industry saw diesel vehicles being phased out over time.  “We are obviously headed for the end of diesel,” Renault Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn told reporters at the Paris auto show where electric cars are in the spotlight. “It’s the end of the game,” he added.

2018-10-02,"ISLAMABAD/KARACHI (Reuters) - Pakistan wants to build an oil refinery near the deep-water port of Gwadar to reduce petroleum product imports, a planning official said on Tuesday as the government hosted a Saudi delegation reported to be considering funding the project. Pakistan is also during the Saudi visit expected to seek financial assistance from its oil-rich ally to avoid another bailout by the International Monetary Fund amid a foreign currency crisis fueled by a widening current accounts deficit. The government of new Prime Minister Imran Khan wants to turn the Chinese-funded Gwadar port into “an oil city” to reduce dependence on imported refined fuel, Khusro Bakhtyar, minister for planning, development and reforms, told reporters. The Saudis were reported by Pakistani newspapers Dawn and The News to be considering investing in what local media say would be a multi-billion-dollar refinery project. Bakhtyar mentioned neither the projected cost nor any confirmed Saudi investment.  Last month, Pakistan invited Saudi Arabia to invest in projects related to the China-funded Belt and Road infrastructure corridor, of which the Gwadar port is the crown jewel of some $60 billion in projects in Pakistan.  “An oil city concept has been developed for Gwadar,” Bakhtyar said, saying the country can reduce its $16 billion petroleum import bill if it imports cheaper crude oil to refine instead of more expensive finished products. “If we set up a refinery and complete Pakistan’s requirement through our refinery this oil import bill can be cut by half. And God willing, we will do this.” Khan made Riyadh his first foreign trip since he swept to power in elections in July, but there was no confirmation that the Saudi government might offer an economic lifeline. Pakistan has seen foreign reserves dwindle to about $9 billion, barely enough to meet its external debt through the end of the year, and the rupee has lost more than 20 percent of its value since December. Local media have reported that Islamabad is hoping for a deferred-payments deal for Saudi oil to help shore up foreign reserves and possibly even a bridge loan of around $2 billion, but officials on both sides have not commented on any requests.

The MSCI world equity index dipped 0.3 percent, paring Monday’s gains due to the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.55 percent. Wall Street slipped at the open with bank stocks the biggest drag, but soon regained some momentum. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 81.53 points, or 0.31 percent, to 26,732.74, the S&P 500 lost 0.11 points, or -0.00 percent, to 2,924.48 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.49 points, or 0.11 percent, to 8,028.82. The economics spokesman for Italy’s ruling League party, Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency. His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German yields to the widest for more than five years. Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering part of their losses. “We are dealing with a war of words, with the euro on one side and Italy on the other,” Credit Agricole head of G10 FX Strategy Valentin Marinov said. “There’s a lot of headline risk about.” Borghi and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down, calling the euro “unrenounceable”, helping to calm markets and erasing losses for Italy’s FTSE MIB. The euro fell to its weakest since Aug. 21 at $1.1505, before retracing to $1.1537, down 0.34 percent on the day. The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy’s debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European Union’s. Asian stocks were lower as the boost from the agreement to save the North American free-trade deal faded. The deal lifted optimism for a resolution of a trade row between the United States and China. China’s financial markets are closed for the week of Oct. 1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index rise to its highest since Aug. 21, at 95.744. It was last at 0.17 percent. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index, which fell 1.3 percent, setting it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month. Gold rose as investors sought refuge in the safe-have after equity markets weakened. Spot gold rose 1.6 percent to $1,206.11 per ounce, reaching its highest point since Sept. 21. U.S. gold futures were up 1.5 percent at $1,209.20. Oil prices steadied near their highest since November 2014 as markets braced for tighter supply once U.S. sanctions against Iran kick in next month. U.S. crude fell 0.31 percent to $75.07 per barrel and Brent was last at $84.77, down 0.25 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Helen Reid in London, Karen Brettell

Royal Dutch Shell said it would export LNG from Western Canada by 2025 after approving a $14 billion project, hot on the heels of Qatar’s commitment last week to expand its facilities. The two announcements, adding 37 million tonnes a year (mtpa) to the 290 million tonnes traded in 2017, are just the start of project approvals - known as final investment decisions (FIDs) - that have been waiting in company drawers while LNG prices recovered from a three-year slump. “We believe 2019 could be the busiest year of LNG FIDs ever,” Wood Mackenzie’s director of North America gas, Dulles Wang, said. Despite a slump in global LNG prices between 2015 and 2017, many had long worried there would be a global supply gap at some point after 2020 due to broadly fast-rising demand and the lack of new export projects to produce corresponding supply. Several projects that had been touted for years, such as Shell’s LNG Canada venture, were put on the backburner. LNG prices LNG-AS began climbing last winter and have since broadly stayed at four-year highs, seasonally, driven by China’s policy-dictated shift to gas away from coal. “If you look at the demand curve and the supply coming on stream, there are simply not enough projects that are being sanctioned or under development to meet demand by 2023-24,” Shell’s chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, told reporters on Tuesday. Shell’s vote of confidence in these new market conditions now gives credence that projects with capacities of around 175 mtpa will be approved by the end of next year as planned, with most expected to be running by 2024. Aside from these, projects with another 51 mtpa in the United States have already been approved and are expected to start operations between now and the end of 2021. Forecasts vary, but LNG demand is expected to jump to about 360 mtpa by 2023, the International Energy Agency has said, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie is projecting 450 mtpa. “There needs to be 200 mtpa LNG capacity authorised by 2025 to meet future demand – this is a colossal boom, a 42 percent expansion on the entire capacity installed since 1962,” Bernstein analysts said in a research note. “Ultimately, this is the start of a major LNG investment wave,” Bernstein said. Qatar Petroleum said it would build a fourth mega train, or production facility, with capacity of 32 mtpa to bring its supply to 110 mtpa by early 2023, more than twice China’s consumption today and enough to feed China’s demand that year. Other large project approvals on the horizon include Novatek’s Arctic LNG-2 project with 19.8 mtpa capacity after the Russian gas company’s Yamal export facility started operations smoothly and quickly at the end of last year. Two projects are planned in Mozambique backed by different commercial models: Exxon Mobil’s, like LNG Canada, does not make use of long-term offtake agreements to finance it. The other is more conventional, operated by Anadarko. A host of U.S. approvals are also anticipated, including from Tellurian for the 27.6-mtpa Driftwood project in the first quarter of next year, which is seen as a potential industry disruptor because of its LNG supply pricing models.

The United States aims to reduce Tehran’s oil revenue to zero in an effort to force Iran’s leadership to change its behaviour in the region. U.S. officials have said new sanctions will be imposed on Iran’s oil sector from Nov. 4. Bijan Zanganeh said in an interview on state television that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries lacked the capacity to produce more oil to make up for the drop in Iranian sales. “If Trump wants to bring stability to the oil market, he should suspend sanctions on Tehran,” Zanganeh added. Oil prices have extended a rally this year on expectations the sanctions on Iran will test OPEC’s ability to replace the shortfall, despite a June agreement among the group to pump more after pressure from Trump. Brent crude lost 37 cents to $84.61 per barrel by 1200 GMT on Tuesday after reaching a four-year high of $85.45 in the previous session. “China and Europe will be severely damaged by the U.S. sanctions against Iran,” Zanganeh said.

Shunned by Western powers, the Syrian government is looking to states such as Iran, Russia and China to play a major role in rebuilding the country, as the war heads toward its seventh year. Iran has provided critical military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, helping it regain control of swathes of the country. Iran experts say Tehran is now looking to reap a financial dividend. Iran’s Minister of Energy Reza Ardakanian was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency that a memorandum of understanding was signed on Tuesday. Iran’s state news agency IRNA reported that the MoU was signed by the head of the Iranian power and infrastructure group MAPNA and the head of the Syrian public authority for electricity generation. The project is to be launched next year, IRNA reported. “Iranian private firms are keen to participate in energy projects in Syria and reconstruct its electricity grid,” Ardakanian was quoted as saying by IRIB news. In 2017, Iran and Syria signed an agreement to repair Syria’s power grid. The agreement involved restoring the main control centre for Syria’s electricity grid in the capital Damascus. Ardakanian said he was hopeful that a second credit line would be launched between the two countries.

The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it had brought the men to trial after the ringleaders - two brothers and former directors of Solar Energy Savings Limited - were caught during a routine police traffic stop after seven months on the run. The men manipulated their victims with deceitful sales techniques, lies and false guarantees of reimbursement to misrepresent their deals and maximise sales. Around 1,500 victims lost up to 20,000 pounds each, the SFO said. The men paid themselves almost two million pounds and drove Lamborghini and Porsche sports cars, had cosmetic surgery and took private flights to Switzerland and Italy. They offered their victims a cashback scheme that falsely guaranteed that their costs would be invested and returned in a number of years. But in reality, the cash was transferred between a string of businesses in a scam so crude that investigators said the names of companies had been manually crossed out on certificates.

The leading index of euro zone stocks lost 0.7 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.5 percent as Italian assets came under renewed pressure, though the sell-off lost steam by midday. The economics spokesman for Italy’s ruling League party, Claudio Borghi, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency. His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German yields to the widest for more than five years. Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low before recovering part of their losses. But Borghi and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte backed down, calling the euro “unrenounceable”, helping to calm markets and erasing losses for Italy’s FTSE MIB. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. “We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy.” The euro fell 0.6 percent to its lowest since Aug. 21 at $1.1504, then recovered to trade down 0.3 percent at $1.1542. The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy’s debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European Union’s. “The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great fudges - think of the case of Greece,” the Saracen global income and growth fund’s manager, David Keir, said. “But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading. The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,” he said. Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free-trade deal faded. China’s financial markets are closed for the week of Oct. 1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index rise to its highest since Aug. 21, at 95.744. It was last up 0.3 percent at 95.546. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index, which fell 1.3 percent, setting it on course for its biggest one-day loss for a month. Oil prices recoiled slightly as investors took profit after crude surged to near four-year highs in the previous session. Crude contracts rose to their highest since November 2014 as the deal to salvage NAFTA stoked economic growth expectations, with impending U.S. sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. On Tuesday U.S. crude futures, having touched a high of $75.91, were trading flat at $75.33 a barrel. Brent crude edged down 0.4 percent to $84.60 a barrel, having rallied the previous day to $85.45.

2018-10-02,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Oct 2 (Reuters) - The crude oil and natural gas industries believe they have got their mojo back, with the overwhelming impression gained at two recent conferences that the future is indeed bullish. It was hard to find any downbeat delegates at last week’s Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference, the region’s largest annual event, or at the well-attended GasTech in Barcelona the prior week. However, one advantage of having been around the commodity sector for what seems like ages is that sometimes one can get a sense of deja vu. The crude and natural gas industries today sound remarkably similar to the coal industry of a decade ago. In the recovery from the 2008 global recession, the coal industry found itself in the happy place of being in strong demand to fuel robust economic growth in China and India, the two fast-growing economies that displaced Japan as the region’s top importer of the polluting fuel. The refrain at numerous coal industry events at the time was the outlook is bright because coal is cheap, reliable and necessary to bring electricity to populations in Asia that were rapidly moving from poverty to a more middle-class existence. This optimism manifested itself in some extremely bullish forecasts, which seem ridiculous with the benefit of hindsight. Among those was a forecast that China’s coal imports would rise to 1 billion tonnes a year, when they in reality peaked at 327 million tonnes in 2013. This rosy outlook for coal led the industry to invest heavily in mines to boost the availability of seaborne supplies, which in turn led to five consecutive years of declining prices as supply overwhelmed demand. But that wasn’t the real problem for the coal industry, what is causing them more problems now is the fact that they didn’t see either renewables and natural gas in their rearview mirror. A decade ago, coal industry executives dismissed both renewables and natural gas as too expensive, and in the case of wind and solar, too unreliable. What they didn’t anticipate was that renewables managed to lower costs dramatically as the take up increased, albeit with the help of government incentives in many countries. The advent of battery storage also appears to be mitigating the problem of intermittent supply, with the success of the world’s largest battery storage facility in South Australia being a case in point. Natural gas was also happy to sink the knife into coal, especially in the United States with the rise of cheap shale gas. The natural gas industry could simultaneously claim a price advantage in the United States as well as being less polluting. The pollution advantage also started to become more important in Asia, with China aggressively pursuing clean air policies that have resulted in natural gas, much of it in the form of imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), displacing coal in residential heating and industry. To all this, coal was left claiming it was still cheap and reliable, but the sharp rise in coal prices since 2017 has eroded the cost advantage. Now coal’s major threat is the withdrawal of financing and credit by banks and development agencies, and the curtailing of insurance. Getting a new, large-scale coal project off the ground is proving increasingly difficult, as shown by Adani Enterprises’ (ADEL.NS> ongoing struggle to start the Carmichael project in Australia’s Queensland state. In some ways, the only positive currently for the coal industry is that it is very profitable, given high prices and the limited ability to boost output. But how does this relate to natural gas and crude oil? Similar to coal 10 years ago, much of the positive outlook expressed by the industry is that they are necessary for economic development, reliable and not easy to replace. But it’s not too hard to imagine a scenario where renewables combined with storage end up being cheaper than natural gas, particularly in countries that have to import relatively expensive LNG. Crude oil has a better story to tell, given the current lack of alternatives for much of its use in ships, heavy transport, aviation and petrochemicals. Even if electric vehicles do claim a large share of the passenger car market, this will only make a dent in the overall demand profile for crude, rather than delivering a potential lethal blow. The main problem for natural gas and crude is rising opposition from environmental activists, coupled with government policies aimed at limiting fossil fuel consumption. As climate change rises in the consciousness of the world’s population, particularly the young, every report of record temperatures and unusually destructive hurricanes will be a nail in the coffin of the deniers of the science, many of whom are supporters of the fossil fuel industry. Just as coal argued it was cheap, reliable and needed, those arguments are unlikely to work in the long term for natural gas and crude.

2018-10-02,"SAN JOSE, Oct 2 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Costa Rica has long monitored its forests and the carbon they hold but it hopes to soon have a cheaper and more effective way to do it: by drone. Deep Forest, a project backed by environmental group Fundecor, semi-conductor manufacturer Intel and San Jose-based Aerial Robotixs, aims to give scientists a better idea of what is happening in the country’s forest canopy, and allow more frequent monitoring. “There are many ways of taking these metrics but none with this level of resolution,” said Felipe Carazo, the executive director of Fundecor, a non-governmental organization that works on sustainable forest management. “Here the advantage is the precision in a scheme that is cost-effective,” Carazo said at a Congress of Sustainability, Ecology and Evolution in San Jose. The project will use a drone to fly over remote areas of forest, using a built-in laser to “scan” the forest. The effort, still in an experimental phase, will scan three forests near the Costa Rican city of Guapiles this year, said its backers, who are financially supporting the test. They say the method could scale up to help many countries monitor their forests more accurately - a step both towards reducing emissions from forest loss and tapping into the market for carbon credits from forest protection. “It could help the region to fulfill the commitments we signed in the Paris Agreement,” said Timothy Scott, Intel’s governmental affairs manager. The project is not the first to use advanced technology to monitor Costa Rica’s forests. The Irazú project, a forest satellite monitoring system, also will track forests using a satellite launched in April. Around the world, drones are being used increasingly to gauge the health of forests, monitor illegal deforestation, and even replant forests from the air. For Ruperto Quesada, a researcher at the Center for Research in Forest Innovation at the Technological Institute of Costa Rica (TEC), the technologies simply reinforce monitoring of forests that has gone on for more than 30 years in Costa Rica. “In the end, the important thing in a country like ours is to guarantee the existence of forest,” he said. That, “in itself, guarantees the absorption of carbon, controls soil erosion, conserves biodiversity and provides other ecosystem services”. In part because of its monitoring systems, Costa Rica is the only country in Latin America to substantially reverse its rate of deforestation. The area of the country covered in forest has risen from a quarter in 1983 to more than half in 2010, according to United Nations data. Costa Rica’s decades of forest monitoring data make it easier to develop algorithms to analyse drone footage and judge what is changing in the forest, Carazo said. But making the drone scanning technology work has been anything but simple, project backers said, not least because the drone needs to capture and store large amounts of data as it flies. Simply flying the device at first took a big share of available processor time, and when the processor was overwhelmed, “the drone fell,” Scott said. “The pilot could not control it.” Intel then set about increasing the capacity of the processor so that the pilot could both control the drone and at the same time scan the forest. The drones used in the project also will use a high-definition laser - called LiDAR HD - to analyse an area of ​​the forest that, until now, was difficult for researchers to access: treetops. The LiDAR HD system has previously been used from airplanes or helicopters, both expensive ways to gather data, Carazo said. Putting the technology on a drone can help make the process cheaper - and more frequent, he said. ""We have been monitoring forests for more than 30 years, Quesada said. The new technology will be used to ""reinforce"" - not replace - that work, he said.

2018-10-02,"MIDLAND, Texas (Reuters) - The west Texas drillers that drove the shale revolution have overwhelmed the region’s infrastructure with oil production -driving up costs, depressing regional oil prices and slowing the pace of growth. The U.S. government continues to forecast the country’s oil output rising to fresh record. But competition for limited resources in Texas is making it harder for shale producers to turn a profit and encouraging some to invest elsewhere. Texas is home to the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil field and the centre of the country’s shale industry. In the past three years, production from the Permian has risen a whopping 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to 3.43 million bpd. All that oil means pipelines from the shale patch are full, so producers are paying more to transport oil on trucks and rail cars. Shortages of labour, water and even the fuel used in fracking are driving up production costs. At the same time, Permian producers are getting less for their oil, which in August traded as much as $17 a barrel below the U.S. crude benchmark. Sellers have to offer the discount to compensate for the higher transport costs. “We’re our own worst enemy,” said Ross Craft, chief executive of Approach Resources, a small west Texas oil producer which last year averaged about 11,600 barrels of oil equivalent daily output. “We can drill, bring these wells on so quickly that we basically outpace the market. It is going to take a little bit of time,” he said, for the infrastructure to catch up to producers. Approach Resources is leaving some wells uncompleted. That means the firm drills the wells, but does not fracture the rock to produce the oil. Other shale producers are also leaving the oil in the ground, waiting for higher prices to make the drilling more profitable. The number of uncompleted wells in the Permian jumped by 80 percent to 3,630 in August compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. Energy Department data. For the rest of the United States, uncompleted wells are up 10 percent from the same period a year ago.  Some companies are reducing the scope of their operations in the Permian. ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Carrizo Oil & Gas (CRZO.O) each moved a Permian drilling rig to another oilfield, and Conoco idled a second, the companies have said. Noble Energy (NBL.N) also has cut back on its well completions and said it is moving some drilling resources to Colorado. Global Drilling Partners, a drilling contractor based in the Woodlands near Houston, was set to drill seven wells with a Permian operator this July, but that has dropped to two wells starting in December due to lack of pipeline takeaway, said John Hopkins, a managing partner at the company.  “There will be a shift out of West Texas temporarily until they can solve their midstream problems,” he said. Companies are looking to boost their drilling in other fields in Texas, Colorado and Oklahoma, he said. Suppliers including sand and rail companies say they are hedging their bets by expanding elsewhere.  The price discount on Permian oil has hurt the share price of shale producers such as Parsley Energy (PE.N), which operates only in the Permian. Parsley delivered an eight fold-rise in profits in the second quarter versus a year earlier, and boosted output by 57 percent over the same period. But investors have dumped the stock on concern that plans to increase output by another 5 percent by spending 17 percent more will deliver diminishing returns. Parsley’s shares are down about 8 percent since the company reported results on Aug. 7. Spending plans in 2018 by 53 independent U.S. producers have risen a combined 18 percent over 2017, to $63.2 billion, according to investment firm Cowen & Co.    The U.S. in August produced a record 11 million bpd and continued investment in the Permian should see the country’s total output to hit an average of 11.5 million bpd in 2019.  But rising costs and bottlenecks have already slowed the pace of growth. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie estimates Permian oil production in 2019 will be 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) less than it could be because of transport constraints. Permian output will be 3.9 million bpd next year, Wood Mackenzie estimates, but could have been 4.1 million bpd if more pipeline space were available. “We’ve had a more significant increase in costs this year than we would have assumed,” Timothy Dove, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the largest Permian oil producers, said in August. Smaller producers without contracts to use pipelines are getting hurt most because they are forced to use trucks and railcars. Shipping oil by truck to Gulf Coast refinery and export hubs costs $15 to $25 a barrel, compared to $8 to $12 a barrel by rail and less than $4 a barrel by pipeline, according to market sources. The shift is leading to traffic jams on highways and rail crossings in far-flung parts of the Permian shale fields. It also means fuel for supply vehicles and fracking equipment can be in short supply locally.  “Truck traffic is unlike anything we’ve ever seen,” said James Walter, co-CEO of Colgate Energy, a Midland-Texas based oil producer, who adds his company has agreements to transport all of its crude and gas production via pipelines. Rail capacity is unlikely to increase because oil producers are reluctant to sign up to long-term contracts to lease rail cars. They would prefer to wait for the new pipelines to be built. Planned pipelines out of the Permian will add about 3 million bpd of oil capacity by late 2020, estimates Wood Mackenzie.  Rail firms are reluctant to buy new oil railcars without long-term contracts.  “We do think it’s a short-term situation,” Union Pacific Executive Vice President Beth Whited said in July. “So we will not invest to support that.”  Sand suppliers have moved quickly to alleviate one supply shortage by opening new operations. Some 15 sand mines have popped up in the Permian in the past year, creating a $1.2 billion industry almost overnight, consultancy Rystad Energy estimates.  These mines sell sand for about $40 a ton, saving producers nearly $90 a ton compared with sand shipped in from other states.  Just as elsewhere in the Permian, however, the increase in activity is inflating costs. Preferred Sands, which has a sand mine in Monahans, Texas, is paying workers there about 30 percent more it does in other markets, said Chief Executive Michael O’Neill, prompting the firm to open its next sand mine in Oklahoma instead.

2018-10-02,"(Repeats story with no changes to headline or text) By Stephanie Kelly and Rania El Gamal NEW YORK/DUBAI, Oct 2 (Reuters) - With oil prices hitting fresh four-year highs, long-dormant proposals to allow the United States to sue OPEC nations are getting a fresh look in Congress, though they were once considered a longshot to becoming law. A U.S. Senate subcommittee on Wednesday will hear testimony on the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or NOPEC, which would revoke the sovereign immunity that has long shielded OPEC members from U.S. legal action. The bill would change U.S. antitrust law to allow OPEC producers to be sued for collusion; it would make it illegal to restrain oil or gas production or set those prices - removing sovereign immunity that U.S. courts have ruled exists under current law. Past U.S. leaders have opposed the NOPEC bill, but the possibility of its success may have increased due to President Donald Trump’s frequent criticism of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and as some predict that Brent crude, the international benchmark, could reach $100 a barrel before long. “OPEC is a pet peeve for him,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research. “Everybody thinks he could easily support NOPEC.” Saudi Arabia is lobbying the U.S. government to prevent the bill’s passage, sources familiar with the matter said. Business groups and oil companies also oppose the bill, citing the possibility of retaliation from other countries. OPEC controls output from member nations by setting production targets. Prices are up 82 percent following the cartel’s decision to cut output at the end of 2016, hitting $84 a barrel on Monday, and lawmakers have trained their ire on the group, saying it is again harming consumers and represents interference in free markets. Wednesday’s hearing before the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights could give insight into the executive branch’s stance, McMonigle said. One of the witnesses will be Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division, who has written in support of such legislation. A version of NOPEC passed both houses of Congress in 2007 but was shelved after President George W. Bush said he would veto the legislation. Chances of passage this year are slim, as the U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to be in session only 16 days the rest of this year, leaving little time for anything but must-do legislation like keeping the government funded. Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is worried that NOPEC could turn into another Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) law, which allows victims of the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States to sue Riyadh, the sources said. The JASTA law is seen as key to why state-run Saudi Aramco was hesitant in publicly listing its shares on U.S. markets in an IPO that has since been shelved. With close to $1 trillion in investments in the United States, Riyadh has a lot to lose if NOPEC becomes law. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih raised concerns about it with U.S. officials, including U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, during private meetings in recent months, two sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Earlier this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American Petroleum Institute told Congress they opposed the bill, saying surging U.S. energy output had mitigated OPEC’s influence. Since the U.S. renewed sanctions on Iran this May, other nations, including Saudi Arabia, have agreed to increase production. However, that has not yet stopped oil’s upward climb.

2018-10-02,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and oil traders are now in fundamental disagreement about the market outlook and the standoff is fuelling a sharp rise in prices that could spell trouble for the global economy over the next 18 months. The overall balance between supply and demand is “healthy” according to a statement from the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of OPEC and non-OPEC producers last month. The committee expressed its satisfaction regarding the current oil market outlook, according to a press statement released afterwards (“JMMC meets in Algiers to monitor developments in the oil market”, OPEC, Sept. 23). But where the committee sees a balanced market and warned about downside risks to demand in 2019, traders see a market that is increasingly tight and are worried about the adequacy of future supply. Front-month Brent crude futures have jumped by almost $14 per barrel (20 percent) since the middle of August, including an increase of nearly $6 (7 percent) since the JMMC meeting, to their highest in almost four years. Brent’s six-month calendar spread, which has been a good proxy for the global supply-demand balance in the last 25 years, has risen by $2.50 per barrel and swung from a small contango into a pronounced backwardation. The recent intense backwardation in Brent futures close to delivery and the surge in Oman crude prices to a rare premium over Brent are all consistent with a market that fears physical shortages in the next few months. Hedge funds and other money managers have boosted their bullish position in Brent by 172 million barrels since late August, an increase of more than 50 percent, including 50 million barrels in the aftermath of the JMMC. Nearly all hedge fund managers expect oil prices to rise rather than fall in the short to medium term, according to exchange data. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OyHccI) Fund managers hold bearish short positions in Brent amounting to just 27 million barrels, the second-lowest level in the last five years. Across the entire petroleum complex, including crude and refined fuels, hedge fund short positions have fallen the lowest level since at least 2013. Where OPEC is worried about the potential for a slowdown in oil consumption growth as a result of rising prices and a possible downturn in the global economy, traders are more worried about the impact of sanctions on Iran. The standoff between the JMMC, in reality Saudi Arabia, its most powerful member, and oil traders about the state of the oil market is reminiscent of earlier periods of rising prices. OPEC and traders fundamentally disagreed for almost the entire run up in oil prices in 2007/8, with OPEC insisting the market was well-supplied while traders continued to bid up prices amid concerns about shortages. Experience suggests prices will continue rising until: (a) evidence of demand destruction becomes clear, or (b) the increase in prices forces a reaction from OPEC and its allies. OPEC tends to react to price changes rather than lead them (which is why its influence over the oil market is usually overstated by many commentators). In this instance, prices will continue rising until there is clear evidence of a slowdown in oil consumption growth, or an adjustment in production and sanctions policy from Saudi Arabia, Russia or the White House. Traders are hunting for the price threshold that forces one of those developments. In the meantime, the blame game is heating up, with the White House and OPEC each trying to claim the rise in prices is not their fault. U.S. President Donald Trump has blamed OPEC for rising prices in a message on Twitter on Sept. 20 and in a high-profile speech to the United Nations on Sept. 25. Trump has also reportedly discussed oil supplies and prices in a phone call with the king of Saudi Arabia on Sept. 29 (“Trump calls Saudi’s King to discuss oil supplies”, Reuters, Sept. 29). Despite close coordination between the United States and Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran sanctions, neither wants to be blamed for the escalation in fuel costs. The recent rise in oil prices confirms closely to the traditional boom-bust pattern. Oil prices are not inherently self-stabilising and display strongly non-linear and cyclical behaviour. The oil market cycles between periods of over- and under-supply. The market is rarely balanced or in equilibrium except by accident and not usually for very long. Experience strongly suggests oil prices will continue on a rising trajectory until softening consumption growth or an acceleration in production knocks them onto a new course. Position-building by hedge funds and other traders will accelerate and exaggerate the price movement in the short term but is not the underlying cause of volatility. If the past is any guide, and it usually is, OPEC and its allies will resist changing production, citing concerns about consumption and the growth in alternative supplies, until the political pressure on them becomes overwhelming. By that point, prices will already be close to peaking, extra OPEC and non-OPEC supplies will come too late, with consumption already slowing, and add to the subsequent slump.

2018-10-02,"* European stocks follow Asia lower * Italian bond yields rise, bank stocks sink * Oil near 4-year highs * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Helen Reid LONDON, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Stocks fell worldwide and European assets sold off on Tuesday after anti-euro comments from an Italian lawmaker dented the single currency and sent Italy’s bond yields to multi-year highs. A boost to investors’ risk appetite from the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact proved short-lived with the MSCI world equity index falling back 0.4 percent, its biggest loss in a month. The leading index of euro zone stocks lost 1 percent and the pan-European STOXX 600 fell 0.7 percent, tracking Asian stocks lower and extending losses as Italian assets came under renewed stress. U.S. futures also traded down 0.3 percent to 0.4 percent. Claudio Borghi, the economics spokesman of Italy’s ruling League party, said in a radio interview that most of the country’s problems could be solved by having its own currency. His comments drove Italian 10-year bond yields to a new 4-1/2-year high, pushing the spread between Italian and German yields to the widest for more than five years. Shares in Italian banks, which have large sovereign bond holdings, hit a 19-month low, falling as much as 2.8 percent and Italy’s FTSE MIB tumbled 1.2 percent. Clarifying his remarks later, Borghi told Reuters that Italy’s government has no intention of leaving the euro. However, the spectre of a euro zone breakup and stern words from EU officials about Italy’s budget kept markets on edge. Euro zone banks also dropped 1 percent as the comments reignited investors’ anxieties about contagion in the euro zone from Italy’s higher-than-expected budget deficit plans, which the government set out on Thursday. “While our economists do not expect systemic implications for the global economy, contagion risks have risen,” Goldman Sachs analysts said. “We think European risky assets remain vulnerable and there is potential for negative spillovers to the Euro area given the high trade exposure to Italy.” The euro extended losses to fall 0.6 percent to its lowest since Aug. 21 at $1.1504 and was last trading at $1.1509. The single currency has been hurt by concerns that a significant increase in the Italian budget will deepen Italy’s debt and deficit problems, and by extension the European Union’s. “The history of the euro zone tends to be one of great fudges - think of the case of Greece,” the Saracen global income and growth fund’s manager, David Keir, said. “But I would caution against any wider systemic spreading. The reality is making kneejerk reactions to big political decisions can very much be the wrong thing to do,” he said. Asian stocks were lower as the lift from an agreement that saved the North American free-trade deal faded. China’s financial markets are closed for the week of Oct. 1-5 for national holidays, but data showing weaker factory growth in China also hit Hong Kong stocks. The U.S. and Canada forged a last-minute deal on Sunday to salvage NAFTA as a trilateral pact with Mexico, rescuing a $1.2 trillion open-trade zone that had been about to collapse after nearly a quarter century in operation. The trade pact helped the dollar index rise 0.4 percent to 95.718, its highest since Sept. 4. The dollar’s strength weighed on the leading emerging markets stock index, which fell 1.5 percent - its biggest one-day loss for a month. Oil prices recoiled slightly, having hit nearly four-year highs in the previous session. Crude contracts had surged nearly 3 percent to $75.77 a barrel, their highest since November 2014, as the deal to salvage NAFTA stoked economic growth expectations, with impending U.S. sanctions on Iran seen raising prices. U.S. crude futures, having touched a high of $75.91, were trading flat at $75.30 a barrel.

The proposal formally be will be made by the government later on Tuesday and has to be passed in parliament to become law, the spokesman said. With the proposal, Denmark may follow the example of Britain and France who have pledged to ban new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 in a win for electric cars that could hit the wealth of oil producers and transform car industry jobs.

2018-10-02,"SEOUL/LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s leading climate scientists this week are preparing the final version of a cornerstone United Nations report to assess whether global temperatures can be kept in check this century to prevent the most damaging effects of global warming. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is meeting this week in Incheon, South Korea, and plans to discuss the report, which will determine whether global warming this century can be kept to a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).  The IPCC aims to release the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C on Oct. 8.  “The main issue of the report discussion will be around how we can get to a 1.5 degree limit and what will be the carbon (emissions) budget available to do that,” said Friederike Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University.    In 2015, nearly 200 nations pledged in Paris to limit the global average temperature rise to “well below” 2C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for a tougher 1.5C goal. The IPCC report, seen as the main scientific guide for combating climate change, will provide guidance on the required actions to combat climate change. There has already been a rise of 1C since the mid-1800s as industrialization produced rising emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas blamed for climate change. According to a draft of the report seen in June but subject to change, governments can still limit temperatures below 1.5C but only with “rapid and far-reaching” action. The draft said current pledges in the Paris Agreement are too weak to limit warming to 1.5C. The document said there was a need to increase renewable energy output by 60 percent between 2020 and 2050, while energy from coal should be scaled back by two-thirds. By 2050, that means renewables would supply between 49 percent and 67 percent of primary energy. Since the agreement was reached, U.S. President Donald Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris accord. “On the policy side of reducing emissions I think there will be a lot of points of disagreement,” said Michael Grubb, professor of international energy and climate change policy at University College London.  “If they fail to reach an agreement, it will be down to a fundamental division on climate justice between fossil fuel producers (and the U.S. administration) and more vulnerable countries such as small island states who feel their existence is under threat,” Grubb said.
