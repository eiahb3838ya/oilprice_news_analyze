2018-09-20,"(Adds NOC statement) TRIPOLI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Libyan state oil firm NOC has reopened the airfield at the southwestern Wafa oilfield after state guards ended a blockade, it said. “NOC is thankful that those blockading the site stood-down following the corporation’s public warning regarding this activity,” it said in a statement. NOC said output at the field had not been affected. Wafa produces around 40,000 barrels a day of crude and condensates as well as 400 million cubic feet of natural gas. A field worker said a first flight would arrive on Saturday. The runway is used by the company to transport workers and equipment as it is too dangerous to travel by road in the chaotic country that is still trying to establish the rule of law since veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi was ousted in 2011. NOC had said in a statement earlier on Thursday that the protesters were planning to “extort” Mellitah, the joint-venture between ENI and NOC that runs Wafa and other operations, for a “corrupt” contract, without giving details. Guards, paid by the state to protect oil faculties, as well as other groups regularly seize oilfields to pressure weak authorities into giving them extra pay and benefits, part of the chaos in the OPEC producer since 2011. NOC and other government entities have agreed in the past to some demands in the end to keep oil and gas exports flowing, Libya’s only source of income.

2018-09-20,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government has begun its promised review of oil contracts, starting with a major project won by a consortium led by U.S.-based Talos Energy, the country’s next energy minister said. Set to become Mexico’s first leftist leader in modern history when he takes office in December, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed during the campaign to review all oil contracts awarded under his predecessor for signs of corruption. He won a landslide election victory in July. Officials with Talos Energy, which also holds a 45 percent  stake, and Premier Oil <(PMO.L)>, which has 10 percent, did not respond by Tuesday to requests for comment. The chief executive of Sierra Oil & Gas, which holds a 45 percent stake in the project, welcomed the review. “They should check everything,” said Sierra CEO Ivan Sandrea in an interview. “Along with the entire industry, I’m most interested that they clear up all of their thoughts that there was manipulation.”  The consortium secured development rights for two blocks in 2015 during the first oil auction launched by the outgoing government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, following a landmark energy overhaul that ended the decades-long monopoly enjoyed by national oil company Petróleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], known as Pemex. Last year, the consortium, which also includes Britain’s Premier Oil and Mexico’s Sierra Oil & Gas, said its Zama-1 well drilled in the Area 7 shallow water block confirmed the discovery of a deposit that could hold between 1.2-1.8 billion barrels of crude oil. The contract and subsequent find are now under the microscope of Lopez Obrador’s top energy aides. “We’re making progress” in reviewing several contracts, Rocio Nahle, designated to be the next energy minister, told Reuters on the sidelines of meetings earlier this month between Lopez Obrador and energy company officials. “We’re beginning with that one.” The texts of the more than 100 exploration and production contracts are all accessible online and the rolling auctions that awarded them have been lauded by sector analysts for their transparency. The consortium estimates for the deposit confirmed by the Zama-1 well could extend into a neighboring block operated by Pemex. The two sides are negotiating an agreement to determine the size of each parties’ claim.

2018-09-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets rallied on Thursday, with the Dow and S&P 500 setting new highs, while the U.S. dollar slipped as investors viewed this week’s fresh U.S. and Chinese tariffs on imports as less harsh than initially feared. Still, investors remained cautious about the next steps in the U.S.-China trade dispute, driving long-dated U.S. Treasury yields lower. But the equity market’s early take on the latest moves was that they were mostly benign for the U.S. economy.

Some market participants hope China comes to the table and negotiates a deal, Mahajan said, referring to the bullish sentiment that lifted the week’s rally in equities.  “The other reasoning behind this could also be the market is thinking ultimately China will have to improve its trade practices, particularly on the intellectual property rights and  technology transfers,” she said. “If that becomes more fair now, the U.S. will certainly be a beneficiary,” she added.

2018-09-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Thursday, pulling back after U.S. President Donald Trump urged OPEC to increase production at its meeting in Algeria, and slowing bullish momentum that had previously propelled the market toward four-year highs.  Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled down 78 cents at $78.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 was down 32 cents to settle at $70.80 a barrel after rising nearly 2 percent on Wednesday. Global benchmark Brent has been trading just below $80 a barrel, near its highest level in almost four years, on expectations that U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third biggest producer, will reduce global supply. “We’re stuck in a range here,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, with prices supported by the U.S. sanctions on Iranian supplies and pressured by the potential that Chinese demand could wane.  Trump has imposed sanctions in response to Iran’s nuclear program that are to go into full effect on Nov. 4. Many buyers have already cut Iranian purchases ahead of the new regulations. It is unclear whether producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia can compensate for lost supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. The meeting is unlikely to agree to an official rise in crude output, although pressure is mounting to prevent a spike in prices. Trump weighed into the debate via Twitter, saying, “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember,” Trump tweeted. In the range-bound market, Trump’s tweets may drive prices down slightly, said Tyche’s Zahir, predicting that such tweets from the president would probably continue with the U.S. midterm elections fast approaching. “The last thing that he is going to want to have happen is diesel prices and oil prices hitting highs when people are going to the voting booth,” Zahir said. The mid-term elections on Nov. 6 will determine if Republicans maintain control of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Still, many traders and analysts expect Brent to move above $80 soon. “Brent is definitely fighting the $80 line, wanting to break above,” said SEB Markets chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. “But this is likely going to break very soon.”  BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum: “Eighty-dollar-per-barrel Brent is a psychological level, and unsurprisingly, as we approach it, it gets sold into as some market participants take profit. “As more evidence gathers that Iranian oil exports are heading sharply down,” Tchilinguririan said, “the more emboldened the oil market is likely to be to test, and breach this level.” Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault; Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London, Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo; Editing by David Gregorio and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-8-oil-prices-pull-back-as-trump-tweet-shifts-focus-to-opec-idUKL3N1W61GG,20 Sep 2018,"* U.S. sanctions on Iran oil exports start on Nov. 4

2018-09-20,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Caixabank (CABK.MC) on Thursday said it would sell its 9.4 percent stake in Spanish oil major Repsol (REP.MC) and book a loss of 450 million euros in the third quarter. Caixabank’s stake in Repsol has a market value of more than 2.5 billion euros. Like other Spanish and European banks, Caixabank is trying to comply with harsher solvency requirements and regulators are demanding banks focus on their core banking business. The lender, which first entered Repsol more than 20 years ago, said it expected the sale of its stake to have a neutral impact on its core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio. Following the transaction, the lender’s chairman Jordi Gual and its chief executive Gonzalo Gortázar will step down as board members of Repsol. Caixabank said it would sell down its shareholding in Repsol through a disposal programme. It would sell two existing equity swaps, equivalent to a 1.91 percent and a 2.7 percent stake in Repsol, at 15.39 euros per share and 15.55 euros per share, respectively, to be  settled no later than end of September 2018. The loss is partly related to the transaction with the equity swaps as Repsol’s current shares closed on Thursday, much higher, at 16.885 euros per share. The remaining 4.75 percent stake in Repsol would be accounted for as “financial assets at fair value” and its sale would begin immediately and terminate no later than the end of the first quarter of 2019. Caixabank reiterated it would reach a profitability target or return on tangible equity of between 9-11 pct in 2018.

2018-09-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published new data detailing how it drastically expanded a biofuels waiver program for oil refiners since President Donald Trump’s administration took office, responding to pressure from the corn lobby to boost transparency over the opaque program. The details published on the EPA’s website on Thursday showed the agency issued exemptions for 29 small refineries for 2017, freeing them from their requirement under the Renewable Fuel Standard to blend biofuels into gasoline and diesel, according to agency data released on Thursday.  That was up from 19 waivers granted for 2016 and 7 in 2015, the EPA said. The data provides the most complete picture of the EPA’s expansion of the controversial small refinery waiver program to date. The waivers save the oil industry money, but biofuels groups worry they also cut into the nation’s demand for ethanol and other biofuels, and have criticized Trump’s EPA for over using the exemptions. “Increasing transparency will improve implementation of the RFS and provide stakeholders and the regulated community the certainty and clarity they need to make important business and compliance decisions,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. The data showed that the number of gallons exempted from the RFS under the 29 waivers granted in 2017 amounted to 13.62 billion, nearly double the 7.8 billion exempted in 2016. More details of the gallons waived are available here: [L2N1W61A7]. The EPA is still considering five waiver requests for 2017, and has received a total of 11 requests for 2018, all of which are also still pending, according to the data. EPA had previously been more stingy with its waivers. It granted 19 of the 20 waivers requested for the 2016 compliance year - with some of those decisions made in 2017 - but only seven out of 14 requests for 2015. The RFS requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year, or purchase credits from those that do. Small refineries can apply for and receive waivers if they demonstrate that compliance with their requirements would cause them financial hardship.  The EPA does not divulge information on who applies for or receives the waivers, arguing the information is business-sensitive, and until now it has been sparing with details on the numbers of waivers and quantities of fuel exempted.  The expansion of the program occurred mainly under former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who left the post in July. His management of the program had prompted calls from biofuels supporters that the agency release more detail on the waivers.  Pressure mounted after Reuters reported that large refining companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Marathon and Andeavor all had applied for the exemptions, which can be granted based on the size of an individual refinery unit rather than the whole company. Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen described the EPA’s new data release as a “step in the right direction.” But he said more was needed. “Market participants and the public deserve to know exactly who is receiving small refinery exemptions and what criteria is being used by EPA in making the decision to grant or deny a waiver request,” he said in an emailed statement. Prices of blending credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), have plunged as a result of policy uncertainty and expansion of the waiver program. They fetched around 18 cents each on Thursday, traders said, little-changed from the previous session and matching a near 6-1/2-year low struck in June.  After Pruitt’s exit, Wheeler said he would follow up on the work of his predecessor to overhaul the RFS in a way that would satisfy both the oil industry and the biofuels sector.

2018-09-20,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Thursday that four of its new flagship power turbines in the United States have been shut down due to an “oxidation issue” and warned it expects the problem to affect more of the 51 units it has shipped, sending shares lower. The giant machines form the beating heart of billon-dollar electricity plants around the world. Analysts consider GE’s success with the new turbines, known as the HA class, critical to rescuing its power division from a steep decline in sales and profits.  “This issue, if not quickly resolved, could hurt GE’s turbine brand image and market share,” Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, said in a note, cutting his price target to $14 from $15.  GE stock was down 3 percent at $12.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. The problem was first discovered on turbine blades in a natural gas-fueled turbine operated by Exelon Corp (EXC.N) in Texas a few weeks ago, GE told Reuters.  The problem forced Exelon to shut down one turbine. Exelon said it shut down its three other units as a precaution.  GE and Exelon said they expect the turbines to return to service soon. Neither company provided details about the oxidation or how it led to the shutdowns.  GE is working with other customers “to address any impacted unit,” GE spokesman Chris Shigas said, adding that 10 other HA turbines in the United States were still operating. But, he added, “We expect the same issue will impact other HA units.” GE has installed 27 HA units in seven countries since they were introduced two years ago, but faces competition from rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (7011.T) and Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE). GE could be forced to pay millions of dollars in compensation to customers and make costly design changes if the problems persist, industry experts said.  The HA turbines have had trouble before. A group of units in Pakistan required costly repairs. The outage in Texas “represents a negative development for a company that has little wiggle room for more ‘shoes to drop,’” J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Thursday, cutting his price target to $10 from $11 a share. GE Power Chief Executive Officer Russell Stokes first mentioned the problem at the bottom of a post on its LinkedIn internet page on Wednesday, without identifying the plant or providing details. “The minor adjustments that we need to make do not make the HA any less of a record setting turbine – they are meeting – and in many cases exceeding – their performance goals at every customer site today,” Stokes wrote.  GE has received 82 orders for the HA turbine, which entered service in Bouchain, France, in 2016, and subsequently set a Guinness World Record for its high energy efficiency.

2018-09-20,"* Govt fears rupee could weaken further - finmin official * Currency has fallen 12 percent against dollar this year * Oil companies open to locking in futures if govt asks By Manoj Kumar and Promit Mukherjee NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - India’s government is planning to ask state oil firms to lock in their crude futures purchase prices, a government source said on Thursday, anticipating a spike when U.S. sanctions on Iran snap back again in November. The move would be another step to tackle a slide in the rupee, as oil prices are putting pressure on India, which imports some 80 percent of its crude demand. Its currency has fallen sharply this year against the U.S. dollar, amid a wider sell-off in emerging markets. “The futures should be locked in when crude price is down,” said the source, who is familiar with deliberations on the matter, adding the step should have been taken earlier. The rupee, Asia’s worst performing currency this year, has depreciated about 12 percent year-to-date against the U.S. dollar, closing at 72.39 on Wednesday, after a record low of 72.99 on Tuesday. Markets were closed on Thursday. The government is expected to announce a set of measures to discourage non-essential imports to stem the slump in the currency. Separately, a senior finance ministry official said there was a view that the rupee could weaken further in the next two months if proposed steps failed to kill “speculation in the rupee market”. “The gap between the announcement of steps and action is creating a space for speculation. We have to stop this,” said the official. Officials at oil companies said they were open to the idea of locking in futures if the government asked. A senior official at Indian Oil Corp, a state-owned oil marketing company, said they were considering some options in terms of forward contracts. He declined to give details saying this was “market sensitive information”. An official at BPCL, another state-owned oil firm, said they were trying to hedge margins, under a policy reviewed every quarter. BPCL is also studying a proposal to buy dollars directly from the Reserve Bank of India instead of the market, in a bid to quell strong dollar demand that is denting the rupee. “Whenever, there is sharp volatility in exchange rates, this dollar window is opened. We’re studying the proposal,” he said. Another official at state-run HPCL said the government had not officially asked for it to examine forward contracts. “In case it is needed, or the government wants us to, we will then look into it,” the HPCL official said. The officials declined to be named as the proposals are still under consideration. India’s risk-averse state-owned refiners have in the past been reluctant to engage in futures trading or hedging strategies, fearing administrative blow-back if bets go wrong. The refiners typically buy up to 70 percent of their oil needs through term deals and the remainder through spot markets. Unlike state refiners, private players Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy use hedging tools to lock in costs on the international market.

2018-09-20,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel between the past of dirty coal and crude oil and the future of renewables, according to an increasingly confident cross-section of the industry. A procession of senior executives of major companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp, espoused this view while speaking at this week’s GasTech event, the industry’s biggest annual gathering. While the industry has plenty to be buoyant about, including rapid and sustained Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the shale gas revolution in the United States, it is running the risk of getting ahead of itself, while ignoring the threats it faces. The idea of natural gas as a transition fuel was largely cemented by the International Energy Agency in 2011, when it published a report on what it termed the “golden age of gas,” which would see demand for the fuel jump by 50 percent to become 25 percent of global energy consumption by 2035. Natural gas was seen as a cleaner alternative to coal, a factor the industry was happy to seize upon as it allowed them to boost output while being seen as part of the solution to climate change, rather than part of the problem. The rapid expansion of shale gas production in the United States was largely behind the demise of many coal-fired power stations, while in China coal used in industries and for residential heating is being replaced by natural gas as part of the government’s efforts to reduce air pollution. These dynamics are part of the reason why many players in the natural gas industry expect the market for LNG to rise from around 300 million tonnes a year currently to at least 450 million by 2025, and possibly even higher. But for this to happen, almost everything has to work in LNG’s favour, and the risks must remain only possibilities. LNG faces several challenges in Asia, the market expected to take the bulk of planned new output. For countries that aren’t concerned with limiting carbon emissions, LNG is still more expensive than coal, especially if you plan to use low-grade Indonesian thermal coal. For countries that do care about emissions, LNG will struggle to remain competitive with renewables backed up by battery storage. For any would-be developer of a multi-billion dollar LNG project, the question has to be whether they can deliver the fuel at a price that can compete with what renewables plus storage are likely to cost in the future, not what they cost now. The high-cost of LNG projects is likely to make company boards and financiers cautious about committing vast sums of money to what may become stranded assets. The other factor that the natural gas industry may well be underestimating is the rise of environmental activism. For much of the past decade, the activists have focused their attention on forcing coal out of the power mix, but that is changing into calling for an end to the burning of all fossil fuels. In Australia, it would appear as much green activism is aimed at halting natural gas exploration as is targeted against coal mining. Politicians have started to take notice by taking steps to restrict fracking and also to ensure domestic supplies ahead of LNG exports. This sort of activism is likely to spread and the natural gas industry, having helped knife coal, are likely to find the blades turned against them. In some ways the natural gas industry should be embracing renewables and offering to work in tandem to create electricity supply networks that are both reliable and low in emissions. But under this scenario, demand growth for natural gas would be more muted, making it more likely that the industry will rather choose to fight renewables until the bitter end. Natural gas also has the advantage of being a flexible fuel, given it can be used for residential heating, in manufacturing and in transport. But if the industry wants those sectors to consume significantly more, they will need to invest to develop markets, and not only spend capital on boosting supply. Overall, the natural gas industry has reason to be confident about the future, but in giving up the concept that they are a transition fuel, they are inviting a fight with renewables that they are likely to lose in the end.

2018-09-20,"(Repeats with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MKZGBz By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners have processed a record volume of crude in the last three months, reversing the previous shortage of distillate but leaving the country with record gasoline stocks at the end of the summer driving season. Fuel availability has been helped by the absence of a direct hurricane hit on the major refining centres located on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, in stark contrast to the refinery closures caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Refiners have carried on processing at elevated rates well after the end of the normal summer driving season and into September in order to rebuild previously depleted distillate stocks (tmsnrt.rs/2MKZGBz). But the now-plentiful supply of gasoline and to a lesser extent distillate implies refiners will have to cut processing more sharply than usual over the next couple of months to avoid creating a glut of refined products. U.S. refiners processed 17.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in the week to Sept. 14, up from 15.0 million bpd in 2017 (impacted by Hurricane Harvey) and 16.6 million bpd in 2016. Refiners produced a seasonal record 5.5 million bpd of distillate last week, up from 4.5 million bpd in 2017 and 5.0 million bpd in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Distillate stocks have risen to 140 million barrels up from a recent low of just 114 million barrels in mid-May (“Weekly Petroleum Status Report”, EIA, Sept. 19). Distillate inventories are now just 6 million barrels below the 10-year average compared with a deficit of 25 million barrels as recently as July 20. Distillate availability has been improving significantly over the last eight weeks after deteriorating more or less continuously since the start of the year. But the consequence of heavy refining activity to produce distillate has been the emergence of a potential over-supply of gasoline. Gasoline stocks remained plentiful throughout the peak summer driving season and are now at a record for the time of year. Gasoline inventories stood at 234 million barrels at the end of last week, up from 216 million at the same point in 2017, 227 million in 2016 and a 10-year average of 215 million. Refiners use the shoulder season between the end of summer driving demand and the onset of winter heating to undertake scheduled maintenance and change refinery configurations. Crude processing typically declines by almost 1 million bpd between the middle of August and early October, before starting to pick up again from the start of November. But this year the decline may need to be deeper and/or longer than average, otherwise the market will head into the year-end with too much fuel, especially gasoline.

2018-09-20,"* Case revolves around Nigerian OPL 245 field * Sentence comes ahead of main trial involving Shell, Eni * Next hearing in main trial on Sept. 26 (Recasts, adds Shell and Eni comments, anti-corruption campaigner) By Emilio Parodi MILAN, Sept 20 (Reuters) - An Italian judge sentenced two defendants in a Nigerian corruption case to jail on Thursday in the first ruling on one of the oil industry’s biggest graft scandals. Nigerian Emeka Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo were found guilty of international corruption and each given four-year jail sentences, three sources with knowledge of the ruling said. Lawyers for Obi and Di Nardo declined to comment. The long-running case revolves around the 2011 purchase by Italian oil company Eni and Anglo-Dutch peer Royal Dutch Shell of Nigeria’s OPL 245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion. Milan prosecutors allege bribes totaling around $1.1 billion were paid to win the licence to explore the field which, because of disputes, has never entered into production. The main trial - which besides Eni and Shell also involves Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and four ex-Shell managers including former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded - is expected to drag on for months. But Obi and Di Nardo, accused of being middlemen and taking illegal kickbacks, had asked for a separate fast-track trial which, under Italian law, allows sentences to be cut by a third. Thursday’s ruling will not tie the court’s hand in the main trial. But Barnaby Pace, anti-corruption campaigner at Global Witness, said: “This judgment will send shivers down the corporate spines of the oil industry.” In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Shell said neither Obi nor Di Nardo worked on behalf of the company, adding it was waiting to see the fast-track judge’s written decision. “Based on our review of the Prosecutor of Milan’s file and all of the information and facts available to us, we do not believe that there is a basis to convict Shell or any of its former employees of alleged offences,” it said. Also in emailed comments, Eni reiterated it had acted correctly in the purchase of OPL 245, saying it had worked directly with the Nigerian government. Nigeria’s OPL 245 is one of the biggest sources of untapped oil reserves on the African continent with reserves estimated at 9 billion barrels. Eni, the biggest foreign oil producer in Africa, has been doing business in Nigeria since 1962 and last year produced 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shell is the biggest foreign investor in the country, producing 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. The sources said the Milan judge had ordered the seizure of $98.4 million from Obi and more than 21 million Swiss francs ($21.9 million) from Di Nardo. Prosecutors had alleged Obi received a mandate from former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete to find a buyer for OPL 245, collecting $114 million. Di Nardo, they said, took $24 million of that amount for putting Obi in touch with Eni. The next hearing of the main trial involving Eni, Shell and 13 people is set for Sept. 26. $1 = 0.9611 Swiss francs

2018-09-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sometime in the next few weeks, global oil consumption will reach 100 million barrels per day (bpd) - more than twice what it was 50 years ago - and it shows no immediate sign of falling. Despite overwhelming evidence of carbon-fuelled climate change and billions in subsidies for alternative technologies such as wind and solar power, oil is so entrenched in the modern world that demand is still rising by up to 1.5 percent a year. There is no consensus on when world oil demand will peak but it is clear much depends on how governments respond to global warming. That’s the view of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises Western economies on energy policy.     As Bassam Fattouh and Anupama Sen of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said in a presentation last month, the debate over peak demand “signifies a shift in perception from scarcity to abundance”, which is already changing the behavior of all players in the world oil market, including exporters. “Taking the ‘peak demand’ argument forward, it is generally thought that the world is on the brink of another energy transition, in which conventional sources such as oil will eventually be substituted away in favor of low-carbon sources.” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told a conference in South Africa on Sept. 5 that global consumption would hit 100 million bpd this year, sooner than anyone had projected.  With a sophisticated global infrastructure for extraction, refining and distribution, oil produces such a powerful burst of energy that it is invaluable for some forms of transport such as aircraft. Of the almost 100 million barrels of oil consumed daily, more than 60 million bpd goes for transport, and alternative fuel systems such as battery-powered electric cars still have little market share. GRAPHIC: Primary energy demand by fuel - 1970-2040 - reut.rs/2MNFxuU Much of the remaining oil is used to make plastics by a petrochemicals industry that has few alternative feedstocks. Although government pressure to limit the use of hydrocarbons such as oil, gas and coal is increasing, few analysts believe oil demand will decrease in the next decade. GRAPHIC: When will crude oil demand peak? reut.rs/2CEGUfs If the current mix of policies continues, the IEA expects world oil demand to rise for at least the next 20 years, heading for 125 million bpd around mid-century. Oil demand would rise less quickly if governments moved some way toward reducing the use of carbon-based fuels, putting into action already-announced plans, the IEA says. But it warns governments that existing plans are unlikely to make a huge dent in carbon emissions, and only a thorough change in energy use will bring down oil demand. The problem for the countries the IEA advises is that they are no longer primarily responsible for rising oil consumption. While oil demand in the big, developed economies has stalled, consumption is increasing rapidly in countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Non-OECD oil demand has almost doubled over the last two decades as new industries develop in countries across Asia, Central and South America and Africa. GRAPHIC: Emerging market thirst for crude oil - reut.rs/2MI9LiH The research unit of China National Petroleum Corp predicts China’s oil demand will top out at around 13.8 million bpd as early as 2030. Some analysts argue world oil demand could come down much faster if there were more efficiency gains in vehicles, greater market penetration by electric cars combined with lower economic growth and higher fuel prices. Investment in solar power is rising rapidly and even Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is supporting the industry, creating the world’s biggest solar power project.     Goldman Sachs has said oil demand could peak by 2024 under some circumstances, but slow adoption of new technology in less-developed economies could delay the change. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie is somewhere in the middle of the range, expecting demand for transport to flatline from 2030 and overall use to peak in 2036. Its chief economist, Ed Rawle, argues a fall in oil demand is coming, whatever happens:  “The signs of peak oil demand really are there into the future.

President Muhammadu Buhari, who won the 2015 election on an anti-corruption ticket, ordered government revenues to be placed in a Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the central bank as part of an anti-corruption drive. Money recovered from alleged graft would also be put in the account. The police on Thursday said they had launched a nationwide exercise to recover stolen funds, to be placed in the TSA, during which it discovered money related to the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation’s (NNPC) Liquefied Natural Gas business unit.

2018-09-20,"(Adds NOC statement) TRIPOLI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Libyan state oil firm NOC has reopened the airfield at the southwestern Wafa oilfield after state guards ended a blockade, it said. “NOC is thankful that those blockading the site stood-down following the corporation’s public warning regarding this activity,” it said in a statement. NOC said output at the field had not been affected. Wafa produces around 40,000 barrels a day of crude and condensates as well as 400 million cubic feet of natural gas. A field worker said a first flight would arrive on Saturday. The runway is used by the company to transport workers and equipment as it is too dangerous to travel by road in the chaotic country that is still trying to establish the rule of law since veteran leader Muammar Gaddafi was ousted in 2011. NOC had said in a statement earlier on Thursday that the protesters were planning to “extort” Mellitah, the joint-venture between ENI and NOC that runs Wafa and other operations, for a “corrupt” contract, without giving details. Guards, paid by the state to protect oil faculties, as well as other groups regularly seize oilfields to pressure weak authorities into giving them extra pay and benefits, part of the chaos in the OPEC producer since 2011.

2018-09-20,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government has begun its promised review of oil contracts, starting with a major project won by a consortium led by U.S.-based Talos Energy, the country’s next energy minister said. Set to become Mexico’s first leftist leader in modern history when he takes office in December, President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed during the campaign to review all oil contracts awarded under his predecessor for signs of corruption. He won a landslide election victory in July. Officials with Talos Energy, which also holds a 45 percent  stake, and Premier Oil <(PMO.L)>, which has 10 percent, did not respond by Tuesday to requests for comment. The chief executive of Sierra Oil & Gas, which holds a 45 percent stake in the project, welcomed the review. “They should check everything,” said Sierra CEO Ivan Sandrea in an interview. “Along with the entire industry, I’m most interested that they clear up all of their thoughts that there was manipulation.”  The consortium secured development rights for two blocks in 2015 during the first oil auction launched by the outgoing government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, following a landmark energy overhaul that ended the decades-long monopoly enjoyed by national oil company Petróleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], known as Pemex. Last year, the consortium, which also includes Britain’s Premier Oil and Mexico’s Sierra Oil & Gas, said its Zama-1 well drilled in the Area 7 shallow water block confirmed the discovery of a deposit that could hold between 1.2-1.8 billion barrels of crude oil. The contract and subsequent find are now under the microscope of Lopez Obrador’s top energy aides. “We’re making progress” in reviewing several contracts, Rocio Nahle, designated to be the next energy minister, told Reuters on the sidelines of meetings earlier this month between Lopez Obrador and energy company officials. “We’re beginning with that one.” The texts of the more than 100 exploration and production contracts are all accessible online and the rolling auctions that awarded them have been lauded by sector analysts for their transparency. The consortium estimates for the deposit confirmed by the Zama-1 well could extend into a neighboring block operated by Pemex. The two sides are negotiating an agreement to determine the size of each parties’ claim.

2018-09-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Thursday, pulling back after U.S. President Donald Trump urged OPEC to increase production at its meeting in Algeria, and slowing bullish momentum that had previously propelled the market toward four-year highs.  Brent crude oil LCOc1 settled down 78 cents at $78.70 a barrel. U.S. light crude CLc1 was down 32 cents to settle at $70.80 a barrel after rising nearly 2 percent on Wednesday. Global benchmark Brent has been trading just below $80 a barrel, near its highest level in almost four years, on expectations that U.S. sanctions against Iran, OPEC’s third biggest producer, will reduce global supply. “We’re stuck in a range here,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York, with prices supported by the U.S. sanctions on Iranian supplies and pressured by the potential that Chinese demand could wane.  Trump has imposed sanctions in response to Iran’s nuclear program that are to go into full effect on Nov. 4. Many buyers have already cut Iranian purchases ahead of the new regulations. It is unclear whether producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Russia can compensate for lost supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers, including Russia, meet on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate supply increases to offset the loss of Iranian barrels. The meeting is unlikely to agree to an official rise in crude output, although pressure is mounting to prevent a spike in prices. Trump weighed into the debate via Twitter, saying, “The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember,” Trump tweeted. In the range-bound market, Trump’s tweets may drive prices down slightly, said Tyche’s Zahir, predicting that such tweets from the president would probably continue with the U.S. midterm elections fast approaching. “The last thing that he is going to want to have happen is diesel prices and oil prices hitting highs when people are going to the voting booth,” Zahir said. The mid-term elections on Nov. 6 will determine if Republicans maintain control of both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. Still, many traders and analysts expect Brent to move above $80 soon. “Brent is definitely fighting the $80 line, wanting to break above,” said SEB Markets chief commodities analyst Bjarne Schieldrop. “But this is likely going to break very soon.”  BNP Paribas oil strategist Harry Tchilinguirian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum: “Eighty-dollar-per-barrel Brent is a psychological level, and unsurprisingly, as we approach it, it gets sold into as some market participants take profit. “As more evidence gathers that Iranian oil exports are heading sharply down,” Tchilinguririan said, “the more emboldened the oil market is likely to be to test, and breach this level.” Reporting by Jessica Resnick-Ault; Additional reporting by Christopher Johnson in London, Aaron Sheldrick and Osamu Tsukimori in Tokyo; Editing by David Gregorio and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-8-oil-prices-pull-back-as-trump-tweet-shifts-focus-to-opec-idUKL3N1W61GG,20 Sep 2018,"* U.S. sanctions on Iran oil exports start on Nov. 4

2018-09-20,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain’s Caixabank (CABK.MC) on Thursday said it would sell its 9.4 percent stake in Spanish oil major Repsol (REP.MC) and book a loss of 450 million euros in the third quarter. Caixabank’s stake in Repsol has a market value of more than 2.5 billion euros. Like other Spanish and European banks, Caixabank is trying to comply with harsher solvency requirements and regulators are demanding banks focus on their core banking business. The lender, which first entered Repsol more than 20 years ago, said it expected the sale of its stake to have a neutral impact on its core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio. Following the transaction, the lender’s chairman Jordi Gual and its chief executive Gonzalo Gortázar will step down as board members of Repsol. Caixabank said it would sell down its shareholding in Repsol through a disposal programme. It would sell two existing equity swaps, equivalent to a 1.91 percent and a 2.7 percent stake in Repsol, at 15.39 euros per share and 15.55 euros per share, respectively, to be  settled no later than end of September 2018. The loss is partly related to the transaction with the equity swaps as Repsol’s current shares closed on Thursday, much higher, at 16.885 euros per share. The remaining 4.75 percent stake in Repsol would be accounted for as “financial assets at fair value” and its sale would begin immediately and terminate no later than the end of the first quarter of 2019. Caixabank reiterated it would reach a profitability target or return on tangible equity of between 9-11 pct in 2018.

2018-09-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published new data detailing how it drastically expanded a biofuels waiver program for oil refiners since President Donald Trump’s administration took office, responding to pressure from the corn lobby to boost transparency over the opaque program. The details published on the EPA’s website on Thursday showed the agency issued exemptions for 29 small refineries for 2017, freeing them from their requirement under the Renewable Fuel Standard to blend biofuels into gasoline and diesel, according to agency data released on Thursday.  That was up from 19 waivers granted for 2016 and 7 in 2015, the EPA said. The data provides the most complete picture of the EPA’s expansion of the controversial small refinery waiver program to date. The waivers save the oil industry money, but biofuels groups worry they also cut into the nation’s demand for ethanol and other biofuels, and have criticized Trump’s EPA for over using the exemptions. “Increasing transparency will improve implementation of the RFS and provide stakeholders and the regulated community the certainty and clarity they need to make important business and compliance decisions,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. The data showed that the number of gallons exempted from the RFS under the 29 waivers granted in 2017 amounted to 13.62 billion, nearly double the 7.8 billion exempted in 2016. More details of the gallons waived are available here: [L2N1W61A7]. The EPA is still considering five waiver requests for 2017, and has received a total of 11 requests for 2018, all of which are also still pending, according to the data. EPA had previously been more stingy with its waivers. It granted 19 of the 20 waivers requested for the 2016 compliance year - with some of those decisions made in 2017 - but only seven out of 14 requests for 2015. The RFS requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into their fuel each year, or purchase credits from those that do. Small refineries can apply for and receive waivers if they demonstrate that compliance with their requirements would cause them financial hardship.  The EPA does not divulge information on who applies for or receives the waivers, arguing the information is business-sensitive, and until now it has been sparing with details on the numbers of waivers and quantities of fuel exempted.  The expansion of the program occurred mainly under former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, who left the post in July. His management of the program had prompted calls from biofuels supporters that the agency release more detail on the waivers.  Pressure mounted after Reuters reported that large refining companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil, Marathon and Andeavor all had applied for the exemptions, which can be granted based on the size of an individual refinery unit rather than the whole company. Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Officer Bob Dinneen described the EPA’s new data release as a “step in the right direction.” But he said more was needed. “Market participants and the public deserve to know exactly who is receiving small refinery exemptions and what criteria is being used by EPA in making the decision to grant or deny a waiver request,” he said in an emailed statement. Prices of blending credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs), have plunged as a result of policy uncertainty and expansion of the waiver program. They fetched around 18 cents each on Thursday, traders said, little-changed from the previous session and matching a near 6-1/2-year low struck in June.  After Pruitt’s exit, Wheeler said he would follow up on the work of his predecessor to overhaul the RFS in a way that would satisfy both the oil industry and the biofuels sector.

2018-09-20,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) said on Thursday that four of its new flagship power turbines in the United States have been shut down due to an “oxidation issue” and warned it expects the problem to affect more of the 51 units it has shipped, sending shares lower. The giant machines form the beating heart of billon-dollar electricity plants around the world. Analysts consider GE’s success with the new turbines, known as the HA class, critical to rescuing its power division from a steep decline in sales and profits.  “This issue, if not quickly resolved, could hurt GE’s turbine brand image and market share,” Jim Corridore, an analyst at CFRA, said in a note, cutting his price target to $14 from $15.  GE stock was down 3 percent at $12.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. The problem was first discovered on turbine blades in a natural gas-fueled turbine operated by Exelon Corp (EXC.N) in Texas a few weeks ago, GE told Reuters.  The problem forced Exelon to shut down one turbine. Exelon said it shut down its three other units as a precaution.  GE and Exelon said they expect the turbines to return to service soon. Neither company provided details about the oxidation or how it led to the shutdowns.  GE is working with other customers “to address any impacted unit,” GE spokesman Chris Shigas said, adding that 10 other HA turbines in the United States were still operating. But, he added, “We expect the same issue will impact other HA units.” GE has installed 27 HA units in seven countries since they were introduced two years ago, but faces competition from rivals Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (7011.T) and Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE). GE could be forced to pay millions of dollars in compensation to customers and make costly design changes if the problems persist, industry experts said.  The HA turbines have had trouble before. A group of units in Pakistan required costly repairs. The outage in Texas “represents a negative development for a company that has little wiggle room for more ‘shoes to drop,’” J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note on Thursday, cutting his price target to $10 from $11 a share. GE Power Chief Executive Officer Russell Stokes first mentioned the problem at the bottom of a post on its LinkedIn internet page on Wednesday, without identifying the plant or providing details. “The minor adjustments that we need to make do not make the HA any less of a record setting turbine – they are meeting – and in many cases exceeding – their performance goals at every customer site today,” Stokes wrote.  GE has received 82 orders for the HA turbine, which entered service in Bouchain, France, in 2016, and subsequently set a Guinness World Record for its high energy efficiency.

2018-09-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. refiners have processed a record volume of crude in the last three months, reversing the previous shortage of distillate but leaving the country with record gasoline stocks at the end of the summer driving season. Fuel availability has been helped by the absence of a direct hurricane hit on the major refining centres located on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, in stark contrast to the refinery closures caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Refiners have carried on processing at elevated rates well after the end of the normal summer driving season and into September in order to rebuild previously depleted distillate stocks. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MKZGBz) But the now-plentiful supply of gasoline and to a lesser extent distillate implies refiners will have to cut processing more sharply than usual over the next couple of months to avoid creating a glut of refined products. U.S. refiners processed 17.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in the week to Sept. 14, up from 15.0 million bpd in 2017 (impacted by Hurricane Harvey) and 16.6 million bpd in 2016. Refiners produced a seasonal record 5.5 million bpd of distillate last week, up from 4.5 million bpd in 2017 and 5.0 million bpd in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Distillate stocks have risen to 140 million barrels up from a recent low of just 114 million barrels in mid-May (“Weekly Petroleum Status Report”, EIA, Sept. 19). Distillate inventories are now just 6 million barrels below the 10-year average compared with a deficit of 25 million barrels as recently as July 20. Distillate availability has been improving significantly over the last eight weeks after deteriorating more or less continuously since the start of the year. But the consequence of heavy refining activity to produce distillate has been the emergence of a potential over-supply of gasoline. Gasoline stocks remained plentiful throughout the peak summer driving season and are now at a record for the time of year. Gasoline inventories stood at 234 million barrels at the end of last week, up from 216 million at the same point in 2017, 227 million in 2016 and a 10-year average of 215 million. Refiners use the shoulder season between the end of summer driving demand and the onset of winter heating to undertake scheduled maintenance and change refinery configurations. Crude processing typically declines by almost 1 million bpd between the middle of August and early October, before starting to pick up again from the start of November. But this year the decline may need to be deeper and/or longer than average, otherwise the market will head into the year-end with too much fuel, especially gasoline.

2018-09-20,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya’s parliament on Thursday backed the halving of a new value added tax on oil products, bowing to complaints by Kenyans squeezed by high prices, but the move drew protests from some lawmakers who want the levy scrapped altogether. The government has faced a fuel dealers’ strike, anger among commuters and a lawsuit after transport and fuel prices jumped when the 16 percent value-added tax on all petroleum products entered into force on Sept. 1. Some lawmakers opposed to the eight percent levy on the grounds it would hike living costs objected to its approval by acclamation, chanting “zero, zero”. But speaker Justin Muturi refused their demand for a formal vote on the measure. “The clause which was under consideration at that point was carried,” Muturi said amid protests by lawmakers demanding the removal of the tax. Earlier parliament’s finance committee had backed the plan, proposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta, to halve the 16 percent tax.  Operators of public transport minibuses, locally known as matatus, said the new tax, even at eight percent, would hurt demand for their services, and called for its total removal.  “We can’t increase bus fare too much. No one will board the vehicle,” said Maxwell Njuguna, a driver who sat in his empty vehicle at a bus terminal in downtown Nairobi. “The customers don’t understand and they quarrel with us. We are operating at a loss.”  The tax is part of a government bid to finance key priorities prudently while narrowing a fiscal deficit that the Treasury forecasts at 5.9 percent of economic output this year. Like other frontier economies, Kenya has found it tough to secure external funding as emerging markets from Turkey to Argentina are buffeted by turbulence and tumbling currencies. Kenya’s challenge was compounded by last week’s expiry of an International Monetary Fund stand-by loan arrangement for balance of payments support. [L5N1W01PS] The fiscal deficit reduction targets were set by the IMF when it granted a precautionary credit deal two years ago that expired this month. Legislators must approve the VAT proposal before Kenyatta can sign this financial year’s budget into law. Foreign investors are watching the events keenly. “Kenya should be a country of concern for investors at the moment,” Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital, told a conference in Nairobi on Wednesday. He cited the challenging external financing environment for frontier African economies and the risk that the shilling currency could weaken steeply in the near term.  The finance committee said in its report on the president’s proposals that the VAT measure is consistent with the government’s aim to avoid a huge funding gap in the budget. The finance ministry had budgeted for 35 billion shillings ($347.74 million), which it expected to collect through the tax in the financial year to the end of next June, the committee said, adding the halved rate will allow the Treasury to collect 17.5 billion shillings. Kenyatta said last week that further delaying the tax, which was passed into law in 2013 but never implemented, would compromise the government’s ability to fund planned social welfare and development programs. The finance committee also supported Kenyatta’s proposal to increase taxes on some financial services.

2018-09-20,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; changes dateline to NEW YORK, previous MILAN) * MSCI World index hits 3-week high * Dollar down at 7-week low, Treasury yields edge up * World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Sept 20 (Reuters) - World stock markets rallied on Thursday, while the U.S. dollar slipped, amid expectations that fresh U.S. and Chinese tariffs on reciprocal imports will be less harsh than feared. Still, investors remained cautious about the next steps in the U.S.-Sino trade war, driving long-dated U.S. Treasury yields lower. But the equity market’s early take of the latest trade moves was that it was mostly benign for the U.S. economy. Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock Inc. <BLK.N,> the world’s largest asset manager, said the United States was “a big winner” in the trade spat with China “in the short-term.” The greenback fell amid a drop in safe-haven demand for the currency and a resurgence in global risk appetite on relief that the new round of U.S. and Chinese import tariffs was less harsh than feared.] The Dow industrials index became the last of key U.S. stock indexes to regain record territory, while the benchmark S&P 500 opened at a fresh record high. “Our general view on the trade issue is that so far it has not been economically significant,” Mona Mahajan, U.S. Investment Strategist at Allianz Global Investors in New York. “Some market participants are hoping that China comes to the table and negotiates a deal, so perhaps there’s a little bit more of that,” Mahajan said, referring to the bullish sentiment lifting equities. The MSCI index tracking shares in 47 countries rose 0.71 percent to a three-week high, supported by gains in Europe and Asia. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.75 percent, as investors focused on bullish macroeconomic and corporate news. Consumer confidence and small business optimism remain near post-crisis highs, while there’s still more of a positive impact from earnings and U.S. tax reform, along with two more quarters of corporate repatriation of money held abroad, Mahajan said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 220.45 points, or 0.83 percent, to 26,626.21. The S&P 500 gained 17.11 points, or 0.59 percent, to 2,925.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 60.28 points, or 0.76 percent, to 8,010.31. Upbeat U.S. economic data pushed debt yields a little higher, but that was short-lived as investors remained focused on the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict. Some analysts were concerned China would resort to other non-trade measures to fight back against the United States. “We have been moving higher in yields ever since the last jobs report showed higher wages and now with the increased tension between the U.S. and China, there are some concerns that the Chinese would back away from owning Treasuries,” said Lou Brien, market strategist, at DRW Trading in Chicago. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, fell 0.54 percent, with the euro up 0.69 percent to $1.1752. The Japanese yen weakened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 112.47 per dollar. The dollar had benefited from growing trade-related tensions in recent months, as investors bet it would gain at the expense of riskier currencies. Some market participants believe the dollar’s current weakness might be fleeting as the Federal Reserve next week is widely expected to raise benchmark borrowing costs and shed more light on its future rate path. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 3.0757 percent. Oil prices steadied after U.S. President Donald Trump called on the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to “get prices down now,” slowing an upward surge that had pushed the market towards four-year highs. Brent crude oil was down 50 cents at $78.90 a barrel. U.S. light crude oil slid 16 cents at $70.96 a barrel after rising nearly 2 percent on Wednesday.

2018-09-20,"BRATISLAVA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Slovakia’s proposed Eastring gas pipeline, aimed at reducing southeastern Europe’s reliance on Russian supplies, could be operational by 2025 and draw initial demand of 12 billion cubic metres (bcm) a year, according to a feasibility study. The $2.6 billion, two-way pipeline would link Europe’s main gas transmission corridor from Russia via Ukraine and Slovakia with the border of Southeastern Europe — the Black Sea or Turkey. If the project wins final approval, construction could start in 2022 with the pipeline becoming operational at the beginning of 2025, Rastislav Nukovic, general director of pipeline operator Eustream, said on Thursday after the company disclosed the study’s findings. “The positive outcomes of the feasibility study represent an important milestone in common project development and move us closer toward investment decisions,” Nukovic told reporters. The pipeline would ensure southern countries, almost exclusively dependent on Russian gas, would receive gas even if Russian supplies via Ukraine were disrupted. It would also allow for new sources of natural gas in Turkey and the Balkans to be transferred further into Europe. Hungarian, Romanian and Bulgarian gas companies would also be involved in the project, which would be eligible for EU funding. The feasibility study outlines a new route snaking 1,208 kilometres (751 miles) between Velke Zlievce at the Slovak-Hungarian border and Malkoclar at the Bulgarian-Turkish border, Eustream said. The pipeline would have an estimated initial capacity of about 15 billion to 20 billion cubic metres per year with a potential upgrade up to 40 bcm in the next phase, Eustream said. As a project that will benefit more than one European Union country, Eastring is entitled to accelerated planning decisions and EU funding.

2018-09-20,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc  has won a long-term contract to provide liquefied natural gas to a Chinese company’s 441 megawatt power plant under construction in Colon, Panama, advisors on the deal said. The $900 million (679.79 million pounds) power project, being built by Sinolam LNG affiliate Sinolam Smarter Energy LNG Power Co, expects to begin taking deliveries of the super-cooled natural gas in 2020, the advisors told Reuters late Wednesday.  The deal with a Shell trading unit comes as a trade dispute between the United States and China has put global LNG exports in the spotlight. This week, China imposed tariffs on $60 billion of U.S. goods, including a 10 percent tax on LNG imports effective Monday, in response to the U.S. slapping tariffs on some $200 billion of Chinese goods.  Terms of the 15-year deal, which will meet all the fuel needs of the LNG-fueled plant, were not disclosed. The facility will require roughly 400,000 tonnes per year of LNG.  Sinolam LNG, a Panamanian subsidiary of private Chinese investment firm Shanghai Gorgeous, also is building an LNG receiving facility in Colon that will utilise a floating storage unit berth.   Energy consultants Featherwood Capital acted as commercial advisers for Sinolam, and Hogan Lovells were legal advisers. Shell declined to comment on the deal. In the 12 months to June, China was the second largest buyer of U.S. LNG, while Shell was the largest U.S. LNG seller, according to research published by energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie on Wednesday.  After years of slumping prices, in which oil and gas companies slashed costs and project investments, the energy industry is coming out of crisis.     At the Gastech trade show this week in Barcelona, delegates said the outlook for the natural gas business was better than at any point since 2014. Global LNG trading is expected to double in coming years, from 300 million tonnes this year.      This upturn is largely due to soaring demand for natural gas in China, where there is a government push to move millions of households and factories from using coal to employing cleaner-burning gas, and because countries from Myanmar to the Philippines may soon start importing LNG.

2018-09-20,"Sept 20 (Reuters) - Next-day natural gas prices for Thursday at the Waha hub in the Permian basin tumbled 60 percent to their lowest on record due to pipeline constraints limiting the amount of gas that can move out of the region. Prices for Thursday at the Waha hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL fell almost a dollar to 66 cents per million British thermal units (mmBtu), according to SNL data going back to 1991. That compares with an average of $2.25/mmBtu so far this year, $2.71 in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of $3.11. The Permian is the biggest U.S. oil producing shale basin and since much of that oil comes out of the ground with associated gas, it is also the nation’s second biggest shale gas producing region, behind the Appalachian. As the number of rigs seeking oil in the Permian rose this year to the highest since 2015, the amount of oil and associated gas produced has increased to record highs, constraining the region’s existing gas and oil pipes. Those gas constraints have boosted the discount Waha trades at below the Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana NG-W-HH-SNL. That spread rose to $2.45/mmBtu for Thursday, its widest since November 2008, according to SNL data available on Reuters. That compares with an average discount of 70 cents so far in 2018, 27 cents in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of 14 cents. Traders said Waha’s price drop was triggered by a pair of force majeures in Kinder Morgan Inc’s Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (NGPL) system that are expected to restrict gas flows from West Texas to the Midwest. A line strike on NGPL’s Amarillo line, a major route for Permian gas to flow to the Midwest, forced the company to declare a force majeure at Compressor Station 104 in Barton County, Kansas. Flows through Segment 296, which spans Compressor Stations 103 to 106, have averaged 500 million cubic feet per day (MMcfd), slightly more than half the previous 30-day average, according to S&P Global Platts. NGPL said it expects the Kansas force majeure to continue through Monday. NGPL also declared a force majeure at Compressor Station 168 due to maintenance on the Permian Line in Bailey County, Texas. The company said work there began Wednesday and is scheduled to be done Friday. S&P Global Platts said the Texas force majeure reduced flows for NGPL Station 167 to Station 112 by 45 MMcfd to 234 MMcfd on Wednesday.

2018-09-20,"* FERC filings show progress of terminal commissioning * Initial cargoes sold on spot basis before contracts triggered * Between 1.0 and 2.5 mln tonnes could hit spot market in Q1 By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - New U.S. liquefied natural gas terminals with enough capacity to double U.S. exports have either begun commissioning their facilities or are waiting for approval from the energy regulator, a review of their documents showed this week. Although long planned, the actual commissioning of plants has been a moving target in the past. Yet the process not only kicks off a new era for the global industry as the United States turns into a significant exporter. It also opens the taps for large volumes to hit the spot market before long-term commercial contracts are formerly triggered. The ramp up of U.S. LNG production comes just as U.S. President Donald Trump boasts of his country’s energy dominance across the world stage but may also hit a wall of Chinese tariffs set on the super-chilled fuel earlier this week. Activity at five terminals dotted mainly on the U.S. Gulf Coast means some production will start ahead of schedule with two or three plants producing their first cargoes this year, one as early as November. Analysts now estimate anywhere between 1.0 and 2.5 million tonnes of LNG will hit the spot market in the first quarter of next year, a significant amount in an industry still dominated by rigid multi-year supply contracts. While China is the second largest LNG importer in the world, its purchases of U.S. cargoes is low at 5 percent of the total it buys. Japan and South Korea are the other top importers. Based on regulatory filings and analysts’ forecasts, the first LNG is expected in December from Kinder Morgan’s Elba Island and Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass train 5, and in the second quarter from Sempra’s Cameron terminal and Freeport LNG’s terminal. Additionally, the pace of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approvals for Cheniere’s Corpus Christi plant surprised the industry last month with Wood Mackenzie now seeing first LNG from the Texas terminal as early as November. “We see somewhere between 2.0 to 2.5 million tonnes of additional U.S. supplies in the first quarter,” said Trevor Sikorski, analyst at Energy Aspects. “We think probably, most of the 2.5 million will be put into the spot market.” Spot market volumes are not recorded but industry group GIIGNL calculates around 77.6 million tonnes, or 6.4 million a month, were traded on spot basis or in short-term contracts last year. U.S. exports, at 15 million tonnes so far this year, have exceeded last year’s of 14.3 million tonnes, according to Thomson Reuters data. U.S. capacity has been 23.3 million tonnes a year (mtpa) since March when the second LNG terminal in the country, Dominion Energy’s Cove Point, came online. Cheniere, Sempra, Kinder Morgan and Freeport told Reuters their timetable for start-ups remained unchanged from their latest announcements. The four new terminals and one extension will come onstream in stages over the next two years and at capacity they will constitute 60 percent of new supplies expected to be added to the global market by 2023. The first trains and one extension alone have a capacity of 19 mtpa. Commissioning U.S. energy facilities involves a back and forth process with FERC which reviews and approves many stages of the start-up. The last major milestone before production is FERC’s approval to inject feedgas that gets chilled into LNG. Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Train 1 and Sabine Pass Train 5 both received that FERC approval in recent weeks. At 4.5 mtpa each, the trains add 9 mtpa to U.S. capacity. Privately-held Freeport LNG has been given permission to commission utilities at its 5 mtpa Train 1. It pushed back the start date of commercial activities to September 2019 leading traders and analysts to expect LNG exports to start in May. Sempra has filed all its pre-commissioning documents for Cameron Train 1, with capacity of 5 mtpa, allowing it to move ahead with initial commissioning. Kinder Morgan appears to be the furthest behind in the regulatory approval and commissioning process, the filings show. But traders say its modular design with much smaller units of 0.25 mtpa each means an initial cargo is possible this year. Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Veronica Brown and

2018-09-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) are joining a group of major international oil and gas companies in an initiative aimed at curbing carbon emissions in the sector, they said in a statement on Thursday. The move marks a U-turn for Exxon Mobil and Chevron. The top two U.S. oil and gas producers had resisted joining the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) after its launch in 2014. Exxon and Chevron differ from their rivals on several topics around climate, and in the past have refused to join a call by the European firms for a global price on carbon. Together with its three newest members, the group will account for around 30 percent of global oil and gas production and 20 percent of primary energy consumption, Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in a tweet. “The addition of 3 U.S. companies gives us more impact to lead the industry’s response to climate change,” he wrote. The OGCI currently comprises 10 firms including BP, Royal Dutch Shell, France’s Total as well as national oil companies of China, Mexico, Brazil and Saudi Arabia.  The announcement comes ahead of Climate Week in New York next week, a global gathering of world and company leaders around climate change. “We are pleased to be joining OGCI to work constructively on addressing the risks of climate change,” Chevron Chief Executive Officer Michael Wirth said in the statement. The OGCI created a $1 billion fund to develop technologies to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the sector as the world aims to shift towards a low-carbon economy.  Exxon and Chevron will each contribute $100 million to the fund, the statement said. Exxon in recent years came under fire from investors and faced lawsuits over its climate policies and disclosures.  It will expand its investment in greenhouse gas emission-reduction research as part of the initiative, the company said in a statement. Earlier this year, Exxon pledged to reduce its methane emissions by 15 percent by 2020 and last year began an equipment upgrade at its XTO Energy shale business unit to cut emissions during production. “It will take the collective efforts of many in the energy industry and society to develop scalable, affordable solutions that will be needed to address the risks of climate change,” Exxon CEO Darren Woods said in the statement. “Our mission is to supply energy for modern life and improve living standards around the world while minimizing impacts on the environment. This dual challenge is one of the most important issues facing society and our company.” The news of the U.S. firms’ joining was first reported by Axios.

2018-09-20,"* Govt fears rupee could weaken further - finmin official * Currency has fallen 12 percent against dollar this year * Oil companies open to locking in futures if govt asks By Manoj Kumar and Promit Mukherjee NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - India’s government is planning to ask state oil firms to lock in their crude futures purchase prices, a government source said on Thursday, anticipating a spike when U.S. sanctions on Iran snap back again in November. The move would be another step to tackle a slide in the rupee, as oil prices are putting pressure on India, which imports some 80 percent of its crude demand. Its currency has fallen sharply this year against the U.S. dollar, amid a wider sell-off in emerging markets. “The futures should be locked in when crude price is down,” said the source, who is familiar with deliberations on the matter, adding the step should have been taken earlier. The rupee, Asia’s worst performing currency this year, has depreciated about 12 percent year-to-date against the U.S. dollar, closing at 72.39 on Wednesday, after a record low of 72.99 on Tuesday. Markets were closed on Thursday. The government is expected to announce a set of measures to discourage non-essential imports to stem the slump in the currency. Separately, a senior finance ministry official said there was a view that the rupee could weaken further in the next two months if proposed steps failed to kill “speculation in the rupee market”. “The gap between the announcement of steps and action is creating a space for speculation. We have to stop this,” said the official. Officials at oil companies said they were open to the idea of locking in futures if the government asked. A senior official at Indian Oil Corp, a state-owned oil marketing company, said they were considering some options in terms of forward contracts. He declined to give details saying this was “market sensitive information”. An official at BPCL, another state-owned oil firm, said they were trying to hedge margins, under a policy reviewed every quarter. BPCL is also studying a proposal to buy dollars directly from the Reserve Bank of India instead of the market, in a bid to quell strong dollar demand that is denting the rupee. “Whenever, there is sharp volatility in exchange rates, this dollar window is opened. We’re studying the proposal,” he said. Another official at state-run HPCL said the government had not officially asked for it to examine forward contracts. “In case it is needed, or the government wants us to, we will then look into it,” the HPCL official said. The officials declined to be named as the proposals are still under consideration. India’s risk-averse state-owned refiners have in the past been reluctant to engage in futures trading or hedging strategies, fearing administrative blow-back if bets go wrong. The refiners typically buy up to 70 percent of their oil needs through term deals and the remainder through spot markets. Unlike state refiners, private players Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy use hedging tools to lock in costs on the international market.

2018-09-20,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Natural gas is no longer merely a transition fuel between the past of dirty coal and crude oil and the future of renewables, according to an increasingly confident cross-section of the industry. A procession of senior executives of major companies, including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil Corp, espoused this view while speaking at this week’s GasTech event, the industry’s biggest annual gathering. While the industry has plenty to be buoyant about, including rapid and sustained Chinese demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and the shale gas revolution in the United States, it is running the risk of getting ahead of itself, while ignoring the threats it faces. The idea of natural gas as a transition fuel was largely cemented by the International Energy Agency in 2011, when it published a report on what it termed the “golden age of gas,” which would see demand for the fuel jump by 50 percent to become 25 percent of global energy consumption by 2035. Natural gas was seen as a cleaner alternative to coal, a factor the industry was happy to seize upon as it allowed them to boost output while being seen as part of the solution to climate change, rather than part of the problem. The rapid expansion of shale gas production in the United States was largely behind the demise of many coal-fired power stations, while in China coal used in industries and for residential heating is being replaced by natural gas as part of the government’s efforts to reduce air pollution. These dynamics are part of the reason why many players in the natural gas industry expect the market for LNG to rise from around 300 million tonnes a year currently to at least 450 million by 2025, and possibly even higher. But for this to happen, almost everything has to work in LNG’s favour, and the risks must remain only possibilities. LNG faces several challenges in Asia, the market expected to take the bulk of planned new output. For countries that aren’t concerned with limiting carbon emissions, LNG is still more expensive than coal, especially if you plan to use low-grade Indonesian thermal coal. For countries that do care about emissions, LNG will struggle to remain competitive with renewables backed up by battery storage. For any would-be developer of a multi-billion dollar LNG project, the question has to be whether they can deliver the fuel at a price that can compete with what renewables plus storage are likely to cost in the future, not what they cost now. The high-cost of LNG projects is likely to make company boards and financiers cautious about committing vast sums of money to what may become stranded assets. The other factor that the natural gas industry may well be underestimating is the rise of environmental activism. For much of the past decade, the activists have focused their attention on forcing coal out of the power mix, but that is changing into calling for an end to the burning of all fossil fuels. In Australia, it would appear as much green activism is aimed at halting natural gas exploration as is targeted against coal mining. Politicians have started to take notice by taking steps to restrict fracking and also to ensure domestic supplies ahead of LNG exports. This sort of activism is likely to spread and the natural gas industry, having helped knife coal, are likely to find the blades turned against them. In some ways the natural gas industry should be embracing renewables and offering to work in tandem to create electricity supply networks that are both reliable and low in emissions. But under this scenario, demand growth for natural gas would be more muted, making it more likely that the industry will rather choose to fight renewables until the bitter end. Natural gas also has the advantage of being a flexible fuel, given it can be used for residential heating, in manufacturing and in transport. But if the industry wants those sectors to consume significantly more, they will need to invest to develop markets, and not only spend capital on boosting supply. Overall, the natural gas industry has reason to be confident about the future, but in giving up the concept that they are a transition fuel, they are inviting a fight with renewables that they are likely to lose in the end.

2018-09-20,"(Repeats with no changes to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MKZGBz By John Kemp LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners have processed a record volume of crude in the last three months, reversing the previous shortage of distillate but leaving the country with record gasoline stocks at the end of the summer driving season. Fuel availability has been helped by the absence of a direct hurricane hit on the major refining centres located on the coasts of Texas and Louisiana, in stark contrast to the refinery closures caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Refiners have carried on processing at elevated rates well after the end of the normal summer driving season and into September in order to rebuild previously depleted distillate stocks (tmsnrt.rs/2MKZGBz). But the now-plentiful supply of gasoline and to a lesser extent distillate implies refiners will have to cut processing more sharply than usual over the next couple of months to avoid creating a glut of refined products. U.S. refiners processed 17.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of oil in the week to Sept. 14, up from 15.0 million bpd in 2017 (impacted by Hurricane Harvey) and 16.6 million bpd in 2016. Refiners produced a seasonal record 5.5 million bpd of distillate last week, up from 4.5 million bpd in 2017 and 5.0 million bpd in 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Distillate stocks have risen to 140 million barrels up from a recent low of just 114 million barrels in mid-May (“Weekly Petroleum Status Report”, EIA, Sept. 19). Distillate inventories are now just 6 million barrels below the 10-year average compared with a deficit of 25 million barrels as recently as July 20. Distillate availability has been improving significantly over the last eight weeks after deteriorating more or less continuously since the start of the year. But the consequence of heavy refining activity to produce distillate has been the emergence of a potential over-supply of gasoline. Gasoline stocks remained plentiful throughout the peak summer driving season and are now at a record for the time of year. Gasoline inventories stood at 234 million barrels at the end of last week, up from 216 million at the same point in 2017, 227 million in 2016 and a 10-year average of 215 million. Refiners use the shoulder season between the end of summer driving demand and the onset of winter heating to undertake scheduled maintenance and change refinery configurations. Crude processing typically declines by almost 1 million bpd between the middle of August and early October, before starting to pick up again from the start of November. But this year the decline may need to be deeper and/or longer than average, otherwise the market will head into the year-end with too much fuel, especially gasoline.

2018-09-20,"* Case revolves around Nigerian OPL 245 field * Sentence comes ahead of main trial involving Shell, Eni * Next hearing in main trial on Sept. 26 (Recasts, adds Shell and Eni comments, anti-corruption campaigner) By Emilio Parodi MILAN, Sept 20 (Reuters) - An Italian judge sentenced two defendants in a Nigerian corruption case to jail on Thursday in the first ruling on one of the oil industry’s biggest graft scandals. Nigerian Emeka Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo were found guilty of international corruption and each given four-year jail sentences, three sources with knowledge of the ruling said. Lawyers for Obi and Di Nardo declined to comment. The long-running case revolves around the 2011 purchase by Italian oil company Eni and Anglo-Dutch peer Royal Dutch Shell of Nigeria’s OPL 245 offshore oilfield for about $1.3 billion. Milan prosecutors allege bribes totaling around $1.1 billion were paid to win the licence to explore the field which, because of disputes, has never entered into production. The main trial - which besides Eni and Shell also involves Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi and four ex-Shell managers including former Shell Foundation Chairman Malcolm Brinded - is expected to drag on for months. But Obi and Di Nardo, accused of being middlemen and taking illegal kickbacks, had asked for a separate fast-track trial which, under Italian law, allows sentences to be cut by a third. Thursday’s ruling will not tie the court’s hand in the main trial. But Barnaby Pace, anti-corruption campaigner at Global Witness, said: “This judgment will send shivers down the corporate spines of the oil industry.” In an emailed statement, a spokeswoman for Shell said neither Obi nor Di Nardo worked on behalf of the company, adding it was waiting to see the fast-track judge’s written decision. “Based on our review of the Prosecutor of Milan’s file and all of the information and facts available to us, we do not believe that there is a basis to convict Shell or any of its former employees of alleged offences,” it said. Also in emailed comments, Eni reiterated it had acted correctly in the purchase of OPL 245, saying it had worked directly with the Nigerian government. Nigeria’s OPL 245 is one of the biggest sources of untapped oil reserves on the African continent with reserves estimated at 9 billion barrels. Eni, the biggest foreign oil producer in Africa, has been doing business in Nigeria since 1962 and last year produced 109,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shell is the biggest foreign investor in the country, producing 266,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2017. The sources said the Milan judge had ordered the seizure of $98.4 million from Obi and more than 21 million Swiss francs ($21.9 million) from Di Nardo. Prosecutors had alleged Obi received a mandate from former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete to find a buyer for OPL 245, collecting $114 million. Di Nardo, they said, took $24 million of that amount for putting Obi in touch with Eni. The next hearing of the main trial involving Eni, Shell and 13 people is set for Sept. 26. $1 = 0.9611 Swiss francs

2018-09-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sometime in the next few weeks, global oil consumption will reach 100 million barrels per day (bpd) - more than twice what it was 50 years ago - and it shows no immediate sign of falling. Despite overwhelming evidence of carbon-fuelled climate change and billions in subsidies for alternative technologies such as wind and solar power, oil is so entrenched in the modern world that demand is still rising by up to 1.5 percent a year. There is no consensus on when world oil demand will peak but it is clear much depends on how governments respond to global warming. That’s the view of the International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises Western economies on energy policy.     As Bassam Fattouh and Anupama Sen of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies said in a presentation last month, the debate over peak demand “signifies a shift in perception from scarcity to abundance”, which is already changing the behavior of all players in the world oil market, including exporters. “Taking the ‘peak demand’ argument forward, it is generally thought that the world is on the brink of another energy transition, in which conventional sources such as oil will eventually be substituted away in favor of low-carbon sources.” OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo told a conference in South Africa on Sept. 5 that global consumption would hit 100 million bpd this year, sooner than anyone had projected.  With a sophisticated global infrastructure for extraction, refining and distribution, oil produces such a powerful burst of energy that it is invaluable for some forms of transport such as aircraft. Of the almost 100 million barrels of oil consumed daily, more than 60 million bpd goes for transport, and alternative fuel systems such as battery-powered electric cars still have little market share. GRAPHIC: Primary energy demand by fuel - 1970-2040 - reut.rs/2MNFxuU Much of the remaining oil is used to make plastics by a petrochemicals industry that has few alternative feedstocks. Although government pressure to limit the use of hydrocarbons such as oil, gas and coal is increasing, few analysts believe oil demand will decrease in the next decade. GRAPHIC: When will crude oil demand peak? reut.rs/2CEGUfs If the current mix of policies continues, the IEA expects world oil demand to rise for at least the next 20 years, heading for 125 million bpd around mid-century. Oil demand would rise less quickly if governments moved some way toward reducing the use of carbon-based fuels, putting into action already-announced plans, the IEA says. But it warns governments that existing plans are unlikely to make a huge dent in carbon emissions, and only a thorough change in energy use will bring down oil demand. The problem for the countries the IEA advises is that they are no longer primarily responsible for rising oil consumption. While oil demand in the big, developed economies has stalled, consumption is increasing rapidly in countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Non-OECD oil demand has almost doubled over the last two decades as new industries develop in countries across Asia, Central and South America and Africa. GRAPHIC: Emerging market thirst for crude oil - reut.rs/2MI9LiH The research unit of China National Petroleum Corp predicts China’s oil demand will top out at around 13.8 million bpd as early as 2030. Some analysts argue world oil demand could come down much faster if there were more efficiency gains in vehicles, greater market penetration by electric cars combined with lower economic growth and higher fuel prices. Investment in solar power is rising rapidly and even Saudi Arabia, the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, is supporting the industry, creating the world’s biggest solar power project.     Goldman Sachs has said oil demand could peak by 2024 under some circumstances, but slow adoption of new technology in less-developed economies could delay the change. Consultancy Wood Mackenzie is somewhere in the middle of the range, expecting demand for transport to flatline from 2030 and overall use to peak in 2036. Its chief economist, Ed Rawle, argues a fall in oil demand is coming, whatever happens:  “The signs of peak oil demand really are there into the future.

The mining charter - which was introduced to redress the exclusion of black people in the mining sector under apartheid - could, however, still be the subject of legal challenges if mining companies are unhappy with its contents after it is published. Communications Minister Nomvula Mokonyane said more details about the charter would be announced on Friday by President Cyril Ramaphosa when he unveils a new economic stimulus package, to kick-start economic growth. Policy uncertainty has stifled investment in the mining industry of Africa’s most industrialised economy, which has also faced a wave of job cuts during a downturn in commodity markets, high wage costs and a volatile labour environment. “The mining charter was deliberated upon and indeed cabinet has approved the mining charter,” Mokonyane told reporters in a briefing on Thursday, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Mokonyane also said the cabinet backed the withdrawal of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Amendment (MPRDA) bill, which would have given the state a 20 percent minority stake in new gas and oil exploration and production ventures, which the industry had said would discourage investment. Analysts say addressing policy certainty in the mining sector could lead to billions of dollars of new investment. “On both scores it will be beneficial to the investment climate, because until now there has been hesitation to invest in the sector because of the regulatory uncertainty,” said Lloyd Christie, a mining lawyer at ENS Africa. The Minerals Council, which represents South African mining companies, says policy and regulatory certainty could potentially add 122 billion rand ($8 billion) in capital expenditure to the struggling mining sector over the next four years. “We will be able to comment when we see the final document,” a spokeswoman for the Minerals Council said. Amendments to the MPRDA bill were passed by parliament four years ago but the draft law was sent back to lawmakers by former president Jacob Zuma in 2015 due to concerns over whether they were constitutional. The bill would have allowed the mines minister to require that a portion of extracted resources be processed domestically and not be exported in raw form. Sean Lunn, chairman of the Offshore Petroleum Association of SA (OPASA), told Reuters the group would support a separate Act governing the upstream petroleum industry “that will encourage and unlock investment.” OPASA members include ExxonMobil Total, Shell Anadarko, ENI and Statoil. $1 = 14.4826 rand

An MSCI index tracking shares in 47 countries rose 0.3 percent to a three-week high, supported by gains in Europe and Asia, but Chinese equities dipped after a two-day rally due to bets of government stimulus to limit the economic damage of new trade barriers. The pan-European STOXX benchmark rose 0.5 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei ended little changed, barely moving after a well-anticipated win by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a ruling party leadership vote. Wall Street futures pointed to slight gains at the open. Markets were also watching a European Union summit where leaders lined up to tell UK Prime Minister Theresa May she needed to give guarantees on the Irish border before they will agree the deal she wants to avoid Britain crashing out of the bloc. After a knee-jerk negative reaction to the new tariffs announced by Washington and Beijing on Tuesday, markets have been speculating that an immediate escalation could be averted. U.S. President Donald Trump has not made fresh threats to extend tariffs to all Chinese imports. “Making forecasts on Trump is always a risk but it’s a fact that at the moment the escalation has taken a break,” said Anthilia Capital fund manager and strategist Giuseppe Sersale. For his part, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week he would not would not weaken the yuan to boost exports. Broader market sentiment was at odds with a new Reuters poll that showed unanimous agreement that an escalating trade war with China was bad economic policy for the United States and could slow economic growth. Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, said he saw more reasons to take a “glass-is-half-full” approach, given the recent emerging market selloff. The consensus of the poll for U.S. growth showed a slowdown to 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 2019, less than half the last reported rate of 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, S&P 500 E-mini futures rose 0.1 percent following strong gains on Wall Street on Wednesday. The rally in global stocks has been accompanied a drop in demand for safe-haven assets, boosting U.S. Treasuries yields and sending the dollar to seven-week lows. The Japanese yen has also been under pressure. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes edged up to 3.0775 on Thursday but remained below the highest level since May 18 it reached on Wednesday. This move comes ahead of what is expected to be a hawkish meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. All 113 economists in the Reuters poll forecast the Fed would hike rates when it meets Sept. 25-26. It is expected to follow that up with one more before the end of this year, taking the fed funds rate to 2.25-2.50 percent. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals, dipped 0.38 percent at 94.184, a fresh seven week low. The dollar was 0.05 percent lower against the yen at 112.20 , while the euro rose 0.44 percent against the greenback at $1.1724. The pound rose 0.77 percent to $1.3245 versus the dollar, making fresh two-month highs, helped by growing confidence that a Brexit trade deal can be clinched in the coming months. Forecast-beating British retail sales data also supported the sterling. “Sterling was in a celebratory mood,” said Connor Campbell, analyst at Spreadex. On Thursday a French official said London and Brussels should make as much progress as possible towards a Brexit deal by October. Earlier UK Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Britain was over 85 percent of the way to agreeing a deal with the EU. The Norwegian crown slumped versus the euro after the country’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, as expected, but trimmed its policy rate forecasts. The crown fell 0.7 percent versus the euro to 9.584 . In commodities, oil prices steadied but the market remained bullish after news of another fall in U.S. crude inventories and on signs that OPEC may not raise production enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports hit by sanctions. Brent crude dipped 0.1 percent at $79.37. On metal markets, copper ended two days of gains, falling 0.6 percent at $6,080 a tonne, as concerns resurfaced about the health of the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates ahead of a central bank meeting.

2018-09-20,"(Adds background) WASHINGTON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump linked American support for Middle Eastern countries to oil prices on Thursday as he again urged OPEC to lower prices. “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” Trump wrote on Twitter. The Republican president has lashed out at the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries over the past several months. Rising U.S. gasoline prices could create a political headache for Trump before November congressional elections by offsetting Republican claims that his tax cuts and rollbacks of federal regulations have helped boost the U.S. economy. Trump has called on Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s largest producer, to raise output, saying that it should help the United States lower fuel prices since Washington is aiding Riyadh in its struggle against Iran. OPEC and its allies are unlikely to agree to an official increase in crude output when they meet in Algeria this weekend, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC sources told Reuters on Thursday. The new sanctions take effect in November, as a result of with Trump’s decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement on Iran’s nuclear program. Saudi Arabia is worried that any sanctions-related spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from Trump, but it also faces doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in Iranian supply, the sources said. In a visit to Moscow this month, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said Saudi Arabia, the United States and Russia can between them raise global output in the next 18 months to compensate for falling oil supplies from Iran.

2018-09-20,"DUBAI (Reuters) - OPEC and its allies are unlikely to agree an official increase in crude output when they meet in Algeria this weekend, although pressure is mounting on top producers to prevent a spike in oil prices ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, OPEC sources said. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is worried that any sanctions-related spike in oil prices will trigger fresh criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump but is concerned about a lack of spare oil capacity to offset shortages, the sources said.  The kingdom is caught between a rock and a hard place, seeking to prevent prices from rising far above $80 a barrel ahead of U.S. congressional elections while fending off doubts over its ability to compensate for a drop in Iranian supply. “It’s complicated. Saudi Arabia has to balance oil supply and demand, and it has to balance oil prices so they don’t rise too much before the U.S. elections,” one OPEC source said. “It’s also political because the Saudis don’t want to pump too much oil then the Iranians complain to OPEC that it (Saudi Arabia) is taking (Iran’s) market share. They also don’t want oil prices to fall too much.” Trump took aim at OPEC on Thursday, writing on Twitter: “We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices! We will remember. The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now!” Under pressure from the U.S. president, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other allies agreed in June to boost production by 1 million barrels per day, having participated in a supply-cutting deal since 2017. The so-called “OPEC+” coalition meets on Sunday in Algeria to discuss how to allocate that 1 million bpd increase within its quota framework. OPEC sources say there is no immediate plan for any official action as such a move would require OPEC to hold what it calls an extraordinary meeting, which is not on the table.  The weekend gathering will discuss how to share the previously agreed output increase and examine whether the market needs more oil to offset the loss of Iranian supply as well as a decline in Venezuelan output, the sources said. Two sources said the meeting could produce a recommendation on dividing the increase, as most participating countries would be represented. “There are no proposals for an extraordinary meeting in Algeria,” another OPEC source said.  The source added that the joint OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial committee known as the JMMC, which meets in Algiers on Sunday, can still recommend to the wider coalition a further increase in output if needed. A separate OPEC source said: “To make a decision, you need to have all the ministers. Not all ministers are attending but most delegations will be represented.”  U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports come into force in November, with supply from the country already at two-year lows. Falling Venezuelan output and unplanned outages elsewhere will also keep the supply-demand balance tight. Fears over supply shortages have boosted crude prices in recent weeks, and international benchmark Brent LCOc1 was trading above $79 a barrel on Thursday.  Washington wants to cut Iranian oil exports to zero by November and is pushing Saudi Arabia, other OPEC members and Russia to pump more to meet the shortfall.  OPEC and industry sources told Reuters that Chinese, Indian and other Asian refiners had been asking Middle Eastern producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait for more cargoes. While some producers face supply restrictions due to infrastructure constraints or a desire not to be seen as flooding the market, others are quietly boosting exports to Asia, the sources said. Though OPEC production has increased since July, Saudi Arabia has added less crude than it initially indicated. Saudi officials believe there is insufficient oil demand so far to justify raising Saudi output much beyond the roughly 400,000 bpd that it has pumped above its 10 million bpd target, OPEC and industry sources told Reuters. But that has raised some doubt over whether Riyadh can quickly boost output to what the kingdom says is its maximum sustainable capacity of 12 million bpd, the sources said. Though Saudi Arabia has never tested such high levels, it has said it pumped 10.7-10.8 million bpd in the past.  Industry sources familiar with Saudi oil plans say state energy giant Aramco can raise output quickly to 11 million bpd, but reaching 12 million bpd could take up to six months. Spare capacity refers to a producer’s ability to ramp up production in a relatively short time. Much of it is located in the Middle East. OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo, meanwhile, warned this week of underinvestment in the global oil industry. “We have seen a contraction in the level of investments in the last couple of years in response to the impact of the downturn,” Barkindo told Reuters TV in an interview, referring to a drop in oil prices that started in 2014. “It is our hope that with the gradual return of confidence in the market we will be able to see a higher level of investment in the industry, that will ensure that at any given time a certain level of spare capacity will serve us as a buffer against volatility.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal; Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London; Editing by Dale Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-algeria/opec-unlikely-to-agree-official-output-increase-in-algeria-but-pressure-mounts-idUKL8N1W60LE,20 Sep 2018,"OPEC and its allies are unlikely

2018-09-20,"(Adds detail, background) By Hadeel Al Sayegh DUBAI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabian utility developer ACWA Power IPO-ACPO.SE has delayed plans for an initial public offering (IPO), originally envisaged for this year, sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday. It is the latest company to delay a public listing in Saudi Arabia at a time when the government is focused on attracting more investment to the stock market under its push to move the economy away from a dependence on oil revenues. A spokesman for ACWA Power declined to comment. The company has $30 billion of assets under management and counts Saudi sovereign wealth fund Public Investment Fund as a shareholder. ACWA Power, which develops power and desalinated water plants, had been planning to sell a 30 percent stake in an IPO in Riyadh by the end of the year. It hired JP Morgan, Citigroup, Natixis and Riyad Capital to advise on that process, sources told Reuters in March. But sources now say the transaction will not happen this year, with one saying the IPO will be delayed for at least a year. Problems relating to an ACWA Power project in Turkey were one reason for the delay, one of the sources said. Last year, ACWA Power launched the $1 billion Kirikkale Power Plant, with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts and capable of meeting three percent of Turkey’s total electricity demand. But players in the Turkish power market have had their margins squeezed due to slow reform in the sector and Turkey’s recent economic plight. Several other Saudi companies have delayed IPO plans in the past year. Most notably, Saudi Arabia recently called off plans for the domestic and international listing of state oil giant Saudi Aramco. Earlier this year, the Saudi Stock Exchange also delayed plans for its public share sale, partly due to anticipation that a MSCI upgrade could lift its valuation, sources previously told Reuters, while proposals for the IPO of Arabian Centres also stalled. MSCI in June said it would add Saudi Arabian stocks to its widely-tracked emerging markets benchmark, but an inflow of foreign funds as a result of the move is expected to take several months.

2018-09-20,"* Diesel demand to grow up to 1.7 pct this year -sources * Higher industrial output, truck sales, mining boost diesel use * But diesel demand increase likely temporary -CNPC researcher By Jessica Jaganathan and Meng Meng SINGAPORE/BEIJING, Sept 20 (Reuters) - China’s diesel demand will grow at its fastest in at least five years as a pick-up in diesel-intensive sectors in the world’s second-biggest economy coincides with lower output from domestic refineries, several sources and analysts said. Estimates of the hike in diesel use from three analysts and two oil industry sources range from 0.3 to 1.7 percent for 2018 compared with last year’s stagnant growth, pointing towards a recovery for the industrial and transport fuel. Diesel accounts for about 30 percent of China’s appetite for petroleum products and is typically used to fuel trucks, as well as mining and construction equipment. The slight pick-up in Chinese demand helped to boost Asian diesel margins to their highest in more than three years earlier this month. “Our outlook for Chinese diesel demand remains positive, with consumption set to remain supported over the coming years with positive ... trends in key diesel-intensive sectors, such as construction, manufacturing, freight and mining,” said Richard Taylor, oil and gas analyst at Fitch Solutions. This year’s diesel growth will be the fastest since 2011, said Energy Aspects analyst Nevyn Nah. The demand increase is likely temporary, however, said the research unit of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) , with economic growth moderating and tighter environmental scrutiny from Beijing. “China’s diesel demand will stay around peak levels until 2020. After that, consumption will slowly go down,” said Wang Lining, researcher from CNPC Research Institute of Economic and Technology. “We noticed the recent pickup in infrastructure investment which led to a temporary boom in diesel consumption,” Wang said. Besides increased demand from industry and mining, the lifting of an annual fishing ban of up to four months in certain areas this year has created pent-up demand for diesel, the industry sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media. Higher industrial output ahead of the Golden Week holiday in early October also boosted demand, the sources said. Industrial output in China rose 6.1 percent in August from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said last week, a tick higher than in July. Medium and heavy truck sales were up 3.5 percent in the first eight months from a year ago as car producers sold 2.6 million trucks in the period, data from China Association of Automobile Manufacturing also showed. Also, tightening tax rules implemented in March have led to a cut in imports of blending stocks such as light cycle oil (LCO), stoking demand for diesel in the domestic market instead, two of the sources said. Premiums for LCO exported from South Korea this year have at least halved to $5 to $6 a tonne since last year, indicating a drop in demand from its main customers in China, one of the sources said. Led by a spike in benchmark crude prices, wholesale diesel prices in China have jumped 22 percent from the start of the year to 7,838 yuan ($1,140.40) per tonne, the highest in four years, according to consultancy JLC. In comparison, the price of 10ppm diesel loading in Singapore is just over $700, about 5,000 yuan, a tonne, Reuters data showed. GO10-SIN The disparity in prices also led to a recent rare import of diesel cargo into China, and has boosted margins and diesel appetite among fuel sellers, the sources said. Diesel margins were also lifted because of lower diesel output due to prolonged maintenance by independent Chinese refiners amid higher oil prices and a shift towards cleaner diesel in the marine sector.

2018-09-20,"* Gunvor, Vitol, Trafigura eye global LNG market * Bangladesh seeks gas imports as domestic supply slides * LNG officials says smaller LNG projects costlier By Ruma Paul and Sabina Zawadzki DHAKA/LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Bangladesh has put aside two smaller liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects with trading houses Gunvor and Vitol to focus on two larger LNG import terminals, one of which is already in use while the second will start up in March. Bangladesh has turned to LNG to offset falling domestic gas output to feed industrial demand and electricity generation in a nation of 160 million people where a third have no power supply. It aims to import 17 million tonnes a year of LNG by 2025, which in today’s terms would make it a top five importer. This attracted commodity merchants Vitol, Gunvor and Trafigura in their bid to muscle in on the global LNG business. Bangladesh began importing LNG on a regular basis this month after the arrival of a Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU) in April in Moheshkhali port by Cox’s Bazar. A second FSRU project, operated by Summit Corp with Japan’s Mitsubishi Corp as partner, will start operations in March and double the country’s import capacity to 7.5 million tonnes a year. Bangladesh had also touted several smaller projects, drawing interest from Vitol, Gunvor and Trafigura, as well as energy giants like Exxon Mobil. It is now changing tack. “These small projects are not a priority anymore,” said Mohammad Quamruzzaman, managing director of the Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co, the unit in charge of LNG imports at state-owned oil firm Petrobangla. “These are costlier than the bigger ones. Why should we go for the costlier option when there is no urgency right now? One bigger-capacity FSRU has started operations and another is expected to be commissioned by March,” he told Reuters. Trafigura and Gunvor had vied for smaller LNG projects close to Chittagong, an industrial region north of Cox’s Bazar. Bangladesh said in May it had terminated talks with Trafigura. Vitol was chosen above Exxon to develop a small FSRU by the ageing Sangu gas platform in the Bay of Bengal. Vitol said on Thursday it had no comment when asked about LNG plans in Bangladesh. Gunvor appeared to have progressed the farthest with its plan to import LNG for a fertiliser complex. Belgian shipping firm Exmar said in May that Gunvor had chartered its small FSRU for 10 years. When asked about the Gunvor project, Quamruzzaman said its chances were “very slim”, although he said all the LNG projects could be revived at anytime. A Gunvor spokesman said: “Our project has not been dropped.” Exmar said this month the FSRU was at a shipyard being modified. A senior Petrobangla official said the terms for the Gunvor deal was for LNG priced at 11.95 percent of Brent crude plus a fixed $0.93 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) and an additional $1.075 per mmBtu as infrastructure cost. When Brent crude prices are at $70 a barrel, that translates to $10.37 per mmBtu and at $80 a barrel, it is $11.57 per mmBtu compared to $11.40 per mmBtu for October delivery on the spot market last week. LNG-AS “The deal with the trader (Gunvor) was almost finalised but it got delayed,” the senior official said. “Now the big FSRU came online and we doubt this (the Gunvor deal) will happen.” Additional reporting by Julia Payne

2018-09-20,"* Southern exports in first 19 days of Sept avg 3.6 mbpd - tracker * Protests in Basra not affecting oil shipments - source * OPEC, non-OPEC to discuss dividing output boost this weekend By Alex Lawler LONDON, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Oil exports from southern Iraq are heading for a record high this month, two industry sources said, adding to signs that OPEC’s second-largest producer is following through on a deal to raise supply and local unrest is not affecting shipments. Southern Iraqi exports in the first 19 days of September averaged 3.6 million barrels per day, according to ship-tracking data compiled by an industry source, up 20,000 bpd from August’s 3.58 million bpd - the existing monthly record. The increase follows June’s pact among OPEC and allied producers to boost supply after they had curbed output since 2017 to remove a glut. Iraq in August provided OPEC’s second-largest increase as shipments drop from Iran, which is facing renewed U.S. sanctions. A second industry source who tracks shipments also said exports this month had averaged 3.6 million bpd, reflecting smooth operations at export terminals and no sign that unrest in Basra, Iraq’s second city, was disrupting flows. “There were fears that the protests would get to the terminal,” this source said. “But so far, there is no impact.” Protests in Basra against Iraq’s political elite erupted in July. In early September, Basra airport was attacked with rockets a6nd protesters briefly took oilfield workers hostage. Before the June OPEC deal, Iraq had been boosting exports from southern terminals to offset a halt in shipments from the northern Kirkuk region last October after Iraqi forces seized control of oilfields there from Kurdish fighters. Northern exports have held steady in September, averaging around 400,000 bpd so far, according to shipping data and one of the industry sources. This is up from about 300,000 bpd in July but short of levels above 500,000 bpd in some months of 2017. On June 22-23, OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed to return to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017. That amounted to an increase of about 1 million bpd, according to OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia. A group of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers and officials monitoring the agreement are meeting on Sunday in Algeria and will discuss proposals on how to divide the increase, sources have told Reuters. Iraq has said it is ready to boost output and in August pumped an extra 90,000 bpd, OPEC’s second-largest increase after Libya, according to analyst and oil-industry media estimates compiled by OPEC. Iraq itself said production in August was steady.

2018-09-20,"* Confusion over plans after trade min says need to convert FX * Proposed rules would disrupt firms’ cashflows - exporters * Rupiah trading close to its weakest in 20 years (Adds quotes, context) By Maikel Jefriando and Bernadette Christina Munthe JAKARTA, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s finance minister said the government aims to “persuade” exporters to keep earnings onshore and convert them into rupiah, rather than make this mandatory, amid confusion over a plan floated this week to support the ailing currency. On Tuesday, Trade Minister Enggartiasto Lukita had said authorities would make it mandatory for exporters of commodities such as palm oil, coal, oil and natural gas to keep half of their proceeds onshore for at least six months and convert them to rupiah. Asked about Lukita’s remarks, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati told reporters on Thursday: “I am hoping earnings can be saved onshore and converted to rupiah.” She said authorities had talked to some companies holding dollars to “persuade” them to convert to rupiah, including mining companies who she said paid contractors with dollars. The Trade Ministry this week also revised a regulation on natural resource shipments, requiring exports to use letters of credit issued by banks in Indonesia and tightening rules on implementation. The moves are the latest in a string of measures by President Joko Widodo’s government to support the rupiah, which has been hit with portfolio outflows and rising imports, and is near its weakest in 20 years. Other measures announced in recent weeks include increasing Indonesia’s coal output by 100 million tonnes, import tariffs, delays to an estimated $24 billion in energy projects and enforcing biodiesel use. Exporter industry groups say the measures will hurt their business, and criticise the plans lack of clarity. Indonesia is the world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal and palm oil, with shipments last year worth around $39 billion combined , and a major global supplier of crude oil, natural gas, minerals, coffee and cocoa. Pandu Sjahrir, Indonesian Coal Mining Association (ICMA) chairman, said discussions had been held with the finance ministry over the export earnings proposals. He urged the government to provide incentives “rather than banning things” to support the rupiah. “Everybody is being reactive to it, trying to work out how to proceed,” he said. Ido Hutabarat, chairman of the Indonesia Mining Association (IMA), said retaining and converting export revenue would put pressure on cashflows of exporters, especially those repaying offshore debt and buying imported equipment that’s mostly paid for in dollars. Togar Sitanggang, deputy chairman of the Indonesia Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), said the moves could lead some producers to reduce exports and sell as much as they can domestically to avoid having to deposit 50 percent of their revenue. Faced with a rupiah that has lost around 9 percent of its value against the dollar this year, President Widodo has repeatedly urged exporters to exchange dollar earnings. Some analysts point to tougher rules in Malaysia and Thailand, though also question whether copying them could breach Indonesia’s free foreign exchange regime. Malaysia has, since 2016, required exporters to convert 75 percent of their earnings to ringgit, while Thai exporters must keep export proceeds above a certain amount in authorized banks for 360 days. Bank Mandiri chief economist Anton Gunawan said the government and central bank could provide incentives to encourage rupiah conversion, such as cutting tax rates on foreign currency term deposits for exporters.

2018-09-20,"NEW DELHI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - India will settle payments for Iranian oil using rupees through local banks starting in November as U.S. sanctions will make it difficult to settle trades through European banks, two industry sources said on Thursday. In May, U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and ordered the renewal of U.S. sanctions. Some sanctions took effect from Aug. 6 while those affecting the oil and banking sectors will start from Nov. 4. “We are bracing up for any eventuality we have to make a payment and we don’t want to default on making payments,” one of the sources said. The sources said India has selected UCO Bank and IDBI Bank for facilitating payment to Iran. Indian refiners are currently using State Bank of India and Germany-based Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG to buy Iranian oil in euros. SBI has told refiners it would stop handling Iran payments from November. The second source said after the United States announced it would re-impose sanctions in May, Iran has already received payments for some cargoes in rupees. Reuters in June reported that India is looking to revive the its earlier rupee payment mechanism with Iran. During the previous sanctions regime, India adopted a barter-like scheme to buy oil from Iran while the Middle Eastern country used rupees to import goods from India. “Previously we settled 45 percent of our trade in rupees this time it could be 100 percent. We have to mutually decide the number,” said the first source. India, Iran’s top oil client after China, is still seeking some exemptions to the sanctions from the U.S. though some refiners have already curtailed purchases because of insurance issues tied to the sanctions. IDBI did not respond to requests for a comment while UCO Bank’s Managing Director R. K. Takkar did not respond to phone calls seeking comment.

2018-09-20,"(Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto will return $3.2 billion to shareholders from its sale of Australian coal assets this year in addition to existing buyback programs, it said on Thursday. The news helped to drive Rio Tinto’s London share price (RIO.L) nearly 2 percent higher by 0927 GMT and pushed up the Australian listing (RIO.AX) by 3.5 percent. Across the mining sector, a trend to hand money back to shareholders has gathered steam following a recovery from the mining and commodity crash of 2015-16 and pressure from investors not to waste growing piles of cash on buying up assets that may never deliver returns. In its latest move, Rio Tinto, which has already returned more money to shareholders than its peers, said it will conduct an off-market share buyback for up to 41.2 million shares in its Australian entity Rio Tinto Ltd, worth about $1.9 billion, and further on-market purchases of London’s Rio Tinto plc shares, bringing the total to $3.2 billion. Previous buybacks have favored the London arm of the dual-structured company but industry sources said it balanced out over time. Rio Tinto had already announced plans in August for a $4 billion buyback. “Returning $3.2 billion of coal disposal proceeds demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline and providing sector-leading shareholder returns,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement on Thursday. The funds come from the proceeds of Rio Tinto’s exit from coal.  Early this year, it sold the Hail Creek coal mine and Valeria coal project to Glencore (GLEN.L), Winchester South to Whitehaven Coal (WHC.AX) and the Kestrel coal mine to private equity manager EMR Capital and Indonesia’s Adaro Energy Tbk (ADRO.JK). In total, the assets raised $4.15 billion.  Jason Teh, chief investment officer of Sydney-based Vertium Asset Management, said the buyback would be taken favorably by the market, adding that there could be more to come. “Because their balance sheet is in such a pristine state, every time they do an asset sale they are normally just returning proceeds back to shareholders,” he said. Jacques said the focus would remain on managing the company’s portfolio to get rid of assets that did not provide the best returns over time. Rio Tinto has agreed to sell copper assets in Indonesia to Freeport-McMoRan Inc (FCX.N) as part of a series of complex deals. It is unclear when that sale will be completed. Norsk Hydro (NHY.OL) and Rio announced last week they had dropped a plan for Hydro to buy Rio Tinto assets, including an aluminum plant in Iceland, after approval from European regulators took longer than expected. Rio’s sale of its Dunkirk aluminum smelter in northern France announced in January has also yet to be finalised. BMO Capital Markets said in a note Rio’s buybacks amounted to a shareholder return well ahead of its peers and the company was its “top pick” among the diversified majors, but would eventually have to find other options to drive value, including possible acquisitions. Big miners have been struggling to find good assets to buy and even Glencore (GLEN.L), renowned for adventurous merger and acquisition activity, has said it will focus on buybacks.

2018-09-20,"CONWAY, S.C. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned South Carolina on Wednesday “water is coming your way” in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, as the death toll from the massive storm rose to at least 36 after two women were swept away in a sheriff’s van. Trump made his comments after visiting an emergency operations centre in Conway, South Carolina, and speaking to residents who were preparing to evacuate as rivers rose.  “Over the next couple of days, it’s going to get rough in South Carolina ... Whatever you need from Washington, we are there,” Trump told state and local officials at a briefing. “Now it looks nice, but it’s really the calm before the storm,” Trump said, referring to water draining into rivers and waterways after Florence’s epic deluge over the weekend. The storm made landfall on Friday as a Category 1 hurricane. The slow-moving storm has since been downgraded to a tropical depression and moved into the U.S. northeast. The deaths of at least 36 people have been attributed to the storm, including 27 in North Carolina, eight in South Carolina and one in Virginia.  The latest victims were two women in South Carolina who drowned on Tuesday when a sheriff’s department van in which they were riding was swept away by floodwaters. Some 2,600 people had been rescued by boat or helicopter in North Carolina alone since the storm hit land, according to the state department of public safety. Some 10,000 people remained in shelters and over 160,000 customers were without power across North Carolina as darkness fell on Wednesday, the department said. Although the storm has moved on, river flooding still poses a danger.  The Cape Fear River crested at 61.5 feet (19 meters), four times its normal height, on Wednesday in Fayetteville, North Carolina, according to the National Weather Service. The city of 200,000 is near the Fort Bragg Army base in the southern part of the state. Floodwaters have disrupted efforts to restore power, clear roads and allow evacuated residents to go home.  Wilmington, just down the coast, remained almost completely cut off by flooding from the Cape Fear River and earlier storm surges. At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others due to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, according to forecasts. “People in flood prone areas or near waterways need to remain alert as rivers crest and stay above their banks in coming days,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said in a written statement. “Stay alert, and stay safe.” Many areas remained cut off by floodwaters and inundated roads. The storm dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina.  Environmental damage was also mounting as human and animal waste was swept up in roiling floodwaters. Floodwaters have caused 21 hog “lagoons,” which store manure from pig farms, to overflow, creating a risk of standing water being contaminated with bacteria like salmonella, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Quality. North Carolina is one of the leading hog-producing states in the country.  Experts have said that climate change has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and touching off catastrophic flooding. Trump, who has been criticized for the federal government’s  handling of Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, told officials at a briefing before going to the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock, North Carolina, “We’re going to be there 100 percent.” He visited a church in New Bern, a town of 30,000 people at the confluence of the Neuse and Trent rivers that was hit especially hard by flooding, and joined volunteers in passing out boxed meals to people in a drive-through line.  He walked through a neighbourhood lined with discarded wet furniture, hugging residents and posing for pictures.

2018-09-20,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total has expanded its footprint in the French electricity market with the completion of its takeover of alternative power supplier Direct Energie, and the acquisition of an electric vehicle charging solutions provider. The oil and gas major said in separate statements on Thursday that it had finalised its $1.7 billion deal to buy Direct Energie, holding 95.37 percent of the share capital and at least 95.33 percent of the voting rights of this company. Direct Energie’s takeover will enable Total to grab a sizeable share of the French retail electricity market and challenge state-controlled utility EDF.  Total also announced the acquisition of G2mobility, which provides electric vehicle charging solutions. It did not disclose the amount for that transaction. The takeovers form part of Total’s strategy to expand in the French power market. Those plans include moves for Total to  produce its own power, distributing it to clients, and developing its low carbon businesses.  It aims to grow its low-carbon energy assets to 20 percent of total assets by 2035 from 5 percent today.    “With a market share of more than 25 percent of charging points for local governments and growth in revenues of over 50 percent last year, G2mobility brings us a new competency to provide more efficient electric charging systems for our B2B and B2C customers,” said Momar Nguer, Total’s head of marketing and services, in a statement. As part of the G2mobility deal, Total also signed a partnership agreement with cable company Nexans, to help develop infrastructure for electric vehicles in France.

An MSCI index tracking shares in 47 countries rose 0.2 percent, supported by gains in Europe and Asia, but Chinese equities dipped after a rally on bets of government stimulus to limit the economic damage of new trade barriers. The pan-European STOXX benchmark rose 0.3 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei ended little changed, barely moving after a well-anticipated win by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in a ruling party leadership vote. Markets were also watching a European Union summit where Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to fellow EU leaders on Wednesday to drop Brexit demands that she said could rip Britain apart. After a knee-jerk negative reaction to the new tariffs announced by Washington and Beijing on Tuesday, markets have been speculating that an immediate escalation could be averted. U.S. President Donald Trump has not made fresh threats that he would seek to extend tariffs to all Chinese imports. “Making forecasts on Trump is always a risk but it’s a fact that at the moment the escalation has taken a break,” said Anthilia Capital fund manager and strategist Giuseppe Sersale. For his part, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said this week he would not would not weaken the yuan to boost exports. Broader market sentiment was at odds with a new Reuters poll that showed unanimous agreement that an escalating trade war with China was bad economic policy for the United States and could cause economic growth to slow. Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, said he saw more reasons to take a “glass-is-half-full” approach, given the recent emerging market selloff. The consensus of the poll for U.S. growth showed a slowdown to 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 2019, less than half the last reported rate of 4.2 percent. Meanwhile, S&P 500 E-mini futures were little changed following strong gains on Wall Street on Wednesday. The rally in global stocks has been accompanied a drop in demand for safe-haven assets, boosting U.S. bonds yields and sending the dollar to seven-week lows. The Japanese yen has also been under pressure. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which on Wednesday touched its highest level since May 18, eased back to 3.0682 percent on Thursday. This move comes ahead of what is expected to be a hawkish meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. All 113 economists in the Reuters poll forecast the Fed would hike rates when it meets Sept. 25-26. It is expected to follow that up with one more before the end of this year, taking the fed funds rate to 2.25-2.50 percent. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals, dipped 0.18 percent at 94.371. The dollar was 0.04 percent lower against the yen at 112.25 , while the euro was 0.26 percent stronger against the greenback at $1.1700. The pound rose 0.3 percent to $1.3188 versus the dollar, helped by growing confidence that a Brexit trade deal can be clinched in the coming months. On Thursday Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Britain was over 85 percent of the way to agreeing a deal with the European Union on its exit from the bloc. The Norwegian crown slumped versus the euro after the country’s central bank raised interest rates for the first time in seven years, as expected, but trimmed its policy rate forecasts. The crown fell 0.9 percent versus the euro to 9.5990 EURNOK=D3. In commodities, news of another drawdown in U.S. crude inventories and signs that OPEC may not raise output enough to compensate for the loss of Iranian exports hit by sanctions, lifted benchmark Brent crude 0.11 percent at $79.49. Base metals rose, buoyed by relief over trade and a shortage of the metal in top consumer China, with London Metal Exchange zinc hitting its fortnight before paring some gains and trade up 0.50 percent at $2,446 a tonne.

2018-09-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China hopes the United States will show sincerity and take steps to correct its behavior, its commerce ministry said on Thursday, after both countries slapped new tariffs on each other’s goods this week in an escalating trade war.  China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list on Tuesday to hit back at U.S. duties on $200 billion of Chinese goods that go into effect from Sept. 24. Some analysts and American businesses are now concerned China could resort to other means of retaliation such as pressuring U.S. companies operating in China.  Alibaba’s billionaire co-founder Jack Ma, a known advocate for globalization, this week expressed his growing pessimism over the dispute, saying it would be a “mess” for all parties involved.  U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened further retaliation if Beijing takes aim at U.S. agricultural or industrial workers as he accused China of trying to sway U.S. elections by targeting farmers. “China has been forced to take retaliatory measures, and they are entirely meant to protect China’s own interests,” commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said at a weekly news briefing in Beijing.   “They are also meant to protect global free trade order, and have nothing to do with domestic politics in the United States.” He did not directly reply to questions asking if there will be a fresh round of trade talks between Beijing and Washington, which had appeared to be in the works prior to the latest tit-for-tat tariffs.     The deepening rift between China and the United States has stoked concerns about job losses on both sides of the Pacific as tariffs threaten to erode trade flows and economic growth.  “The current economic situation is indeed not good, and that could go on longer than people think,” said Jack Ma, the billionaire co-founder of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (BABA.N).  “On China-U.S. frictions, people should make preparations for the next 20 years,” Ma reiterated at the World Economic Forum in the northern Chinese port city of Tianjin.  Ma met Trump two years ago and laid out Alibaba’s plan to bring small U.S. businesses onto its platform to sell to Chinese consumers. The Chinese billionaire also promised to create 1 million jobs in the United States. Alibaba can no longer meet that promise, Ma told Chinese news agency Xinhua on Wednesday.  “The current situation has already destroyed the original premise. There is no way to deliver the promise,” he said.  Chinese firms with factories in the United States would also face higher costs as they ship U.S.-assembled products back home.  Chinese white goods firm Haier Group, which acquired General Electric’s home appliances businesses two years ago, has halted plans to sell products made in the United States by the GE Appliances brand in China, Financial Times cited the group’s chief executive Zhang Ruimin as saying.

2018-09-20,"NEW DELHI, Sept 20 (Reuters) - India’s Chennai Petroleum will stop processing Iranian crude oil from October to keep its insurance coverage once new sanctions by the United States against Iran go into effect, three sources familiar with the issue said. Iran’s Naftiran Intertrade Co Ltd, a trading arm for state-owned National Iranian Oil Co, owns a 15.4 percent stake in Chennai Petroleum, which has two refineries with a total combined capacity of 230,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). In May, U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran and announced new sanctions against the country, the third-largest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Washington is pushing allies to cut Iranian oil imports to zero once the sanctions on the petroleum sector start up on Nov. 4. United India Insurance has informed Chennai Petroleum that its new annual policy that is set to take effect from October will not cover any liability related to processing crude from Iran, the three sources said. This has forced the refiner to cancel a scheduled loading of 1 million barrels in October, they said. Indian insurers do not fall directly under the sanctions, but need to hedge their own risk on the Western reinsurance market, which will not accept Iranian exposure. “It is quite complicated.. reinsurers are quite apprehensive about extending cover for Chennai Petroleum,” said one of the sources, who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. Chennai Petroleum’s reduced demand will further cut India’s imports from Iran to about 10 million tonnes in October, lower than previous estimates reported by Reuters. . “Reinsurers have said they can not provide full 100 percent cover. They have agreed to provide support for only 85 percent cover,” said a second source, who also declined to be identified. Chennai Petroleum, a subsidiary of the country’s biggest refiner Indian Oil Corp (IOC), has a deal to buy up to 2 million tonnes, or 40,000 bpd, of oil from Iran in the fiscal year 2018/19. IOC imports oil on behalf of Chennai Petroleum. Chennai Petroleum and United India Insurance did not respond to requests for comment. With Chennai’s absence, Iran is left with just two Indian clients, Managalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, and IOC. State-owned refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp has already halted purchases due to insurance problems, while Bharat Petroleum Corp boosted Iranian purchases earlier this year and expects to sharply cut Iranian flows once the sanctions take effect. Nayara Energy is also preparing to halt Iranian imports from November, while Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd have already stopped buying Iranian oil.

2018-09-20,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) By Henning Gloystein BARCELONA, Spain, Sept 20 (Reuters) - The global gas industry, boosted by a host of new projects to feed booming demand, is in better shape than at any point in the last five years but analysts warn it is getting ahead of itself, pointing to the rise of renewable energy as a threat. Commodity merchant Vitol expects trade in liquefied natural gas (LNG) to double to 600 million tonnes annually (mtpa) in the coming years, reflecting forecasts by Russian LNG producer Novatek which sees 700 mtpa by 2030. To meet that demand, companies are working on final investment decisions for a new wave of mega projects. “The industry is confident,” said Christian Brown, president for the oil and gas sector at Canadian-listed SNC Lavalin , an industrial project management company. “So far this year, we have bid almost twice as much as last year (for available gas projects),” he said. SNC Lavalin made about 36 percent of its $9.3 billion revenues from the oil and gas sector last year. Brown said the industry was in its best shape since 2014, when a slump in oil and gas LNG-AS prices led to aggressive cost cutting and scrapping of projects. He said most growth was coming from U.S. unconventional oil and gas. “They are fast and furious. Decisions are made quickly,” he told Reuters during the Gastech trade show in Barcelona. Still, not everybody is buying into the industry’s confidence, warning the fast rise of cheap renewable power generation, backed up by improving battery technology, would increasingly take market share away from the gas industry. “The oil and gas industry are undergoing major disruption from electrification and renewables,” said Bernadette Cullinane, of Deloitte Consulting. “LNG producers must lower costs to compete with solar plus storage,” she said, warning that projects vying for investment, but unable to reduce costs enough to compete with renewables, were likely fail. Following a sharp price falls in panel costs and improvement in efficiency, global solar power capacity has soared from just 15 gigawatt (GW) a decade ago to around 400 GW now, data from the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) showed. Most forecasts expect capacity to double again by the mid-2020s. “We are an industry in flux. There are public policies in place around the world and technology developments that fundamentally challenge the gas industry outlook,” said Deepa Poduval, senior managing director for oil and gas at U.S. engineering, procurement and construction firm Black & Veatch. The gas industry is growing by just 1 to 2 percent annually, said Dumitru Dediu, who leads the global gas and LNG group at consultancy McKinsey & Company. Judging by sales of large gas turbines, growth may slow further, with orders down from the equivalent of 70 GW sold at the start of the decade, to less than 30 GW this year, according to GE, one of the major turbine makers. Siemens, another leading turbine maker, said growth of renewables was the main reason for a 56 percent fall in profits from its power and gas division in the third quarter. “Given how fast this disruption is occurring, we believe the oil and gas industry must act now,” Deloitte’s Cullinane said.

2018-09-20,"SINGAPORE, Sept 20 (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Ltd will load its last Enfield crude oil cargo in November as the Australian field reaches the end of production, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. “The Nganhurra FPSO (floating, production, storage and offloading) will load its last Enfield cargo in mid-November,” she said in a statement sent by email. Woodside’s 60 percent share of Enfield production fell to 193,821 barrels in the second quarter of this year, down from 508,857 barrels during the same period in 2013. Mitsui E&P Australia holds the remaining 40 percent stake in the field. The FPSO in the Enfield oilfield is located about 52 kilometres (32 miles) northwest of Exmouth in western Australia and has been producing oil since 2006. Traders said they did not expect a big impact from the move as the crude grade does not feed into any particular refinery. “The volume isn’t very big as well ... I am not sure which other grade is a direct replacement, but West African grades can be an easy alternative,” said a Singapore-based trader, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. Production from the nearby Vincent oilfield through the Ngujima-Yin FPSO was suspended in May as the FPSO was sent to Singapore for modifications. That FPSO is being refitted as part of Woodside and Mitsui’s $1.9 billion Greater Enfield project that will start producing from three fields near Vincent by the middle of 2019. Overall, production from the Greater Enfield project is expected to initially add an incremental 40,000 bpd of oil to Vincent oil production through the Ngujima-Yin FPSO. The project is on schedule to produce its first oil in mid-2019, the spokeswoman said.

2018-09-20,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese oil refiners have temporarily halted Iranian oil loadings ahead of U.S. sanctions and are buying alternatives as it remains unclear whether Japan will receive an exemption, the head of the country’s refinery association said on Thursday. The United States has demanded that nations cut all their Iranian oil imports when sanctions on the country’s petroleum sector over Tehran’s nuclear program are re-imposed on Nov. 4. “It is my view that each firm is taking the same stance and temporarily suspending (the loading) and watching the situation carefully,” Takashi Tsukioka, the President of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ), said when asked if Japanese refiners plan to halt Iranian loadings from October.  Tsukioka, who also serves as chairman of refiner Idemitsu Kosan, however, did not comment on the details of each refiner’s reaction. Many refiners in Japan, the world’s fourth-biggest oil consumer, say they are resigned to completely halting imports from one of their historically important suppliers, unlike during a previous round of sanctions when they only reduced imports from Iran. Iran is an important supplier of oil to Japan, accounting for about 5 percent of its crude imports, and Japanese refiners, together with the government, will try to maintain its good relationship with the Middle Eastern country, said Tsukioka, adding that the U.S. sanctions will not cause a major impact.  Tsukioka said in July that Japanese oil refiners would likely stop loading Iranian crude oil from mid-September, with final shipments to arrive in the first half of October.

2018-09-20,"AMSTERDAM, Sept 20 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Magdalena was clearing out her home in Amsterdam, she took her old clothes and other household waste to a recycling hub, knowing it would be worth her while. The Zero Waste Lab in the east of the Dutch city gave her discount tokens for local shops and market stalls in exchange for two bags of fabric, paper and plastic. “It’s great. You are rewarded for saving the planet,” said Magdalena, who did not want to give her full name. Zero Waste Lab is one of several new initiatives in Dutch cities aiming to highlight the scourge of urban waste by turning trash into something useful or artistic. Magdalena’s jeans were sent to Firma Koos, a local social enterprise that hires people struggling to find work and upcycles denim to make cushions and bags. Her electronic cables, fabric and plastic bottles were destined for children’s arts and crafts workshops. “We need to reward people, and we need the rewards to come back into the local community,” lab manager Bonnie Joosten told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Since it started in 2016, 30 local businesses and 1,100 households have joined the project. Tom Leeflang, who owns a pancake stall nearby, said the scheme works well because it is not compulsory. “If it’s voluntary, people are much more likely to participate,” he said. The Netherlands’ two largest cities have both pledged to become circular economies, reusing waste as new materials to extract maximum value - Amsterdam by 2050 and Rotterdam by 2030. The first step is to improve the cities’ recycling rates, which are far lower than in the rest of the country. The average person in the Netherlands produces 550 kg (1,213 lb) of waste each year, according to Zero Waste Lab. Just over half of that is recycled. In Amsterdam, where most residents live in apartments with no outdoor space, only 27 percent of waste is recycled, Joosten said. The municipality hopes to boost that percentage to 65 percent by 2020. Besides helping raise recycling rates, Joosten and her team at Zero Waste Lab hope to improve social cohesion in the area. The goal is for the lab to serve as a “community living room” where people can get to know their neighbours and find out about local projects. “We don’t only create value for waste, we also create value for people,” said Joosten. The lab sends some of the waste it collects to libraries that recently started running workshops for children called “maker spaces”. The creative sessions aim to show “you can create something beautiful from rubbish”, said project manager Rob van der Burg. The children are taught how to make bags and clothing from old textiles, and to build robots using electronic waste. “We want to give them the tools they need in the 21st century, to consciously reuse the materials they have, and to invent creative solutions for environmental issues,” van der Burg added. In Rotterdam, a floating park opened this summer, built entirely from plastic waste found in the Nieuwe Maas River. “Recycled Park” is a green oasis teeming with small water birds, fish and algae. It is made up of more than a dozen hexagonal pods, where people can sit and watch ships on their way to the port. Frustrated by the “plastic soup” floating in the river, architect Ramon Knoester started organising clean-ups two years ago. Since then, volunteers have used large litter traps to retrieve around 10,000 kg of plastic from the water. Knoester had not realised the scale of the problem until he saw the contents of the traps, which included large containers, construction helmets and many footballs. Every year, 80,000 to 100,000 kg of plastic waste dumped in the Nieuwe Maas floats out to the North Sea, Knoester said. The architect convinced Rotterdam municipality to use the waste to make a floating park in its centre, as his vision fitted with the city’s ambition to become a circular economy. “Waste is worth gold, we say in Rotterdam,” said a spokeswoman for the municipality. “As a city we are working together to move from ‘trash towards beauty’. We are aiming to turn the city centre and port into a circular hotspot.” With 200,000 euros ($233,980) from the municipality and investors, Knoester launched the park in June. The architect said the public reaction had been positive, and he plans to expand the 140 square-metre park, as well as create an educational programme to teach younger people to “think about products we can make from this waste material”. Knoester hopes his work with the park will inspire others to incorporate waste products into buildings and public facilities. “If we treat and collect our waste well, then we can make beautiful projects like this,” he said. $1 = 0.8548 euros

After a knee-jerk reaction to new tit-for-tat tariffs announced by Washington and Beijing on Tuesday, markets now appear to be taking a somewhat longer view, reckoning the fallout will take some time to show up in corporate earnings and not produce a sharp global shock. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index ended flat. Shares in China and Hong Kong dipped. In Europe, spreadbetters expected London’s FTSE to open 0.1 percent higher at 7,338, Frankfurt’s DAX to open 0.07 percent higher at 12,227 and Paris’ CAC to open 0.07 percent higher at 5,398. Markets were closely watching a European Union summit where Prime Minister Theresa May appealed to fellow EU leaders on Wednesday to drop “unacceptable” Brexit demands that she said could rip Britain apart. Rob Carnell, chief economist and head of research, Asia-Pacific at ING, said he saw more reasons to take a “glass-is-half-full” approach given the recent selloff in emerging markets. “It’s not my natural state of being at all, but I’m always looking for the bad in things, and there’s plenty out there, and the markets don’t really seem to be responding all that much,” Carnell said. U.S. shares had been boosted on Wednesday by expectations that the impact of the Sino-U.S. trade war would be smaller than feared, with U.S. tax and other fiscal policy measures potentially outweighing any negative impact. On Thursday, S&P 500 E-mini futures were slightly lower at 2,909.5. The broader market sentiment was at odds with a new Reuters poll that showed unanimous agreement that an escalating trade war with China was bad economic policy for the United States and could cause economic growth to slow. The consensus of the poll for U.S. growth showed a slowdown to 2.0 percent in the final quarter of 2019, less than half the last reported rate of 4.2 percent. Analysts at Citi also cautioned in a note Thursday that U.S. housing data out this week showed signs of weakness despite a headline jump. Citi said housing starts had been strong, but building permits - a indicator of future activity - were at their lowest since May 2017. “The housing market remains a specific point of weakness in the U.S. economy and while not in focus, it could be important... housing data on Tuesday wasn’t encouraging on net.” The rally in global stocks has been accompanied by falls in U.S. bonds and the Japanese yen. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes, which on Wednesday touched its highest level since May 18, was at 3.0626 percent Thursday, compared with its U.S. close of 3.083 percent. This week’s rise in yields comes ahead of what is expected to be a hawkish meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve next week. All 113 economists in the Reuters poll forecast the Fed to hike rates when it meets Sept 25-26. It is expected to follow that up with one more before the end of this year, taking the fed funds rate to 2.25-2.50 percent. The two-year yield, which is sensitive to market expectations of Fed rate hikes, was at 2.7951 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.807 percent Wednesday. The dollar was 0.1 percent lower against the yen at 112.13 . The euro was 0.1 percent stronger against the greenback at $1.1683. The dollar index, which tracks the dollar against a basket of six major rivals, was down less than 0.1 percent at 94.478. U.S. crude added 0.9 percent to $71.77 a barrel, on top of a jump Wednesday that came after new data showed U.S. crude inventories fell 2.1 million barrels last week, its fifth weekly drawdown, to 394.1 million barrels. That was the lowest level since February 2015. Brent crude was 0.4 percent higher at $79.73 per barrel. The weakening dollar pushed gold higher. Spot gold was trading up 0.1 percent at $1,204.97 per ounce. Reporting by Andrew Galbraith; Additional reporting by Herbert

2018-09-20,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to reduce the average tariff rate on imports from most of its trading partners as soon as October, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday.  In July, China cut import tariffs on almost 1,500 consumer products ranging from cosmetics to home appliances as part of efforts to open up its economy, the world’s second biggest.  The move was in line with Beijing’s pledge to its trading partners - including the United States - that it would take measures to further increase imports. The Bloomberg report did not specify the countries that could enjoy lower Chinese tariffs.  At the World Economic Forum in the northern port city of Tianjin, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Wednesday that the government will continue to lower import tariffs on some goods. He did not elaborate.  The promise to further lower import tariffs came as China and the United Stated remained locked in a bitter trade dispute that has roiled financial markets and cast uncertainty over global supply chains.  On Tuesday, China added $60 billion of U.S. products to its import tariff list in retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods.  The trade war has started to hit Chinese cities and provinces, especially those that depend on U.S. order books.  While the direct economic impact of the dispute on China has so far been limited, the trade tensions could rapidly push Chinese exporters to switch away from the U.S. market, a former chief of China’s central bank said on Wednesday.

2018-09-20,"(Repeats Wednesday’s story with no changes to text) * Surgutneftegaz is Russia’s fourth biggest oil firm by output * Wants buyers to agree to use euros if necessary-traders * Some traders link push to threat of more U.S. sanctions * Company relies on short-term contracts and so more vulnerable By Gleb Gorodyankin and Olga Yagova MOSCOW, Sept 19 (Reuters) - Russian oil producer Surgutneftegaz is pushing buyers to agree to pay for oil in euros instead of dollars if the need arises, apparently as insurance against possible tougher U.S. sanctions, traders who deal with the firm told Reuters. Russia has been subject to Western sanctions since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, but Washington has threatened to impose extra sanctions, citing what it has called Moscow’s “malign” activities abroad. The prospect that causes most alarm for Russian firms is inclusion on a Treasury Department blacklist that effectively cuts them off from conducting transactions in dollars, the lifeblood of the global oil industry. Surgutneftegaz, whose chief executive Vladimir Bogdanov is already on a U.S. blacklist in a personal capacity, declined to respond to Reuters questions. “We do not comment on our commercial activity,” said the company, Russia’s fourth largest by output. To date, Russia’s oil industry has been able to weather Western sanctions. In response to restricted access to Western finance and technology, firms have switched to borrowing from Russian state banks and developed their own technology. Most Russian oil majors, including Rosneft and Lukoil, also sell the lion’s share of output via long-term contracts with clients, giving them more time to work out alternative forms of payment when the contracts expire. But most of Surgutneftegaz’s exports — around 2 million tonnes per month — is sold through monthly tenders on the spot market, the largest volumes by far among its Russian peers. So it would have only around 30 days to find alternative payment methods. Six traders who regularly deal with Surgutneftegaz said the company had been asking buyers to agree to an addendum to their contracts stating that they accept the option of settling payments in euros. According to a message sent by Surgutneftegaz to one of its customers asking them to sign the addendum, the oil company cited the need to “avoid any possible problems with payment in USD.” Reuters has seen a copy of the message. Three of the traders said Surgutneftegaz had already begun discussions with its partners last summer about the possibility of settling payments in euros. But the company was now raising the issue with greater urgency, and had in some cases warned it would reject bids from buyers for cargoes of oil unless the buyers signed the addendum, according to four of the traders. In its message to customers, Surgutneftegaz did not mention the risk of new sanctions, but two traders said from their interactions with the company it was clear to them that this was the reason behind the change. “Surgut is afraid of sanctions,” a source in a European oil major which has dealings with Surgutneftegaz told Reuters, on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media. The U.S. government cannot forbid anyone from using dollars, but it can prevent U.S. banks from doing business with a sanctioned entity. Most dollar-denominated transactions pass through the U.S. banking system, and those banks, to avoid violating sanctions, can refuse to handle money linked to blacklisted companies or individuals. It is not clear how widely the Russian oil sector is preparing for the possibility of tougher sanctions. A source at Gazpromneft, Russia’s third-biggest oil company by output, said most of its contracts already contained a clause on possible payments in non-dollar currencies. A second source at the company said that when it is drafting supply contracts with customers for 2019, it will make sure they include a non-dollar payment option in all cases. Gazpromneft was not immediately avilable to comment. Several other oil firms also already have clauses in their contracts allowing non-dollar payments under some circumstances, said four industry sources. Washington’s decision in April to include on its sanctions blacklist Russian firm Rusal, one of the world’s biggest aluminium producers, signalled to Russian business that Washington was ratcheting up the pressure. It was the first time a major Russian company with international partners had been blacklisted. Some elements of the sanctions have been temporarily watered down, but Rusal’s inclusion has disrupted its access to raw materials, led to the cancellation of some orders and prompted some foreign partners to sever ties. Washington has not spelled out when or how it plans to toughen sanctions further, but it has signalled that they are coming this year, partly in response to the poisoning in Britain of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Britain and its Western allies say Russian intelligence agents carried out the poisoning using a military-grade nerve agent, an allegation Moscow has denied. State Department official Manisha Singh said this month there would be a “very severe second round of sanctions” unless Russia meets a November deadline to comply with international chemical weapons law. The source in the European oil major said Surgutneftegaz, in its push to arrange the option of payments in euros, was focussed on what might happen in November. There is no indication from Washington if Surgutneftegaz would be a target for the next round of sanctions. But CEO Bogdanov was included on the Treasury Department list, published in January, of Russian oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more. In April, the Treasury Department added Bogdanov to its “Specially Designated National” list, freezing any U.S. assets he owns and barring him from travel to the United States. It said he was being blacklisted “for operating in the energy sector of the Russian Federation economy.” (Reporting by Gleb Gorodyankin and Olga Yagova; writing by Vladimir Soldatkin; Editing by Mike Collett-White)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-surgut-sanctions/rpt-exclusive-russian-oil-firm-seeks-dollar-alternative-amid-us-sanctions-threat-traders-idUKL8N1W55BK,20 Sep 2018,"* Surgutneftegaz is Russia's fourth biggest oil firm by
