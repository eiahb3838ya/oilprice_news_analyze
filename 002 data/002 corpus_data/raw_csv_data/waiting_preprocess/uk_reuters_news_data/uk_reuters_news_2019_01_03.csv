2019-01-03,"(Rewrites to include comments from energy minister and Petrobras CEO, changes media tag to conform with news planning advisory) By Marta Nogueira and Rodrigo Viga Gaier RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian officials on Thursday predicted a quick resolution to a dispute with Petroleo Brasileiro SA over offshore oil blocks and doubled down on pledges to steer the state-run firm toward its core businesses like oil exploration. At the swearing-in ceremony for new Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, incoming Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said Petrobras, as the company is known, and the state, expect to resolve a dispute over the oil-producing zone known as the ‘transfer-of-rights’ area within 100 days. The long-running dispute over the zone’s oil, and its price, dates back years to when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. While parts of the government and the state-controlled company have each claimed to be owed billions of dollars based on disputed readings of a contract covering the area, the Ministry of Mines and Energy has now agreed that Brazil will pay Petrobras to settle the matter. Albuquerque’s comments were the strongest signal yet that the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office on Jan. 1, is serious about resolving the long-running disagreement, which could result in a windfall for Petrobras worth tens of billions of dollars if settled. “Petrobras will be the creditor,” Albuquerque told journalists. “What we are discussing is the amount and form of the payment.” At the ceremony, new Petrobras CEO Castello Branco, a liberal economist and former board member at iron ore miner Vale SA, emphasized the need for the company to focus on oil exploration and production, and begin divestments in the refining and natural gas sectors. The firm’s current domination of the natural gas production and supply chain in Brazil is bad for the country and the company, he said, adding that Petrobras would like to have more competition in the domestic refining sector. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras began the swearing in ceremony in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday afternoon slightly in the red, but closed up 2.45 percent. In his inaugural speech, the liberal economist’s criticism of Petrobras’ domestic near monopoly in the refining and natural gas sectors doubled as a push for the divestment of non-core assets, which is a priority for the incoming chief executive. Among the major planned divestments is a complex of gas pipelines known as TAG and a group of four refineries, both of which would fetch several billion dollars if sold. While Castello Branco said that Petrobras’ current five-year plan - which foresees $26.9 billion in divestments - is “very good ... in principle,” he added that the company’s incoming administration will need to examine if changes are needed. The firm would double down on exploration and production, he said, calling Petrobras’ exploration potential “immense.” “What’s important is being strong, not gigantic,” Castello Branco told reporters. At the event, Energy Minister Albuquerque also reiterated that the Bolsonaro government had no plans to interfere in domestic fuel pricing, as had occurred in the last year of former president Michel Temer’s administration, leading to the sudden resignation of then-CEO Pedro Parente.

2019-01-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 1 percent on Thursday in volatile trade, drawing support from signs that Saudi Arabia is cutting crude output but pressured by concerns that slowing global economic growth could dent demand. Brent crude LCOc1 futures gained $1.04 to settle at $55.95 a barrel, a 1.89 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 55 cents to settle at $47.09 a barrel, a 1.18 percent gain. (GRAPHIC: Shanghai crude oil futures vs Brent & WTI crude - tmsnrt.rs/2AmwzBl)  Prices traded in a wide range, with Brent hitting a session high of $56.30 a barrel and a low of $53.93 a barrel. WTI posted a session high of $47.49 a barrel and a low of $45.35 a barrel. Supporting futures were signs of reduced supply from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC oil supply fell in December by the largest amount in almost two years, a Reuters survey found, as top exporter Saudi Arabia made an early start to a supply-limiting accord while Iran and Libya posted involuntary declines. OPEC led by Saudi Arabia, alongside allied producers led by Russia, agreed last year to rein in supplies starting from January after oil prices tumbled from above $86 on worries about surging output. “The Saudis are still spearheading a significant production cut that became official this week. Thus far, strong adherence to adjusted quotas appears a high probability,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. But oil price gains were capped by concerns about a faltering global economy.  Tech giant Apple Inc (AAPL.O) cut its sales forecast, citing a slowdown in China. [.N] The news rattled U.S. equity markets and weighed on oil prices, which at times track Wall Street. Weaker-than-expected U.S. factory data also added to economic worries. “Oil is flip-flopping on concerns of supply and demand,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “It’s really a battle between the supply situation, which looks to be tightening, versus the possibility that demand will drop off.” U.S. oil and gas executives’ outlook turned negative for the first time since the low point of the last oil bust, according to results of a survey released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Investors have been concerned about rising supply from top producers, including the United States and Russia.  U.S. crude stocks fell last week, while gasoline and distillate inventories built, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Thursday. Crude inventories fell by 4.5 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 28 to 443.7 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3.1 million barrels.  Gasoline stocks rose by 8 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2 million-barrel gain. Distillate fuels stockpiles rose by 4 million barrels, compared with expectations for a 1.6 million-barrel gain, the API data showed. Official U.S. government data is due to be released on Friday. Riyadh was expected to cut February prices for heavier crude grades sold to Asia due to weaker fuel oil margins while reducing prices for light grades to keep Saudi oil competitive against rising U.S. shale oil supplies, a Reuters survey showed on Thursday.

2019-01-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A revenue warning from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) rocked equity markets around the globe on Thursday as concerns over the damaging China-U.S. trade battle and its impact on world economic growth boosted assets considered safer investments, such as bonds and the Japanese yen. Technology stocks led a selloff in equities after Apple, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China, late on Wednesday cut its revenue forecast for the first time in nearly 12 years. Apple’s U.S.-listed shares closed down 10 percent. That heightened concerns that sluggish global growth may be reflected in the United States, where corporate earnings season is set to kick off in a few weeks. Some market watchers fretted that U.S. corporate earnings may recede this year, leading to a further downturn in equities. “With the friction in the global economy, the market has to discount the multiples we’d previously been paying,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “Investors want to pay lower prices with the increased level of risk out there.” Survey data from the Institute for Supply Management showed U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December, sending stocks on Wall Street lower. All three major U.S. stock indexes ended down more than 2 percent.  As stocks were roiled, U.S. Treasury prices rose and their yields tumbled. The two-year Treasury yield US2YT=RR briefly dropped below 2.4 percent to reach parity with the federal funds effective rate for the first time since 2008. The market move indicated that investors believe the Federal Reserve’s plans to continue tightening monetary policy may be too aggressive given signs of an economic slowdown. “When the two-year yield is up, it’s constructive for equities, because it’s signalling that the economy is doing well, that the market can absorb the Fed moving towards rate normalization,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “The two-year yield is telling you a different story now.” Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last rose 31/32 in price to yield 2.5517 percent, from 2.661 percent late on Wednesday. In the U.S. equity market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 660.02 points, or 2.83 percent, to 22,686.22, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 62.14 points, or 2.48 percent, to 2,447.89 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 202.43 points, or 3.04 percent, to 6,463.50. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.26 percent. Apple's news also unsettled the currency markets, with the safe-haven yen climbing against the dollar JPY=. The dollar was last 1.19 percent lower against the yen at 107.57 yen. Earlier, in what some market watchers called a “flash crash,” the yen rose as much as 4.4 percent versus the dollar after a flurry of automated orders triggered a massive move in Asia, where trade was thin with Japanese participants still away for the New Year holiday.  The dollar index .DXY, measuring the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, was last down 0.6 percent. The euro EUR= rose 0.48 percent against the dollar to $1.1396. Keeping with the risk-off theme, gold prices hit a 6-1/2-month peak. Spot gold XAU= last added 0.7 percent to $1,293.96 an ounce.

2019-01-03,"(New throughout, adds details) Jan 3 (Reuters) - Southern California’s gas utility on Thursday extended its request for consumers to reduce natural gas use through the weekend, to avoid straining the system as cold weather lingers over the area. Regional gas supplies were expected to remain tight this winter due to limitations on several Southern California Gas Co (SoCalGas) pipelines and reduced availability of the utility’s biggest storage field at Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles, following a massive leak between October 2015 and February 2016. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , said it pulled gas from all four of its storage fields during the cold this week, including Aliso Canyon. When Aliso Canyon returned to service after the leak, the state mandated the facility was only to be used as an asset of last resort to maintain system reliability after other storage facilities and pipelines have been exhausted. “Without withdrawals from Aliso Canyon, increased demand...may have resulted in further curtailments to non-core customers,” SoCalGas said in a customer notice. Non-core customers include electric generators and some large industrial businesses. The U.S. National Weather Service issued a freeze warning for some inland cities in Southern California like Riverside. In addition to asking consumers to reduce gas used to heat homes and businesses, SoCalGas also extended a system-wide voluntary curtailment notice to electric generators from Wednesday through Friday. Consumer gas demand was expected to reach 3.6 billion cubic feet (bcf) on Thursday, 3.4 bcf on Friday and 3.0 bcf on Saturday and Sunday after hitting 3.8 bcf on Wednesday. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. State agencies forecast SoCalGas’ pipelines and storage facilities could send out up to 4.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this winter before the utility would have to tap Aliso Canyon, according to a report in October. SoCalGas can get about 2.7-3.3 bcfd from its pipes and the rest from storage, depending on how many pipeline outages and reductions the utility is able to fix, according to a state report. If needed, Aliso Canyon can deliver around 1.0 bcfd. But like all storage facilities, the amount of gas it can deliver will decline rapidly as pressure in the cavern decreases when the utility pulls fuel out.

2019-01-03,"HOUSTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - OPEC crude cargoes leaving for the United States in December dropped to the lowest level in at least five years, data from Refinitiv Eikon and market intelligence firm Kpler show. Oil cargoes departing from OPEC nations to the United States fell to 1.63 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, down from 1.80 million bpd in November and 1.78 million bpd in October, the data show. Saudi Arabia, the biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, and several others curbed supplies in the face of rising U.S. production and inventories, analysts said. “Some of it was a decline in OPEC production,” said Andy Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “But they’re facing competition from U.S. shale and Canadian production.” OPEC and allies including Russia agreed last month to cut crude production beginning this month by 1.2 million bpd, following a strategy to support prices when supplies overwhelm demand. OPEC pumped 32.68 million bpd last month, according to a Reuters survey, down 460,000 bpd from November, suggesting some members moved to reduce supplies ahead of the recent accord. “Historically, Saudi Arabia has utilized crude export flows to the United States as a method of signaling the Kingdom’s intentions, given the transparency of the U.S. market,” said Reid I’Anson, an energy economist at Kpler. Vessels last month carried about 534,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia to the United States, down from 632,000 bpd in November. Algeria sent 10,000 bpd, down 94,000 bpd, and Nigeria shipped 103,000 bpd, down by 48,000 bpd, according to Kpler. One major exception to the decline was Iraq, which sent 295,000 bpd to the United States, up by 140,000 bpd from November. Shipments from Venezuela increased 22,738 bpd. Booming U.S. shale production and growing stockpiles also crimped the nation’s appetite for imported crude. U.S. commercial crude stocks rose to 441 million barrels in the week ended Dec. 21, up from 394 million barrels in mid-September, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “When inventories began rising, that started to help decrease the demand for imports,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “We could see even lower imports from OPEC.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton, Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-crude-imports-opec/opec-sends-fewest-oil-cargoes-to-united-states-in-at-least-five-years-idUKL1N1Z30WW,03 Jan 2019,"OPEC crude cargoes leaving for

2019-01-03,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas executives’ outlook turned negative for the first time since the low point of the last oil bust, according to results of a survey released on Thursday by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. A survey of executive sentiment fell to -10 from 47 in the prior quarter, the first negative reading since early 2016, when U.S. crude prices CLc1 plummeted to $26 per barrel. More than half of executives said they expect lower capital spending in 2019. Still, executives predict U.S. crude will end the year trading around $60 per barrel, a 30 percent increase over current prices. Executives are using a price of $50 to $64.99 per barrel for planning, according to the survey, which was conducted Dec. 12-20. Only 9 percent said they were planning for a per-barrel price below $50 for the year. The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude was trading around $46.61 on Thursday morning. “I can’t help but feel we are in for another extended period of low prices,” one exploration and production executive said. “The only way for me to survive is to quit spending money.” Though exploration and production firms have come under intense investor pressure in the last year to shore up balance sheets, control spending and return money to shareholders through dividends or stock buybacks, only 7 percent of executives said their top goal was to return capital to shareholders. Meanwhile, 46 percent said their primary goal of 2019 was to grow oil and gas production. Service firms, which handle drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the oil field, had a more bearish outlook than exploration and production firms. Nearly 58 percent of services firms reported greater uncertainty. “We are holding the line and hanging on,” an executive with a service firm said. Another called the recent drop in crude oil prices, which peaked at $76 per barrel in October before plummeting by $30, a “blow to confidence.” The survey’s respondents included 104 companies focused on exploration and production activities and 63 that operate in the oilfield service sector.

2019-01-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers reported the broadest slowdown in growth last month for more than a decade, as the trade conflict with China, falling equity prices and increasing uncertainty finally started to take a toll on the economy. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index slumped by 5.2 points in December from the previous month, the largest monthly fall since October 2008. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Sy98Mh) Manufacturers reported increases in orders, output, employment and inventories, indicating the sector continues to expand, but at a much slower rate than before, according to survey results published on Thursday. The new orders component slumped by 11 points and remained barely above the 50-point threshold that divides expanding activity from a contraction, suggesting the loss of momentum could extend into early 2019. Major U.S. equity indices have been trending lower for months, suggesting investors were anxious about the earnings outlook, even as the purchasing managers survey continued to point to strong expansion. That contradiction has now been resolved - with the decline in the survey results confirming the signal coming from the equity markets. Until recently, the United States had appeared immune to the slowdown in growth evident in most other major economies since the middle of 2018. But the loss of momentum reported at the end of last year shows the economy is not immune from broader global trends. The slowdown in the United States is consistent with other indicators suggesting a significant deceleration in global export orders and trade flows. Oil prices and calendar spreads have been falling since October, as traders anticipate weaker consumption growth in 2019. Through tariffs, sanctions and other actions that have heightened uncertainty for businesses, policymakers have taken the expansion for granted and pushed the global economy to the brink of a slowdown.

2019-01-03,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s PetroRio SA (PRIO3.SA) and Australia’s Karoon Energy Ltd (KAR.AX) are among the bidders for a mature shallow water oilfield owned by Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), according to two sources speaking on condition of anonymity, as the state-run oil major marches ahead with an ambitious divestment program. With oil production of about 34,000 barrels per day, the Bauna field in Brazil’s Santos Basin is among the largest mature production assets in Petrobras’ $26.9 billion divestment portfolio.  While the sources did not disclose a potential value, PetroRio had previously placed a bid of about $500 million for Bauna in 2016 that was ultimately unsuccessful. Oil prices LCOc1 CLc1 have increased moderately since then. The slightly more productive Pampo and Enchova clusters in the adjacent Campos Basin, which are being sold together, were seen as fetching bids of around $1 billion in June. Karoon and Petrobras declined to comment. PetroRio did not respond to a request for comment. One of the sources said that other bidders were involved in the auction which closed late last year, and it was possible neither PetroRio nor Karoon would emerge as the winner for the concession set to last through 2040. Petrobras could enter exclusive talks with one of the bidders in a matter of weeks, the sources said. This is the second time PetroRio and Karoon have attempted to purchase Bauna.  Karoon had entered into exclusive negotiations in 2016 to purchase Bauna as well as the Tartaruga Verde field, which has recently started producing, though that process was scuttled following a court injunction. Karoon at that time beat out PetroRio’s $500 million bid, which was geared strictly toward Bauna. For PetroRio, the asset fits well with the independent oil firm’s strategy of acquiring stakes in mature oil fields to boost their productivity.  For Karoon, which has said that it remains interested in Bauna, the asset would present significant synergies with its nearby Kangaroo and Echidna oil discoveries. Petrobras is cutting its stakes in shallow water and mature fields to refocus its efforts on Brazil’s promising, deepwater pre-salt play. There is some legal uncertainty hanging over the Bauna divestiture. In December, a Supreme Court justice suspended sales of exploration and production assets by Petrobras, but the company later said it believed that decision applied only to processes begun in May or later.

2019-01-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC oil supply fell in December by the largest amount in almost two years, a Reuters survey found, as top exporter Saudi Arabia made an early start to a supply-limiting accord while Iran and Libya posted involuntary declines. The 15-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped 32.68 million barrels per day last month, the survey on Thursday found, down 460,000 bpd from November and the largest month-on-month drop since January 2017. The survey suggests Saudi Arabia and some of its allies acted unilaterally to bolster the market as crude prices slid on the possibility of a new glut. A formal accord by OPEC and its allies to cut supply in 2019 took effect only on Tuesday. Oil LCOc1 has slid to $56 a barrel from a four-year high of $86 in October on signs of excess supply.  While OPEC has not ruled out further action, officials hope prices will be supported by further output declines in January as producers implement the new deal.  “Naturally, it will adjust from now on,” said an OPEC delegate, referring to the downward trend in production. “I hope the market will recover soon.” OPEC, Russia and other non-members, an alliance known as OPEC+, agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd.  The deal came just months after an accord to pump more oil, which in turn partially unwound a supply cut that took effect in 2017. The drop in OPEC output in December is the largest month-on-month decline since January 2017, the first month of the earlier supply-cutting deal, according to Reuters surveys. The biggest drop in OPEC supply last month came from Saudi Arabia and amounted to 400,000 bpd, the survey showed. Saudi supply in November had hit a record 11 million bpd, after U.S. President Donald Trump demanded more oil be pumped to curb rising prices and make up for losses from Iran. The kingdom has said it plans to go even further in January by delivering a larger cut than required under the OPEC+ deal. The second-biggest drop occurred in the United Arab Emirates, which like Saudi voluntarily scaled back supply, the survey found.  The third largest was an involuntary cut by Libya, where unrest led to the shutdown of the country’s biggest oilfield.  Output from Iran declined further as U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying its oil. According to industry sources, however, Iran maintained its exports, helped by sanctions waivers granted to eight buyers as well as dogged Iranian efforts to keep selling crude. Among the countries boosting output, the biggest increase was in Iraq due to the restart of Kirkuk crude exports and a rebound in shipments from the country’s southern terminals. Output also rose in Kuwait and Nigeria. An OPEC list of output targets seen by Reuters and other news organisations will provide a basis to calculate compliance with the new supply deal in the January survey. As of 2019, OPEC has 14 members following Qatar’s departure. The Reuters survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Refinitiv Eikon flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2019-01-03,"* European shares fall; U.S. jobs data soothes some worries * Wall Street opens lower * Apple shares fall almost 10 percent * Currency ‘flash crash’ sends yen soaring By Josephine Mason LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Apple’s warning on revenue rocked financial markets on Thursday, as investors shunned equities and sought safety in bonds and less risky assets amid renewed concerns about slowing global economic growth and damage from the Sino-U.S. trade war. Technology stocks led a sell-off across Asian, European and U.S. shares after Apple cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. The news also jolted currency markets and German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years. “For the moment, investors have reacted by going into non-risky assets,” said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management, in Paris. “No one wants to take any risk because none of the uncertainties we are facing have been lifted, whether it’s Brexit, this trade war, or growth. Investors are putting their heads in the sand and waiting.” Apple’s U.S. and Frankfurt-listed shares tumbled almost 10 percent. The alert renewed worries about corporate earnings just weeks before results season kicks off in the United States and stirred worries that it signals broader malaise in the global economy, said Peter Rutter, head of global equities at Royal London Asset Management. “The equity market in the past three or four months has begun to bake in some form of economic slowdown and a reduction in corporate earnings expectations and there’s a wrestling match between waiting for that to come through,” he said. Analysts on average expect S&P 500 companies to increase their earnings per share by nearly 7 percent this year, down from a forecast of 10 percent at the start of October and far below their expectations of 24 percent EPS growth for 2018, according to Refinitiv’s IBES. The news sparked a ‘flash crash’ in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly in China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese yen, which was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months. Apple’s warning came after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing. U.S. stocks opened lower, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down 0.73 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropping 1.22 percent. In Europe, the pan European STOXX 600 was down 0.2 percent in late afternoon trade, with major European bourses off earlier lows as better-than-expected U.S. jobs data helping soothe some concerns. “You get Apple data today and then you get this (solid) jobs data. I think we’ll be waiting for the evidence of some slowdown to justify some of this recent sell-off and rotation between sectors,” said Rutter. Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit, sending technology stocks to their lowest since February 2017. Overnight, shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors braced for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy. Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with the yen moving sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars. The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011. The euro was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52. Germany’s 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.18 percent, after hitting a session low of 0.148 percent . U.S. crude oil rose 1.5 percent to $47.25 a barrel, and Brent crude was up 2.1 percent at $56.07. Gold was higher as the dollar weakened, with spot gold trading up 0.3 percent at $1,289.4 per ounce.

The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble.  The emergencies ministry said earlier on Thursday that 37 people had been killed. But the death toll went up to 39 when rescuers recovered another two bodies from the rubble on Thursday afternoon. Deputy Emergencies Minister Alexander Chupriyan told Interfax there were no more bodies under the rubble and that the search and rescue operation was over.  A Reuters witness at the scene said that workers were removing debris from the site using cranes and other equipment.  Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast. It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion.  Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.

2019-01-03,"TBILISI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Oil and oil-related shipments from Georgia’s Black Sea port of Batumi fell 51.2 percent in 2018 from a year earlier, an official at a KazMunaiGas-operated terminal at the port said on Thursday. Some crude oil was re-routed to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and to the Caspian Pipeline Consortium last year, the official added, while some fuel oil was sent to the port of Taman in Russia and Georgia’s other Black Sea port of Kulevi. The fall in shipments is partly because Azerbaijan prefers to send its oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline or via its own terminal in Kulevi, rather than from Batumi, which is operated by a Kazakh company. Shipments of crude oil and refined oil products from Batumi totalled 1.030 million tonnes last year, down from 2.109 million tonnes in 2017, said the official, who asked not to be identified. In December, overall shipments were 51,709 tonnes, compared with 26,761 tonnes the previous month and 221,210 tonnes in December 2017. “Some volumes have been re-routed to other routes last year,” the official said. There were no shipments of crude oil, jet fuel, fuel oil and naphtha last month. Crude and refined oil products from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan are shipped out of Georgia’s Black Sea ports of Batumi, Supsa, Poti and the terminal in Kulevi.

The planned 6,000-megawatt Grand Renaissance Dam is the centrepiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter, but until this week progress had been unclear after Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed last August cancelled a state-run conglomerate’s contract to build the turbines. State media reported on Wednesday that the government had signed an agreement with GE Hydro France, a unit of GE Renewables, to accelerate the completion of the dam, and water and energy minister Seleshi Bekele said on Thursday the project was on track to open in two years’ time. “750 megawatts is the planned initial production with two turbines,” Seleshi told parliament. The government expected the dam to be fully operational by the end of 2022, he said. The project has caused problems with Egypt, which fears the dam will restrict Nile River waters coming down from Ethiopia’s highlands, through the deserts of Sudan, to Egyptian fields and reservoirs. Ethiopia disputes that and in November Abiy was quoted by Egyptian state media as saying he wanted to preserve Egypt’s Nile rights. When Abiy cancelled the contract of Ethiopian military conglomerate Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC) in August, he said not a single turbine was operational more than seven years after the government awarded the contract. Dozens of senior officials from METEC, including its head, have been arrested in a corruption crackdown launched by the reformist leader who took office last year. METEC had only completed 23 percent of the work, Seleshi said on Thursday. There have been other construction delays. “Purchased generators, turbines and other equipment are scattered in ports and other places, meaning more costs,” Seleshi said. GE Hydro France will be paid nearly 54 million euros ($61 million) to manufacture, fix and test turbine generators, state media said. $1 = 0.8818 euros

The proposal lifted shares of state-run utilities Energa, Tauron and PGE by 1-5 percent. “A member state is obliged to notify to the Commission any state aid measures before they are put into effect,” Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva told a regular news briefing. “EU law sates that such measures need to be notified for the Commission to be able to look at them.

2019-01-03,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China PMI vs iron ore, coal prices: tmsnrt.rs/2SxeDuQ By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The slump in China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is likely to prove an unwelcome New Year’s gift to the world’s major exporters of bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal. The manufacturing gauge compiled by Beijing’s National Bureau of Statistics dropped to 49.4 in December, dropping below the 50-level that demarcates growth from contraction, for the first time since July 2016. The outcome was also below the 49.9 median forecast in a survey of analysts, and the weakest reading since in almost three years. The problem for iron ore and coal producers shipping to the world’s biggest commodity importer is that the PMI has a strong correlation to prices, once a lag of a month or two is factored in. The Chinese PMI showed a solid uptrend from July 2016 to a peak of 52.4 in September 2017, a period that coincided with gains for the prices of iron ore and thermal coal. Iron ore with a 62-percent iron content for delivery to China MT-IO-QIN62=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, almost doubled in price from June 2016 to a peak of $94.75 a tonne in February 2017. Thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, also enjoyed a strong run from June 2016 to November of that year, more than doubling to reach a peak of $110.73 a tonne. Both coal and iron ore reverted to the usual seasonal pattern of peaks in the northern hemisphere winter and troughs in the summer, but prices remained above the 2016 lows. A slowing in the Chinese PMI to 50.3 in February 2018 was matched by lower iron ore and coal prices by March. But a recovery in the PMI to 51.9 by May saw iron ore prices stabilise and coal prices regain strength. The issue for iron ore and coal exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa is that the Chinese PMI is now in an established downtrend, having peaked in May last year and fallen every month since, apart from a slight bump in August. Iron ore and coal have both managed to hold up relatively well in that period, especially considering the rout in other commodities such as crude oil. Newcastle coal did retreat from its seven-year high of $119.74 a tonne, reached in July last year, but it only fell as far as $97.50 in late November, and has since then actually managed to move higher, to $99.74 in the week ended Dec. 28. Iron ore, in contrast to the PMI, climbed for most of the second half of 2018, reaching as high as $77.80 a tonne in early November, before dropping to $64.55 by the end of the month. However, since then, similar to coal, iron ore has managed to stage a little rally, closing at $72.40 a tonne on Wednesday. There are short-term drivers of the iron ore and coal price that can outweigh a longer-term correlation with the PMI. These include winter peak demand for coal, and restocking by steel mills ahead of the lifting of China’s winter pollution controls. But it also appears that for iron ore and coal much of the recent resilience in prices is built on the hope that Beijing will open the stimulus taps and boost steel- and energy-intensive industries, such as infrastructure and construction. The optimistic view in the market is that the authorities will do what is necessary to ensure that economic growth remains above 6 percent in China - a level that seems to be taking on some sort of iconic status as a line in the sand that Beijing will defend, even at the risk of creating more credit problems from unrestrained spending. It may yet be the case that China does successfully stimulate its economy, or it may get a boost if its trade dispute with the United States is resolved in the coming months. But unless there is some evidence to back up the optimistic scenario, iron ore and coal prices would seem increasingly likely to weaken, in line with the PMI.

2019-01-03,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Renewables overtook coal as Germany’s main source of energy for the first time last year, accounting for just over 40 percent of electricity production, research showed on Thursday. The shift marks progress as Europe’s biggest economy aims for renewables to provide 65 percent of its energy by 2030 in a costly transition as it abandons nuclear power by 2022 and is devising plans for an orderly long-term exit from coal. The research from the Fraunhofer organization of applied science showed that output of solar, wind, biomass and hydroelectric generation units rose 4.3 percent last year to produce 219 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity. That was out of a total national power production of 542 TWh derived from both green and fossil fuels, of which coal burning accounted for 38 percent. Green energy’s share of Germany’s power production has risen from 38.2 percent in 2017 and just 19.1 percent in 2010. Bruno Burger, author of the Fraunhofer study, said it was set to stay above 40 percent this year. “We will not fall below the 40 percent in 2019 because more renewable installations are being built and weather patterns will not change that dramatically,” he said. Green power skeptics say that output merely reflects favorable weather patterns and does not prove the sector’s contribution to secure energy supplies. Solar power increased by 16 percent to 45.7 TWh due to a prolonged hot summer, while installed capacity expanded by 3.2 gigawatts (GW) to 45.5 GW last year, according to the Fraunhofer data. The wind power industry produced 111 TWh from combined onshore and offshore capacity of just under 60 GW, constituting 20.4 percent of total German power output.  Wind power was the biggest source of energy after domestically mined brown coal power which accounted for 24.1 percent.  Coal plants run on imported hard coal contributed 75.7 TWh, or 13.9 percent of the total. Hydropower only accounted for 3.2 percent of power production at 17 TWh, as extreme summer heat dried out rivers and was accompanied by low rainfall. Biomass output contributed 8.3 percent. Gas-to-power plants accounted for 7.4 percent of the total; nuclear energy for 13.3 percent; with the remainder coming from oil and waste burning. Germany was a net exporter of 45.6 TWh of power in 2018, mostly to the Netherlands, while importing big volumes from France.

Asian and European shares fell sharply, led by a sell-off in technology stocks, and U.S. equity futures pointed to a weaker open on Wall Street after Apple cut its revenue forecast, its first downgrade in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. The news also jolted currency markets and German government bond yields held close to their lowest in over two years. “For the moment, investors have reacted by going into non-risky assets,” said Philippe Waechter, chief economist at Ostrum Asset Management, in Paris. “No one wants to take any risk because none of the uncertainties we are facing have been lifted, whether it’s Brexit, this trade war, or growth. Investors are putting their heads in the sand and waiting.” Apples shares tumbled in after-hours trade and those listed in Frankfurt were down 8.6 percent in early European deals. The news sparked a ‘flash crash’ in holiday-thinned currency markets as growing concerns about the health of the global economy, particularly in China, sent investors scurrying into the safe-haven of the Japanese yen, which was poised for its biggest daily rise in 20 months. Apple’s warning came after data earlier this week showed a deceleration in factory activity in China and the euro zone, indicating the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China was taking a toll on global manufacturing. Major European bourses were firmly in negative territory by midmorning - Frankfurt’s DAX, with its exposure to Chinese trade and tech-heavy constituents, was the biggest faller and down as much as 1.2 percent, while Paris’ CAC40 dropped 1.1 percent and London eased 0.4 percent. Chipmakers who supply parts to Apple were the worst hit, sending technology stocks to their lowest since February 2017. U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-minis down 2.7 percent and S&P 500 E-minis off 1.6 percent. Overnight, shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors braced for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy. “Chinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,” said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan, at Nomura. China’s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator. While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world’s second-largest economy. Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with the yen moving sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars. The dollar was last 1 percent weaker against the yen at 107.77, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011. The euro was up 0.3 percent, buying $1.1375, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.52. Germany’s 10-year bond yield was most recently at 0.185 percent, after hitting a session low of 0.148 percent . U.S. crude oil fell 0.9 percent to $46.12 a barrel, and Brent crude was down 0.2 percent at $54.82. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices.

2019-01-03,"MUMBAI, Jan 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Deadly disputes over land and indigenous rights are not obvious themes for children’s books, but Indian writers are using real-life conflicts to help the next generation understand their impact on communities across the country. “I Will Save My Land” by Rinchin is about the impact of coal mining on a village, while Siddhartha Sarma’s “Year of the Weeds” novel for young adults is based on a successful fight to save indigenous land from a mining company. “When people are displaced from their land, children are also affected, but perhaps no one explains it to them,” said Rinchin, who goes by one name, and published her book last year. In Rinchin’s picture book, a little girl named Mati asks her father and grandmother for her own piece of land in the field where they work. She tends to her plot until she hears that they will lose their land to a coal mine. It is a common occurrence, said Rinchin, in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh, where coal mining has forced tens of thousands of farmers off their land, many of whom are Adivasis, or indigenous people. While indigenous people have customary rights over ancestral land and forests, the state can acquire the land for infrastructure and development projects. Those displaced are rarely consulted or compensated, activists say. Last week, in a rare move, the newly elected government in Chhattisgarh said it would give back land taken from indigenous farmers for a steel plant more than a decade ago, but never used. “An Adivasi’s right over land is so tenuous - it can be taken away at any time by the government or an upper-caste person,” said Rinchin, whose books are also translated into regional languages. The story also highlights the role of caste and gender in land rights issues, she said. “Women do so much of the work, but have so little say,” Rinchin told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Women make up nearly half the agricultural labour in India, yet own less than 2 percent of its farmland, according to the think tank National Council of Applied Economic Research. About 660 disputes over land have forced millions of people from their farms across India, according to the research organisation Land Conflict Watch. Regional-language movies and children’s books are focusing on such issues that big-budget Bollywood films and mass paperbacks generally ignore. In “Year of the Weeds”, also published last year, Sarma tells the story of the Dongria Kondh tribe in Odisha state, which managed to stop London-listed Vedanta Resources from mining bauxite in the sacred Niyamgiri hills. Residents of 12 villages, whose opinion the state sought for a court order in 2013, unanimously voted against allowing mining. ""It was a rare positive story, and I decided to write it for teenagers, because I still have hope that the younger generation will engage with these issues and grow up to be kinder, gentler, more humane citizens,"" said Sarma.

2019-01-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the government to list the steps it plans for the rescue of at least 15 miners trapped in a so-called “rat-hole” coal mine for three weeks in a remote hilly state, warning that “every second counts”. The workers were ensnared on Dec. 13 when the illegal mine in the northeastern state of Meghalaya was flooded. Rescuers have so far only been able to find three helmets and two axes underground. The country’s top court wondered why attempts to reach the miners had not yet been successful. “Tell us by tomorrow, because for people who are trapped, every second counts,” Justice Arjan Kumar Sikri told the federal government, represented by Solicitor-General Tushar Mehta. The Meghalaya government told the court that nearly 86 people were working on the rescue effort since Dec. 14, including employees of state-controlled Coal India Ltd, the world’s biggest miner of the fuel. Kyrmen Shylla, Meghalaya’s disaster management minister, told Reuters both government and private agencies had been involved in the bid to reach the miners, many of whose family members have given up hope. Rat-hole mining has killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya, including children, before India’s environmental court banned the practice in early 2014. At its peak, the state produced coal worth $4 billion a year, or about a tenth of India’s total production. Despite the ban, many mines continued operatihere, requiring workers, often children, to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow, horizontal seams. The unsuccessful rescue bid has drawn criticism of a lack of urgency shown by government agencies, particularly given the remote location of the mine, a journey to which can take more than five hours from the nearest commercial airport in Guwahati. “Would we have cared more if the miners had not been at the fringes of national consciousness in the northeast?” senior journalist Vir Sanghvi asked on Twitter. “I have not given up hope, but our response to this crisis shames us as a nation.” Additional reporting by Zarir Hussain in GUWAHATI; Writing by Krishna N.

2019-01-03,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Residents of the Indian capital of New Delhi woke on Thursday to a thick, gray smog, as pollution surged to “severe” and “emergency” levels, with authorities showing little sign of finding new solutions to the crisis. The air quality index of the state-run Central Pollution Control Board showing the concentration of poisonous particulate matter known as PM 2.5 stood at 440, up from 430 on Wednesday, and about 12 times the U.S. government recommended level of 35.  Pollution levels hit 500 in some parts of New Delhi, with very poor visibility in some areas. Last year, the high was 450 on Dec. 23. “Climatic conditions have contributed to the crisis, but let’s admit that most steps announced in 2018 have failed miserably,” said Sunil Dahiya, a senior campaigner with environmental group Greenpeace. A sharp drop in temperatures and wind speed, combined with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites and smoke from garbage burning has boosted pollution over much of north India, including New Delhi, home to more than 20 million. A spokesman for the federal government was not immediately available to comment. The city government refused to comment. Both the federal government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Arvind Kejriwal’s Delhi government have not announced any measures to fight pollution this year. Cold weather has forced some people, especially those spending the night in the open, to burn small fires to keep warm, adding to the smog. Unfavorable weather conditions have worsened the crisis, but government measures have also failed to improve air quality in New Delhi and elsewhere. As pollution spiked in the city in October and November, the government adopted measures ranging from a temporary ban on construction activities and garbage burning to a clampdown on polluting industrial plants, such as coal-fired power stations. Critics say the measures were inadequate and poorly implemented, largely because of a lack of resources and political will to fight the toxic air, which has driven a spurt in patients battling pollution-related health issues. India is home to the world’s 14 most polluted cities, with Delhi the sixth worst, the World Health Organization said in a report this year.  Toxic air claimed 1.24 million lives in India last year, or 12.5 percent of total deaths, a study published in Lancet Planetary Health showed this month. “India cuts a sorry figure because of the reports from international bodies,” said Dahiya. “If a country fails to give clean air to its people, agencies like the WHO and Lancet will talk about it.” Editing by Martin Howell and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-pollution/toxic-smog-shrouds-indian-capital-as-pollution-soars-govt-measures-fail-idUKL3N1Z31Y0,03 Jan 2019,"Residents of the Indian capital

NOC declared force majeure on Dec. 17 at Sharara, its biggest oilfield, after it was taken over on Dec. 8 by tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. Three security breaches and looting have taken place at the 315,000 bpd field over two weeks, NOC said, reiterating its calls for the implementation of emergency security measures to allow Sharara to be reopened. The internationally recognised government and NOC agreed on a security plan last week to protect the Sharara field and NOC chairman Mustafa Sanalla warned on Thursday that attacks on the field could destroy the Sharara system and damage the economy. “The legitimate and rightful concerns of the Southern Libyan communities are being hijacked and abused by armed gangs, who instead of protecting the field to generate wealth for all Libyans, are actually enabling its exploitation and looting,” Sanalla said.

2019-01-03,"SINGAPORE, Jan 3 (Reuters) - High-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) volumes traded in S&P Global Platts’ Singapore price assessment process were nearly halved in 2018 from the previous year, signs of a market shift ahead of tougher global marine fuel rules coming in 2020. New rules from 2020 will ban ships from using fuel oil with a sulphur content above 0.5 percent, compared with 3.5 percent now, unless they are equipped with exhaust “scrubbers” to clean up sulphur emissions. “International Maritime Organization (IMO) 2020 is clearly having a significant impact on the bunker fuel market,” said Arnaud Humblot, communications manager for S&P Global Platts. A total of 11.786 million tonnes of HSFO was traded in Singapore in 2018 over Platts’ market-on-close (MOC) price assessment process, often called the “window”, down 46 percent from 21.935 million tonnes in 2017 and 34 percent from 17.834 million tonnes in 2016, according to data provided by Platts. Uncertainty in the fuel oil trading community ahead of IMO 2020 has led to some fuel oil trading desks at major oil firms consolidating or dissolving, or even outright exiting the market, five Singapore-based trade sources said. “All this proves is that the number of participants has dramatically reduced and that the majority of traders have scaled back activities on the heavier side of the barrel,” Matt Stanley, an oil products broker at Star Fuels in Dubai. Singapore is the world’s top fuel oil trading hub and serves as Asia’s pricing centre for refined oil products, including gasoline, diesel and marine fuels. The city-state is also home to the world’s largest bunkering or ship refuelling port. Until now, that has meant primarily the sale of HSFO for ships’ bunkers. But as the use of HSFO in marine fuels has to be displaced by other IMO-compliant fuels come 2020, oil price reporting agencies are working to introduce new price benchmarks for low-sulphur fuel oil (LSFO) bunker fuels ahead of time. Starting in October, Platts price reporting rival Argus launched several new assessments for low-sulphur marine fuels in bunkering hubs in Singapore, Europe and the United States. And Platts on Wednesday kicked off its own physical trade for “Marine Fuel 0.5 percent” fuel oil on the MOC. While trade liquidity for the nascent Platts LSFO product was sparse, it marked an important step towards price discovery for the fuel. “The fact that market participants bid and offered marine fuel 0.5 percent on the launch day of the new assessments is an indication of the market’s eagerness to adapt to the IMO 2020 rules,” said Vera Blei, global director of oil market reporting at S&P Global Platts in a statement.

2019-01-03,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan -0.6 pct, Asia tech shares hit harder * European shares expected to open lower * China shares volatile as economy slows * Currency ‘flash crash’ sends yen soaring By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell and Asian shares stumbled on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple Inc added to worries about slowing global growth and weaker earnings and jolted currency markets. European markets were expected to follow, with bookmakers predicting London’s FTSE and Frankfurt’s DAX would open 0.4 percent lower and Paris’ CAC40 down 0.6 percent. Apple blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China in its most recent quarter, its first such warning since 2007. Its shares tumbled in after-hours trade. The news sparked a ‘flash crash’ in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds. U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 2.6 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.6 percent after an early attempt at a bounce. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 2.2 percent. Shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors waited for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy. “Chinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government tool case, but also the monetary parts ... and I suspect the Chinese authorities will use that,” said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura.

While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world’s second-largest economy. “Despite a more pro-growth policy stance, effectively since mid-2018, we expect growth to continue to slow in the foreseeable future as it appears to us that the government’s policy is still behind the curve,” economists at BofA Merrill Lynch said in a global research repport. “In our view, the next significant stimulus may only occur when the government senses that financial stability is in jeopardy.” Apple’s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. An MSCI index of Korean shares lost 1.8 percent and Taiwan shares fell 1.4 percent. Australia bucked the trend, with the ASX 200 bouncing 1.4 percent after the previous day’s drubbing. A sudden slide in the Aussie dollar, which fell to near decade lows at one point, boosted shares of miners and other resource exporters despite the weakening China demand outlook. The volatile day for Asia followed swings on Wall Street overnight, where shares slid in early trade on growth worries before clawing back losses as surging oil prices drove gains in energy shares. Apple specifically highlighted slowing Chinese growth and Sino-U.S. trade tensions, exacerbating investors’ concerns about the health of the global economy. “The fall in the EM manufacturing PMI last month was fairly broad-based and supports our view that growth in the emerging world as a whole will slow this year,” Gabriella Dickens, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. Adding to the sour mood, a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders produced no agreement to end a partial government shutdown. Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with risk aversion pushing the yen sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars. The dollar was last 1.9 percent weaker against the yen at 106.85, having earlier fallen as low as 104.96, its lowest level since March 2018. The Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011. The euro was up 0.2 percent, buying $1.1365, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.504.

2019-01-03,"MOSCOW, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Thirty-seven bodies have been recovered from the rubble of a Russian apartment building that partially collapsed this week after an apparent gas explosion, Russian news agencies reported on Thursday. The blast in the early hours of December 31 damaged 48 apartments in a 10-storey building in the industrial city of Magnitogorsk, some 1,700 km (1,050 miles) east of Moscow. The death toll has progressively risen in the past few days as rescuers battle blisteringly cold temperatures to recover people trapped under the rubble. As of Thursday morning, the bodies of 22 of the 37 dead had been identified, agencies cited the local branch of the emergencies ministries as saying. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, has said it is still investigating the exact cause of the blast. It said no traces of explosives had been found at the site. Initial reports attributed the blast to a gas explosion. Gas explosions are relatively common in Russia because of ageing infrastructure and poor safety regulations surrounding gas use.

2019-01-03,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The slump in China’s Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) is likely to prove an unwelcome New Year’s gift to the world’s major exporters of bulk commodities such as iron ore and coal. The manufacturing gauge compiled by Beijing’s National Bureau of Statistics dropped to 49.4 in December, dropping below the 50-level that demarcates growth from contraction, for the first time since July 2016. The outcome was also below the 49.9 median forecast in a survey of analysts, and the weakest reading since in almost three years. (Graphic: China PMI vs iron ore, coal prices: tmsnrt.rs/2SxeDuQ) The problem for iron ore and coal producers shipping to the world’s biggest commodity importer is that the PMI has a strong correlation to prices, once a lag of a month or two is factored in. The Chinese PMI showed a solid uptrend from July 2016 to a peak of 52.4 in September 2017, a period that coincided with gains for the prices of iron ore and thermal coal. Iron ore with a 62-percent iron content for delivery to China, as assessed by Argus Media, almost doubled in price from June 2016 to a peak of $94.75 a tonne in February 2017. Thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, also enjoyed a strong run from June 2016 to November of that year, more than doubling to reach a peak of $110.73 a tonne. Both coal and iron ore reverted to the usual seasonal pattern of peaks in the northern hemisphere winter and troughs in the summer, but prices remained above the 2016 lows. A slowing in the Chinese PMI to 50.3 in February 2018 was matched by lower iron ore and coal prices by March. But a recovery in the PMI to 51.9 by May saw iron ore prices stabilise and coal prices regain strength. The issue for iron ore and coal exporters such as Australia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa is that the Chinese PMI is now in an established downtrend, having peaked in May last year and fallen every month since, apart from a slight bump in August. Iron ore and coal have both managed to hold up relatively well in that period, especially considering the rout in other commodities such as crude oil. Newcastle coal did retreat from its seven-year high of $119.74 a tonne, reached in July last year, but it only fell as far as $97.50 in late November, and has since then actually managed to move higher, to $99.74 in the week ended Dec. 28. Iron ore, in contrast to the PMI, climbed for most of the second half of 2018, reaching as high as $77.80 a tonne in early November, before dropping to $64.55 by the end of the month. However, since then, similar to coal, iron ore has managed to stage a little rally, closing at $72.40 a tonne on Wednesday. There are short-term drivers of the iron ore and coal price that can outweigh a longer-term correlation with the PMI. These include winter peak demand for coal, and restocking by steel mills ahead of the lifting of China’s winter pollution controls. But it also appears that for iron ore and coal much of the recent resilience in prices is built on the hope that Beijing will open the stimulus taps and boost steel- and energy-intensive industries, such as infrastructure and construction. The optimistic view in the market is that the authorities will do what is necessary to ensure that economic growth remains above 6 percent in China - a level that seems to be taking on some sort of iconic status as a line in the sand that Beijing will defend, even at the risk of creating more credit problems from unrestrained spending. It may yet be the case that China does successfully stimulate its economy, or it may get a boost if its trade dispute with the United States is resolved in the coming months. But unless there is some evidence to back up the optimistic scenario, iron ore and coal prices would seem increasingly likely to weaken, in line with the PMI.

2019-01-03,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan -0.4 pct, Asia tech shares hit harder * U.S. stock futures fall over 1 pct after Apple warning * China shares volatile as economy slows * Currency ‘flash crash’ sends yen soaring By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell and Asian shares wobbled on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple Inc added to worries about slowing global growth and weaker earnings. The California-based tech giant blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China in warning about revenues in its most recent quarter, its first such warning since 2007. Its shares tumbled 8 percent in after-hours trade. The news sparked a ‘flash crash’ in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds. U.S. stock futures pointed to another rough start on Wall Street, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 2.2 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent after an early attempt at a bounce. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 1.9 percent. Shares in China and Hong Kong see-sawed between gains and losses as investors waited for Beijing to roll out fresh support measures for the cooling Chinese economy. China’s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms that are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to ease strains on the private sector, a key job creator. While more fiscal and monetary policy support had been expected in coming months on top of modest measures last year, some analysts wonder if more forceful stimulus will be needed to stabilise the world’s second-largest economy. “Despite a more pro-growth policy stance, effectively since mid-2018, we expect growth to continue to slow in the foreseeable future as it appears to us that the government’s policy is still behind the curve,” economists at BofA Merrill Lynch said in a global research repport. “In our view, the next significant stimulus may only occur when the government senses that financial stability is in jeopardy.” Apple’s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. Korean shares were 1.3 percent lower and shares in Taiwan lost 1.4 percent. Australia bucked the trend, with the ASX 200 bouncing 1.6 percent after the previous day’s drubbing. A sudden slide in the Aussie dollar, which fell to near decade lows at one point, boosted shares of miners and other resource exporters despite the weakening China demand outlook. The volatile day for Asian markets followed swings on Wall Street overnight, where shares slid in early trade on growth worries before clawing back losses, as surging oil prices drove gains in energy shares. Apple specifically highlighted slowing Chinese growth and Sino-U.S. trade tensions, exacerbating investors’ concerns about the health of the global economy. “The fall in the EM manufacturing PMI last month was fairly broad-based and supports our view that growth in the emerging world as a whole will slow this year,” Gabriella Dickens, an economist at Capital Economics, said in a note. Adding to the sour mood, a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional leaders produced no agreement to end a partial government shutdown. Trump’s demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers. Currency markets saw a wild spike in volatility in early Asian trade, with risk aversion pushing the yen sharply higher against the U.S. dollar, breaking key technical levels and triggering stop-loss sales of U.S. and Australian dollars. The dollar was last 1.6 percent weaker against the yen at 107.15, while the Australian dollar at one point hit levels against the Japanese yen not seen since 2011. The euro was up 0.2 percent, buying $1.1365, and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of major rivals, was 0.3 percent weaker at 96.503. Amid the flight to perceived safety, the yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes fell to 2.6328 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.661 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, was at 2.4777 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.504 percent as signs of slowing growth ate away at expectations of further Federal Reserve rate hikes. U.S. crude fell 1.8 percent to $45.71 a barrel after a sharp rise on Wednesday. Brent crude was down 1 percent at $54.38. Slowing global growth is expected to coincide with an increase in crude supply, depressing prices.

2019-01-03,"* MSCI Asia Ex-Japan erases early losses * China central bank widens scope of targeted RRR cut * Currency ‘flash crash’ sends yen soaring By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures fell on Thursday after a rare revenue warning from Apple Inc added to worries about slowing global growth, but a move by China’s central bank to help struggling smaller firms lifted shares there, cushioning losses for Asian markets. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant blamed fewer iPhone upgrades and slowing sales in China in warning about revenues in its most recent quarter, its first such warning since 2007. Its shares tumbled 8 percent in after-hours trade. The news also sparked a ‘flash crash’ in holiday-thinned currency markets as investors rushed to less risky assets, with the Japanese yen soaring against most major currencies in a matter of seconds. MSCI’s broadest gauge of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped in early trade but later steadied as Chinese shares climbed. Japanese markets were closed for holidays but Nikkei futures dropped 1.8 percent. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index was 0.8 percent higher, and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gained 0.4 percent after a bruising Wednesday session. China’s central bank said late on Wednesday it was adjusting policy to benefit more small firms which are having trouble obtaining financing, in its latest move to support the cooling economy. The step “is aimed at getting banks of all sizes to lend to SMEs through offering incentives, and is part of the government’s pledge to support private investment,” analysts at Everbright Sun Hung Kai said in a note. “Chinese authorities have got the luxury of having control not just of the fiscal parts of the government’s tool case, but also the monetary parts of the government’s tool case,” said Jim McCafferty, head of equity research, Asia ex-Japan at Nomura. “What’s going on right now between the U.S. and China, a lot of this is not just about trade, a lot of it is about soft power. And the stock market is an instrument of soft power, and if the Chinese authorities are able to to influence the value of the stock market, they will do whatever it takes to make sure that that happens,” he said. More growth boosting measures are widely expected in China amid expectations the economy will continue to slow in early 2019. Weak China December factory readings this week have spurred a fresh round of selling in global markets. Apple’s surprise announcement weighed on tech shares across Asia, most notably in Taiwan and South Korea. Australian shares bounced 1.4 percent after the previous day’s drubbing, helping to offset weakness elsewhere in the region. A weaker Aussie dollar, which fell to near decade lows, also boosted exporters. The mixed performance in Asia comes after shares on Wall Street slid in early trade Wednesday on growth worries but later clawed back losses, with a surge in oil prices driving gains in energy shares. U.S. stock futures were still pointing lower on Thursday, with Nasdaq E-mini futures down 1.9 percent and S&P 500 E-mini futures off 1.1 percent following Apple’s warning.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $45.83 per barrel at 0120 GMT, down 71 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures were down 51 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $54.40 per barrel. Markets were roiled by a more than 3 percent crash of the U.S.-dollar against Japan’s yen overnight, and after U.S. tech giant Apple cut its sales forecast. “We did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration, particularly in Greater China,” Apple chief executive Tim Cook said. The slowdown in China and turmoil in stock and currency markets is making investors nervous, including in oil markets. Investment bank Jefferies said in a 2019 opening note to clients and employees that the start of the year “doesn’t feel as firm, the future doesn’t feel as certain and optimistic, and the path forward does not seem as clear.” The U.S. bank added that “markets are extremely volatile and virtually impossible to anticipate or navigate.” Reporting by Henning Gloystein; editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/oil-prices-drop-amid-currency-and-stock-market-turmoil-idUKL3N1Z310Y,03 Jan 2019,"Oil prices fell by more than

2019-01-03,"(Repeats Wednesday’s story with no changes to text. (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own)) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2AtMMVh By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Fear became the dominant sentiment in 2018, especially in the second half of the year, as growing pessimism about the future gripped policymakers, business leaders, investors and journalists. Those best able to articulate, amplify and exploit concerns about the economy, migration, security and the impact of technology proved the most influential. Fear can be a powerful motivating force but it is not a particularly creative one. “Fear is the mind-killer, fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration,” Frank Herbert wrote in his 1965 novel “Dune”. Risk-taking and willingness to invest under conditions of uncertainty are critical to sustaining output, growing the economy and raising real incomes. “If human nature felt no temptation to take a chance, no satisfaction (profit apart) in constructing a factory, a railway, a mine or a farm, there might not be much investment merely as a result of cold calculation,” John Maynard Keynes wrote in 1936’s “General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money”. As fear drives the global economy towards a slowdown or outright recession, politicians, business leaders, investors, journalists and voters will have to find reasons to become more optimistic if the threatened slump is to be averted, or at least not prolonged. The rising influence of China and its shifting balance of power with the United States was one particular area of concern in 2018. By the end of the year, the two countries were embroiled in a wide-ranging conflict covering trade, intellectual property, foreign investment, technology transfer and espionage, as well as an accelerating arms race. Strategic competition intensified globally, from the Pacific and Indian Oceans to Africa, Latin America, Central Asia and Europe, as well as in multilateral institutions including the IMF, World Bank, APEC and WTO. The two superpowers appeared to be heading towards a new cold war in which the globalised economy of the 1990s and 2000s would be sundered into separate and competing economic, diplomatic and military blocs. A proliferation of tariffs and non-tariff barriers intended to protect national and economic security was born from worries about the impact of international trade on domestic manufacturing industries and employment. Policymakers as well as academics stipulated that trade should be fair as well as free, with optimism about the benefits of globalisation countered by renewed calls to strengthen the nation-state. Concerns grew about income inequality, poor productivity and rural areas of advanced economies left-behind by economic and social changes. By the end of the year, commentators as well as politicians were invoking nationalism, patriotism and a bigger role for democratic governments as part of a broad backlash against unaccountable multilateralism. Technology became something to be feared for its negative impact on existing industries rather than a positive force for productivity and social and economic change. Journalists and politicians focused on the disruptive effect of internet platforms, social media, data collection and artificial intelligence on incumbent businesses and workers, now also including white-collar professionals. Social media was blamed for intensifying political polarisation and spreading propaganda rather than hailed as an agent for reform and democratisation, with growing calls for government regulation of various platforms. China’s leading technology exporters ZTE and Huawei bore the brunt of a backlash as the worries about technology intersected concerns about the security of global supply chains. Cyber-espionage, surveillance and hacking by Russia, China, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Israel and the United States among others, along with private security companies and criminal organisations, added to the jittery mood. The Middle East became less rather than more stable in 2018, with an intensifying dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, tensions between Qatar and its neighbours, and the ongoing war in Yemen. The U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed sweeping sanctions on the country, ratcheting up tensions and leaving the future of the accord unclear. Previous optimism about Saudi Arabia’s modernisation programme was quashed by concerns about the country’s leadership following the detention of domestic critics and the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In Europe, inconclusive Brexit negotiations dominated the political outlook, along with violent protests in France and the ebbing political authority of Germany’s long-time leader Angela Merkel. Italy elected an avowedly populist government determined to confront the EU while there were concerns about judicial independence, press freedom and authoritarianism in parts of eastern Europe. Voters continued to desert moderate centre-right and centre-left politicians to back parties and movements with more radical agendas, leading to fears about the EU’s future direction, stability and cohesion. Meanwhile, the United States and its European allies continued to complain about Russia’s military intervention in Syria and Ukraine, along with its missile programmes and cyber activities. Given the unpredictable environment, and the prospect of rising interest rates, it should come as no surprise that major equity markets and commodity prices fell sharply towards the end of the year (tmsnrt.rs/2AtMMVh) The U.S. S&P 500 equity index posted its worst 12-month performance since February 2016, and before that Sept 2009, ending last year 6 percent lower. South Korea’s KOSPI-100 index, which is heavily exposed to world trade, ended down 20 percent in its worst 12-month performance since May 2009. Despite the worries, world trade has held up reasonably well so far, with volumes up 3.7 percent in the three months from August to October compared with the same period a year earlier. Growth has moderated but is not yet showing the sharp slowdown anticipated by global equity markets. However, some forward-looking indicators paint a gloomier picture. In Hong Kong, the world’s busiest air freight hub seen as a leading indicator for world trade, air freight volumes fell 0.2 percent in the September-November period compared with a year earlier, the worst 12-month performance since April 2016. China’s economy also appears to have been slowing since the middle of 2018, squeezed by tighter credit, the tariffs imposed by the United States and an increasingly uncertain outlook for exporters. The country’s manufacturers reported a significant decline in business activity in December, with the composite purchasing managers’ index falling to just 49.4, its lowest level since February 2016 and below the 50.0 threshold dividing economic expansion from contraction. Mirroring the slide in global equity markets, Brent crude futures ended the year almost 20 percent lower, the worst 12-month performance since June 2016, and the calendar spread remains in a small but significant contango. Most traders expect the oil market to remain modestly oversupplied in 2019, as worries about the impact of a slowing economy on consumption outweigh the impact of production cuts by OPEC and its allies.
