2018-07-26,"(Reuters) - Shares of First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) fell 6 percent on Thursday after the U.S. solar company reported a surprise quarterly loss and lower-than-expected revenue due to production challenges in its next-generation panel technology. The company also lowered its gross margin forecast for the year, but stood by its earnings outlook. First Solar lost $48.5 million, or 46 cents per share, during the second quarter, compared with earnings of $51.9 million, or 50 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Wall Street analysts had been expecting earnings of 2 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $309 million, far lower than analysts’ average forecast of $503.1 million. First Solar has been moving to ramp up manufacturing of its so-called Series 6 panels at factories in Ohio, Malaysia and Vietnam. The impact of production challenges is expected to be short term, executives said on a conference call with analysts. First Solar has benefited from having a technology that is not subject to the 30 percent tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on solar imports earlier this year. Its panels are made from cadmium telluride, while the tariffs apply only to traditional silicon solar products. The company’s Series 6 product, which is low in cost and more efficient at generating power than its previous products, will be a competitive advantage in the industry, Chief Executive Mark Widmar said on the conference call. He said changes to China’s solar incentive policies had caused “an almost immediate collapse in pricing across the crystalline silicon supply chain” that would lead to greater industry competition but lower solar power prices for customers. First Solar shares were down 6.3 percent at $50.30 in after-hours trading after closing at $53.67 on the Nasdaq.

2018-07-26,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities are studying the possibility of inking a social and environmental deal with Norsk Hydro, after its Alunorte alumina refinery was accused of polluting the environment, signaling a potential warming in relations between the government and the Norwegian aluminum producer.  Norsk Hydro was ordered by Brazilian regulators in February to slash output from Alunorte, the world’s largest alumina refinery, after the company admitted to making unlicensed emissions of untreated water during severe rains that month. The company has, however, denied many parts of prosecutors’ allegations and argued there was no evidence of a lasting environmental impact. The production cut triggered cutbacks at its nearby Albras aluminum plant and a scramble by customers for supplies.  On Thursday, prosecutors for the state of Para, where the plant is located, said a deal was also being considered the state government and federal prosecutors, and would include social and environmental obligations on their part as well as the company’s.  The statement clarified that such a deal would not include a resumption of the halted production and did not provide a timeline for a deal, adding that it still needed to be evaluated by the state government.  Norsk Hydro said this week that the timing for resuming full output at its Alunorte alumina refinery remains uncertain, but that it could be achieved between October and the middle of 2019. Alunorte transforms bauxite to alumina, which is turned into aluminum at huge smelters. Founded in 1995, Alunorte produces 5.8 million metric tonnes of alumina a year, according to the website of Norway’s Norsk Hydro.

2018-07-26,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Teck Resources Ltd TCKb.TO (TECK.N) boosted its production forecasts for copper, zinc and oil on Thursday as the diversified miner reported market-beating profits on the back of higher prices for a range of commodities. Flush with C$2.9 billion ($2.22 billion) in cash and C$7 billion in liquidity, Teck is in “great shape” to fund growth, said Chief Executive Don Lindsay, including big Chilean developments like the $4.8 billion Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 project and $3.5 billion NuevaUnion project. Shares in the base metal miner popped 4.5 percent higher on Thursday, in sharp contrast to broad declines for gold miners that reported lower production and higher costs. With Quebrada Blanca Phase 2 permits expected in August, Teck said it will launch a formal process seeking a development partner, which could contribute some $2 billion for a 30 percent to 40 percent stake. It expects to close a deal in the fourth quarter. Teck also aims to complete a feasibility study on NuevaUnion, a joint venture with Goldcorp (G.TO) to develop neighboring mines, by the third quarter of 2019. With its new Galore Creek project partner, Newmont Mining (NEM.N), Teck plans to update a pre-feasibilty study in three to four years. Newmont agreed to pay $275 million to NovaGold Resources (NG.TO) on Thursday for its 50-percent stake in the copper-gold project.   Asked on a conference call whether oil remains a core business, Linsday said that if the value of its stake in the Fort Hill oil sands is inadequately reflected in its stock in 2020 or 2021, when operations are well established, he would consider a spin-out, sale or partnership.   Separately, family-controlled Teck appointed as its new chairman Dominic Barton, an outsider and global managing partner of consulting firm McKinsey & Co.   Current chair Norman Keevil, who joined Teck in 1962 as vice president of exploration, held the position of CEO from 1981 to 2001, when he became chairman. He retires from that role Oct. 1.          Teck, the world’s second-biggest exporter of steelmaking coal, stuck to its annual production forecast of 26 million to 27 million tonnes, but said production is now expected near the lower end of the range. Third-quarter coal sales are seen rising to 6.8 million tonnes from 6.6 million tonnes in the second quarter, which lagged its 6.7 million tonne forecast due to two rail strikes. The average realized price rose 9.6 percent to $183 a tonne, Teck said.      Adjusted profit of C$1.12 per share beat analyst expectations of C$1.07.

2018-07-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets failed to hold onto four-month highs on Thursday as a record sell-off in Facebook shares offset optimism that the European Union and the United States would settle their differences on trade. Facebook Inc (FB.O), the fifth-largest global stock by market capitalization, collapsed 18.96 percent, the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history, after the social media company’s earnings report showed slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets.  Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg’s fortune took an almost $16 billion hit as the declines wiped more than $120 billion off the company’s value. Executives warned that profits would plummet as the company improves privacy safeguards. That countered optimism over news that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while Europe and the United States negotiated to cut other trade barriers. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.04 percent after earlier in the day rising to the highest level since March 16. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 112.97 points, or 0.44 percent, to 25,527.07, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 8.63 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,837.44 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 80.05 points, or 1.01 percent, to 7,852.19.

Liz Young, senior investment strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said investors’ skepticism of the market is leading them to take a closer look at corporate earnings and other fundamental factors “rather than jumping on the bandwagon and investing in tech stocks. “People need to be careful right now to be in those trendy trades,” she said. Yet the heat has eased somewhat over U.S. and European trade issues, allowing markets to return their attention to central banks and their plans to withdraw stimulus. “Game theory tells us that, in a global trade war, nobody likes to be left out from a deal,” Bank of America Corp analysts wrote in a note. “The U.S.-EU deal... has reduced the risk of an escalating global trade war.” The euro, which initially received the U.S.-EU trade news warmly, fell sharply after European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi reaffirmed a commitment to keep interest rates on hold “through” next summer, even though he saw inflation picking up by the end of the year. The euro EUR= was down 0.69 percent to $1.1647. Concerns about Facebook’s major earnings miss in an otherwise largely positive U.S. corporate results season did little to support bonds, which lost value as yields resumed their climb higher ahead of an expected strong reading on U.S. gross domestic product data on Friday. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR hit a six-week high and last yielded 2.982 percent, up from 2.936 percent late on Wednesday. Progress on trade also helped demand for oil, which is sensitive to economic growth prospects. Crude prices also rose as Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through a strait in the Red Sea after an attack by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled 0.45 percent higher at $69.61 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 rose 0.83 percent to $74.54. Trade is by no means removed from a slate of issues facing investors, with Washington still to finalize an agreement with Europe, while it remains in negotiations with China as well as with Canada and Mexico.

2018-07-26,"WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - Numerous congressional Republicans worried about jobs for constituents back home remained skeptical of President Donald Trump’s trade policies on Thursday, a day after Trump struck a surprise deal with the EU to halt further tariffs and hold talks on opening markets. The Republican lawmakers, who face voters in congressional elections this autumn, spelled out their anxieties in a meeting at the U.S. Capitol with Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, and his economic chief, Larry Kudlow. “Let me tell you, that was a vociferous bunch in there, and I was not the only one,” Representative Andy Barr of Kentucky told reporters after the closed-door gathering. Barr said he had sought to find out from Navarro and Kudlow what the impact of Wednesday’s deal would be on Kentucky’s bourbon industry. Last month, the European Union imposed tariffs on bourbon, American motorcycles, orange juice and other products in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year. Barr said he emphasized to Navarro and Kudlow that 17,500 jobs in Kentucky were connected with the bourbon industry and “these jobs are not less important than the jobs (associated) with the aluminum and steel.” Trump’s pursuit of aggressive measures against U.S. trading partners from China to Europe and Canada has put him at odds with the Republican free-trade orthodoxy of recent years. After Wednesday’s pact with the EU was announced, it was not immediately clear that Trump, who has touted tariffs as key to bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, had abandoned his previous trade policies. Republican lawmakers attending Thursday’s meeting with administration officials said the EU pact was encouraging, but “the devil is in the details,” as Representative Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the Financial Services Committee, said. “And the details here are a little bit sketchy.” Republican lawmakers repeated their previous warnings against the administration levying new tariffs on auto imports, and said they were told that may not happen. Representative Roger Williams, who owns a car dealership in Texas, said dealers were already beginning to cancel orders with manufacturers because they were fearful of tariffs as well as rising interest rates. Another Republican lawmaker, Representative Bill Huizenga of Michigan, said the administration’s trade policies had been “painful and damaging” to auto suppliers in his state that supply both foreign and domestic cars. “Our ag (agriculture) folks are also getting squeezed with tariffs. We are kind of getting it, coming and going, in western Michigan,” Huizenga said.

2018-07-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for the third consecutive day on Thursday after Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through a strait in the Red Sea following an attack on two oil tankers and as trade tensions between the United States and the European Union eased. Brent futures rose 61 cents to settle at $74.54 a barrel, a 0.8 percent gain. The contract earlier touched $74.83 a barrel, highest since July 16. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 31 cents, settling at $69.61, a 0.5 percent gain. After meeting European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the White House on Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the European Union and the United States start talks on cutting other trade barriers. “Certainly it’s positive for the economy and commodities,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “This sort of revives economic prospects that were dimmed from the trade wars that were started.” Brent rose in post-close trading on Wednesday after Saudi Arabia said it was “temporarily halting” oil shipments through the Red Sea shipping lane of Bab al-Mandeb after an attack by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Any move to block the Bab al-Mandeb, which is between the coasts of Yemen and Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea, would virtually halt oil shipments through Egypt’s Suez Canal or the SUMED crude pipeline that link the Red Sea and Mediterranean.  An estimated 4.8 million barrels per day of crude oil and refined products flowed through the Bab al-Mandeb strait in 2016 toward Europe, the United States and Asia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia additionally has the Petroline, also known as the East-West Pipeline, which mainly transports crude from fields clustered in the east to Yanbu for export. That could offset a bottleneck caused by Bab al-Mandeb’s closure. Olivier Jakob from Petromatrix said in a note it remains to be seen whether the Saudi move has an impact on shipping costs. “The passage is not as crucial as the Strait of Hormuz... but restricted flows through it would have an impact not just for crude but also for products due to the longer voyage time,” he said.  U.S. crude oil inventories last week tumbled more than expected to their lowest level since 2015, the EIA said on Wednesday, as U.S. gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell. Traders said Thursday that inventories at the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, have continued to fall. They were forecast to have dropped by 1.1 million barrels through Tuesday, traders said, citing energy information provider Genscape.

2018-07-26,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The project manager of a $4 billion (3.05 billion pounds) Ethiopian dam was found shot dead in his vehicle in Addis Ababa on Thursday, police said, prompting scores of people to take to the streets in the capital and his home city calling for justice. People in the crowds said they believed Simegnew Bekele had been murdered, though there was no immediate confirmation from the authorities, or details of any motive. “We have confirmed that engineer Simegnew Bekele  was shot dead ... He had a bullet wound behind his right ear,” the head of Ethiopia’s Federal Police Commission, Zeinu Jemal, told reporters. Zeinu said a Colt pistol was found in the vehicle in the city’s Meskel Square - a massive road junction and open space usually packed with vehicles and pedestrians during daylight hours. Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was “saddened and utterly shocked” by the death, his chief of staff said in tweet. Simegnew was the public face of the Grand Renaissance Dam project on the River Nile - the centrepiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. Ethiopia has been pushing on with the project in the face of opposition from Egypt which fears it will affect the flow of the Nile, its main source of water. In June, the leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt vowed to iron out their differences peacefully.  Crowds in Addis Ababa marched to the state television station’s headquarters chanting “No to killings” and “Justice for Simegnew”. Hundreds also packed the streets of his birthplace, the northern city of Gondar. “Amongst our requests is the repatriation of his body back to his own city,” said one protester, who only gave his name as Geremew. A Reuters photographer saw blood stains along an arm rest inside his vehicle - a gold Toyota Land Cruiser - before an ambulance took away the body. The dam is currently only half complete, but the government says it is designed to churn out 6,000 megawatts (MW) of power on completion.

2018-07-26,"(Reuters) - Canada’s Cenovus Energy said on Thursday it would hold back on future oil production until pipeline bottlenecks have eased, while some of the country’s top oil and gas producers ramped up output in the recent quarter in response to higher demand. As demand for heavy Canadian crude from U.S. Gulf of Mexico refiners has risen amid a drop in Venezuelan production, the country’s energy infrastructure has failed to keep pace. The surge in production - expected to reach more than half a million barrels per day in 2019 - has led to pipeline constraints, resulting in Canadian heavy crude trading at steep discounts to U.S. light crude as well as producers turning to crude-by-rail options. “Transportation bottlenecks are by far the biggest challenge for Canadian producers, mainly because the pipeline constraints won’t be alleviated until the end of 2019, at the earliest,” said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland.  “It impacts their decisions for future production projects, and it impacts investor sentiment toward the companies,” she added. Shares in Calgary, Alberta-based Cenovus fell as much as 2 percent, but recovered to edge up slightly in afternoon trading. Cenovus’ second-quarter production soared 61 percent to 518,530 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), while rival Suncor Energy’s output rose 22.7 percent to 661,700 boe/d. “We do not want to expand our oil sands production until we are confident about transportation capacity,” Cenovus Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix told analysts. Cenovus said it is beginning to see increased activity across its rail-loading facilities as pipelines operate at full capacity. Calgary-based rival Husky Energy, however, reported a 7.5 percent drop in total production as it increased focus on its refining business to take advantage of widening heavy crude price differentials. “The physical integration of our upstream and downstream businesses, including our committed pipeline capacity, shielded us from location and quality differentials,” Husky Chief Executive Officer Rob Peabody said.  Husky posted a second-quarter profit of C$448 million compared to a loss of C$93 million a year ago. Suncor’s net income more than doubled to C$972 million ($745.6 million), or 60 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from C$435 million, or 26 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.

2018-07-26,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin raised the subject of a nuclear deal at a private meeting with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa at the BRICS summit in Johannesburg, but his host said Pretoria could not sign such a deal for now. Russian state firm Rosatom was one of the front runners for a project to dramatically increase South Africa’s nuclear power-generating capacity championed by former president Jacob Zuma. Ramaphosa has put nuclear expansion on the back burner since taking office in February, saying it is too expensive, and has focused instead on pledges to revive the economy and crack down on corruption. “While we remain committed to an energy mix that includes nuclear, South Africa is not yet at the point where it is able to sign on the dotted line,” Ramaphosa’s spokeswoman Khusela Diko said about the meeting between Putin and Ramaphosa. Hours earlier, one of the top six officials in South Africa’s ruling African National Congress (ANC) had said that Pretoria would not rush into major nuclear investments but that it was still open to future deals with Russia. “Once we are clear that this is affordable for us to do, we are open for business including with Russia,” ANC Treasurer General Paul Mashatile said. He spoke on the sidelines of a three-day BRICS summit attended by the leaders of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. “I think the approach we will take is to avoid the Big Bang approach. The initial intervention was that we would do close to 10,000 megawatts (MW). ... It’s unaffordable,” he said. Mashatile also said the ANC wanted greater private investment in struggling state-owned power utility Eskom, which swung to a loss for the year to end-March. Russia wants to turn nuclear energy into a major export industry. It has signed agreements with African countries with no nuclear tradition, including Rwanda and Zambia, and is set to build a large nuclear plant in Egypt. Rosatom is “still interested” in helping South Africa expand its nuclear capacity, a Rosatom executive told Reuters.  “If there is a place for nuclear energy in the energy mix, we are happy to cooperate. We are happy to follow each and every procedure that will be communicated to us by the South African government,” said Dmitry Shornikov, Rosatom’s chief executive for central and southern Africa. Rosatom on Thursday signed a separate agreement with South African state nuclear firm Necsa to explore joint production of nuclear medicines and other ways of harnessing nuclear technology, a statement from the two firms showed. The agreement, which is non-binding, is a further sign that Rosatom is keen to cement its position on the African continent. South Africa currently operates Africa’s only nuclear power plant, with an installed capacity of around 1,900 MW.

2018-07-26,"(Adds background) July 26 (Reuters) - EQT Corp said Thursday it delayed the targeted completion of its $3.5-$3.7 billion Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia to the first quarter 2019 from late 2018. Analysts have said the project was in danger of being delayed due in part to legal challenges by environmental and other groups to a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, among other things. Mountain Valley is one of several big pipelines expected to enter service over the next year to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The 303-mile (488-kilometer) pipeline is designed to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas to meet growing demand for the fuel for power generation and other uses in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. Mountain Valley is owned by units of EQT, NextEra Energy Inc , Consolidated Edison Inc, AlatGas Ltd and RGC Resources Inc. EQT Midstream Partners LP will operate the pipeline and owns a significant interest in the venture. In April, the companies said they planned to spend about $350 million to $500 million to extend the pipe about 70 miles from Virginia into North Carolina by the fourth quarter of 2020.

2018-07-26,"DUBAI, July 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two crude tankers, underscoring risks caused by the conflict in the world’s top oil exporting region. Iran, in its row with the United States over sanctions, has also threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, the other major strategic shipping route for oil from the region and the main route for Iranian crude exports. Below are facts about region’s shipping routes: BAB AL-MANDEB Any move to block the Bab al-Mandeb, the narrow waterway between the coasts of Yemen and Africa at the southern end of the Red Sea, would virtually halt oil shipments through Egypt’s Suez Canal or the SUMED crude pipeline that link the Red Sea and Mediterranean. The SUMED pipeline, with capacity for 2.34 million bpd, runs roughly parallel to the Suez Canal and can be used by oil tankers that cannot navigate the canal waterway. An estimated 4.8 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and refined petroleum products flowed through the strait in 2016 to Europe, the United States and Asia, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Reuters data shows Saudi crude exports through Bab al-Mandeb, which is about 18 miles (29 km) wide at its narrowest point between Djibouti’s coast and the Yemeni mainland, are estimated to be 500,000-700,000 bpd. Closing the strait, which has a shipping channel just two miles (3.2 km) wide, would force oil and liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers around the southern tip of Africa, extending the distance for a vessel travelling between Saudi Arabia and the United States by 2,700 miles (4,300 km). This would add weeks to the journey time and extra costs, although Saudi Arabia could export its crude along that route on non-Saudi vessels. About 18.5 million bpd of oil or more than 30 percent of seaborne traded crude was transported in 2016 through the Strait of Hormuz, making the waterway at the southern end of the Gulf the most important oil transit channel in the world, according to U.S. EIA figures. The strait, which is about 33 miles (54 km) wide at its narrowest point, separates the Arabian Peninsula from Iran. Most of the crude exported from Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq must slip through a four mile (6.4 km) wide channel between the Omani and Iranian coasts. More than 85 percent of the crude oil that moves through it is sent to Asia, mainly Japan, India, South Korea and China. In addition, LNG tankers from Qatar, the world’s biggest LNG exporter, pass through the strait. The U.S. Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain and responsible for an area that includes the Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman and parts of the Indian Ocean, has said it would not allow any disruption of traffic through the strait. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have pipelines that can transport their crude without passing through the strait. The UAE can ship crude from it Indian Ocean coastline, while Saudi Arabia’s alternative route runs to its Red Sea port of Yanbu. Most oil exports from Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest crude exporter which produces about 10 million bpd, are transported by ship through the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, the East-West Pipeline, known as Petroline, mainly transports crude from the kingdom’s eastern fields to Yanbu, which lies north of Bab al-Mandeb so shipments could avoid that Red Sea shipping chokepoint. The Petroline has capacity to transport about 5 million bpd of the kingdom’s oil exports that can reach 8 million bpd. Saudi Arabia has a parallel 290,000 bpd Abqaiq-Yanbu natural gas liquids (NGL) pipeline linking gas processing plants in the east with NGL export facilities at Yanbu. It also provides only a partial alternative to Saudi shipments of NGL from the Gulf. State oil giant Saudi Aramco plans to launch its overhauled Muajjiz oil terminal on the Red Sea this year, lifting its total loading and export capacity to as much as 15 million bpd. Located on the Red Sea, Muajjiz had been used as an export terminal for Iraqi crude through the Iraqi Pipeline in Saudi Arabia (IPSA), but it has not carried Iraqi crude since Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. Other OPEC members in the region, Iran, the UAE, Kuwait and Qatar, rely almost entirely on the Strait of Hormuz. A Kuwaiti official said 90 percent of Kuwaiti oil shipments go to Asia and do not pass through Bab al-Mandeb. The remaining 10 percent of its shipments passing through the Red Sea chokepoint were mostly refined products. The UAE has built a new pipeline, the Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline with a capacity of 1.5 million bpd, to carry the bulk of its production to Fujairah, a bunkering hub and oil terminal on the Indian Ocean, bypassing the Strait of Hormuz. Qatar, a small crude exporter, shipped about 3.7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) per year of LNG through the Strait of Hormuz in 2013, according to BP Statistics. Nearly 80 percent of Iraq’s crude is exported through Gulf ports and through the Strait of Hormuz. Most of it heads to Asia. Iran’s total reliance on crude exports through the Strait of Hormuz is one of the reasons why it is unlikely to be blocked.

2018-07-26,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services provider Patterson-UTI Energy Inc (PTEN.O) fell on Thursday after the company reported weaker-than-expected results in its pressure pumping business, stoking investor concerns that the market is over supplied.  Patterson said it would temporarily stop deploying new pressure pumping fleets to hydraulically fracture oil and gas wells due to oversupply of such gear. The company pointed to a sharp uptick in deployment by rivals and a slowdown in spending by some exploration and production companies.  The pressure pumping business in North America had been expanding as a result of growing U.S. shale production, which in July hit 7.3 million barrels per day, according to government estimates. However, pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin and additions to hydraulic fracturing fleets earlier this year have threatened to undermine some of those gains.  Patterson’s shares fell as much as 7 percent shortly after the market opened, hitting a two-and-a-half-year low. They later rebounded, trading around $16.03 at 11:45 a.m. ET (1545 GMT), off about 1 percent. “Patterson-UTI’s pressure pumping results in the second quarter will likely add to investor concerns around a slowing of growth trajectory of the U.S. pressure pumping market,” James West, a senior managing director for Evercore ISI, wrote in a note on Thursday. Patterson-UTI’s decision to halt additions comes after leading pressure pumping provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) saw its shares plummet more than 8 percent this week on a forecast of moderating growth in the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. shale field.  Patterson’s expects pressure pumping revenue for the third quarter to decline by 5 percent, while gross margins in that business to fall 7.5 percent, the company said.  It said oversupply issues were not limited to the Permian Basin.  “It’s disappointing to hear our peers are continuing to add additional horsepower,” one executive said on the call with analysts. “It’s made it difficult for us to fill the white space in our calendar when we had delays. Normally we’d be able to shift some spreads and do some fracks for other companies,” the executive added.

2018-07-26,"(Adds company statement, paragraphs 3-4) HOUSTON, July 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. unit of Brazilian state-run company Petrobras agreed to pay $3.5 million to settle a lawsuit over alleged toxic emissions from its Pasadena, Texas, oil refinery, the company said. The settlement, which is subject to approval by a federal judge, comes in the midst of the company’s efforts to sell the refinery. “Pasadena Refining is confident that the settlement agreement with Environment Texas and Sierra Club is in the best interest of all parties, and will provide a direct benefit to our community,” Petrobas said in a statement. “Through this agreement, we commit to further improvements for the facility and its operations, both of which are part of our objectives.” Under the terms of the agreement, Petrobras subsidiary Pasadena Refining System Inc (PRSI) will pay $3.175 million to Houston-area municipal governments and school districts to convert fossil-fuel-burning vehicles to electric or hybrid models, according to the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter and Environment Texas. The 112,229-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery also will pay a $350,000 civil penalty to the U.S. government for releasing sulfur dioxide and other pollutants in excess of permitted levels and install new pollution control equipment at the refinery, according to the environmental groups. The two organizations brought the lawsuit under a provision of the U.S. Clean Air Act that allows citizens to bring enforcement actions in federal court against polluters. “We brought this suit to address the repeated mechanical breakdowns and operational flaws that have plagued the Pasadena refinery for years,” said Neil Carman, clean air program director for Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter. “These so-called ‘emission events’ have released millions of pounds of illegal air pollution into surrounding neighborhoods.” Petrobras in February put the refinery up for sale in a two-step process that began with a non-binding phase to allow potential buyers to look over the plant. In May, Petrobras began the binding phase of the sale with qualified partners receiving strict instructions on how to proceed with due diligence. That phase is still under way. Petrobras purchased half the refinery in 2006 and by 2012 was its sole owner, having sunk more than $1 billion into the plant. The purchase of the refinery was a target of the so-called Car Wash corruption investigation by Brazilian authorities. Brazilian audit court TCU said the refinery deal caused losses of more than $580 million to the company.

2018-07-26,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the Red Sea’s Bab al-Mandeb strait, one of the world’s most important tanker routes, after Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthis attacked two ships in the waterway. Brent futures rose 19 cents to $74.12 a barrel by 1305 GMT, extending their rally into a third day but slipping from a 10-day high in earlier trading.  Graphic - Saudi Arabia issues temporary halt on shipments of its crude through Red Sea strait: reut.rs/2LF3NCD Saudi Arabia and arch-foe Iran have been locked in a three-year proxy war in Yemen, which lies on one side of the Bab al-Mandeb strait at the southern mouth of the sea, one of the most important trade routes for oil tankers heading from the Middle East to Europe.  The Houthis, who have previously threatened to block the strait, said on Thursday that they had the naval capability to hit Saudi ports and other Red Sea targets. Iran has threatened to block another strategic shipping route, the Strait of Hormuz.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers in the Red Sea on Wednesday, one of which sustained minimal damage. “Saudi Arabia is temporarily halting all oil shipments through Bab al-Mandeb strait immediately until the situation becomes clearer and the maritime transit through Bab al-Mandeb is safe,” he said. It was not clear if a Saudi-led military coalition would take additional security measures or impose further restrictions on imports to Yemen, which is struggling with the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. A senior oil source said Saudi Arabia had already beefed up oil security and that all crude vessels in the area are accompanied by security ships.  Saudi crude exports through Bab al-Mandeb are estimated at around 500,000-700,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to analysts and Reuters data. Most Gulf oil exports that transit the Suez Canal and SUMED Pipeline pass through the strait.   The chairman of the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company said the country was considering whether to follow suit.  The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Quds force, Qassem Soleimani, criticised the U.S. role in the Red Sea. “The Red Sea, which was secure, is no longer secure with the American presence ... (U.S. President Donald) Trump should know that we are nation of martyrdom and that we await him,” Soleimani was quoted as saying on Thursday.  Industry and shipping sources said the suspension was unlikely to impact Saudi crude supplies to Asia, but could add shipping costs to Saudi vessels heading to Europe and the United States due to a longer transit. Traders said the suspension order was only for Saudi-owned vessels, so state-owned Saudi Aramco could still charter foreign ships to move its crude. Saudi Arabia also has a pipeline route to the city of Yanbu on the Red Sea keeping Europe and North America well supplied — the 5-million-bpd Petroline. The world’s largest oil exporter has kept its crude shipments flowing during previous regional conflicts, including the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war when the two sides sought to disrupt each other’s oil exports in what was known as the Tanker War. The OPEC heavyweight, a key U.S. ally, has led a pact among oil producers to boost output to cool the market after Trump imposed sanctions on Iran and criticised OPEC for high  prices. Saudi state media reported shortly after Falih’s announcement that the kingdom’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman chaired a meeting of the Political and Security Affairs Council but did not mention what topics were discussed. Saudi Arabia leads a coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states which intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government in exile and thwart what Riyadh sees as Tehran’s expansionist ambitions in the region. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates backed Trump’s decision to quit a nuclear deal with Iran. They accuse Iran of supplying the Houthis with weapons including missiles, which the group and Tehran deny. The latest attack on Saudi oil tankers could strengthen the Arab states’ position ahead of possible U.N.-sponsored peace talks between Yemen’s warring parties, which aim to avoid an all-out assault on the country’s main port city of Hodeidah. The Western-backed military alliance launched an offensive on June 12 to wrest Hodeidah from the Houthis in a bid to cut off the primary supply line of the movement, which holds the most populated areas of Yemen including the capital Sanaa.  But the alliance did not make major gains and on July 1 it halted operations to give the United Nations a chance to resolve the situation in Hodeidah and the wider conflict which has killed more than 10,000 people. “The only way forward is to get Hodeidah. What we are planning to do is give diplomacy every possible chance to secure that,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said in London.  The United Nations fears that cutting off Hodeidah may trigger a famine in Yemen, where around 8.4 million people are believed to be on the verge of starvation. The United Nations says the Houthis have offered to hand over management of the port to the world body, but the Saudi-led coalition says that the Houthis must quit the western coast. One of the coalition’s main justifications for intervening in Yemen was to protect shipping routes such as the Red Sea. It has said it foiled previous attacks there in April and May. The Bab al-Mandeb strait is only 18 miles (29 km) wide,  making hundreds of ships potentially an easy target. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said an estimated 4.8 million bpd of crude oil and products flowed through it in 2016.

2018-07-26,"LONDON, July 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The effects of climate change mean the world can expect higher temperatures and more frequent heat waves, climate experts have warned, with poor communities likely to be worst affected. Heat is neglected because it is both an invisible and hard-to-document disaster that claims lives largely behind closed doors, they said, and because hot weather does not strike many people as a serious threat. The warning comes as hot weather has swept the northern hemisphere. Britain has sweltered in a prolonged heat wave, with temperatures set to test national records, the country’s Meteorological Office said. “We will have to get used to these kinds of summers,” said Friederike Otto, deputy director at the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. “There is no doubt that there is a link to climate change. We need to take heat waves seriously around the world as something that we need to adapt to,” Otto told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Fires have also caused devastation in Greece, Sweden and the United States. In Greece, rescuers are searching scorched land and the coastline for survivors three days after a wildfire destroyed a village outside Athens killing at least 82 people. The past three years were the hottest on record, the United Nations’ World Meteorological Organization said in March. The World Health Organization says heat stress, linked to climate change, is likely to cause 38,000 extra deaths a year worldwide between 2030 and 2050. Two weeks into Japan’s blistering heat wave, at least 80 people have died and thousands have been rushed to emergency rooms, as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to avoid temperatures exceeding 40 degrees Celsius (104°F) in some areas. In a heat wave in May, more than 60 people died in Karachi, Pakistan, when the temperature rose above 40C (104F). “Heat waves are becoming more frequent, and that is likely due to climate change because the global temperature is rising,” Sven Harmeling, head of climate change and resilience policy at aid group CARE International, said by phone. He said climate change was altering weather patterns, and “we have to prepare for more of these consequences”. Stanford University researchers on Monday said hotter weather was linked to increases in suicides, after examining decades worth of temperature data against suicide rates in U.S. counties and Mexican municipalities, some dating back to the 1960s. The report projected that if global warming were not capped by 2050, there could be at least an additional 21,000 suicides in the U.S. and Mexico alone. In 2015, countries signing the Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting a rise in average world surface temperatures to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times, while “pursuing efforts” to limit rising temperatures to 1.5C (2.7F). U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to pull out of the accord, which would make his country the only one to do so. Nearly one in three people around the world are already exposed to deadly heat waves, and that will rise to nearly half of people by 2100 even if the world moves aggressively to cut climate-changing emissions, a University of Hawaii study found in 2017. But poorer communities will suffer the most, said Frank Rijsberman, head of the Global Green Growth Institute, which helps developing countries adopt clean energy to boost their economies and reduce carbon emissions. “In developed countries, we have resources, we have money, we have systems, we can manage. But in developing countries, where resilience is very low, people are hit much harder,” he said in an interview. About 1.1 billion people in Asia, Africa and Latin America are at risk from a lack of air conditioning to keep them cool as global warming brings more high temperatures, the non-profit Sustainable Energy for All said in a study last week. “The most vulnerable in society will be most affected because those are the people who do not have the air-conditioned offices to go to, the people who have to work outside to make a living,” said Otto. ""They will be hit very hard by these increasing risks and heat waves,"" she said. (Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls. Editing by Robert Carmichael.

Facebook, the fifth-largest U.S. stock by market capitalization, collapsed 19.35 percent after the social media company after earnings showed slowing usage in the biggest advertising markets. Executives warned profits would plummet as the company improves privacy safeguards. That countered optimism over news that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to refrain from imposing car tariffs while Europe and the U.S. negotiated to cut other trade barriers. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained just 0.05 percent after earlier rising to its highest since March 16. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 136.92 points, or 0.54 percent, to 25,551.02, the S&P 500 lost 5.15 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,840.92 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 64.68 points, or 0.82 percent, to 7,867.56. “It’s going to be hard for markets today with such a massive market cap stock down so much,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird & Co. “It is possible that easing tensions could outweigh something like Facebook, because that has been the biggest concern of markets for weeks and Facebook is a one-off negative event.” Concerns about Facebook’s major earnings miss in an otherwise largely positive U.S. corporate results season did little to support bonds, which lost value as yields resumed their climb higher. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 2.9542 percent, from 2.936 percent late on Wednesday. Trade is by no means removed from a slate of issues facing investors, with the U.S. still to finalise an agreement with Europe, while it remains in negotiations with China as well as with Canada and Mexico. China’s blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. Qualcomm Inc dropped its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors after a deadline for securing Chinese regulatory approval passed. The breakdown of the deal leaves “investors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,” Citi analysts told clients. Still, the heat has eased somewhat, over U.S. and European trade issues. “The lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development. We’ve not seen a lot of actual measures implemented but it should lift the confidence of manufacturers,” said Royal Bank of Canada European economist Cathal Kennedy. That allowed markets to return their attention to central banks and their plans to withdraw stimulus. The euro, which initially received the U.S.-EU trade news warmly, sharply lost ground after European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi reaffirmed a commitment to keep interest rates on hold “through” next summer, even though he saw inflation picking up by the end of the year. The dollar index rose 0.31 percent, with the euro down 0.62 percent to $1.1655. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-07-26,"(Updates quotes after speech, adds context) By William James LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is ready to deploy more troops across the Middle East to counter its foes as it believes it can no longer rely on Western allies like the United States and Britain, UAE minister Anwar Gargash said on Thursday. Filling the vacuum left by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, the UAE has extended its influence by deploying troops and cash across the Middle East and Africa, where it has built up local armies and set up military bases. “In this current international system, it is no longer ‘write a cheque and someone is going to come and secure the stability in the region.’ You have to do some of the burden-sharing,” Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said in a speech in London. The UAE has been fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthis in Yemen for more than three years, and backed forces opposed to political Islam in Libya and elsewhere. With its closest ally Saudi Arabia, the UAE has been locked in a power struggle with their arch-rival Iran that has played out across the region and taken on a sectarian dimension. Each accuses the other of creating instability in the region. Gargash said he was concerned about divergence between Western powers over the future of relations with Iran. “As we move forward, we do really hope that the current American effort to bring about a change in Iranian approach is successful. We are worried a little bit about what is seen as a divergence of view between Europe and the United States over Iran,” he said at the Policy Exchange think tank event. UAE sees the more forceful approach towards Iran taken by the United States as a more effective means of curbing what it sees as Iran’s malign activity and development of ballistic missiles than European attempts to rescue a 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In May U.S.President Donald Trump withdrew from the multinational agreement that lifted sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme, calling it a “horrible deal”. Gargash also said UAE was engaging in a mediation process with Somalia, whose coastline sits close to key shipping routes and across the water from Yemen, following a row over the seizure of several million dollars from a UAE civilian aircraft at Mogadishu airport. “There are attempts currently to mediate between us and Somalia,” he said. “We’d like to continue to do our work, but we have made it very clear that we have been wronged with regards to how we were treated with the shipment of nine-point-something million dollars ... we are asking for an apology for that.” (Reporting by William James; additional reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi in DUBAI; editing by Stephen Powell)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/yemen-security-britain/update-1-uae-ready-to-take-on-greater-security-burden-in-middle-east-minister-idUKL5N1UM6RZ,26 Jul 2018,"The United Arab Emirates is

2018-07-26,"FRANKFURT/LONDON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s plan for “vast amounts” of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) to be sold to the European Union after trade talks with its top representative faces a reality test. After a meeting at the White House with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday, Trump said the EU would also buy more U.S. soybeans and work with Washington to cut other trade barriers to zero. “European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately. Also, they will be buying vast amounts of LNG!,” Trump wrote in a Tweet. Juncker said the EU would build more terminals to handle America’s LNG. It appeared that a major LNG deal between the trading partners had been struck.  In reality, three-quarters of Europe’s existing import facilities lie empty while demand for U.S. LNG on the continent remains limited.  The most lucrative markets for U.S. LNG are in South and Central America, India and the Far East, with Europe near the bottom of the pile given its relatively low prices and ample supplies of gas via pipelines from Russia and Norway. (For a graphic on 'The most profitable export destinations for U.S. LNG' click reut.rs/2mNaXql) Global gas price signals determine LNG trade flows, Royal Dutch Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said on Thursday.  “Will U.S. LNG reach Europe? Yes, but only if there is an arbitrage opportunity that makes sense,” he said. Politicians have little sway over this. The EU applies zero tariffs on U.S. LNG imports, so cutting them is not an option to boost trade in any future U.S.-EU talks. Europe’s declining domestic production of gas from the North Sea, Netherlands, Germany and Norway leaves a growing gap for Russia and potential LNG suppliers in the United States to exploit.  EU gas production will halve by 2040, the International Energy Agency says.  By then, 84 percent of gas will be imported against 71 percent 2016, it says, although it could be less if green energy expands faster and energy efficiency gains reduce the need for gas. Trump told reporters on Wednesday that Europe would be a massive buyer of LNG to diversify its energy supply - “And we have plenty of it.”  A number of European companies have already announced plans to buy LNG from a new wave of planned U.S. projects. Portugal’s Galp, Italy’s Edison, Britain’s BP and Royal Dutch Shell are all lining up to lift LNG from Venture Global’s planned Calcasieu Pass project in Louisiana.  But supply from these and other projects will not be ready for years and even then there is no guarantee it will come to Europe in meaningful quantities if more lucrative markets, such as China, emerge.  The benefit of lifting supplies from the U.S. is that a buyer can divert shipments to the highest bidder anywhere in the world without needing the approval of the seller.  Thomas Kusterer, chief financial officer for German utility EnBW (EBKG.DE), said on Thursday that he would consider purchasing U.S. LNG if it became cheaper than other sources. Having more LNG options will help Europe avoid being overcharged by Russia, analysts say. “LNG is a valuable option for Europe, it can create negotiating power,” said Hanns Koenig of Berlin-based Aurora Energy Research.

2018-07-26,"(Adds Mnuchin comments) WASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials will immediately focus on resolving steel and aluminum tariff issues with the European Union, while a broader trade agreement between the parties likely rolls out in stages over the next year, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday. In an interview on CNBC, Mnuchin said the United States was focused on its European partners, although there continued to be quiet conversations with China over trade. “If they’re willing to make serious changes just as the EU did yesterday, we’ll negotiate with China any time,” he told reporters at the White House following his television interview. “We’re very focused on the EU,” he told CNBC. On Wednesday, the European Union reportedly offered concessions on trade during talks at the White House between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Mnuchin told CNBC that U.S. and European officials had an agreement in principal and planned to move forward to “turn it into a real agreement,” but gave few details. He said officials from both sides would immediately focus on steel and aluminum tariffs first “so that there can be no tariffs in either direction,” and he expected that issue to be resolved “very quickly.” “We have an outline ... in agriculture, in chemicals, in medical devices, in industrial LNG. So we’re going to make a lot of progress,” he told reporters later. Threatened U.S. auto tariffs would be put on hold while overall talks with the EU are ongoing, Mnuchin said. On the NAFTA talks with Mexico and Canada, Mnuchin said he was “hopeful that we’ll have an agreement in principal in the near future.” “Whether it’s one deal or two deals, so long as we get the right agreement, we’re indifferent,” he told CNBC, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement.

2018-07-26,"* Equinor Q2 adj EBIT at $4.3 bln vs $3 bln in Q2 2017 * Total production increases helped by U.S. output * Net debt ratio increases to 27.2 pct in Q2 from 25.1 pct * Equinor CFO says too early to decide on share buybacks * Graphic: reut.rs/2JWYNVk (Adds graphics) By Nerijus Adomaitis and Ole Petter Skonnord OSLO, July 26 (Reuters) - Norwegian oil and gas firm Equinor said on Thursday second-quarter adjusted operating income rose from a year ago but missed forecasts due to higher maintenance costs at its Norwegian fields. The company formerly known as Statoil also said it was too early to follow peers, such as Shell and Total , with share buyback programmes as it had investment plans to fund. “We did not feel it was natural in the second quarter (to launch buybacks) because we have big projects and increased working capital. We need to come back to the question at a later point,” Chief Financial Officer Hans Jakob Hegge told Reuters. Due to acquisitions and working capital increase, the company’s net debt ratio rose to 27.2 percent in the second-quarter from 25.1 percent in the first quarter. Equinor’s executives previously said their near-term priority was to reduce gearing before launching any buybacks. The company offered a quarterly dividend of $0.23 per share as forecast and has previously said it expected to maintain that in the third quarter. Some analysts expect Equinor to pay more to its shareholders in the longer-term. “Despite some headwinds into 2018, we expect to see the company generate significant cash flow growth over 2019-21, which suggests the potential for increased returns to shareholders over the next few years,” Biraj Borkhataria at RBC Capital Markets said in a note. Equinor’s adjusted earnings before interest and taxes rose to $4.3 billion in the second quarter from $3 billion a year ago, missing a forecast for $4.6 billion in a Reuters poll. Earnings from the biggest of the company’s three divisions, the Norwegian exploration and production, were affected by “higher turnaround activity”, Equinor said. New fields, higher maintenance work and quarter-specific items contributed to an increase in costs, the company added. Chief Financial Officer Hans Jakob Hegge said higher operational costs were expected at some Norwegian fields and from suppliers in the United States, but he said Equinor still had “good control on costs”. “This underlines the importance of continued cost focus across the organisation,” Chief Executive Eldar Saetre said in a statement. The Norwegian company has maintained its guidance on capital spending and production growth, but it now sees a bigger impact on its full-year production due to higher maintenance. Equinor expected maintenance work to pull down output by 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for 2018, instead of the 30,000 boepd it previously saw. Equinor’s equity production stood at 2 million boepd in the second quarter, up 1.6 percent from the same quarter a year ago. The increase was underpinned by higher output in the United States, which was once a struggling operation for the company but has now turned around.

2018-07-26,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2JVAFSZ By John Kemp LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - World trade volumes continued to rise in May, but the rate of growth is decelerating, consistent with other signs that the global economic expansion is moving into a slower phase. Trade volumes rose by 0.4 percent in May compared with April, according to the latest data from the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (“World Trade Monitor”, CPB, July 25). But volumes in the three months from March to May were just 3.1 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier, a marked slowdown from year-on-year growth of over 5 percent in late 2017 and early 2018. The fastest growth in May was reported in China, Asia, the Middle East and the United States, with volumes in most other regions actually declining during the month. Volumes on the trans-Pacific routes are likely to have been flattered by the race to beat tariffs announced by the United States and China, which led to an upsurge in container arrivals in May and June. The impact will probably prove temporary and is likely to unwind in the second half of the year as the tariffs go into effect and the supply chain digests higher than normal inventories after stocking up. In much of the rest of the world the picture is one of moderating and increasingly unbalanced growth, after the strong synchronised upturn in 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2JVAFSZ). The trade figures are consistent with leading indicators compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which show the rate of economic growth peaking in the second half of 2017. The OECD’s composite indicators show growth accelerating in the United States, China and India in the early months of this year but losing momentum in other countries. Signs of a moderation in growth are also evident in South Korea’s KOSPI share index, often seen as a leading indicator for world trade growth given the country’s heavy export orientation. Over the last two decades, the KOPSI 100 share index has been closely correlated with world trade volumes as measured by the Netherlands government statistics. The 100-share index peaked at the end of 2017 and has been steadily sliding throughout the first seven months of 2018. KOSPI was up 32 percent in the 12 months to October 2017, but the annual comparisons have gradually become less favourable and annual growth turned negative in June and July. If KOSPI remains a good early warning indicator, global trade growth seems likely to slow further over the next few months.

2018-07-26,"(Adds trade ministry comment) By Fergus Jensen and Bernadette Christina Munthe JAKARTA, July 26 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s trade ministry has decided to postpone for six months the application of rules requiring coal and crude palm oil export shipments to use Indonesian insurance, ministry officials said. Indonesia is the world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal and palm oil. The decision is the second time the rules, issued in October and due to come into effect on Aug. 1, have been postponed. The rules were part of trade regulations issued in October that were intended to boost the role of the archipelago’s shipping industry and save foreign currency, part of which were postponed to 2020. The insurance rules would be “postponed to Feb. 1, 2019” Trade Ministry spokeswoman Fajarini Puntodewi told Reuters by text message. The decision was announced to industry representatives at a brief meeting earlier on Thursday, Indonesian Coal Mining Association (ICMA) Executive Director Hendra Sinadia told Reuters. “Everybody is very anxious,” Sinadia said, referring to coal buyers and exporters confused about how they could put the rules into practice for shipments sold on a free-on-board (FOB) basis, on which the vast majority of Indonesia’s coal exports are sent. Under FOB terms insurance is the responsibility of the buyer, Sinadia noted. Ido Hotna Hutabarat, chief executive of coal miner Bumi Resources unit PT Arutmin Indonesia, said the rules were unworkable. “This cannot be carried out for FOB sales because we don’t have rights to control the buyer,” he said, adding that FOB shipping terms were preferable as they were lower risk. Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI) Executive Director Mukti Sardjono said on Wednesday GAPKI would discuss how to implement the rules with the Trade Ministry. “We hope the implementation of this regulation won’t be a disincentive for exports,” he said. Dody Dalimunthe, executive director of the Association of General Insurance Companies of Indonesia (AAUI), said there were 73 Indonesian insurance firms that cover coal and CPO shipping. “And many companies already use this insurance,” he said. Earlier, ICMA Chairman Pandu Sjahrir said diplomats from several countries including Japan had asked the trade ministry for a transition period for the insurance rules to come into effect. The Japanese embassy did not respond to a written request for comment. Indonesia could produce up to 485 million tonnes of coal this year, around three-quarters of which would be exported, the government said in January. Indonesia’s palm oil exports jumped 23 percent in 2017 to 31 million tonnes.

2018-07-26,"(Adds IMF comment) By Natalia Zinets KIEV, July 26 (Reuters) - Ukraine on Thursday extended a freeze on gas prices until at least Sept. 1, reducing its prospects of securing more money from the International Monetary Fund needed to keep its war-battered economy on a stable footing. Ukraine must raise gas prices to market levels in order to qualify for more aid under a $17.5 billion IMF programme. It initially agreed to raise prices under a jointly agreed formula but has since postponed price rises a number of times. The government may shy away from potentially unpopular measures like gas price hikes with presidential and parliamentary elections due next year. Ukraine has received no IMF money since April 2017 due to a slowdown in reforms, putting the country in a more financially precarious position as it must repay around $15 billion of foreign currency debt in the next two years. The government said talks with the IMF were continuing but signalled its reluctance to meet the fund’s terms. “Negotiations are ongoing,” the government said in a statement. “The government of Ukraine stresses that the price of gas is too sensitive a topic to approach in a purely mathematical way.” Ukraine earlier in July fulfilled another of the IMF’s conditions by passing legislation to set up a special court to try corruption cases, but that on its own is unlikely to lead to more IMF disbursements. Asked for comment on Thursday’s decision, an IMF spokesman repeated that Ukraine had fulfilled its obligations on the corruption court and “discussions on other outstanding issues, including gas prices and the government budget, are ongoing”. The country’s economy crashed following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of separatist fighting in the Donbass region. Ukraine plans to ramp up its borrowing in order to manage its debts and reduce its sensitivity to exchange rates, which arises from much of its debt being dollar-denominated, the finance minister told Reuters on Monday.

2018-07-26,"(Recasts, adds sources, details) MILAN, July 26 (Reuters) - Infrastructure fund F2i is set to become Europe’s third largest solar power operator with the purchase of private equity firm Terra Firma’s Italian solar portfolio. The companies did not give details on the price but two sources close to the matter said the 1.3 billion euro enterprise value included debt of around 700 million euros. The deal, expected to close after summer, is Italy’s largest solar energy sale in a fragmented industry under pressure to consolidate after the end of generous state subsidies. Since Terra Firma bought its RTR portfolio in 2011 the business has more than doubled its production capacity to 334 megawatts spread over 134 production sites. “The noteworthy operating and financial efficiencies of scale achieved will also make (F2i) one of the continent’s most efficient operators,” CEO Renato Ravanelli said. F2i, which is partly owned by state lender CDP, has a joint venture with Europe’s biggest utility Enel operating 395 MW of capacity in Italy. F2i and Enel had originally placed a joint bid for the RTR portfolio but Enel pulled out. “In recent weeks, F2i has expressed its intention to acquire the remaining 50 percent of the company currently held by Enel,” F2i said.

2018-07-26,"* U.S. agrees to refrain from car tariffs on EU for now * World stock index hits highest since mid-March * European auto sector jumps 2 pct, European stocks up * Chinese stocks still suffer as concerns persist * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Abhinav Ramnarayan and Tommy Wilkes LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - European equities powered higher on Thursday, pushing world stocks to new four-month highs after the European Union and the United States agreed to negotiate on trade, easing fears of a transatlantic trade war. However, concerns over the slowing pace of world economic growth, the prospect of escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade spat and some lacklustre company earnings reports prevented markets from rallying further, and Wall Street looked set for a weaker session. In what the EU chief called a “major concession,” U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers. European gains were led by the continent’s auto sector, which was up more than two percent, with Germany’s export-reliant and auto-heavy index up 1.5 percent. Auto shares, highly vulnerable to tariff wars, have performed poorly this year, with earnings forecasts downgraded in recent months. Gains elsewhere were more subdued and a pan-European stock index rose 0.5 percent while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up a quarter percent to the highest since March 16. “The lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development. We’ve not seen a lot of actual measures implemented but it should lift the confidence of manufacturers,” said RBC European economist Cathal Kennedy. “The feedthrough should come through in the manufacturing sector and confidence indicators in the coming months.” The equity gains pushed up government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe, with Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, coming close to a one-month high at 0.42 percent. Foreign exchange markets were more cautious about seeing the EU-U.S. announcement as a substantial breakthrough, with the euro down against the dollar and other currencies such as the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc. The euro, having initially strengthened on the news, fell back 0.2 percent to $1.1707 as traders turn their attention to the European Central Bank monetary policy meeting later on Thursday. The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies. U.S. equities were set to open weaker, with Nasdaq futures down the most by 0.8 percent. That follows a 21 percent after-hours slump in tech giant Facebook after its quarterly report. Facebook losses could weigh on the entire tech sector, where Amazon and Intel will post second-quarter results later in the day. Asian markets were also more circumspect, on fears that U.S. trade policy would now squarely be concentrated on China. China’s Shanghai Composite index fell 0.7 percent and blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. This kept MSCI’s Asian shares outside Japan flat. While the transatlantic mood was improving, “this deal, along with the breakdown of a large M&A deal, leave investors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,” Citi analysts told clients. They were referring to Qualcomm’s decision to drop its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors after a deadline for securing Chinese regulatory approval passed. Economic growth worries are also mounting — economists polled by Reuters said global activity had peaked, with trade protectionism seen having a significant downward impact . Data out of South Korea on Thursday showed slowing growth and exports reinforced that picture. Another poll indicated U.S. second quarter growth — with data due on Friday — also would mark the peak. Trade and growth worries have already taken their toll on some companies’ bottom lines. U.S. automakers General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have cut profit forecasts, while Germany’s Daimler blamed U.S.-China tariffs for a 30 percent drop in second-quarter profit. With U.S.-EU trade fears pushed into the background for now, the focus will return to central bank policy - the softer U.S.-EU tone should help the ECB stick with its plan to gradually withdraw stimulus. Brent crude touched a 10-day high of $74.68 per barrel, extending gains into a third day after Saudi Arabia suspended crude shipments through a strategic Red Sea shipping lane.

2018-07-26,"KHOKONG, Laos (Reuters) - Troops searched for survivors in the remote southern tip of Laos on Thursday, three days after the collapse of a hydropower dam sent a torrent of water charging across paddy fields and through villages, as rescuers rushed aid to thousands of homeless. The scale of the disaster was still unclear, in part because of the inaccessibility of the area but also because reports from the communist country’s state media have been scant and sketchy. For graphic on map locating the collapsed dam in Laos click tmsnrt.rs/2JLQY4F The official Laos News Agency said that 27 people were confirmed dead and 131 were missing following the failure of the dam on Monday, a subsidiary structure under construction as part of a hydroelectric project in the province of Attapeu. Earlier reports had suggested the death toll would be much higher, and on Wednesday the Vientiane Times had said more than 3,000 people were waiting to be rescued from swirling floodwaters, many of them on trees and the rooftops of submerged houses. In the village of Khokong, a sea of mud oozed around the stilt houses that were still standing and dead animals floated in the water. “Seven villages were hit, two very badly. There were 200 houses and only about 10 are left standing,” said a medical official, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media. “We retrieved one body today. I suspect there will be more as the water goes down and the road becomes easier to access.” He said villagers were warned about three to four hours before the dam burst, but few had expected the water to rise as high as it did. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said roads and bridges were damaged, and boat and helicopter were the only means of transport in the worst-affected areas. Schools in safe areas were being used as evacuation centres, and about 1,300 families needed tents for shelter, it said. On a road to the small town of Sanamxai, Reuters saw trucks carrying aid, including fresh water and blankets, for those made homeless. The government put their number at 3,060. Phra Ajan Thanakorn, a Buddhist monk returning from Sanamxai, said he had delivered food and medicine in four pick-up trucks that had come from Vientiane, the capital some 800 km (500 miles) to the north, and he was heading back there to load up with more. “The situation is really bad,” he told Reuters. “All the relief efforts are at Sanamxai. There are volunteers distributing food and medicine for survivors every day there. They are still lacking food, medicine, and coffins.”  Rescue and relief teams from around Asia have headed into  Attapeu, a largely agricultural province that borders Vietnam to the east and Cambodia to the south. Laos, one of Asia’s poorest countries, has ambitions to become the “battery of Asia” through the construction of multiple dams. Its government depends almost entirely on outside developers to build the dams under commercial concessions that involve the export of electricity to more developed neighbours, including power-hungry Thailand. Laos has finished building 11 dams, says Thai non-government group TERRA, with 11 more under construction and dozens planned. Rights groups have repeatedly warned against the human and environmental cost of the dam drive, including damage to the already fragile ecosystem of the region’s rivers. The dam that collapsed was part of the $1.2 billion (£0.91 billion) Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project, which involves Laotian, Thai and South Korean firms. Known as “Saddle Dam D”, it was part of a network of two main dams and five subsidiary dams. The project’s main partner, South Korea’s SK Engineering & Construction, said part of a small supply dam was washed away and the company was cooperating with the Laos government to help rescue villagers. The firm blamed the collapse on heavy rain. Laos and its neighbours are in the middle of the monsoon season that brings tropical storms and heavy downpours. In Cambodia’s northern Strung Treng province, nearly 1,300 families that were also affected by the flooding from the dam in Laos were moved to higher ground. “These people will be affected for about seven to 10 days and once all the water flows into the Mekong, we will be fine,” said Keo Vy, a spokesman for the National Centre for Disaster Management. An official at SK Engineering & Construction said fractures were discovered on the dam on Sunday and the company ordered the evacuation of 12 villages as soon as the danger became clear. Laotian Minister of Energy and Mines Khammany Inthirath told a news conference in the capital that the company could not deny responsibility for the destruction of livelihoods and property. The Vientiane Times cited him as saying that all compensation would be “borne by the project developer 100 percent”.

2018-07-26,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: India coal imports by source: tmsnrt.rs/2JS2lYR By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 26 (Reuters) - India’s coal imports appear to have surged in July and may even come close to a monthly record as it grapples with domestic transport woes and rising demand for electricity. Coal imports are on track to reach 19.7 million tonnes in July, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. The data was filtered to include only cargoes that have already unloaded, are awaiting or currently discharging, or are expected to arrive before the end of the month. The final figure for July may be adjusted, but it’s likely that the month will be near the previous record of 19.85 million tonnes, from July 2015, or top the second-best figure of 19.65 million from June 2016. The rising imports come even as coal prices surge on the back of strong demand from China, the world’s biggest importer, and other Asian countries including Japan. Imports for the first seven months of the year are likely to be around 115.1 million tonnes, up 9 percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the vessel-tracking data. India is likely to be a reluctant buyer of imported coal, given the country tends to cut back on overseas purchases in times of high prices. Prices for thermal coal used in power generation have scaled multi-year peaks so far in 2018, with the Australian benchmark weekly Newcastle Index hitting $122.57 in the week to July 22, the highest since September 2011 and up 18 percent since the end of last year. However, Australia isn’t a major supplier of thermal coal to India, with the bulk of its exports to the South Asian nation being coking coal. India’s main supplier of thermal coal is Indonesia, where prices have also been rising, but perhaps not quite so dramatically as for the higher-quality Australian grades. Indonesian coal with a calorific value of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram, as assessed by Argus Media, ended at $47.48 per tonne in the week to July 20, having dropped for the past four weeks to be up only 1.4 percent since the end of last year. It’s also down from its peak so far in 2018 of $51.04 a tonne, hit in late February, although it is also well above the trough of $41.08 from the week to Apr. 13. What the prices show is that lower-rank Indonesian coal has underperformed higher-quality Australian coal, meaning that it should be enjoying a relative advantage in a price-sensitive buyer such as India. But the vessel-tracking data isn’t showing this, with imports from Indonesia weakening in June and July. July’s total is likely to be around 6.7 million tonnes, down from June’s 7 million and 7.3 million in May, which was the best month since December last year. In contrast, coal shipments from Australia to India have been moving sharply higher, with 5.1 million tonnes likely to have arrived in July - the strongest month since shipping data started in 2015. Of course, the bulk of this will still be coking coal used to make steel, but looking at the breakdown of the vessels and it appears at least some cargoes were thermal coal. The other winner is India’s third-largest supplier, South Africa, with imports rising to around 4 million tonnes in July, also a record. South Africa’s exports are thermal coal and are of a higher calorific value than the bulk of shipments from Indonesia. This shows that Indian utilities are prepared to pay more for higher-quality coal, which may be a sign that they are seeking to maximise the efficiency of their boilers, or are concerned about minimising the amount of pollution per unit of electricity generated. It also seems likely that coal imports may remain elevated for at least the coming months, given the difficulties being experienced by state-controlled producer Coal India in securing rail transportation. However, as the import bill surges, it’s also likely that political heat will be turned up on Coal India, given it’s the policy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government to produce enough coal domestically to cut imports to zero.

2018-07-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In what the EU chief called a “major concession,” U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers, easing the threat of a transatlantic trade war. After a meeting at the White House, Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the talks would also seek to “resolve” U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and Europe’s retaliatory duties - marking a step back from Trump’s signature import protections for American metals producers.  The breakthrough came as the bitter trade dispute between the United States and China appeared to claim a major casualty, with China not approving U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc’s (QCOM.O) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI.O), likely shutting the door on the $44 billion deal. Qualcomm needed Beijing’s okay because China accounts for nearly two-thirds of its revenue, but a deadline at midday on Thursday in Asia passed without word from China’s regulator. Qualcomm had said on Wednesday it was dropping the bid. Trump said Europe agreed to increase purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas and lower trade barriers to American soybeans, aiding U.S. farmers and the energy sector. “Soybeans is a big deal. And the European Union is going to start, almost immediately, to buy a lot of soybeans,” Trump told reporters after the meeting. Trump later tweeted that work on documents was “moving along quickly,” adding that the meeting with Juncker had “great warmth.” “A breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible!” Trump wrote, marking a turnaround from July 15, when he called the 28-nation European Union a “foe” on trade.     Juncker said the two sides agreed that as long as they were negotiating on trade, they would hold off on further tariffs, including potential U.S. tariffs on cars and auto parts. He later told reporters that was a “major concession” on Trump’s part and that he expected the U.S. president to follow through on it. U.S. import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum imposed in March will remain in place during the talks, but Juncker added: “It is the first time that the Americans agreed to reassess the measure that they have taken in the steel and aluminum sector.” European governments and EU officials hailed the Trump-Juncker agreement as a major success. “Breakthrough achieved that can avoid trade war and save millions of jobs! Great for global economy,” tweeted German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s economy minister, Peter Altmaier.  The late-afternoon news that the meeting had eased transatlantic trade tensions fed a powerful late rally on Wall Street. U.S. stocks shot to their highs of the day, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index .SPX rising by the most in nearly two months to close the day within 1 percent of an all-time high.    The dollar .DXY fell, led by a surge in the euro EUR=, which has been pressured by the deteriorating trade relations with the EU's largest trading partner. U.S. Treasury prices also eased and the 10-year note’s yield US10YT=RR ended the day at a one-month high near 2.98 percent.    Steelmakers’ shares fell, with United States Steel (X.N) falling more than 5 percent in extended trading, and AK Steel Holdings (AKS.N) sliding 2 percent. The Alliance of Automobile manufacturers, a trade group representing both domestic and foreign-brand automakers, welcomed the agreement to hold talks instead of impose tariffs, saying the announcement “demonstrates that bilateral negotiations are a more effective approach to resolving trade barriers, not increasing tariffs.”   Trump and Juncker said the U.S.-EU talks would seek to eliminate tariffs, trade barriers and subsidies for non-automotive industrial goods, and cut barriers to transatlantic trade in services, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and medical products. They also said they would cooperate to reform the rules of the World Trade Organization, which the Trump administration frequently criticizes for favoring U.S. trading partners.    Trump’s threat to impose tariffs on auto imports on national security grounds would hit European carmakers BMW (BMWG.DE) Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) as well as Japanese and South Korean car companies. The Commerce Department could recommend new tariffs as early as September after an investigation into whether car imports posed a risk to U.S. national security. The two leaders did not specifically mention car tariffs in their statements, keeping the focus on other industrial products. An EU official said there was significant pressure from Trump administration officials to increase EU soybean purchases as part of any trade deal. U.S. farmers have been hurt by China’s retaliatory tariffs on American soybeans amid an escalating trade fight between Washington and Beijing, and Trump has been promising relief. On Tuesday, his administration said it would use a Depression-era program to pay farmers up to $12 billion, easing the pain for a politically important Trump constituency.

2018-07-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is ready to deploy more troops across the Middle East to counter its foes as it believes it can no longer rely on Western allies like the United States and Britain, UAE minister Anwar Gargash said on Thursday.    Filling the vacuum left by the administration of former U.S. president Barack Obama, the UAE has extended its influence by deploying troops and cash across the Middle East and Africa, where it has built up local armies and set up military bases.  “In this current international system, it is no longer ‘write a cheque and someone is going to come and secure the stability in the region.’ You have to do some of the burden-sharing,” Gargash, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said in a speech in London.   The UAE has been fighting the Iranian-aligned Houthis in Yemen for more than three years, and backed forces opposed to political Islam in Libya and elsewhere.    With its closest ally Saudi Arabia, the UAE has been locked in a power struggle with their arch-rival Iran that has played out across the region and taken on a sectarian dimension. Each accuses the other of creating instability in the region.   Gargash said he was concerned about divergence between Western powers over the future of relations with Iran. “As we move forward, we do really hope that the current American effort to bring about a change in Iranian approach is successful. We are worried a little bit about what is seen as a divergence of view between Europe and the United States over Iran,” he said at the Policy Exchange think tank event.     UAE sees the more forceful approach towards Iran taken by the United States as a more effective means of curbing what it sees as Iran’s malign activity and development of ballistic missiles than European attempts to rescue a 2015 Iran nuclear deal. In May U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the multinational agreement that lifted sanctions in exchange for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme, calling it a “horrible deal”. Gargash also said UAE was engaging in a mediation process with Somalia, whose coastline sits close to key shipping routes and across the water from Yemen, following a row over the seizure of several million dollars from a UAE civilian aircraft at Mogadishu airport. “There are attempts currently to mediate between us and Somalia,” he said. “We’d like to continue to do our work, but we have made it very clear that we have been wronged with regards to how we were treated with the shipment of nine-point-something million dollars ... we are asking for an apology for that.” Reporting by William James; additional reporting by Aziz El Yaakoubi in DUBAI; editing by Stephen Powell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/yeneb-security-britain/uae-ready-to-take-on-greater-security-burden-in-middle-east-minister-idUKL5N1UM4NN,26 Jul 2018,"The United Arab Emirates is

2018-07-26,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) (HPCL.NS) cancelled the purchase of an Iranian oil cargo earlier this month after its insurance company refused to provide coverage for the crude because of U.S. sanctions, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. HPCL, India’s third-biggest state-owned refiner, renewed its installation insurance, which protects against any accidents at its refinery or storage sites, in early July. However, the new policy would not protect against any incidents involving Iranian oil processed or stored at its refineries, the sources said. The refiner had planned to load 1 million barrels of Iranian crude onto the Suezmax tanker Ankaleshwar in early July but cancelled the purchase after it was unable to sell it on to another buyer, said the sources who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.  India is the second-biggest buyer of Iranian crude after China and without insurance coverage to protect their plants, the country’s refineries may have to cut off their imports earlier than anticipated.  The United States said in May it plans to re-impose some sanctions against Iran starting in August, with full sanctions in place by November, after withdrawing from a 2015 accord with Iran limiting its nuclear programme.  “HPCL faced problems in lifting cargo from Iran because its annual insurance policy was renewed in July after the U.S. pulled out of the nuclear deal in May,” said one of the sources, adding the company will not be able to lift any Iranian oil.     HPCL’s Iranian imports account for only 20,000 barrels per day (bpd) of its full demand of 316,000 bpd but other Indian refiners that take larger volumes are likely to face the same problem if their annual policy is up for renewal before November. HPCL did not respond to requests from Reuters for a comment. Companies have until Nov. 4 to fully wind down activities with Iran or risk exclusion from the U.S. financial system. However, banks, shipping firms and insurance companies are already cutting ties with Iran and without financing or insurance coverage refiners will have to halt their purchases. Iran had hoped to sell more than 500,000 bpd of oil to India during the current fiscal year that started in April, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said in February. However, the insurance issues may mean a reduction in imports even as India is intent on continuing dealings with Iran.  “The problem in procuring Iranian barrels appears to be happening much before the Nov. 4 deadline,” said Senthil Kumaran, a senior analyst at consultants FGE. “Most of the reinsurance market is based in the U.S. so without the blessing of the U.S., Iranian oil buyers will find it almost impossible to take and process Iranian cargoes.” Indian insurers rely on state-run General Insurance Corp (GENA.NS) for reinsurance, which depends on western re-insurers to hedge its risk. General Insurance did not reply to a request for comment.

The chemicals company predicted higher earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) this year, which it had previously seen as matching last year’s 3.44 billion euros ($4 billion), though it gave no specific forecast. Many chemical industry segments such as furniture and car seat foams have seen demand outgrow limited production capacity over recent quarters, causing a scramble to build new plants by the likes of DowDuPont, Saudi Aramco’s Sadara joint venture, BASF and Wanhua. The former Bayer subsidiary vowed to increase investment this year to between 650 and 700 million euros, up from 507 million in 2017, with further annual expenditure over the next three years to reach as much as 1.2 billion euros. Among the trends Covestro is relying on is its plastics replacing metal parts in electric vehicles, as well as emerging middle classes in developing nations buying more furniture. The shares gained 1.8 percent to 81.58 euros by 0750 GMT, outperforming a 1.1 percent increase in the STOXX Europe 600 chemicals index. Finance chief Thomas Toepfer underscored the focus on internal growth projects, telling Reuters that possible takeover targets were in the smaller or “bolt-on” category, even though cash flow after investment expenditure would exceed 2 billion euros this year. He added that investments were mainly earmarked for upgrades of existing chemical reactors, with a focus on specialised products with few competitors such as coatings for wind turbines or plastics for medical devices. One new large plant in either transparent polycarbonate plastics or foam chemicals was on the cards, he added.

Concerns over the slowing pace of world economic growth and some lacklustre company earnings reports capped some of equity gains, however, as did lingering fears that Washington’s trade tensions with China could escalate further. In what the EU chief called a “major concession,” U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Wednesday to refrain from imposing car tariffs while the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers. There were gains across the board for European stocks on Thursday morning, led by the continent’s auto sector, which was up 2 percent at one point German’s export-reliant and auto-heavy index rose 1.4 percent A pan-European stock index rose half a percent while the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, hit its highest since March 16 on the news. “The lifting of the threat of tariffs on the auto sector in particular is a major development. We’ve not seen a lot of actual measures implemented but it should lift the confidence of manufacturers,” said RBC European economist Cathal Kennedy. “The feedthrough should come through in the manufacturing sector and confidence indicators in the coming months.” The equity gains pushed up government bond yields in the U.S. and Europe, with Germany’s 10-year yield, the benchmark for the euro zone, coming close to a one-month high at 0.42 percent. There were clouds on the horizon, however. Asian stocks were held back by weakness in China, where the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.7 percent and blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. This capped gains for MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan to just 0.1 percent. While the transatlantic mood was improving, “this deal, along with the breakdown of a large M&A deal, leave investors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,” Citi analysts told clients. They were referring to the likelihood that Qualcomm Inc would drop its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors NXPI.O after a deadline for securing Chinese regulatory approval passed. Economic growth worries are also mounting — economists polled by Reuters said global activity had peaked, with trade protectionism seen having a significant downward impact . Thursday’s South Korean data showing slowing growth and exports reinforced that picture. Another poll indicated U.S. second quarter growth — with data due on Friday — also would mark the peak. Trade and growth worries were already taking a toll on some companies’ bottom lines. U.S. automakers General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles have cut profit forecasts, while Germany’s Daimler blamed U.S.-China tariffs for a 30 percent drop in second-quarter profit. A warning of slowing growth from Facebook Inc, which saw the company’s stock fall as much as 24 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, highlighted risks for investors and businesses in the current earnings season. That is likely to weigh on Wall Street at open, with S&P500 futures down 0.2 percent Focus will now turn back to central bank policy and the softer U.S.-EU tone should help the European Central Bank stick with its plan to gradually withdraw stimulus when it meets later on Thursday. The euro, having strengthened on Wednesday on the news, held on to its gains against the dollar and was at $1.1731 while the dollar was down 0.20 percent against a basket of currencies. The yen fell 0.3 percent against the dollar but investors will carefully watch the Bank of Japan’s two-day policy review on July 30-31 after this week’s brief jump in yields and the Japanese currency on reports authorities were debating paring back some stimulus. The bank is said to be considering changing the composition of exchange-traded funds it buys as part of its stimulus programme. Brent crude meanwhile was up over a percent to hit a 10-day high of $74.68 per barrel Brent crude led oil prices higher, extending gains into a third day after Saudi Arabia suspended crude shipments through a strategic Red Sea shipping lane.

2018-07-26,"DUBAI, July 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s stock market barely moved early on Thursday after Riyadh reported an attack on two oil tankers by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement, suggesting investors do not expect the incident to have much of an economic impact. The main stock index fell 0.3 percent in the first hour of trade and shares in National Shipping Co of Saudi Arabia (Bahri) was 0.2 percent lower after it said one of its vessels suffered minor damage in the attack. Oil prices rose only modestly after Saudi Arabia said it was suspending crude shipments through one Red Sea shipping lane because of the attack. Brent crude futures added 0.9 percent to $74.59 a barrel on Thursday morning after gaining 0.7 percent on Wednesday, when the attack reportedly occurred. Credit default swaps, used to insure against the risk of a Saudi sovereign debt default and an indicator of geopolitical tensions in the Gulf, rose marginally on Thursday morning. Other Gulf stock markets mostly traded sideways. Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi Arabia’s second largest bank by assets, was up 0.5 percent after reporting a 17.7 percent rise in second-quarter net profit to 2.57 billion riyals ($685 million), at the high end of analysts’ forecasts. Saudi Arabian Mining Co (Ma’aden), the Gulf’s largest miner, was 1.2 percent down despite posting a 45.3 percent jump in second-quarter net profit. The results were short of forecasts by SICO Bahrain and EFG Hermes. Saudi Arabia’s stock index has surged 16 percent this year as foreign investors anticipate the market’s planned entry into emerging market benchmarks next year. Many fund managers now view the Saudi market as richly valued, with Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) valued at over 20 times trailing earnings. But major Saudi investment bank Jadwa said in a report on Wednesday that the market could rise further in coming months as active foreign funds began entering the market ahead of Riyadh’s entry into MSCI’s emerging market index. “We view a rise of at least 20 percent between now and early 2019 as totally plausible,” which would push the stock index to around 10,000 points, Jadwa said. In Abu Dhabi, where the index slipped 0.2 percent, First Abu Dhabi Bank fell 1.1 percent early on Thursday. On Wednesday the lender reported a 19 percent year-on-year gain in quarterly profit. Dubai’s main index was almost flat as Dubai Islamic Bank climbed 0.4 percent. Qatar’s benchmark was also little changed with Qatar Islamic Bank, the main mover, adding 0.5 percent.

2018-07-26,"TOYOTA CITY (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) is doubling down on its investment in hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, designing lower-cost, mass-market passenger cars and SUVs and pushing the technology into buses and trucks to build economies of scale. As Toyota cranks up improvements for the next generation of its Mirai hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (FCV), expected in the early 2020s, it is hoping it can prove wrong rival automakers and industry experts who have mostly dismissed such plans as commercially unviable. The maker of the Prius, the world’s first mass-produced “eco-friendly” gasoline-hybrid car in the 1990s, says it can popularize FCVs in part by making them cheaper.  “We’re going to shift from limited production to mass production, reduce the amount of expensive materials like platinum used in FCV components, and make the system more compact and powerful,” Yoshikazu Tanaka, chief engineer of the Mirai, said in an interview with Reuters. It is planning a phased introduction of other FCV models, including a range of SUVs, pick-up trucks, and commercial trucks beginning around 2025, a source with knowledge of the automaker’s plans said.  The automaker declined to comment on specific future product plans. But it has developed FCV prototypes of small delivery vehicles and large transport trucks based on models already on the road, as Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) develops a battery-operated commercial semi-truck from the ground up.   “We’re going to use as many parts from existing passenger cars and other models as possible in fuel cell trucks,” said  Ikuo Ota, manager of new business planning for fuel cell projects at Toyota. “Otherwise, we won’t see the benefits of mass production.” The company is also betting on improved performance. Toyota wants to push the driving range of the next Mirai to 700-750 kilometers from around 500 kilometers, and to hit 1,000 kilometers by 2025, a separate source said.  Driven by the belief that hydrogen will become a key source of clean energy in the next 100 years, Toyota has been developing FCVs since the early 1990s.   Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and stores more energy than a battery of equivalent weight. The Mirai was the world’s first production FCV when it was launched in 2014. But its high cost, around $60,000 before government incentives, and lack of refueling infrastructure have limited its appeal. Fewer than 6,000 have been sold globally. LMC Automotive forecasts FCVs to make up only 0.2 percent of global passenger car sales in 2027, compared with 11.7 percent for battery EVs. The International Energy Agency predicts fewer FCVs than battery-powered and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles through 2040. Many automakers, including Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) and Tesla, see battery-powered cars as a better, zero-emission solution to gasoline engines. Only a handful, including Honda Motor Co (7267.T) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS), produce FCVs. But people familiar with Toyota’s plans said the automaker thinks demand will perk up as more countries, including China, warm to fuel cell technology. The company also sees FCVs as a hedge against a scarcity of key EV battery materials such as cobalt. For now, Mirais are assembled by hand at a plant in Toyota City, where 13 technicians push partially constructed units into assembly bays for detailed inspections. This process yields just 6.5 cars a day, a sliver of Toyota’s average domestic daily production of about 13,400 vehicles. Strategic Analysis Inc, which has analyzed costs of FCVs including the Mirai, estimates that it costs Toyota about $11,000 to produce each of its fuel cell stacks, by far the vehicles’ most expensive part.  Toyota has been building up production capacity to change that, as it expects global FCV sales climb to 30,000 units annually after 2020 from about 3,000. Strategic Analysis estimates that would allow Toyota to reduce costs to about $8,000 per stack.  It has already begun to use parts developed for the Mirai in other models, such as the fuel cell stack, which is used in Kenworth freight trucks being tested in California, the Sora FC bus it released in Japan in March and the delivery trucks it will test with Seven-Eleven stores in Japan next year. “It will be difficult for Toyota to lower FCV production costs if it only produces the Mirai,” the first source told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue.  “By using the FCV system in larger models, it is looking to lower costs by mass-producing and using common parts across vehicle classes,” he added.  The Mirai’s high production costs are largely due to expensive materials including platinum, titanium and carbon fiber used in the fuel cell and hydrogen storage systems.  Engineers have been reducing that by improving the platinum catalyst, a key component in the 370 layered cells in the fuel cell stack, which facilitates the reaction between hydrogen and oxygen that produces electricity. “We’ve been able to decrease the platinum loading by 10 percent to 20 percent and deliver the same performance,” said Eri Ichikawa, a fuel cell engineer at Cataler Corp, a Toyota subsidiary that specializes in catalytic converters.  Strategic Analysis says using that much less of the precious metal would save up to $300 per fuel cell stack, based on an estimate that Toyota now uses about 30 grams of platinum per unit. “By consistently focusing on these issues, we will be able to progressively lower the cost of FCVs in the future,” Tanaka said.

2018-07-26,"LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Europe looks set to install 13.5 gigawatts (GW) of new wind power capacity this year, slightly lower than last year’s record of 15.6 GW, according to estimates by industry group WindEurope. In the first half of this year, Europe installed 3.3 GW of onshore wind, mainly in Germany, France and Denmark. A further 1.1 GW of new offshore wind capacity was also added, mainly in Britain, Belgium and Denmark. For the whole of the year, 10.2 GW of new onshore wind and 3.3 GW of new offshore wind is expected. “We are on track for a solid year in new wind farm installations but the growth is driven by just a handful of markets,” WindEurope’s chief policy officer Pierre Tardieu said in a statement. WindEurope expects a drop in France’s new installations because of administrative issues, which have resulted in the country’s latest auction being under-subscribed. “In offshore wind, Europe is too dependent on the UK, which is striding ahead in current installations and in committing to future volumes,” Tardieu said. “By contrast, the rate of new installations has slowed down in Germany. Other countries also need to beef up and speed up their plans on offshore wind,” he added. The new German government has also been slow to reveal when 4 GW of new onshore wind promised for 2019-20 will be auctioned and to confirm auction volumes beyond that.

2018-07-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - French oil and gas major Total (TOTF.PA) raised its 2018 savings and oil production targets after a new record quarterly output, costs savings, and high oil prices lifted its net profit in the second quarter. The group said adjusted net profit for the second quarter soared 44 percent to $3.6 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $3.4 billion (£2.57 billion). Oil production rose by 8.7 percent to 2.717 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by the early completion the Maersk Oil deal, and the ramp-up of several projects including Yamal LNG in Russia and Moho Nord in Congo.  Total raised its production growth target to 7 percent in 2018 from 6 percent previously, expecting a boost from the start-up of its Kaombo North project in Angola, Egina in Nigeria, Australia’s Ichthys LNG and Tempa Rossa in Italy. It said cost savings measures were on track to surpass the $4 billion target for the year and reach $4.2 billion over the 2014-2018 period. “Oil prices continued to increase, averaging $74 per barrel in the second quarter, supported by inventory reductions and geopolitical tensions,” Total’s Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement. The company said it would continue to implement programmes to improve operational efficiency and reduce its breakeven so as to remain profitable, whatever the market context. Organic pre-dividend breakeven continued to drop to less that $25 per barrel in the quarter, it said. Total also maintained 2018 investments at the $16-$17 billion range. Total said it bought back all shares issued during the year for the scrip dividend scheme, and also bought back shares for $600 million to spread the benefits from the higher oil prices with shareholders. Total’s share buybacks came as its rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) also launched a long-anticipated $25 billion share buyback programme on Thursday.   Total added that it will continue to buy back shares issued as scrip dividend when prices were down, to eliminate dilution. Total also raised its dividend in the quarter by 3.2 percent to 0.64 euros ($0.7487) per share.

2018-07-26,"* Weak gains, falls in China reflect lingering trade war worries * Commodities see boost after Juncker-Trump meeting * European shares tipped to open higher * MSCI Asia ex-Japan +0.1 pct, SSEC -0.7 pct, Nikkei -0.1 pct, By Andrew Galbraith SHANGHAI, July 26 (Reuters) - Asian shares inched up n Thursday as the United States and Europe agreed to negotiations to ease barriers on trade, but weakness in China markets underscored persistent worries about the outlook for global growth. European markets looked set to open higher after U.S. President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker had agreed to work to lower industrial tariffs on both sides. Financial spreadbetters expect Britain’s FTSE to open 0.1 percent higher, Germany’s DAX to climb 0.7 percent and France’s CAC to gain 0.4 percent. Juncker also called Trump’s agreement to hold off on car tariffs as the two sides launch negotiations to cut other trade barriers a “major concession.” At the same time, Trump said Europe has agreed to increase purchases of U.S. liquefied natural gas and lower trade barriers to American soybeans. But a warning of slowing growth from Facebook Inc, which saw the company’s stock fall as much as 24 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, highlighted risks for investors and businesses in the current earnings season. Detroit automakers General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) also lowered their full-year profit forecasts on Wednesday, in an indication that trade war worries are far from over. Furthermore, nearly three-quarters of economists polled by Reuters said trade protectionism would have a significant downward impact on global growth next year. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1 percent. After months of see-sawing prompted by uncertainty over trade, some markets were enjoying a relief rally, said Matt Simpson, senior market analyst at Faraday Research in Singapore. “Possibly we’ve got a bit of Trump fatigue,” he said, referring to Trump’s turnabout on trade threats. “You know, nobody cares if it’s going to happen or not at this stage. They just want a slight change of tone.” He added that ahead of U.S. second-quarter GDP data on Friday and a likely shift in the Bank of Japan’s stimulus policy next week, investors were “in a bit of a holding pattern.” The BOJ is said to be considering changing the composition of exchange-traded funds it buys as part of its stimulus programme. It holds a two-day policy review on July 30-31. Concerns that the bank could begin unwinding its stimulus pushed the yield on benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds to its highest level in a year. The yield was 2.5 basis points higher at 0.090 percent. U.S. Treasury yields also remained elevated, pushed higher by the outcome of the Juncker-Trump meeting. The yield on 10-year notes was at 2.9690 percent, compared with its U.S. close of 2.936 percent on Wednesday. The two-year yield, which rises with traders’ expectations of higher Fed fund rates, was at 2.6694 percent compared with a U.S. close of 2.657 percent. In China, the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.7 percent and blue-chip shares lost 1.1 percent. A senior official at the country’s state planner told jouralists that “escalating Sino-U.S. trade frictions have brought uncertainties to our country’s economic development.” The prospect of weaker growth has prompted a loosening of fiscal policy in China as authorities seek to head off a slowdown. Most recently, China’s central bank gave notice to some domestic banks that it would ease a capital requirement to support lending. Shares in Taiwan gained 0.4 percent and Seoul’s KOSPI added 0.6 percent, with Korean investors taking heart from a respite in trade tensions. But data on Thursday showed South Korea’s gross domestic product grew at a slower pace in the second quarter, and export growth weakened. Australian shares were flat and Japan’s Nikkei stock index was down 0.1 percent. After gains on Wall Street on Wednesday sparked by signs of sunnier days for U.S.-Europe trade, S&P 500 E-mini futures turned lower Thursday in Asia, falling 0.3 percent to 2834.25. In commodities, the prospect of a deal between the U.S. and Europe lifted the most active soybean futures up 2.2 percent at $8.94-3/4 a bushel, after touching their strongest level since July 9 at $8.95-1/4. U.S. soybeans are among the goods China included in retaliatory tariffs after Washington slapped additional levies on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods on July 6. But while the transatlantic mood was improving, “this deal, along with the breakdown of a large M&A deal, leave investors fearing that the trade war has just turned even more so on China,” Citi analysts wrote in a note Thursday, referring to Qualcomm Inc dropping its $44 billion bid for NXP Semiconductors after failing to secure Chinese regulatory approval. The dollar dropped 0.2 percent against the yen to 110.73 The euro was up less than 0.1 percent on the day at $1.1734, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, fell 0.2 percent to 94.140. U.S. crude was flat at $69.29 a barrel. Brent crude was 0.5 percent higher at $74.30 per barrel. After moving slightly higher as the dollar eased, spot gold fell 0.1 percent to $1,229.20 per ounce.
