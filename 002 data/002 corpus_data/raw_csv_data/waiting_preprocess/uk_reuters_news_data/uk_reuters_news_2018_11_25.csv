The agreements will be signed on the sidelines of Aramco’s In-Kingdom Total Value Add Program (IKTVA), which will take place on Monday and Tuesday. IKTVA is a plan outlined by the state oil giant a few years ago, aimed at doubling the percentage of locally produced energy-related goods and services to 70 percent of the total spent by 2021.
