2018-06-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials will have a new round of meetings with an automakers trade group and California’s “clean air” agency next week before unveiling a proposal to reverse rules aimed at increasing fuel efficiency, participants said on Thursday. The rules, negotiated with automakers by President Barack Obama’s administration in 2011, aimed to double average fleet-wide fuel efficiency to about 50 miles (80 km) per gallon by 2025 and included significant annual increases in automaker requirements. President Donald Trump administration’s proposed rule, expected to be made available for public comment later in June or July, will include a series of alternatives but the preferred alternative will be to freeze requirements at 2020 levels, officials said. The White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, part of the Office of Management and Budget, will meet separately on Tuesday with the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The trade group represents General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE), Toyota Motor Corp and other major companies. Reuters on May 31 reported the U.S. Transportation Department had submitted a proposal to the White House for review along with the Environmental Protection Agency that would back freezing requirements at 2020 levels through 2026 and would bar California from setting stricter standards than the federal government. U.S. Senator Tom Carper has said a draft shows the administration’s preferred alternative would result in Americans using 206 billion more gallons of gasoline through 2050 versus the current standards.

2018-06-14,"NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - As the discount of U.S. crude to global benchmark Brent nears three-year highs, an emerging bottleneck at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, is making U.S. futures vulnerable to a drop, traders and analysts said. Infrastructure constraints in the shale-rich Permian basin have already kept U.S. oil prices below international grades. Now, new constraints threaten to depress them even further and widen the gap between U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude (WTI) and global benchmark Brent. Pipelines are overwhelmed as U.S. crude production continues to hit new highs. The bulk of the record 10.9 million barrels per day produced last week came from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. Permian barrels typically go to the Gulf Coast for refining or export, but those pipelines are full. More oil has thus started to flow to the storage hub of Cushing, where U.S. futures are priced. As a result, northbound pipes, too, are nearing capacity. Cushing inventories may therefore start to rise, which, if it happens, could further widen the difference between WTI and Brent. WTI is down 8 percent from its 2018 high while Brent slipped about 5 percent from its peak. On Thursday, WTI traded as much as $10.25 below Brent WTc1-LCOc1; earlier this month, the discount was as much as $11.57, its deepest since March 2015. Raymond James said it expects a spread of $15 per barrel by the end of 2019 on North American output growth. “The production growth in the U.S. is just going to continue to overwhelm the infrastructure buildout,” said Vikas Dwivedi, global oil and gas strategist at investment bank Macquarie. So far, the Cushing builds have not come as Midwest refiners process record amounts of crude to meet summer demand. Last week, inventories there fell 687,000 barrels to 33.9 million barrels, according to government data. For the week ending June 1, pipeline utilization from Cushing to the Gulf Coast was about 92 percent, data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed, compared with about 89 percent and 88 percent in April and May, respectively. Canada, which produces heavy crude, is also ramping up production. As refiners are in search for “a similar spec Venezuelan crude,” RBC Capital Markets said in a note, these heavier Canadian barrels are being prioritized over abundant light shale on Cushing pipelines. The bottlenecks will likely remain until the end of 2019 or early 2020, when about 2.4 million bpd of Permian-to-Gulf pipeline capacity is added, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a note.

2018-06-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Thursday, with Brent slipping and U.S. crude gaining, as a stronger dollar weighed and a key supply-setting meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries loomed.  Brent crude oil LCOc1 lost 80 cents to settle at $75.94 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 gained 25 cents to settle at $66.89. “The independent show of WTI strength is merely a catchup process to the higher priced products and Brent values,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates said in a note.  Brent and WTI hit 3-1/2-year highs in May but have since drifted lower, indicating investors expect the market to soon become better supplied as U.S. crude production rises and as OPEC and its allies look poised to increase output.  The dollar .DXY gained against a basket of currencies, approaching the six-month high it hit in late May as the euro fell broadly as the European Central Bank planned to keep interest rates at record lows into the summer of 2019. “(ECB President Mario) Draghi came out a little bit more dovish than people thought he was going to be. And that really caused the euro to take a dip and the (U.S.) dollar to go up, which is putting downward pressure on prices,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities, like oil, more expensive for holders of other currencies. Oil supply concerns have also weighed on the market.      In 2017, OPEC began cutting about 1.8 million barrels per day to support the market. But, with Brent prices up by around 180 percent from their 2016 low, global crude inventories falling, Venezuelan production plummeting and imminent sanctions against Iran, the group may soon end their supply cuts.  The alliance meets on June 22-23 in Vienna, where it is expected to come to a decision on output.  “A wait-and-see approach is taking hold across the energy complex as market participants buckle down ahead of next week’s crunch OPEC/non-OPEC meeting,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil Associates. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said members of the OPEC-plus production cut deal can consider returning up to 1.5 million bpd to the market gradually. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he expected a reasonable and moderate agreement next week when OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers meet. The two ministers agreed to expand cooperation in oil and gas, Russia’s ministry said in a statement after their meeting in Moscow.

2018-06-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - The United States has charged five Russians and three Syrians with breaking U.S. sanctions by sending jet fuel to Syria and with money laundering by making money transfers through the U.S. financial system to pay for the fuel deliveries. In an indictment handed up by a grand jury in the District Court for the District of Columbia, the United States said the defendants used petroleum tankers Mukhalatka and Yaz, owned by Transpetrochart, a Russia-based company, to ship jet fuel to Syria. Reuters was unable to immediately contact the defendants.  “The U.S. sanctions on Syria and Crimea thwart Syria’s support of terrorism and its pursuit and use of weapons of mass destruction,” U.S. Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers said in a statement. Reuters reported in November that Russian tankers had smuggled jet fuel to Syria through EU waters, bolstering military supplies to a war-torn country where Moscow was carrying out air strikes in support of the government. (reut.rs/2LPCPF7) In the November story, Reuters reported that the Yaz and Mukhalatka delivered jet fuel to Syria. The indictment, published on Tuesday, said Mukhalatka had unloaded thousands of metric tonnes of jet fuel in Syria’s Port Banias. It also said the Yaz had delivered jet fuel to the Syrian port. The defendants engaged in U.S. dollar transactions to deliver jet fuel to Syria in violation of U.S. sanctions, the indictment said. The Russian defendants were employees of Sovfracht, a Russian shipping company, the indictment said.  A spokesman for Sovfracht did not answer a request for comment but earlier told the Interfax news agency that the company denied any wrongdoing. “We expect that in the end, the accusations will be removed,” the Interfax news agency quoted a spokesman for the company as saying.

2018-06-14,"* ECB vows to keep sub-zero rates till next year * Euro hits two-year low; dollar index up more than a penny * Euro equities jump 1.25 pct while Wall Street creeps positive (Updates with Wall Street afternoon trading, oil close) By Nick Brown NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar rose against a basket of major currencies by more than a penny as the euro cratered, and U.S. stocks ticked up in afternoon trading on Thursday, as the European Central Bank signalled interest rate hikes were a long way off. The bank’s unexpectedly dovish decision overshadowed its statement that it aimed to wrap up its crisis-era stimulus program at the end of this year. The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program. Investors, though, seized on comments indicating that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019, and some analysts believed it may be longer. “With Draghi’s term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place,” said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton. The euro touched on its steepest one-day drop against the U.S. dollar since June 2016, and was down 1.64 percent at 1.160. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against six other top currencies, rose 1.1 percent. Ten-year government bond yields in Germany, the euro zone benchmark, fell around six basis points to 0.422 percent compared to Wednesday’s close. Oil markets, pressured by the strengthening dollar and fears that OPEC countries could decide to increase output at a meeting next week, ended mixed. U.S. crude oil futures settled at 66.89 per barrel, up 0.38 percent, while Brent went the other way, settling down more than 1 percent at $75.94. Benefiting from the ECB’s decision were stock markets on both sides of the Atlantic. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.25 percent, reversing earlier losses, buoyed by big gains in interest rate-sensitive sectors like autos and utilities. “The hawks had been guiding for a June hike before the meeting and, given the clear guidance the ECB gave today on interest rates, it had to be priced out,” said AFS Group analyst Arne Petimezas. “It doesn’t seem like we’re at the stage where the hawks are on top of things.” The effects were more measured in the U.S., where Wall Street indexes were creeping up, stabilized too by a U.S. Commerce Department report showing retail sales rose 0.8 percent last month, the biggest advance since November 2017. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 49.71 points, or 0.2 percent, to 25,151.49, but the S&P 500 gained 4.48 points, or 0.16 percent, to 2,780.11 and the Nasdaq Composite added 50.68 points, or 0.66 percent, to 7,746.38. Technology stocks were the biggest advancers, with Facebook and Alphabet leading the pack. In U.S. Treasuries, benchmark 10-year notes last rose 9/32 in price to yield 2.9461 percent, from 2.979 percent late on Wednesday. The 30-year bond last rose 21/32 in price to yield 3.0688 percent, from 3.102 percent Wednesday. One issue keeping investors in check was concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump was planning to meet with trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. CBOT corn and soybean futures tumbled as uncertainty about tariffs and favorable crop weather in the U.S. Midwest prompted funds to liquidate big long positions. CBOT July corn fell to its lowest since mid-January and front-month soybeans dipped to a 9-1/2 month low. Traders are worried about China, Mexico and other countries curbing demand for U.S. grain and soy exports. In a rare merging of the sports and trading worlds, markets are gearing up for soccer’s World Cup in Russia, where time zone differences mean more matches during European, U.S. and Latin American trading hours than any previous tournament. A study done during the last World Cup with similarly-timed games, the 2010 finals in South Africa, showed trading volumes on share markets dropped by a third on average when matches were on and 55 percent when a market’s own team played.

2018-06-14," (This version of June 13 story corrects to remove reference to incorrect description of Occidental derivatives strategy.) By Ayenat Mersie and David Gaffen NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many top U.S. shale oil producers are missing out on the rally in oil prices to more than $70 a barrel - because they sold their oil through futures contracts at about $55 last year when that looked like a good deal. Now, it looks cheap. Those hedged bets will hold down revenues and further frustrate Wall Street investors, who have been disappointed by slow returns from the booming Permian Basin in west Texas. The top 25 shale producers will forego about $1.7 billion in combined revenues in the second quarter with oil prices at about $70, according to Denver-based consultancy PetroNerds. Many of those producers used hedges that guaranteed them between $55 and $58 a barrel. Some west Texas producers face a second profit-limiting dynamic: They are forced to cut prices because the region’s production is overwhelming its pipeline network, raising transportation costs. West Texas oil currently trades at a discount of $9 to U.S. benchmark futures, a spread that hit $12 earlier in the month. Some firms earlier protected themselves from the widening gap with hedges against the discount.  But those that didn’t - and also hedged against future prices at, for instance, at $55 - have been forced to sell barrels at prices in the low-to-mid $40s. Many firms sold their future output at prices in the $50s last year, hoping to take advantage of short-term rallies to lock in guaranteed income to cover drilling and production costs. Those costs can be $30 a barrel or less in west Texas, allowing the firms a healthy profit even as they protected themselves against future price slumps.  But the cost of that protection is to forego the potential upside of higher prices.  The second problem, with pipeline capacity, stems from surprisingly quick production growth that has pushed pipeline capacity to the limit several months before producers expected, said Michael Tran, global energy strategist at RBC Capital Markets.  Producers in west Texas, the nation’s largest oilfield, are now pumping more than 3.3 million bpd, compared with 2.4 million bpd a year ago. With storage brimming and pipelines full, producers have had to offer steep discounts to compensate for rising transport costs.  The large gap between the U.S. futures price and Permian Basin oil is called the Midland differential - named for the town at the center of the west Texas oilfield boom. Until recently, firms had not hedged the discount because the price of Midland oil and U.S. futures have historically tracked closely together. The market for such hedging is also less active, compared with futures hedging.  But at the end of the first quarter, 14 shale companies had hedged against 100 million barrels of 2019’s production in West Texas, compared with just 40 million barrels at the end of the fourth quarter, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. regulatory filings. “It’s really becoming a more widely used phenomenon,” said Ben Montalbano, PetroNerds co-founder, who said Midland hedging volume has increased tenfold in the last two years.  Coming into this year, Cimarex Energy Co had hedged about 905,000 barrels of 2019 west Texas production at a 47-cent discount to U.S. benchmark futures. That means if U.S. oil futures trade at $70 a barrel, Cimarex would sell oil at $69.53 - as opposed to companies that didn’t hedge, and are exposed to the entire Midland discount, now at $9. In the first quarter, Cimarex increased its hedge against the differential to 3.1 million barrels, according to the firm’s filings. About half of that, however, was hedged at a less favorable discount of $4.83 per barrel - effectively selling oil at $65 if futures are at $70. Cimarex produced about 50,000 bpd in the Permian in the first quarter. The company did respond to a request for comment. With major pipelines not expected to come online until next year and production increasing, analysts expect the Midland differential to remain high. Occidental Petroleum, in a recent presentation, said it expects this gap to hit $20 a barrel by the third quarter.  “For the first time in three years, we have not had a pipeline to come on to alleviate the bottleneck,” said Tran. Some firms, including Apache Corp and Pioneer Natural Resources, said they don’t have to worry about the differential because they have reserved enough space on pipelines to transport their oil. Apache said it has started to hedge its Midland exposure for 2019. Pioneer does not have any such positions, said Rich Dealt, CFO. “Pioneer has firm transportation in place over the next few years to move nearly all of its Permian Basin oil production to the Gulf Coast for export or sale to refineries,” Dealt said.

2018-06-14,"BARILOCHE, Argentina, June 14 (Reuters) - Argentina will begin exporting natural gas to neighboring Chile before the end of the year, the energy ministers of both countries said on Thursday, as output from the Vaca Muerta shale field rises. The two South American countries had previously signed deals allowing for the export of gas or electricity in emergency situations, but required that an equivalent amount be re-imported within twelve months. Chilean companies are in talks to sign import deals and the first flow of gas across the Andes could come in October or November of this year, Chile energy minister Susana Jimenez said in an interview in Bariloche, Argentina at the G20 Meeting of Energy Ministers. “We see a great opportunity for mutual benefit,” she said, adding that the gas could come both from the Neuquen basin, home to Vaca Muerta, and from the Austral basin in southern Argentina. The gas could be used for electricity generation, replacing imports from elsewhere, or to heat homes in areas where families still depend on wood, a source of pollution in the center-south region, Jimenez said. Chile produces little hydrocarbons of its own. The unrestricted exports would mark a turning point in energy trade in the region. Argentina was once a major supplier of natural gas to Chile, but triggered a diplomatic crisis in the mid-2000s by cutting off shipments when its own supplies ran low. Argentina sits atop the world’s No. 2 shale gas reserves but is still a net energy importer. Since taking office in December 2015, President Mauricio Macri has sought to loosen labor rules and boost infrastructure to attract investment. Rising output from Vaca Muerta could help the country export more than it imports by 2021, Argentina’s energy minister Juan Jose Aranguren said at a news conference. The country is set to import slightly more than 50 cargoes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) this year, down from 68 last year and 90 in 2015. Argentina still needs the LNG imports to meet peak winter demand, but in the southern hemisphere summer months it could see a surplus, Aranguren said. “This summer we will start to sign permits for exporting natural gas to Chile without any restrictions,” he said.

2018-06-14,"BURTON, Texas (Reuters) - Among vineyards and cow pastures in east Texas last month, roughnecks started to drill in an oilfield that is 25 years past its production peak. Houston-based oil producer Wildhorse Resource Development Corp WRD.N tasked the crew with breathing new life into the field by using technology developed for fracking shale rock. In the limestone and clay Austin Chalk formation, which  stretches across south Texas into central Louisiana, Wildhorse is among a growing group of U.S. producers opening a new front in the nation’s energy revolution.    “The application of new technology to older plays is a winning bet,” Drew Cozby, Wildhorse’s finance chief, said in an interview. After shale producers pushed U.S. oil and gas output to all-time highs, some are now taking what they have learned to fields that until recently were considered played out.  If they are successful, the U.S. energy boom could find another gear as producers find profitable ways to extract the billions of barrels of oil remaining in older fields. Production from the Austin Chalk jumped to 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) last year from 3,000 bpd five years ago and up 50 percent from the previous year, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie, which expects rapid production gains to continue.  The number of drilling rigs in the Austin Chalk has doubled in the past six months to 14, according to data from energy researcher DrillingInfo.  Heavyweights ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) have leased land or drilled here in the past year. (For a graphic on Austin Chalk oil production, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2IkpsLL ) Other non-shale plays getting fresh attention include the Meramec in Oklahoma and the Central Basin Platform in Texas.  Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N) is one of the biggest producers in the Meramec, where it plans to boost output to 140,000 bpd by the end of the year from 107,000 bpd at the end of 2017.  In the Central Basin Platform in the Permian oilfield, smaller producers such as Ring Energy Inc (REI.A) have begun investing heavily, hoping to rejuvenate an area that first produced nearly a century ago. There is no publicly available data on Meramec and Central Basin’s total production. Many of the tools developed to unlock vast shale reserves are working in these different geological settings - including longer wells, steerable drilling technology, complex mixtures of sand and chemicals and the hydraulic fracturing of bedrock. “These fringe areas, like the Austin Chalk, could be the next big thing,” said Bernadette Johnson of DrillingInfo.  More oil from Austin Chalk and other similar fields could push U.S. production to fresh records. Shale producers have for several consecutive years outstripped government forecasts, taking U.S. output C-OUT-T-EIA to a record 10.5 million bpd in March. Even without innovations such as those under way in the Austin Chalk, the government predicts nearly 12 million bpd by late next year.   “This is something that people haven’t baked into the supply side yet,” said Jeremy Gottlieb, who has helped finance companies bringing shale technology to inexpensive, older fields. “This is going to take people by surprise.” Wildcatters first pumped oil from the Austin Chalk nearly a century ago, but output reached its peak in the early 1990s even though the formation still contains about a billion barrels of crude, according to U.S. government’s Geological Survey. That is not unusual. Oil producers have historically extracted less than half the oil from any particular field because the rest has not been accessible at a profit. That is changing in fields like the Austin Chalk.  Based on test wells and modelling techniques, Conoco believes long, horizontal wells with multiple fracks - a technique used often in shale fields - will deliver strong results from its acreage in the Austin Chalk.           “What we were seeing with some of the newer technologies work really well in the Austin Chalk,” Conoco Chief Executive Ryan Lance told Reuters.  Some wells they have fracked in the Austin Chalk have produced more prolifically than shale wells. Wildhorse’s newer Austin Chalk wells produced more than three times the initial output of wells at the Eagle Ford shale field, the company said this month.  EOG also said an Austin Chalk well it drilled this year in Texas produced nearly 3,000 bpd in its first month, more than twice the first month rate of a shale well it had completed in the Permian during the same period. The field’s proximity to Gulf Coast refiners and export ports make it that much more attractive, she said. Rising oil prices have also increase the number of potentially profitable plays. Some portions of the Austin Chalk also sit on top of the Eagle Ford shale field, allowing drillers to potential extract oil from multiple layers and types of rock. “It’s a stacked play,” said Johnson, of DrillingInfo. Land is still cheap in the formation, which has helped lure more producers. Conoco leased its land for less than $5,000 (£3,766) an acre. That compares with as much as $75,000 an acre in the Permian Basin in West Texas and New Mexico, the centre of U.S. shale drilling and its largest oilfield. About 350 Austin Chalk drilling permits were approved in the last 16 months, a nearly four-fold increase from the previous 16-month period, according to DrillingInfo.  Analysts say they expect more activity to spread to the Louisiana portion of the play. There are 3,500 Austin Chalk horizontal wells in Texas, but only 32 in Louisiana, according to Wood Mackenzie. Louisiana is counting on the Austin Chalk developments to revive the state’s declining oil output, which fell 11 percent last year to 40.4 million barrels, the lowest level since 1945. That might stop the drain of oil workers to Texas, said Gifford Briggs, head of the Louisiana Oil and Gas Association, an industry trade group. Oil industry employment in the state fell 4 percent in the past year despite a rise in commodity prices, largely due to workers leaving to develop Texas shale fields, according to U.S. government data. “It’s an opportunity for some of our workers to stay in state,” Briggs said.

2018-06-14,"(Adds Energy Transfer comment) June 14 (Reuters) - Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission (PUC) voted on Thursday to allow Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Sunoco Mariner East 1 natural gas liquids pipeline to return to service, reversing a suspension tied to safety concerns. The PUC stopped flows on Mariner East 1 through West Whiteland Township after sinkholes were discovered near the pipeline, prompting State Senator Andrew Dinniman to ask for an emergency order to suspend service. All five PUC commissioners voted to allow Mariner East 1 to resume service. Three of the five commissioners, however, also voted to prevent ETP from working on the Mariner East 2 and 2X pipelines in West Whiteland Township. The decision overturned the emergency order, which was granted last month by a PUC administrative law judge and stopped ETP from moving liquids through Mariner East 1 and working on Mariner East 2 and 2X in the Chester County town, located about 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Philadelphia. Dinniman’s district includes West Whiteland Township. It was not the first time Mariner East 1 was shut due to those sinkholes. The state stopped flows of liquids on Mariner East 1 for over eight weeks from March to May after the sinkholes were found, forcing producers like Range Resources Corp to find other ways to get their liquids to market. The PUC allowed ETP to resume flows on Mariner East 1 after the company conducted an extensive geological analysis, among other things. The three commissioners who voted to stop construction on Mariner East 2 and 2X in West Whiteland Township want the company to do more inspections, among other things. ETP said it would consider its legal options as far as not being able to work on Mariner East 2 and 2X in the town. Delays related to spills and other matters have pushed back the expected startup of the $2.5 billion Mariner East 2 to the third quarter of 2018 from the third quarter of 2017. Mariner East 1 started service in the 1930s transporting refined products from the Philadelphia area to western Pennsylvania. It was repurposed and expanded to transport propane in 2014 and ethane in 2016 from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including international exports from ETP’s Marcus Hook complex near Philadelphia. Mariner East 2 will boost capacity of the Mariner East project from 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 345,000 bpd and open the pipeline to suppliers in Ohio and West Virginia. Mariner East 2X, which is expected to enter service in mid 2019, will add another 250,000 bpd. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-06-14,"* Eskom says some power plants operating below capacity * Unions have threatened ‘total shutdown’ * Company produces more than 90 pct of South Africa’s power * President oversaw changes at Eskom to clean up governance (Updates after Eskom begins power outages) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, June 14 (Reuters) - South Africa’s struggling state utility Eskom started controlled electricity outages on Thursday, after trade union pay protests at its power plants prevented it meeting demand. The last time there were controlled power outages in Africa’s most industrialised economy, in 2015, economic output suffered. Power cuts during winter are likely to cause hardship for millions. Labour unions have threatened a total shutdown of Eskom’s operations unless it meets their demands for a 15 percent pay rise. Eskom plans to offer no increase. About 1,000 union members picketed outside its Megawatt Park headquarters in Johannesburg. Protesters at power plants blocked trucks carrying coal and buses ferrying staff, forcing some generating units to be switched off. Eskom, which produces more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power, narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year and was embroiled in corruption scandals surrounding friends of former president Jacob Zuma. It said in a statement that it expected the controlled outages - called load-shedding - to last from 5:40 p.m. (1540 GMT) until around 8 p.m. Shortly afterwards, traffic lights in central Johannesburg stopped working, while some bars showing the opening game of the soccer World Cup lost power. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA), who together represent more than 20,000 of Eskom’s 47,000 employees, say they want to send a “strong signal” to management. Thabiso Masha, who works in Eskom’s research department in Germiston, told Reuters outside Megawatt Park: “Zero percent is nonsense, we won’t stand for it. Petrol is going up, VAT is going up, so our pay is decreasing.” An employee in Eskom’s distribution operation in Johannesburg, who asked not to be named, said: “It’s not the workers’ fault that the company is suffering because of corruption ... They are preparing for job cuts.” Two workers held up a placard reading “0% equals 0 Megawatt”. Another read: “To hell austerity measures”. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said some power stations had reduced output because of “acts of sabotage and intimidation”. “There have been several incidents of road blockades, attacks on staff and wilful damage of electricity infrastructure. As a result, all road coal deliveries have been stopped for security reasons,” Eskom said in a statement. Stabilising Eskom’s finances is a priority for President Cyril Ramaphosa as he looks to rekindle growth after nine years of stagnation under Zuma. Ramaphosa oversaw the appointment of a new board and chief executive at Eskom in an attempt to clean up governance and set the company on a firmer financial footing. Separately, the energy regulator NERSA gave Eskom the go-ahead to raise prices to recover 32.7 billion rand ($2.5 billion) of costs incurred over three previous years, about half what the utility had requested. Eskom said it would study the decision before commenting.

The bank’s unexpectedly dovish guidance on interest rates overshadowed its statement that it aimed to wrap up its crisis-era stimulus program, quantitative easing, at the end of this year. The ECB now plans to reduce monthly asset purchases between October and December to 15 billion euros until the end of 2018 and then conclude the program, though ECB President Mario Draghi stressed that the governing council stood ready “to adjust all its instruments as appropriate.” Investors, though, seized on comments indicating that interest rates would stay at record lows at least through the summer of 2019. Some analysts believe it could be even longer. “With Draghi’s term of office due to expire at the end of October 2019, we feel the ECB is unlikely to start increasing interest rates until the new ECB president is firmly in place,” said David Zahn, head of European fixed income for Franklin Templeton.

2018-06-14,"(Adds stop in Manaus, Brazil) By Roberta Rampton WASHINGTON, June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence plans to visit volcano victims in Guatemala as part of a three-nation trip at the end of the month aimed at building Latin American ties and pressuring Venezuela, a White House official said on Thursday. Pence is scheduled to head to Brasilia during the last week of June, followed by a stop in the northern Amazonian city of Manaus, which is grappling with refugees who have fled Venezuela’s economic crisis, the official said. Pence has led the U.S. diplomatic push to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the socialist leader who the Trump administration blames for the deep recession and hyperinflation that have caused shortages of food and medicine in the once oil-rich nation. Washington has stepped up economic sanctions against individuals connected to Maduro and refused to recognize his re-election in a May 20 vote. Both countries have expelled each others’ diplomats. Trump has considered more sanctions on services related to oil shipments from the OPEC member nation, but so far has not opted to act on those. During the past year, Pence has visited leaders in Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Panama and Peru. At the end of June, he will also visit Quito, Ecuador, before stopping in Guatemala. At least 109 people were killed by a massive eruption of Guatemala’s Fuego volcano on June 3 that buried villagers in scalding ash and left nearly 200 missing.

2018-06-14,"BRUSSELS, June 14 (Reuters) - The European Union is seeking a date in early July to mediate talks between Russia and Ukraine over future gas transit to Europe once their contract expires in 2019, the EU’s energy chief told Reuters on Thursday. Russia’s expansion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline directly to Germany and the construction of the new Turkstream pipeline to Turkey has raised doubts about continued gas flows through Ukraine, the traditional route for supplies to Europe. EU leaders worry the new routes will allow Russian export monopoly Gazprom, which supplies over a quarter of the bloc’s gas needs, to cut volumes via Ukraine, depriving the struggling economy of valuable transit fees. “This is a priority on which we have a European consensus,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said. “We have a 100 percent consensus that the gas transits should be maintained in the post 2019 period.” He highlighted Germany’s support and what he said was its acknowldgement that the issue had “polarised” the bloc after Eastern European member states opposed the Nord Stream pipeline, of which Berlin is the main beneficiary. Sefcovic said he wanted talks to bring together political and company representatives from both Russian and Ukraine as well as diplomats from France and Germany. “I hope that we can start working out how we are going to go through these very complex issues,” he said. “If we solve this politically very sensitive issue then it would help us to solve other crucial issues for Europe but also for Russia.” Ukraine’s Nagftogaz is seeking firm guarantees on future transits, and Sefcovic said clarity over future pipeline operations were crucial for securing European investment to modernise the country’s gas transit system. “The best guarantee would be the long-term bookings and commercially viable volumes,” Sefcovic said.

2018-06-14,"OSLO, June 14 (Reuters) - A proposed capacity-based power tariff in Norway that will make it expensive for subscribers to overconsume electricity could trigger demand for battery storage, the country’s water resources and energy regulator (NVE) told Reuters. The new tariff, proposed by NVE and due to take effect from Jan. 1, 2021, is designed to replace the current volumetric regime, as under the current system consumers have more capacity available than they actually use, making network investments inefficient, said NVE. Under the new system, consumers may turn to energy storage solutions rather than pay the heavy premiums if their energy needs exceed their preset levels, helping develop Norway’s relatively small battery market. “Customers subscribe to a certain amount of network capacity at a given price per kW. Consumption beyond the subscribed level is charged at a  significantly higher price,” said NVE’s senior adviser Velaug Mook. By Jan. 1, 2019 all electricity customers will have a smart meter installed, providing better information regarding installed and used capacity and prices, which will allow them to calculate the subscription level they need, he said. “The proposed tariff model will give customers better incentives for storage of energy than today’s energy-based tariff,” added Mook. “Customers can use stored energy when their consumption is high, and retrieve energy from the network for storage when their consumption is low... Furthermore, batteries can be used to reduce the cost of charging electrical vehicles,” she said. The proposed change hasn’t found much support in the market, with companies fearing higher costs in case their energy needs’ assessment falls short. After receiving feedback from public consultations, NVE said it understands the proposed subscribed capacity model is not preferred and will assess whether there is a need for adjustments. Overall, costs are not expected to increase for network users, said Mook. Instead, the price for the use of electricity per kilowatt hour goes down, whilst pricing for simultaneous consumption in kilowatts is introduced.

May’s parliamentary election was marred by low turnout and allegations of fraud, stalling talks on forming a new government. Parliament mandated a nationwide manual recount of votes and some politicians called for it to be repeated. “Despite the violations and irregularities that tainted the election, following legal methods, obeying the law and the constitution, is the only way to solve these problems and move towards forming a new parliament and a government,” he said in a pre-recorded address.

The June 13 decision by Sweden’s Court of Appeal suspends a ruling by a Stockholm arbitration court that had found against Gazprom. With Gazprom disputing that decision, Naftogaz had been pursuing the Russian company’s foreign assets in the courts. The appeal court’s judgement is temporary, while it considers a final decision on Gazprom’s request that the Feb. 28 arbitration ruling be declared invalid, partially or in full. “The Court of Appeal finds reason to now decide that the arbitration ruling until further notice shall not be enforced,” the court said. Naftogaz said the decision was being made without the Ukrainian company being heard and that it would request it to be reversed.

2018-06-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cairn Energy (CNE.L) has bought a 50 percent stake in the Agar-Plantain oilfields in the British North Sea from Azinor Catalyst, the companies said on Thursday, amid renewed interest in North Sea assets. Oil producers are returning to the North Sea having sold many assets in the past few years, often to private equity investors, after oil prices collapsed. “There has clearly been a sentiment change in the North Sea. Certainly from our perspective since the beginning of the year. The oil price is up, costs remain low and it’s a really exciting window of opportunity to invest in the North Sea,” Azinor Managing Director Nick Terrell said. Azinor, which is backed by private equity firm Seacrest Capital and owns a portfolio of North Sea assets, discovered the Agar-Plantain fields in 2014 and said on Thursday that it expected to start drilling in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval.  First oil is expected in early 2022 from Agar and Plantain which have “estimated combined mid-case resources of 60 million barrels oil equivalent, with an upside case of 98 million barrels oil equivalent”, Azinor said. The companies did not say how much Cairn Energy paid. Azinor currently has nine licences in the British North Sea and plans to take part in the upcoming 31st offshore licensing round. Terrell said the company was open to a possible stock market listing. “Yes, that’s certainly a possiblity. We’re aggressively growing, increasing the value of our company and we will be pursuing a range of sources of capital... Seacrest have been a great investor for us and will continue to be so no doubt but clearly the capital markets are opening.” Renewed interest in North Sea assets was highlighted last month when Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) , BP (BP.L) and Norway’s Equinor EQRN.OL as well as smaller independent oil producers including Siccar Point, Chrysaor and Premier Oil (PMO.L) were awarded 229 blocks in the British North Sea.  Azinor is planning to sell further stakes next year as it prepares to drill more wells across its portfolio.

2018-06-14,"ZAGREB, June 14 (Reuters) - Croatia passed a law on Thursday to enable the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal, part of a European Union drive to diversify away from Russian gas imports. The terminal, which will be built on the island of Krk in the northern Adriatic Sea, will be partly funded by the EU but has been criticised by environmental groups and local councils. Environmentalists said ahead of the vote that they would stage fresh protests and may ask the Constitutional Court to rule if the law is in line with the constitution. The project will be built in two stages, involving a floating terminal followed by an onshore facility. The head of the company behind the project, LNG Hrvatska, recently said the cost of the floating terminal had been cut by 90 million euros ($105 million) to 250 million euros and its capacity scaled down to ensure its profitability. The EU has said it would provide 101.4 million euros, while the remainder will be financed from equity and loans. The law, which the government said was designed to help untangle property issues and other factors, was supported by 77 lawmakers in the 151 seat-parliament. The terminal would supply gas to countries in eastern and central Europe, regions heavily dependent on Russian gas. Before the vote, opposition lawmakers called on parliament to reject it on environmental grounds and some also questioned its profitability and said it may endanger tourism, the main engine of Croatia’s economic growth. The energy and environment ministry has said the terminal would not pose a significant threat to the environment or tourism. LNG Croatia is currently running a tender for delivery of a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) for the terminal. An FSRU is a special type of ship whereby LNG brought in by tanker is converted back to gas to feed into the grid. The tender expires on June 15. The company is also preparing a second round of bidding for use of the terminal’s planned capacity of 2.6 billion cubic metres of gas a year. The first round of bidding for the capacity of the terminal drew little interest. U.S. government officials have said that U.S. energy firms are keen to be major suppliers for the terminal, but no decision has been taken.

2018-06-14,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) could face additional fines in Munich and Stuttgart on top of the 1 billion euros ($1.2 bln) it has been told to pay for management lapses which caused emissions cheating on 11 million VW diesel cars. Prosecutors in the German town of Braunschweig used a so-called administrative order to fine Volkswagen for oversight problems which allowed millions of polluting VW cars to hit the road. The fine is one of the biggest ever penalties imposed by German authorities against a company.  It deals yet another blow to one of Germany’s big industries which is struggling to recover from the fallout from the emissions cheating scandal that broke in Sept. 2015. The 1 billion euro fine is not included in the 25.8 billion euros ($30 billion) that Europe’s biggest carmaker has set aside to cover costs related to its admission that it cheated U.S. diesel emissions tests, and it will hit earnings, analysts at Evercore ISI said. But shareholders should welcome the move since it marks an end to some of the criminal proceedings against the carmaker, they added. However, that is not the end of VW’s legal problems. Prosecutors in the southern city of Munich said they too are examining whether to impose similar fines on VW’s premium division Audi (NSUG.DE), for its role manipulating 6 and 8 cylinder diesel engines. That would be in addition to Braunschweig’s fine which sanctioned violations tied to 4-cylinder diesel engines. Stuttgart prosecutors, who have launched a probe against employees at Daimler, Porsche, which is another part of the Volkswagen group, and auto supplier Bosch said they too may consider the use of an administrative order. “In all these proceedings it is possible that a regulatory offense procedure will be carried out, we are still evaluating this possibility,” a spokesman for the Stuttgart prosecutor’s office said on Thursday. Prosecutors in Braunschweig are also investigating  Volkswagen executives including chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch and chief executive Herbert Diess to see if they informed investors in a timely fashion about the scale of potential fines faced by the carmaker for cheating U.S. emissions tests. The company denies any wrongdoing by its executives. Braunschweig said it may rule on the matter in the coming months. The town is the main legal jurisdiction covering VW’s headquarters in the German town of Wolfsburg. “On market manipulation, it is possible that there will be a decision this year. A decision does not necessarily mean bringing charges, it could mean closing the proceedings,” Braunschweig prosecutor Klaus Ziehe said at a news conference. In a filing submitted to a Braunschweig court on Feb. 28, Volkswagen argued it did not violate corporate disclosure rules because it did not understand the scope of potential fines and claims faced by the company. Four days before U.S. regulators blew the whistle on Volkswagen, Poetsch - the company’s chief financial officer at the time - saw the potential financial risk from emissions violations at 150 million euros, the court filing shows.  U.S. authorities disclosed Volkswagen’s systematic emissions cheating on Sept. 18, 2015, sparking the biggest business scandal in the company’s history and triggering a crackdown on emissions across the industry. Volkswagen shares were up 2.5 percent by 1400 GMT, outperforming the blue-chip DAX index .GDAXI and the Stoxx 600 Autos index.

2018-06-14,"* Euro slides as ECB vow to keep sub-zero rates till next year * European shares swing higher, Wall Street opens up * Fed raised rates as expected, sees 2 more hikes this year * Concerns about U.S.-China trade war cast shadow * China data surprisingly soft * Battered EM currencies hit again as dollar surges By Marc Jones LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro suffered its biggest fall in eight months and share and bond markets rallied on Thursday, after the European Central Bank vowed not to raise euro zone interest rates before the middle of next year. The bank said it was pulling the plug on its 2.55 trillion euro stimulus programme, but after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year on Wednesday, the ECB rate promise came as a relief. The pan-European STOXX 600 index raced back into positive territory after a morning in the red, and Wall Street opened higher, though basic resources stocks stayed down after weak data from big metals consumer China. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 led the European stocks rebound as the euro tumbled back under $1.17 from well over $1.18. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary (to get inflation back to near 2 percent),” the ECB said. Government borrowing costs slid too as traders recalibrated for a longer period of sub-zero ECB rates. Germany’s 10-year Bunds were offering 0.45 percent compared with 0.49 percent before the ECB statement. U.S. Treasuries meanwhile were down to 2.94 percent having briefly topped 3 percent overnight after the Fed pushed up its interest rates.. ECB chief Mario Draghi explained at a news conference that there were a number of complications for policymakers. An increasingly murky economic European outlook could extend into next year in some countries, he said, also acknowledging a developing trade war with the United States and a populist challenge from Italy’s new government. On the latter, he said there had been no “significant” contagion, and nothing like the turmoil seen when Greece’s future in the euro was teetering in the balance. “The ECB has insisted publicly that political events would not dictate its action, but we think it might have taken a different view if recent political turmoil in Italy or Spain had exacerbated,” said David Zahn, the head of European fixed income at Franklin Templeton’s fixed income group. Also keeping investors in check were concerns about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump was due to meet with his trade advisers later on Thursday to decide whether to activate the tariffs. . Top U.S. trade officials will also meet Canadian counterparts for the first time since last week’s bitter exchanges between their countries’ leaders at a G7 meeting. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones and Nasdaq all started higher though. boosted by the ECB’s signals and updated data that included the best retail sales figures in six months and an unexpected dip in jobless claims.. That saw the dollar kick all the way up to $1.1670 per euro from its pre-ECB level of $1.1820, clamber back to 110.13 yen, and approach a 3-month high against Canada’s dollar. The dollar index, which tracks it against six top currencies, swung round to be 0.5 percent higher too after spending the European morning 0.4 percent lower. In Asia overnight, surprisingly soft Chinese retail sales and investment data had hit sentiment. China’s central bank also showed caution as it left its interest rates on hold, rather than follow the Fed as it sometimes does. . MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1 percent. South Korea and Taiwan fell by over 1.8 and 1.4 percent. Mainland China’s Shanghai composite index hit a 20-month closing low, while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1 percent. Another event markets are gearing up for was the start of soccer’s World Cup in Russia. Russia’s time zones mean there will be more matches during European or U.S. and Latin American trading hours than any previous tournament. A study done during the last World Cup with similarly timed games, the 2010 finals in South Africa, showed trading volumes on share markets dropped by a third on average when matches were on, and 55 percent when a market’s own team played. Among commodities, China-sensitive industrial metals sagged but gold and other precious metals made ground. oil prices were little changed, underpinned by a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer. Brent and U.S. crude futures traded at $76.57 and $66.97 a barrel respectively, to extend their recovery from eight-week lows touched last week. Additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes; Editing by Janet

2018-06-14,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU negotiators on Thursday agreed to phase out the use of palm oil in transport fuels from 2030, setting up a clash with producer countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia. A text of the deal, seen by Reuters, leaves the wording on details of curbs on palm oil “yet to be agreed”, with EU sources saying the matter remains politically sensitive.   Limits on conventional biofuels in transport will be frozen at the national level at 2020 but must not surpass 7 percent, the text says.   Green lawmaker Bas Eickhout, one of the negotiators in tough talks that ran until the early morning, said the use of palm oil would be capped at 2019 levels until 2023 and reduced to zero by 2030. “That is quite a victory. There is no precedent for a phase-out of the use of specific crops,” said Eickhout. The European Parliament caused an outcry among palm producers in Asia when it called in January for a total ban on palm oil use in road fuel, as part of its negotiating position for talks with member states to hammer out the final deal. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, which produce the majority of the palm oil imported into Europe, had warned ahead of Thursday’s agreement they would retaliate against what they called protectionist measures, if a ban was introduced.  A 2015 study funded by the European Commission found that palm oil and soybean oil had the highest indirect greenhouse gas emissions because of the deforestation and the drainage of peatlands associated with their cultivation. “Governments now have no more excuse to force drivers to burn food or palm oil in their tanks after 2020,” said Laura Buffet at campaign group Transport & Environment.    Palm oil has been used increasingly as a feedstock for biofuels because it is cheaper than locally produced rapeseed oil. Half of the EU’s 6 billion euros ($7 billion) worth of palm oil imports are used for biodiesel, according to data from Copenhagen Economics. Thursday’s agreement is part of a broader legislative package aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. This is part of the bloc’s commitment to the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels.

2018-06-14,"BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian presidential candidate Ciro Gomes has sounded out steelmaking tycoon Benjamin Steinbruch as a possible vice presidential running mate in October and he would join the ticket if invited, a person close to Steinbruch told Reuters. Such a ticket joining the centre-left populist from northeast Brazil with a billionaire industrialist family from the wealthier southeast would be expected to boost Brazilian national industry with strong state backing if elected. Steinbruch is the chief executive of Cia Siderúrgica Nacional SA, Brazil’s second-largest steel company, and a member of its controlling shareholder bloc. He recently joined the centre-right Progressive Party, which could back Gomes, the former governor of Ceará. “Ciro sounded him out directly,” said the source, who is close to the businessman. “Nothing has been decided, but if Steinbruch is invited, he will accept. He feels very honoured.” Steinbruch recently took leave form his position as vice president of the powerful Sao Paulo industrial lobby FIESP with a view to running for public office. He fits the profile of the running mate Gomes has said he wants. The two men have known each other for three decades. Gomes was a CSN director for two years until May 2016 and ran Transnordestina Logística, a subsidiary building a railway to carry iron ore and grain to northeastern ports. Cid Gomes, the candidate’s brother and informal campaign manager, said Steinbruch fits the bill, but no decision would be taken until alliances with other parties are settled. The brothers’ Democratic Labor Party (PDT) is seeking to build a broader coalition for the race. “Ciro has said that his vice presidential running mate should be someone from industry in southern Brazil,” Cid Gomes told Reuters. With former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva barred from the October election due to a corruption conviction, Ciro Gomes is well placed to become the standard bearer of Brazil’s left. He is running third in early polling, with 10 percent of voter support, trailing environmentalist Marina Silva, who has 15 percent, and far-right Congressman Jair Bolsonaro, with 19 percent, according to pollster Datafolha. Gomes has said he is seeking the support of the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), another centre-left party with strong northeastern roots that might ask for a place on the ticket. Steinbruch would accept a cabinet position as industry minister if he is not asked to be running mate, the source said.

2018-06-14," LONDON (Reuters) - Growth in global oil consumption has accelerated significantly since prices slumped in 2014 – highlighting the critical role demand plays in balancing the market. Lower oil prices stimulated OECD consumption between 2015 and 2017 and played a big role in eliminating the global oil market surplus during the rebalancing phase of the cycle. With oil prices up 70 percent over the last 12 months, however, higher prices are set to moderate OECD consumption and thereby global demand growth in 2018/19. Economists often observe that the price-elasticity of oil demand is low, meaning a small change in prices does not have much impact on the amount consumed in the short term. But low impact does not mean no impact. In the case of a large and sustained change, such as occurred in 2014/15, consumption has proved significantly flexible and plays a key role in rebalancing the market. According to the latest estimates from BP, global consumption increased by almost 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2017 (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). Consumption has risen by an average of 1.7 million bpd in the last three years since oil prices slumped (2015-2017) compared with an average of just 1.1 million bpd in the three previous years (2012-2014). Real crude oil prices averaged $51 per barrel between 2015 and 2017, down from $112 between 2012 and 2014, according to BP. Lower oil prices have helped stimulate faster consumption growth, especially in the industrialised countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2Mo4xts) OECD consumption rose by an average of 580,000 bpd in 2015-2017 compared with an average decline of 280,000 bpd in 2012-2014. By contrast, growth in the non-OECD economies slowed slightly, to an average annual rate of 1.2 million bpd from 1.4 million bpd earlier. Faster growth in the OECD economies has accounted for all the acceleration in global fuel consumption since the slump. The BP data underscores the important role that oil price and consumption changes in the advanced economies play in balancing the market. Consumption in the rapidly developing non-OECD economies tends to be more strongly influenced by incomes and economic growth. In the more mature OECD economies, however, consumption is more strongly influenced by large and sustained price changes. Non-OECD economies now account for the majority of global oil consumption (51 million bpd) compared with the OECD countries (47 million bpd). Non-OECD economies also accounted for all consumption growth over the last ten years (+14 million bpd) while OECD consumption fell (-3 million bpd). Even in the most recent three-year period, non-OECD use rose much faster (+3.5 million bpd) than in the OECD (+1.7 million bpd). Non-OECD countries’ strongly rising oil demand linked to their economic development has been the principal driver of increasing oil consumption at global level. But on a year-to-year basis, consumption changes in the more price-sensitive OECD have played a critical role in stimulating or moderating the growth rate. In other words, the non-OECD economies are responsible for the overall rising trend in consumption but the non-OECD economies are significantly responsible for year-to-year variations in growth around that trend. OECD oil consumption may now account for a minority of global demand, and the annual changes may be relatively small, but they still play a critical role in market balancing. The impact is clear in consumption statistics at national level, especially for the United States, where low levels of taxation ensure changes in crude prices have a big impact on the final cost of fuels to consumers. U.S. gasoline consumption increased by an annual average of 133,000 bpd in 2015-2017 compared with an average of just 56,000 bpd in 2012-2014, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Consumption growth was especially pronounced in 2015 (+257,000 bpd) and 2016 (+139,000 bpd) when prices were low, compared with the much higher-priced 2011 (-240,000 bpd) and 2012 (-71,000 bpd). The EIA currently predicts U.S. gasoline consumption will increase by just 20,000 bpd in 2018 and 40,000 bpd in 2019 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018).

The bank said it was pulling the plug on its 2.55 trillion euro stimulus programme but after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year on Wednesday the ECB rate promise came as a relief. The pan-European STOXX 600 index raced back into positive territory after a morning in the red, though basic resources stocks stayed down more than 1 percent after weak data from big metals consumer China. Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC40 led the stocks rebound, while the euro tumbled back towards $1.17 from well over $1.18 . Euro zone government borrowing costs slid too as traders recalibrated prices for a longer period of sub-zero ECB rates. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019 and in any case for as long as necessary (to get inflation back to near 2 percent),” the ECB said. Germany’s Bunds were offering 0.46 percent compared with 0.49 percent before the ECB statement. U.S. Treasuries meanwhile were down to 2.94 percent having briefly topped 3 percent overnight after the Federal Reserve had pushed up its interest rates.. “I think its pragmatic for the Fed to take these moves, because if you are not going to make them now, when are you going to take them?” Kully Samra, European managing director at $3 trillion U.S. asset manager Charles Schwab, said. The ECB had probably been too slow to reduce stimulus, Samra added, though recent weaker data showed Europe still had underlying issues. The bank’s chief Mario Draghi holds a news conference at 1230 GMT to explain the decision. His biggest complication is the increasingly murky economic European outlook, a developing trade war with the United States, a populist challenge from Italy’s new government and softening export demand. Also keeping investors in check were concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. In Asia, surprisingly soft Chinese retail sales and investment data had also hit sentiment.

2018-06-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Global warming is on course to exceed the most stringent goal set in the Paris agreement by around 2040, threatening economic growth, according to a draft report that is the U.N.’s starkest warning yet of the risks of climate change. Governments can still cap temperatures below the strict 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7° Fahrenheit) ceiling agreed in 2015 only with “rapid and far-reaching” transitions in the world economy, according to the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The final government draft, obtained by Reuters and dated June 4, is due for publication in October in South Korea after revisions and approval by governments.  It will be the main scientific guide for combating climate change. “If emissions continue at their present rate, human-induced warming will exceed 1.5°C by around 2040,” according to the report, which broadly reaffirms findings in an earlier draft in January but is more robust, after 25,000 comments from experts and a wider pool of scientific literature. The Paris climate agreement, adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015, set a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2°C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for the tougher 1.5° goal. The deal has been weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump decided last year to pull out and promote U.S. fossil fuels. (nL1N1IZ1BA) Temperatures are already up about 1°C (1.8°F) and are rising at a rate of about 0.2°C a decade, according to the draft, requested by world leaders as part of the Paris Agreement. “Economic growth is projected to be lower at 2°C warming than at 1.5° for many developed and developing countries,” it said, drained by impacts such as floods or droughts that can undermine crop growth or an increase in human deaths from heatwaves. In a plus-1.5°C world, for instance, sea level rise would be 10 centimeters (3.94 inches) less than with 2°C, exposing about 10 million fewer people in coastal areas to risks such as floods, storm surges or salt spray damaging crops. It says current government pledges in the Paris Agreement are too weak to limit warming to 1.5°C. IPCC spokesman Jonathan Lynn said it did not comment on the contents of draft reports while work was still ongoing. “It’s all a bit punchier,” said one official with access to the report who said it seemed slightly less pessimistic about prospects of limiting a rise in global temperatures that will affect the poorest nations hardest.  The report outlines one new scenario to stay below 1.5°C, for instance, in which technological innovations and changes in lifestyles could mean sharply lower energy demand by 2050 even with rising economic growth. And there is no sign that the draft has been watered down by Trump’s doubts that climate change is driven by man-made greenhouse gases. The draft says renewable energies, such as wind, solar and hydro power, would have to surge by 60 percent from 2020 levels by 2050 to stay below 1.5°C “while primary energy from coal decreases by two-thirds”. By 2050, that meant renewables would supply between 49 and 67 percent of primary energy. The report says governments may have to find ways to extract vast amounts of carbon from the air, for instance by planting vast forests, to turn down the global thermostat if warming overshoots the 1.5°C target. It omits radical geo-engineering fixes such as spraying chemicals high into the atmosphere to dim sunlight, saying such measures “face large uncertainties and knowledge gaps.” Reporting By Alister Doyle; editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-report/exclusive-global-warming-set-to-exceed-1-5c-slow-growth-un-draft-idUKL8N1TG36K,14 Jun 2018,"Global warming is on course to

2018-06-14,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 14 (Reuters) - Discussion in the crude oil market is degenerating into a single “will they or won’t they” focus on whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will ease their output restrictions next week. While the meeting in Vienna on June 22 will undoubtedly heavily influence the direction of short-term crude prices, the market’s focus solely on supply could be viewed as somewhat myopic. Demand is probably the more important driver of the oil price over the longer term, and the simple truth is that the global market is effectively now hostage to just two countries. China and India have so far this year accounted for about 69 percent of the expected growth in crude oil demand, meaning that what happens in those two behemoths is likely of far more importance to the crude market than what may or may not happen in Vienna. The International Energy Agency forecast last month that global crude oil demand would rise by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, down from an earlier estimate of 1.5 million bpd. For the first five months of the year China’s crude oil imports were 9.21 million bpd, according to customs data, a rise of 690,000 bpd on the same period in 2017. India’s crude imports were 4.57 million bpd in the January-May period, up 272,000 bpd from the same period last year, according to vessel and port data and industry sources. Together these two countries, the world’s biggest and third-largest crude importers, have brought in 962,000 bpd more in the first five months of 2018 than in same period last year. If this pace of growth was maintained for the whole year, it would mean that China and India would account for the lion’s share of the IEA’s forecast for the increase in global demand. Most investors or companies would tell you that having more than two-thirds of your expected growth exposed to just two players is extremely risky, yet the oil market seems almost blase about the outlook for both these countries. While the majority of economic forecasts are for strong outcomes in both China and India, they aren’t without risks, and those risks may be rising. For China there is the perennial threat of credit problems, with several parts of the economy still highly leveraged and struggling to service loans. There is also the rising risk of an escalation of trade tensions and a tariff war with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. And then there is the government’s policy of reducing air pollution, which is resulting in a shift to electric cars and trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). For India the greatest risk to its economic outlook is high energy prices, given its reliance on imported crude and natural gas, and to some extent imported coal. The price of a litre of diesel in the capital New Delhi was 67.85 Indian rupees ($1.00) on Wednesday, which is up 27 percent from this time a year ago. The price of Brent crude has risen by about 71 percent in the past year, meaning Indian consumers have been spared the worst of the increase, but there have to be question marks over how long the government can lean on the state-owned refiners to absorb the cost increase. Overall, there is no immediate reason to expect lower crude oil demand growth in China and India, but the risks are mainly angled toward an easing rather than an acceleration.

After the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year and hinted at two more, it was shaping up to be a double-whammy for risk assets that have risen sharply in value during years of ultra-cheap borrowing. All sectors on the pan-European STOXX 600 index were in negative territory. Basic resources stocks led the decline with a 1.5 drop after weak economic data too from big metals consumer China. The dollar had popped higher after the Fed’s move, but faded in Asia and was still falling as the euro pushed above $1.1820 before the ECB decision. Euro zone government bond yields also edged up with Germany’s Bunds offering 0.49 percent versus the 2.96 percent from U.S. Treasuries which had briefly topped 3 percent overnight. “I think its pragmatic for the Fed to take these moves, because if you are not going to make them now, when are you going to take them,” Kully Samra, European managing director at $3 trillion U.S. asset manager Charles Schwab, said. The ECB had probably been too slow to reduce stimulus, Samra added, though recent weaker data showed Europe still had underlying issues. Also keeping investors in check were concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. In Asia, surprisingly soft Chinese retail sales and investment data had hit sentiment too. China’s central bank then left its interest rates on hold, rather than follow the Fed as it sometimes does. . MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1 percent. Shares in South Korea and Taiwan fell over 1.8 and 1.4 percent, Japan’s Nikkei dropped 1 percent while mainland China’s Shanghai composite index hit a 20-month closing low. Any changes to the ECB’s asset-purchase programme should appear in a post-meeting statement due at 1145 GMT. The bank’s chief Mario Draghi then holds a news conference at 1230 GMT. The biggest complication might be the increasingly murky economic European outlook. The continent faces a developing trade war with the United States, a populist challenge from Italy’s new government and softening export demand. “It would be wise (for the ECB) to lay out policy for the remainder of the year so any unexpected events over the summer, for instance from Italy, don’t interfere with its plans,” KBC interest rate strategist Mathias van der Jeugt said. Another event markets were gearing up for was the start of soccer’s World Cup in Russia. Russia’s timezones mean there will be more matches during European or U.S. and Latin American trading hours than any previous tournament. A study done during the last one with similarly timed games — the 2010 finals in South Africa — showed trading volumes on share markets dropped by a third on average when matches were on and 55 percent when a market’s own team played . U.S. retail sales figures were also due too. S&P 500 and Dow Jones and Nasdaq futures all pointed to subdued restart later. The dollar stood at 110.06 yen after falling from a three-week high of 110.85 following the Fed’s decision. The dollar index, which tracks it again six top currencies, was down 0.4 percent having erased all of its week’s gains. The Australian dollar fell 0.35 percent to $0.7551 after China’s poor economic data, but the yuan showed little reaction, especially after the PBOC opted not to raise its rates. “There is no urgency for China to maintain its favourable yield differential against the United States as capital outflow and currency stability is no longer the key concern for China at the moment,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC Bank. “With U.S.-China trade war looming, a slightly weaker yuan may be in China’s favour.” Some emerging market currencies have been hit hard by worries higher U.S. interest rates could prompt investors to shift funds to the United States. The dip in the dollar on Thursday brought welcome relief. South Africa’s rand rebounded from a six-month low, the Turkish lira pulled out of a dive and the Mexican peso recovered from a 16-month low. Among commodities, China-sensitive industrial metals sagged but gold and other precious metals made ground. oil prices were little changed, underpinned by a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer.

2018-06-14,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Only a few years ago, shale CEOs and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries were in open conflict. Now, they realise they’re in the same boat and need to row in tandem to keep global crude supply and demand in balance, according to interviews with analysts, executives and investors.  The recent rise in crude prices LCOc1CLc1 - up more than 40 percent in the past year - has lifted profits for producers across the globe, but also threatens to erode demand for fossil fuels at a time when electrification is becoming commonplace.  “We’re getting to a point where a continued rise in the oil price is going to cause major problems for the global economy,” said Amy Meyers Jaffe, director of the programme on energy security and climate change at the Council on Foreign Relations.  “There are bigger issues at hand besides output that OPEC and shale producers care about.” OPEC and U.S. representatives have met at least twice this year, with a third high-profile meeting set for Vienna next week. Finding the optimal balance of crude supply and demand will be the hot topic. Harold Hamm, the billionaire founder of U.S. shale pioneer Continental Resources Inc (CLR.N), is due to address OPEC ministers, along with fellow shale executives Hess Corp (HES.N) CEO John Hess and Pioneer Natural Resource Co (PXD.N) Executive Chairman Scott Sheffield. Hamm and Hess did not respond to requests for comment ahead of the meeting. Sheffield declined to comment. “I wouldn’t take dialogue and discussion as any kind of collaboration. We’re all talking about what does world demand look like for oil,” said U.S. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a North Dakota Democrat who successfully pushed to lift the U.S. oil export ban in 2015.  Lifting that ban ushered in a sea change in global energy, sending nearly 2 million barrels of U.S. crude to India, China and other markets historically dominated by OPEC and forcing the group and its American rivals to be more conciliatory. Hamm, who called OPEC a “toothless tiger” in 2014, has begun encouraging fellow shale companies to focus more on profitability and less on profligate production. Last month, Hamm addressed a Saudi Aramco board meeting in Houston. It was a change in tone for Hamm, who in 2011 erected a granite monument on the windswept plains of North Dakota that boasted of the rising clout of U.S. oil production and the nation’s ability to supply its own energy.  The monument to one of the first horizontal shale wells drilled in the United States bragged that Continental had helped dispel “the myth that America was running out of oil” and would help the country beat global competitors.     Khalid al-Falih, chairman of state oil giant Aramco and the Saudi energy minister, will be in Vienna along with fellow OPEC ministers to debate whether to extend recent production curbs.  U.S. shale executives will not be part of those discussions, but will meet elsewhere in Vienna during the week with Falih and other OPEC ministers.     U.S. shale producers are prohibited by antitrust law from coordinating their output, making their desire with OPEC to curb volatility and price spikes a difficult one. “U.S. oil and gas producers need stable oil prices to be successful, not necessarily higher oil prices,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager of Tortoise Energy Independence Fund (NDP.N), which holds shares of Pioneer and other U.S. producers. Indeed, some U.S. executives are staying away from Vienna. Mark Papa, the CEO of Centennial Resource Development Inc (CDEV.O), and Ryan Lance, CEO of ConocoPhillips (COP.N), had been slated to attend but backed out. Lance had been due to speak on a panel with several Persian Gulf producers, but grew concerned that it would seem as if he were the designate U.S. representative at such a forum, according to a source familiar with the company’s thinking. Conoco declined to comment. Papa did not respond to a request for comment.  OPEC ministers are expected to question the U.S. shale executives about rising output from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, which pumps more than 3 million barrels per day. “There is a tsunami of oil coming from the Permian,” said Pete Bowden, global head of energy investment banking at Jefferies. “That is a game-changer, not just for the industry domestically, but for international oil and gas supply/demand dynamics.” With U.S. crude exports at a record high, rising Permian production has become more of a concern for OPEC than at any time in history. “We expect that they (U.S. shale producers) remain independent and do what’s in the best interest of their country,” Senator Heitkamp said. “We’re not going to join OPEC, and we’re going to be fiercely competing with them.”     That competition, though, increasingly includes a realization that the fate of both sides is tied. “Consumers will move to electric cars if the oil price spikes,” CFR’s Jaffe said.

2018-06-14,"(Repeats for wider distribution) By David French NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - With oil price recovery taking hold, several U.S. oil and gas companies entered 2018 with a compelling plan - sell undeveloped or less essential fields and invest the money to boost returns from their sweetest, most productive spots. There is a catch, though. The strategy assumes that with crude now up more than 150 percent from its February 2016 bottom enough firms are keen to crank up production, even if it means buying fields with higher extraction costs and lower margins. So far, sale attempts suggest those buyers may be hard to come by. After a bruising downturn, shareholders are looking to get a cut of improved profits and asset sale proceeds rather than underwrite acquisitions, those involved in these deals say. “Oil and gas companies are no longer rewarded for simply ‘grabbing land’ and public investors have become more discerning regarding acquisitions,” notes Jon Marinelli, head of U.S. energy investment and corporate banking at BMO Capital Markets. Shares of Devon Energy Corp, QEP Resources Inc and Southwestern Energy Co and others have rallied after they floated plans to sell non-core acreage, reflecting hopes that some of the proceeds will return to investors. But since shareholders across the industry in general favor shedding assets over acquisitions, the sentiment makes striking new deals tricky. An informal poll of five investment bankers by Reuters put the share of sales that failed to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of this year at between 50 percent and 80 percent, with Marinelli putting the figure at around two-thirds. Dealmaking for oil and gas fields going into 2018 was already stagnating. While last year's total sales were only marginally down from 2016 at $67.3 billion, the first quarter accounted for around 38 percent of that figure, according to data provider PLS. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2Lm2hl3) If proposed sales fail to materialize this year, it could mean a time of reckoning for these oil and gas firms. “If these companies cannot execute the divestiture(s) that gave investors’ confidence on their future leverage profile, you would likely see less risk-tolerant investors trim or sell their positions,” said Tim Dumois, portfolio manager at BP Capital Fund Advisors, which invests in energy stocks. Among those seeking spin-offs, Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd  has the most ambitious plans. Facing the same pressure from shareholders as U.S. energy producers, it wants to sell onshore shale assets in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins, valuing them at $14 billion on its balance sheet. While BHP’s Permian and Eagle Ford land is generally considered attractive because of low production costs, one of the Eagle Ford asset packages and its Haynesville fields mainly produce shale gas, making them less appealing to buyers given stubbornly-low gas prices. BHP would consider a bid that valued the entire business below the company’s original valuation, if it ensured no unsold assets remained, according to people familiar with the sale process. The company received bids from interested parties on May 23, although a final decision on what it will do is not expected for a few months. For those weighing acquisitions, Bakken operator Oasis Petroleum offers a cautionary tale. Shares in the company fell as much as 25 percent in the two days after it said on Dec. 11 it paid $946 million for acreage in the Delaware Basin. Since then, major land purchases by U.S. oil and gas firms have fizzled, with executives preaching focus on controlling costs and avoiding unnecessary expansion. “We can do a whole lot of great work by hitting some singles,” Brad Holly, chief executive officer of Whiting Petroleum Corp, told an industry event in April, drawing on a baseball metaphor to describe how the company was looking for some “really small things” to add to its existing acreage. In the absence of companies as buyers, private equity firms have picked up some slack: the value of land bought by buyout firms rose to 47 percent of the total in the fourth quarter from 11 percent in the first three months of 2017, according to PLS. However, the run-up in oil prices, rather than whet their appetite further has an opposite effect, making private equity firms wary that prices may not be as strong when they are ready to cash out. Higher crude prices also boost sellers’ expectations, making it harder for buyout firms to drive a hard bargain to ensure better future profits. Such calculations gain added significance after years of returns on energy stocks trailing other sectors. “If energy equity markets are underperforming the wider S&P, this reduces the chance of private equity buying larger assets because you don’t think you’ll get a good runway for an exit,” said Glenn Jacobson, partner at Trilantic Capital Partners. Some sellers have now started moderating their expectations. Hunt Oil Company for example, owned by one of Texas’ wealthiest families, split a package of Eagle Ford land it was marketing for up to $700 million in the fourth quarter into three individual pieces, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Two bits went to private equity buyers, with a third sold to Penn Virginia Corp for $86 million, the person added. “The decision becomes do you hold your nose and sell, or do you retain the asset,” said BMO’s Marinelli.

2018-06-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway, Europe’s largest hydropower producer, faces higher energy costs this summer as much of the snow accumulating in its mountains evaporated or melted into the ground during a shock heat wave, its water resources and energy regulator said. Following an unusually cold winter that depleted power producers’ reservoirs more than usual, companies had relied on a gradual spring melt to replenish dams, but projections now show this is no longer feasible, the NVE directorate told Reuters. “Some customers may not be happy with their power bill in 2018, but that is the cost of a weather dependent power system. In wet and normal years, power prices tend to be lower,” NVE adviser Martin Andreas Vik said. With about 96 percent of Norway’s energy needs covered by electricity from hydropower, the expected lower reservoir levels drove spot power prices to above 45 euros per megawatt hour on average this week, double year-on-year. From mid-May to early June, temperatures in southern Norway hit records for that time of the year, exceeding 30 degrees Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) and leading many municipalities to ban outdoor barbecuing to prevent fires. “This is the driest three-week period ever recorded, with measurements from 1958 until today,” Vik said, as projections showed more snow had evaporated or melted into the ground than had flowed into reservoirs. “The melting season is not over, but we have less snow left in Norway than normal,” Vik added. By June 3, the remaining snow that had yet to melt in mountain regions corresponded to an estimated future power output of 10 Terawatt hours, as opposed to 32 TWh in a normal year, he said. By June 11, Norway’s reservoirs were 56.8 percent full, still higher than last year’s 54.7 percent, but with much less snow left to melt it was only rain that could significantly increase it. Last year, reservoir fillings peaked at 86.5 percent in late October. In 2018, the peak will come much earlier as Norway has so far received 25 TWh less rain and snow than normal, equal to 30 percent in reservoir capacity, NVE said. While the cold winter and subsequent smaller inflows drove Norway’s prices higher, they were not the only market driver, Vik said. Increasing CO2 and coal prices, combined with low wind power production in Europe, made Norwegian electricity more competitive to export, and even during the dry period Norway continued to supply its neighbors through interconnections.

2018-06-14,"LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - Cairn Energy has bought a 50 percent stake in the Agar-Plantain oilfields in the British North Sea from Azinor Catalyst, the companies said on Thursday. The investment by Cairn is another sign that North Sea assets are becoming attractive again to oil producers, which sold assets in the past few years, often to private equity investors, and cut costs after oil prices collapsed. Azinor, which is backed by private equity firm Seacrest Capital and owns a portfolio of North Sea assets, discovered the Agar-Plantain fields in 2014 and said on Thursday that it expected to start drilling in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval. Agar and Plantain have “estimated combined mid-case resources of 60 million barrels oil equivalent, with an upside case of 98 million barrels oil equivalent”, Azinor said. The companies did not say how much Cairn Energy paid for its stake.

2018-06-14,"* Fed raised rates as expected, sees 2 more rate hikes this year * Concerns about U.S.-China trade war cast shadow * China data surprisingly soft * Dollar quickly loses steam after jump on Fed, focus on ECB * European shares fall 0.5 pct * Battered EM currencies enjoy relief thanks to weaker dollar By Marc Jones LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - The euro rose to its highest in a month but world stocks wilted on Thursday, as the European Central Bank prepared to pull the plug on its 2.55 trillion-euro, three-year stimulus programme. After the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year and hinted at two more, it was shaping up to be a double-whammy for risk assets that have gained during years of ultra-cheap borrowing conditions. All sectors on the pan-European STOXX 600 index were in negative territory. Basic resources stocks led the decline with a 1.3 drop following weak data from big metals consumer China. The dollar had risen after the Fed’s move, then faded in Asia and was still falling as the euro pushed above $1.1820 before the ECB met. Euro zone government bond yields also edged up with Germany Bund offering 0.49 percent. U.S. Treasuries drifted back though to 2.96 percent after briefly topping 3 percent overnight. “I think its pragmatic for the Fed to take these moves, because if you are not going to make them now, when are you going to take them,” Kully Samra, European managing director at $3 trillion U.S. asset manager Charles Schwab, said. The ECB had probably been too slow to reduce stimulus, Samara said, though recent weaker data showed Europe still had underlying issues. In Asia, surprisingly soft Chinese retail sales and investment data had also hit sentiment. China’s central bank left its interest rates on hold, rather than follow the Fed, as it often does . MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.0 percent. Shares in South Korea and Taiwan fell over one percent. Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.6 percent. In mainland China, the Shanghai composite index hit a 20-month closing low, shedding 0.4 percent. Any changes to the ECB’s asset-purchase programme should appear in the ECB policy statement at 1145 GMT. The bank’s chief Mario Draghi then holds a news conference at 1230 GMT. The biggest complication for the ECB might be the increasingly murky economic outlook. The continent faces a developing trade war with the United States, a populist challenge from Italy’s new government and softening export demand. Also keeping investors in check were concern about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his trade advisers later to decide whether to activate the tariffs, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones had both lost 0.4 to 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.11 percent. Futures markets pointed to subdued restart later. The dollar stood at 110.06 yen after falling from a three-week high of 110.85 following the Fed’s decision. The dollar index, which tracks it again six top currencies, also erased all of this week’s gains. The Australian dollar fell 0.35 percent to $0.7551 after China’s poor economic data, but the yuan showed little reaction, especially after the PBOC opted not to raise its rates. “There is no urgency for China to maintain its favourable yield differential against the United States as capital outflow and currency stability is no longer the key concern for China at the moment,” said Tommy Xie, an economist at OCBC Bank. “With U.S.-China trade war looming, a slightly weaker yuan may be in China’s favour.” Some emerging market currencies have been hit hard by worries higher U.S. interest rates could prompt investors to shift funds to the United States. The dip in the dollar on Thursday brought welcome relief. South Africa’s rand rebounded from a six-month low, the Turkish lira pulled out of a dive and the Mexican peso recovered from a 16-month low. Among commodities, China-sensitive industrial metals sagged but gold and other precious metals made ground. oil prices were little changed, underpinned by a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer. Brent and U.S. crude futures traded at $76.83 and $66.67 a barrel respectively, to extend their recovery from eight-week lows touched last week.

2018-06-14,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU negotiators agreed on Thursday to increase the share of renewables in the bloc’s energy production to 32 percent by 2030, a higher target than in draft rules but short of the level sought by some governments and the European Parliament. The final European Union law calls for a phasing out of the use of palm oil, a major import from southeast Asia, by 2030 and removes some barriers to small producers of renewable energy. The measures are aimed at helping the European Union meet its overall goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, following the Paris Agreement to keep global warming well below 2 degrees. “This deal is a hard-won victory in our efforts to unlock the true potential of Europe’s clean energy transition,” EU Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said on Twitter. The EU executive had initially proposed a target of 27 percent, a compromise backed by member states. But at a meeting of energy minister on Monday, a group of EU leaders had pushed for a higher goal - one rejected by Germany’s Peter Altmaier as unachievable. Thursday’s agreement allows for a 2023 review for an upward revision of the EU level target.     Until 2020, the European Union is targeting a 20 percent share of renewables and experts have pointed out that the sharp fall in the cost of renewables would allow for higher targets without increasing budgets. “The agreed 2030 binding target of 32 percent should be seen as a starting line for the race to greater ambition,” said Wendel Trio, director of campaign group Climate Action Network Europe. While crucial in the quest to reduce carbon emissions, some EU countries have been reluctant to back too high a target as their electricity production is still largely dependent technologies such as coal and gas.

2018-06-14,"(Repeats June 13 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chart 1: tmsnrt.rs/2JI9607 * Chart 2: tmsnrt.rs/2JDt3VI By John Kemp LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - Sanctions on Iran and the continued decline in output from Venezuela will leave the oil market very vulnerable to any further production or consumption surprises next year. Output and demand in the global market are each currently running at almost 100 million barrels per day (bpd). To ensure a steady flow of oil from the wellhead to consumers, the industry relies on a series of shock absorbers to handle any interruption in supplies or unexpected strength in demand. In rough order of responsiveness, these buffers are: * Commercial inventories * OPEC spare capacity * Strategic stocks * Short-cycle production * Consumption restraint Both commercial inventories and OPEC spare capacity have become dangerously eroded over the last 12 months, leaving the oil market much more vulnerable in 2019. If all the other shock absorbers become exhausted, oil prices will have to rise to the point where consumption growth begins to slow. The oil market’s first line of defence comes from changes in the volume of commercial inventories held by producers, traders and refiners. OECD commercial stocks currently stand at 2.8 billion barrels, composed of crude (1.1 billion barrels), other liquids (300 million barrels) and refined products (1.4 billion barrels). Additional stocks are held in non-OECD countries, as well as on tankers and in pipelines, either in transit from oilfields to refineries and on to final customers, or as floating storage. The vast majority of stocks are held for operational reasons to ensure the uninterrupted flow of oil from wellhead to final customers. Only a small percentage, generally less than 15 percent, can be considered discretionary and available to act as a shock absorber. OECD crude and product stocks are already 27 million barrels below the five-year average, according to the International Energy Agency (“Oil Market Report”, IEA, June 2018). The five-year average was inflated by the glut of oil between 2015 and 2017, so it may not be representative of the normal level of inventories. But global oil consumption has also increased by more than 6 million bpd over the five years since 2013, so other things being equal, producers, traders and refiners will want to hold more stocks for operational reasons. The fact that futures prices for both Brent and WTI are in backwardation implies oil traders see stocks as already fairly tight and expected to tighten further. For the last four decades, the oil industry’s second line of defence has been the existence of significant volumes of spare production capacity. Nearly all spare production capacity is held by Saudi Arabia, with smaller volumes held by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Russia may also hold a small amount of spare capacity at the moment, following the decision taken in 2016 to restrain production. Other OPEC and non-OPEC members essentially produce as much as they are able and do not hold significant spare capacity. OPEC’s spare capacity currently amounts to less than 2 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2018). In its latest oil market update, the International Energy Agency explored a scenario in which exports from Venezuela and Iran could decline by as much as 1.5 million barrels per day by the end of 2019. To compensate for the lost output, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates could boost production by just over 1 million bpd, with additional supplies from Russia, according to the IEA. But if this scenario comes to pass, OPEC spare capacity will be reduced to less than 1 million bpd, the lowest level since 2004. (tmsnrt.rs/2JI9607) SHORT-CYCLE PRODUCTION With oil inventories already tight and spare capacity set to shrink, the industry will have to fall back on strategic stocks and short-cycle production to meet any unexpected shortfall. OECD governments and refiners hold almost 1.6 billion barrels of crude and products in strategic storage, which can be released in the event of an emergency. China has also amassed a strategic stockpile estimated at more than 800 million barrels, according to the International Energy Agency. Strategic stocks are the third line of defence. But the circumstances under which OECD and China’s strategic stocks would be released to the market remain opaque. Experience suggests governments react to the security and economic threat from both actual shortages of crude and/or a sharp rise in prices. However, strategic stock releases cannot be predicted, and strategic stocks are not generally considered available to the market. The industry will therefore be forced to rely on short-cycle production, its fourth line of defence. Most short-cycle production comes from the U.S. shale sector, with smaller volumes available from the accelerated development of existing oilfields in other parts of the world. But even short-cycle production can take 6-12 months or more to reach the market, given the lengthy delays involved in securing extra drilling rigs, fracking wells and connecting them up to the distribution system. The U.S. shale supply chain is already extremely stretched, with reported shortages of experienced fracking crews and truckers. And pipelines to move the produced oil from the shale fields to refining centres on the U.S. Gulf Coast or onto tankers for export are full. Short-cycle producers may therefore struggle to plug any additional shortfall in oil supplies next year, especially if consumption growth remains strong. Medium-cycle and long-cycle production from new oilfields takes too long to develop to be of any real use as a shock absorber. So the final shock absorber is always the consumer. Oil prices will have to rise high enough in 2018/19 to slow growth in consumption and restore inventory and spare capacity buffers to a more comfortable level. Rising prices will slow consumption growth through some combination of behavioural changes to cut fuel use, switching to alternative fuels, and slower GDP growth in consuming countries. Consumption is not very responsive to a small change in oil prices, at least in the short term, so large price increases are required to enforce demand restraint. Between 2006 and 2008, and again between 2011 and 2014, high oil prices coincided with falling consumption in the OECD. (tmsnrt.rs/2JDt3VI) In both cases, the rise in prices was followed by a slowdown in consumption growth and a faster increase in production, eventually rebuilding stocks and spare capacity. The combination of falling Venezuelan output, sanctions on Iran, low commercial stocks, low spare capacity, and constraints on the expansion of U.S. shale is priming the market for higher prices in 2018/19. The most likely outcome is a further rise in prices to enforce demand restraint and/or a recession in the major consuming countries to bring the market back to balance again.

2018-06-14,"(Adds detail, photo available) * Fed raised rates as expected, sees 2 more rate hikes this year * Concerns about U.S.-China trade war cast shadow * China data surprisingly soft * Dollar quickly loses steam after jump on Fed, focus on ECB * European shares seen falling 0.2-0.4 pct By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares eased on Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and struck a more hawkish tone by forecasting a slightly faster tightening, while concerns about weak Chinese data and U.S.-China trade frictions kept investors on edge. Surprisingly weak Chinese retail sales and urban investment data curbed investors’ risk appetite by adding to doubts over the world’s second-largest economy as its central bank unexpectedly left interest rates on hold rather than follow the Fed higher. European shares are expected to fall, with spread-betters looking at a lower opening of 0.4 percent in Britain’s FTSE , 0.3 percent in Germany’s Dax and 0.2 percent in France’s CAC. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 1.0 percent, with shares in South Korea and Taiwan falling over one percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.6 percent while in mainland China, Shanghai composite index is on course to hit a 20-month closing low, shedding 0.4 percent. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, as expected, on the back of strong U.S. economic growth. Fed policymakers’ rates projections pointed to two additional hikes by the end of this year compared to one previously, based on board members’ median forecast. “The Fed was slightly more hawkish. But at the same time, the Fed is raising rates because of a strong economy and not because of the need to contain inflation. So that might have helped curb market reactions,” said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The spectre of higher borrowing costs hit stocks while boosting U.S. bond yields and the dollar. The overall market reaction was short-lived, however. “When you look more closely, only eight board members saw two more hikes by the end of year, compared to seven who saw one hike. In March it was seven versus eight. So you are talking about a change of only one board member after all,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “The fact that markets quickly reversed their course suggests the Fed’s decision was broadly in line with expectations,” he said. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.11 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a three-week high of 3.010 percent before quickly slipping back to 2.948 percent . Fed funds rate futures are pricing in a little over 50 percent chance of two more rate hikes this year, a small change from around 50 percent priced in before the Fed’s decision. While the Fed slightly accelerated the pace of rate hikes in coming months, it dropped a reference from the statement that interest rates are likely to remain below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. “That gave reassurance to markets that Fed policy board members were also discussing an eventual end in its process to remove stimulus,” said Hiroshi Yokotani, portfolio strategist at State Street Global Advisors. Keeping investors in check were concerns about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his top trade advisers on Thursday to decide on whether to activate the tariffs, a senior Trump administration official said. In the currency market, the dollar had erased all its post-Fed gains as traders’ focus quickly shifted to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting later in the day. Recent comments from top ECB officials have sparked expectations the ECB may offer clues on its intentions to end its bond purchases by the end of the year at its upcoming meeting. The euro traded at $1.1801, bouncing back from $1.1725 hit after the Fed’s policy announcement and not far off last week’s high of $1.1840 on June 7. The dollar stood at 110.06 yen, losing steam after hitting a three-week high of 110.85 in the wake of the Fed’s decision. The dollar index has erased all of its gains so far this week and stood at 93.481. The Australian dollar fell 0.35 percent to $0.7551 after China reported weaker-than-expected activity data for May, adding to views the economy is finally starting to slow under the weight of a prolonged crackdown on riskier lending that is pushing up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Some emerging market currencies have been hit by worries higher U.S. interest rates could prompt investors to shift funds to the United States and also squeeze dollar borrowers in emerging markets. The South African rand hit six-month lows while the Mexican peso dropped to 16-month lows. The Turkish lira and the Brazilian real also stayed under pressure due to domestic political woes. Still, many Asian currencies remained fairly stable so far, thanks to robust growth in the region. Oil prices were little changed but underpinned by a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer. U.S. crude futures traded at $66.67 a barrel, unchanged on the day but extending their recovery from eight-week low of $64.22 touched last week.

2018-06-14,"BEIJING/MANILA (Reuters) - China’s steel output surged to a record in May as mills ramped up production to chase fat profit margins, with a strong outlook for demand likely to keep mills running at nearly full capacity for the rest of the year. The increased output comes despite China’s efforts to limit production in key areas as part of its anti-pollution campaign and highlights Beijing’s challenge in tackling overcapacity in the world’s top steel producer.     China produced 81.13 million tonnes of crude steel last month, up 5.8 percent from the previous month and 8.9 percent from the same month last year, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Year-to-date output rose 5.4 percent to 369.86 million tonnes. To view a graphic on China's Monthly Crude Steel Output, click: reut.rs/2MohKT6 Daily average output climbed 2.4 percent to 2.62 million tonnes in May from April, according to Reuters’ calculations based on the official data.  “Steel mills have been running full-load and adding scrap steel to increase output in order to cash in on strong margins,” said Zhuo Guiqiu, senior analyst at Jinrui Futures.     Given firm demand and smog-battling production curbs in areas including the key steelmaking hubs of Hebei and Jiangsu provinces, analysts say mills can earn up to 900 yuan ($141) by producing a ton of steel at present, not far from more than 1,000 yuan late last year. The utilization rate at steel firms across the country was above 71 percent from late May, a level last seen before winter production curbs which kicked in in October and lasted through March. Recent environmental inspections in some 10 regions have forced some mills to cut production. But analysts do not expect the curbs to last long, unless new environmental policies add to pressure on supplies.  “Demand from downstream sectors may be better than expected,” said Zhuo. “The market generally believes the infrastructure construction sector is more active in the second half than in the first half, which could lift demand for steel products.” Underlining firm demand, steel stockpiles at both mills and traders declined in May despite rising output, Mysteel consultancy data showed.     To view a graphic on Steel products inventory at Chinese mills, click: reut.rs/2JKFm2H China’s output has been increasing despite its closure of 255 million tonnes in steel production capacity in the past two years, including illegal induction furnaces.  That is part of Beijing’s vow to address overcapacity that has dogged its steel sector for years. Outside China, Chinese steel companies have built or acquired 13.5 million tonnes of capacity and are building an additional 8.6 million tonnes over the next few years, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

2018-06-14," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Discussion in the crude oil market is degenerating into a single “will they or won’t they” focus on whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) will ease their output restrictions next week. While the meeting in Vienna on June 22 will undoubtedly heavily influence the direction of short-term crude prices, the market’s focus solely on supply could be viewed as somewhat myopic. Demand is probably the more important driver of the oil price over the longer term, and the simple truth is that the global market is effectively now hostage to just two countries. China and India have so far this year accounted for about 69 percent of the expected growth in crude oil demand, meaning that what happens in those two behemoths is likely of far more importance to the crude market than what may or may not happen in Vienna. The International Energy Agency forecast last month that global crude oil demand would rise by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, down from an earlier estimate of 1.5 million bpd. For the first five months of the year China’s crude oil imports were 9.21 million bpd, according to customs data, a rise of 690,000 bpd on the same period in 2017. India’s crude imports were 4.57 million bpd in the January-May period, up 272,000 bpd from the same period last year, according to vessel and port data and industry sources. Together these two countries, the world’s biggest and third-largest crude importers, have brought in 962,000 bpd more in the first five months of 2018 than in same period last year. If this pace of growth was maintained for the whole year, it would mean that China and India would account for the lion’s share of the IEA’s forecast for the increase in global demand. Most investors or companies would tell you that having more than two-thirds of your expected growth exposed to just two players is extremely risky, yet the oil market seems almost blase about the outlook for both these countries. While the majority of economic forecasts are for strong outcomes in both China and India, they aren’t without risks, and those risks may be rising. For China there is the perennial threat of credit problems, with several parts of the economy still highly leveraged and struggling to service loans. There is also the rising risk of an escalation of trade tensions and a tariff war with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. And then there is the government’s policy of reducing air pollution, which is resulting in a shift to electric cars and trucks powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG). For India the greatest risk to its economic outlook is high energy prices, given its reliance on imported crude and natural gas, and to some extent imported coal. The price of a litre of diesel in the capital New Delhi was 67.85 Indian rupees ($1.00) on Wednesday, which is up 27 percent from this time a year ago. The price of Brent crude has risen by about 71 percent in the past year, meaning Indian consumers have been spared the worst of the increase, but there have to be question marks over how long the government can lean on the state-owned refiners to absorb the cost increase. Overall, there is no immediate reason to expect lower crude oil demand growth in China and India, but the risks are mainly angled toward an easing rather than an acceleration.

2018-06-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - With oil price recovery taking hold, several U.S. oil and gas companies entered 2018 with a compelling plan - sell undeveloped or less essential fields and invest the money to boost returns from their sweetest, most productive spots. There is a catch, though. The strategy assumes that with crude now up more than 150 percent from its February 2016 bottom enough firms are keen to crank up production, even if it means buying fields with higher extraction costs and lower margins. So far, sale attempts suggest those buyers may be hard to come by. After a bruising downturn, shareholders are looking to get a cut of improved profits and asset sale proceeds rather than underwrite acquisitions, those involved in these deals say. “Oil and gas companies are no longer rewarded for simply ‘grabbing land’ and public investors have become more discerning regarding acquisitions,” notes Jon Marinelli, head of U.S. energy investment and corporate banking at BMO Capital Markets. Shares of Devon Energy Corp (DVN.N), QEP Resources Inc (QEP.N) and Southwestern Energy Co (SWN.N) and others have rallied after they floated plans to sell non-core acreage, reflecting hopes that some of the proceeds will return to investors. But since shareholders across the industry in general favor shedding assets over acquisitions, the sentiment makes striking new deals tricky. An informal poll of five investment bankers by Reuters put the share of sales that failed to close in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of this year at between 50 percent and 80 percent, with Marinelli putting the figure at around two-thirds. Dealmaking for oil and gas fields going into 2018 was already stagnating. While last year's total sales were only marginally down from 2016 at $67.3 billion, the first quarter accounted for around 38 percent of that figure, according to data provider PLS. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2Lm2hl3) If proposed sales fail to materialize this year, it could mean a time of reckoning for these oil and gas firms. “If these companies cannot execute the divestiture(s) that gave investors’ confidence on their future leverage profile, you would likely see less risk-tolerant investors trim or sell their positions,” said Tim Dumois, portfolio manager at BP Capital Fund Advisors, which invests in energy stocks. Among those seeking spin-offs, Anglo-Australian miner BHP Billiton Ltd (BHP.AX) BLT.L has the most ambitious plans. Facing the same pressure from shareholders as U.S. energy producers, it wants to sell onshore shale assets in the Permian, Eagle Ford and Haynesville basins, valuing them at $14 billion on its balance sheet.  While BHP’s Permian and Eagle Ford land is generally considered attractive because of low production costs, one of the Eagle Ford asset packages and its Haynesville fields mainly produce shale gas, making them less appealing to buyers given stubbornly-low gas prices.  BHP would consider a bid that valued the entire business below the company’s original valuation, if it ensured no unsold assets remained, according to people familiar with the sale process. The company received bids from interested parties on May 23, although a final decision on what it will do is not expected for a few months. For those weighing acquisitions, Bakken operator Oasis Petroleum (OAS.N) offers a cautionary tale. Shares in the company fell as much as 25 percent in the two days after it said on Dec. 11 it paid $946 million for acreage in the Delaware Basin. Since then, major land purchases by U.S. oil and gas firms have fizzled, with executives preaching focus on controlling costs and avoiding unnecessary expansion. “We can do a whole lot of great work by hitting some singles,” Brad Holly, chief executive officer of Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N), told an industry event in April, drawing on a baseball metaphor to describe how the company was looking for some “really small things” to add to its existing acreage. In the absence of companies as buyers, private equity firms have picked up some slack: the value of land bought by buyout firms rose to 47 percent of the total in the fourth quarter from 11 percent in the first three months of 2017, according to PLS. However, the run-up in oil prices, rather than whet their appetite further has an opposite effect, making private equity firms wary that prices may not be as strong when they are ready to cash out. Higher crude prices also boost sellers’ expectations, making it harder for buyout firms to drive a hard bargain to ensure better future profits. Such calculations gain added significance after years of returns on energy stocks trailing other sectors. “If energy equity markets are underperforming the wider S&P, this reduces the chance of private equity buying larger assets because you don’t think you’ll get a good runway for an exit,” said Glenn Jacobson, partner at Trilantic Capital Partners. Some sellers have now started moderating their expectations. Hunt Oil Company for example, owned by one of Texas’ wealthiest families, split a package of Eagle Ford land it was marketing for up to $700 million in the fourth quarter into three individual pieces, according to a person familiar with the transaction. Two bits went to private equity buyers, with a third sold to Penn Virginia Corp (PVAC.O) for $86 million, the person added. “The decision becomes do you hold your nose and sell, or do you retain the asset,” said BMO’s Marinelli.

2018-06-14,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Northern China’s Hebei, the country’s smoggiest province, will exempt environmental “pace setters” from output curbs as part of a new plan aimed at providing more incentives for local firms to cut pollution, local media said on Thursday. Hebei, which produces around a quarter of China’s steel, has been on the front line of the country’s four-year war on pollution, with authorities anxious to prevent the province’s heavy smog from drifting into neighboring Beijing. Cities throughout Hebei were part of a punishing winter campaign that forced all enterprises in major industries like steel to cut production when air quality declined, but firms complained they were being punished whether they had complied with state pollution standards or not.  China has since promised to put an end to a “one size fits all” approach to environmental compliance and aims to devise more nuanced environmental policies that will minimize economic disruption.  In the first phase of Hebei’s new “pace setter” scheme, three to five leading enterprises from industrial sectors like steel, cement, glass-making, coking and waste-to-energy will now be given preferential treatment, the local Yanzhao Metropolis Daily newspaper reported.  According to “implementation guidelines” published earlier this month on the website of the Hebei environmental protection bureau, the plan will encourage enterprises to cut pollution and carbon emissions, upgrade technology and improve efficiency. “Firms that have obtained the ‘pace setter’ status... do not need to be included in output restriction lists,” the document said, adding that they would also be entitled to “targeted assistance” from local authorities. Third-party assessors will select firms that have imposed stricter than necessary emissions standards or implemented a “green supply chain” system, as well as those that have relatively low levels of coal and water consumption. The list will be refreshed every two years, but “pace setters” found to have exceeded emissions standards or violated other environmental rules would have their status revoked, the document said.

2018-06-14,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is seeking to join the European Union in its push to set up dispute resolution talks with the United States over Washington’s steel and aluminium tariffs, under the World Trade Organisation framework, a government source said. The Japanese government source, who has direct knowledge of the matter, said it has informed the WTO about its intention to take part. The source, who did not want to be named, also said Japan has told the WTO it wants to participate in similar consultations requested by Canada and Mexico as it looks to join forces with countries affected by U.S. tariffs. “We are in the same situation as the other countries, so we want to participate in the talks and share information,” said the source. “Our ultimate goal is to get the U.S. to repeal these tariffs.” Holding consultations is the first step in the WTO’s dispute settlement process, but it is uncertain whether the United States will agree to the request for talks. The United States has upset its closest allies by imposing a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent tariff on aluminium imports. The U.S. says the tariffs are needed to protect national security and U.S. workers. Many countries say their steel exports pose no threat to U.S. national security and the tariffs are really aimed at curbing China’s excess steel capacity. Disagreement over the tariffs spilled into the open at a Group of Seven leaders’ summit last week as U.S. President Donald Trump backed out of signing a joint communique that appeared to reach a fragile consensus on trade policy. The EU, Canada, and Mexico have prepared retaliatory tariffs against U.S. imports, raising the chance of a full-blown trade war. So far, Japan has not taken similar steps, but there is lingering concern in Tokyo over whether Washington will try to curb Japanese imports to lower the U.S. trade deficit.

2018-06-14,"(Adds detail, photo available) * Fed raised rates as expected, sees 2 more rate hikes this year * Concerns about U.S.-China trade war cast shadow * China data surprisingly soft, * Dollar quickly loses steam after jump on Fed, focus on ECB By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, June 14 (Reuters) - Asian shares eased on Thursday after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates and took a more hawkish tone in forecasting a slightly faster pace of tightening, while concerns about U.S.-China trade frictions kept investors on edge. Chinese retail sales and urban investment data were surprisingly weak, pouring cold water on investors’ risk appetite and adding to uncertainty over the world’s second-largest economy after its central bank unexpectedly left interest rates on hold. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.5 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI was off 1.2 percent, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dipped 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.4 percent. The Fed raised its benchmark overnight lending rate a quarter of a percentage point to a range of 1.75 percent to 2 percent, as expected, on the back of strong U.S. economic growth. Fed policymakers’ rates projections pointed to two additional hikes by the end of this year compared to one previously, based on board members’ median forecast. “The Fed was slightly more hawkish. But at the same time, the Fed is raising rates because of a strong economy and not because of the need to contain inflation. So that might have helped curb market reactions,” said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The spectre of higher borrowing costs hit stocks while boosting U.S. bond yields and the dollar. The overall market reaction was short-lived, however. “When you look more closely, only eight board members saw two more hikes by the end of year, compared to seven who saw one hike. In March it was seven versus eight. So you are talking about a change of only one board member after all,” said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “The fact that markets quickly reversed their course suggests the Fed’s decision was broadly in line with expectations,” he said. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.11 percent. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield hit a three-week high of 3.010 percent before quickly slipping back to 2.953 percent . Keeping investors in check were concerns about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his top trade advisers on Thursday to decide on whether to activate the tariffs, a senior Trump administration official said. In the currency market, the dollar had erased all its post-Fed gains as traders’ focus quickly shifted to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting later in the day. Recent comments from top ECB officials have sparked expectations the ECB may offer clues on its intentions to end its bond purchases by the end of the year at its upcoming meeting. The euro traded at $1.1801, bouncing back from $1.1725 hit after the Fed’s policy announcement and not far off last week’s high of $1.1840 on June 7. The dollar stood at 110.19 yen, losing steam after hitting a three-week high of 110.85 in the wake of the Fed’s decision. The dollar index has erased all of its gains so far this week and stood at 93.501. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7556 after China reported weaker-than-expected activity data for May, adding to views the economy is finally starting to slow under the weight of a prolonged crackdown on riskier lending that is pushing up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Some emerging market currencies were hit by worries higher U.S. interest rates could prompt investors to shift funds to the United States and also squeeze dollar borrowers in emerging markets. The South African rand hit six-month lows while the Mexican peso dropped to 16-month lows. Still, many Asian currencies remained fairly stable so far, thanks to robust growth in the region. Oil prices were little changed but underpinned by a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer. U.S. crude futures traded at $66.67 a barrel, unchanged on the day but extending their recovery from eight-week low of $64.22 touched last week.

On a daily basis, the world’s top aluminium producer churned out 90,000 tonnes of the metal last month, compared with 92,300 tonnes in April, according to Reuters calculations based on the data. Shanghai aluminium prices ticked 0.8 percent higher in May, after a 4.8 percent boost in April in the wake of U.S. sanctions on Russian producer Rusal. The metal is on course to gain around 5.6 percent in Shanghai this quarter. The impact on London aluminium prices has been even more pronounced, prompting Chinese aluminium producers to ship more metal overseas in May than they had done for any month since December 2014 despite a 10 percent import tariff in key market the United States.

Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $76.46 per barrel at 0046 GMT, down 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.58 a barrel, down 6 cents from their last settlement. Prices were pulled down by another rise in U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which hit a weekly record of 10.9 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday. U.S. crude output has risen by almost 30 percent in the last two years, and it is now close to top global producer Russia, which produced 11.1 million bpd overall in the first two weeks of June. But the rising output came amid strong demand, which traders said prevented crude prices from falling further. U.S. consumption of gasoline in the United States rose to an historic high of 9.88 million bpd last week, according to the EIA. In part because of strong demand, U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA fell by 4.1 million barrels in the week to June 8, to 432.4 million barrels. Still, U.S. output is now above that of top exporter Saudi Arabia, which currently churns out slightly above 10 million bpd. The surge in American output puts pressure on other producers, who are losing market share. Russian and Saudi production has been held back voluntarily since 2017, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with some non-OPEC producers including Russia, started supply cuts aimed at propping up prices. With Brent prices up by around 180 percent from their 2016 lows and demand strong, OPEC and Russia may soon end their voluntary supply cuts. OPEC, together with Russia, will officially meet in Vienna on June 22 to discuss its production policy, U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said OPEC and its partners had “largely achieved their stated objective of rebalancing the oil market.” With demand for oil strong, Morgan Stanley said the group’s “production is likely to creep higher.” OPEC’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia and Russia will also have the chance to talk before the Vienna meeting. Russia and Saudi Arabia are set to open the football world cup, which kicks off in Russia on Thursday. “The two producers’ ministers plan to discuss the issue during tomorrow’s World Cup game between the two countries,” ANZ bank said.

Keeping investors in check were concerns about U.S. threats to impose tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese goods. U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his top trade advisers on Thursday to decide on whether to activate the tariffs, a senior Trump administration official said. In the currency market, the dollar had erased all its post-Fed gains as traders’ focus quickly shifted to the European Central Bank’s policy meeting later in the day. Recent comments from top ECB officials have sparked expectations the ECB may offer clues on its intentions to end its bond purchases by the end of year at its upcoming meeting. The euro traded at $1.1801, bouncing back from $1.1725 hit after the Fed’s policy announcement and not far off last week’s high of $1.1840 on June 7. The dollar stood at 110.13 yen, losing steam after hitting a three-week high of 110.85 in the wake of the Fed’s decision. The dollar index has erased all of its gains so far this week and stood at 93.495. Oil prices firmed on a bigger-than-expected decline in U.S. crude inventories and surprise drawdowns in gasoline and distillates, which indicated strong demand in the world’s top oil consumer. U.S. crude futures traded at $66.64 a barrel, unchanged on the day but extending their recovery from eight-week low of $64.22 touched last week. Bitcoin fell to four-month low of $6,120 on Wednesday and last stood at $6,442. The cryptocurrency has fallen about 17 percent over the past five days.

2018-06-14,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela is considering producing fuels from foreign crude oil for the first time, according to planning documents seen by Reuters, as the country struggles to meet its obligations despite having the world’s largest crude reserves. State-run oil company PDVSA may process up to 57,000 barrels per day (bpd) of foreign crude in June at the country’s largest refinery, according to a monthly refining plan which was viewed by Reuters on Wednesday. The output would help fulfil fuel contracts for Russian, Chinese and other customers and reduce purchases of fuels for domestic use, the documents showed. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. PDVSA has been falling short on fuel exports in recent years due to a lack of lighter crudes to refine, a shortage of spare parts, poor maintenance, and management upheaval at its domestic refining network. PDVSA also lost access in May to inventories produced in Curacao, where it operates the Isla refinery.  Declining revenue resulting from falling oil production and exports have driven Venezuela into a severe economic recession, and led to a loss of skilled workers, and widespread food and medicine shortages. Some energy experts say further production declines could contribute to a global crude shortfall. U.S.-based ConocoPhillips (COP.N) last month seized some of PDVSA’s assets in the Caribbean seeking payment for a $2 billion (£1.5 billion) arbitration award, reducing PDVSA’s ability to deliver fuel and crude exports to Asian customers and regional allies. Venezuela, an OPEC member country, has never before imported foreign crude oil for its domestic refineries, although it has blended African, Russian and U.S. crudes with its extra heavy oil to make exportable products. It also has purchased foreign oil for Caribbean refineries and to supply allies, including Cuba. DECADES-LOW OUTPUT In May, the country produced 1.53 million bpd of crude, according to numbers delivered to OPEC, but other sources put the figure at 1.39 million bpd, which would be the lowest monthly output since the 1950s.  If PDVSA chooses to refine the imported crude, one of two scenarios outlined in documents showing its production, supply and contract requirements, the imports would alleviate a lack of domestic lighter crudes needed at the refineries, which have been running at about a third of their capacity. It could use Russian, Iranian or Angolan crudes, according to the documents.      “The larger processing of crude would increase our fuel availability. It would also decrease the requirements (to import) of vacuum gasoil and diesel,” said one of the documents prepared in May. The alternative, not using imported crude, would mean the shortfall in fulfilling contracts to supply fuel would increase, the document showed. Most of these fuel contracts cover oil-for-loans with Chinese and Russian companies.   As of June 13, two tankers holding Russian Urals crude were waiting in Venezuelan waters to discharge, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking data. One of the two, the Advantage Atom, is waiting near its Amuay refinery. Venezuela in January started routine imports of Urals crude to supply Cuban refineries, spending nearly $440 million on the purchases for its Caribbean ally. The Urals cargoes had been discharged in Curacao for transfer to Cuba, but since Conoco began seizing PDVSA’s Caribbean assets, tankers arriving from Russia have been diverted to Venezuela’s Paraguana Refining Center (CRP), which includes its Amuay and Cardon refineries. To meet its domestic demands and PDVSA’s fuel supply contracts, Venezuela would have to produce some 850,000 bpd of fuels, the documents show.  Neither of the June alternatives show it getting close to that level. If PDVSA decides to process the foreign crude, it would produce 606,000 bpd, and less if it does not. From January through March, PDVSA’s refineries supplied 78 percent of the 365,000 bpd of the fuels demanded by Venezuela’s domestic market, which forced the company to import finished products including gasoline and diesel. Under the plan excluding foreign oil imports, PDVSA’s domestic refineries this month would work at about 36 percent of their total capacity, or 473,000 bpd of Venezuelan crude, according to the documents, reflecting an acute lack of spare parts and delayed maintenance projects. On Wednesday, PDVSA’s 310,000-bpd Cardon refinery restarted a vacuum distillation unit that was waiting for spare parts to be repaired. Last week, the 645,000-Amuay refinery restarted one of its crude distillation units. Those repairs are just some of the many still pending, according to the documents. At Venezuela’s smallest refineries, Puerto la Cruz and El Palito, the lack of medium and light crudes has kept several distillation units out of service for months. The insufficient fuel production is affecting China’s CNPC [CNPC.UL] and its subsidiaries the most as PDVSA would have to ship 258,000 bpd of fuel oil and jet fuel to these companies for repaying Chinese loans extended to the Venezuelan government in the last decade, but it typically delivers less than 100,000 bpd. Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) this month is entitled to 80,000 bpd of fuel oil, jet fuel and natural gasoline under oil-for-loan contracts, while Cuba and members of Petrocaribe should receive at least 108,000 bpd, according to current contracts.
