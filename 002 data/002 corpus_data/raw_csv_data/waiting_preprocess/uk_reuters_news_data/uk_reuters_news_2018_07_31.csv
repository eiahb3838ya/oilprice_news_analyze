2018-07-31,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s three largest fuel distribution companies are under investigation for fixing prices at the pump, police said on Tuesday, reigniting debate over potential collusion among gas station owners in Latin America’s largest oil producer. The firms targeted by the probe are Petrobras Distribuidora SA (BRDT3.SA), a subsidiary of state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA); Ipiranga, a unit of Ultrapar Participações SA (UGPA3.SA); and Raízen, a Cosan SA (CSAN3.SA) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) joint venture. Police in the southern state of Parana were serving eight arrest warrants and 12 search and seizure warrants in connection with the probe in the city of Curitiba, the state capital, according to police. The probe comes two months after Brazil’s economy was paralyzed by a trucker strike over soaring diesel fuel prices. While the government resolved that protest with new subsidies and other measures, antitrust regulators also raised concerns about a lack of competition in the highly concentrated sector. Police said they were targeting managers and sales representatives of the three firms in the investigation, which has been underway for over a year. They accused the fuel distribution companies of dictating the prices at the pump charged by individual gas station owners, a violation of Brazilian market rules that the owners should have freedom to set prices freely. Shares in Petrobras Distribuidora, Ultrapar, and Cosan all tumbled at least 3.5 percent in late morning trade, dragging Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP down some 1.3 percent.  To make sure the dictated prices were being applied by the gas station owners, the distribution companies hired people to ride motorbikes around the city of Curitiba to take pictures of the gas stations and their pricing banners, according to police. Petrobras Distribuidora, also known as BR Distribuidora, said in a statement that it follows “the best commercial, competitive and ethical practices toward the consumer” and demands the same behavior from its partners and workforce. Raizen said in a statement fuel prices were set by individual gas station owners with no interference from the distributor. “The company operates in total conformity with applicable legislation and always acts toward the consumer in a competitive way and in favor of free competition,” it said in a statement. In a statement late on Tuesday, Raizen said it had access to the probe late in the day and was considering information provided by the investigation reports.  Ipiranga said that it “does not incentives illegal practices,” and that it operates in compliance with competition regulations. The three companies under investigation together control more than two-thirds of the national fuel distribution market, according to data from oil regulator ANP. The operation is the latest effort by Brazilian authorities to clamp down on collusion and price fixing in the fuel distribution market, which has been the most common target of accusations for cartel behavior by antitrust watchdog Cade. The government had asked Cade earlier this year to investigate fuel stations for potential anticompetitive practices that could account for the large spread between fuel prices at refineries and at pumps.

2018-07-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it expects Pyongyang to keep its commitment made at a June leaders’ summit to give up its nuclear arms and would press southeast Asian nations during meetings this week to maintain sanctions against North Korea. Questions have arisen over Pyongyang’s commitment to denuclearize after U.S. spy satellite material detected renewed activity at the North Korean factory that produced the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the United States. The department left open the possibility that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo could meet North Korean officials during meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) bloc in Singapore this weekend. “We will be in some of the same meetings as North Korean officials. I certainly can’t preclude any interaction taking place, but we have no meetings on the schedule,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters.  Another State Department official, who earlier briefed reporters on Pompeo’s trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia this week, said the secretary would remind ASEAN to adhere to sanctions against Pyongyang. There are concerns that fuel is being sold illegally to North Korea despite U.N. sanctions, the official said. The official said that North Korea will participate in a 27-nation regional ASEAN forum on Saturday that Pompeo will also attend. “We remain concerned about the scale of North Korea’s illicit procurement, in particular of refined petroleum products via U.N.-prohibited ship-to-ship transfers,” the official said. Under the restrictions, Pyongyang is limited to importing 4 million barrels of crude and 500,000 barrels of products a year. Pompeo has led talks with Pyongyang to denuclearize following a June summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump.   Nauert said the United States was holding Kim to the commitment he made during the summit to denuclearize. She declined to comment on the spy satellite images. “What we are going on is the commitment that Chairman Kim made to our president, and that is the commitment to denuclearize. That is something that we certainly anticipate that he will hold up his end of the bargain,” Nauert said. One photo image showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the North has used to move its ICBMs. Since the trailer was covered, it was not possible to know what, if anything, it was carrying. Photos and infrared imaging, however, indicate vehicles moving in and out of the facility at Sanumdong, but do not show how advanced any missile construction might be. The evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity in North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities. Trump declared soon after the summit that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat.

2018-07-31,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian utility Enel SpA (ENEI.MI) has called a halt to further acquisitions in Brazil for the time being as it gears up to complete asset sales of up to 1.5 billion euros (1.34 billion pounds)in the second half of the year. “I don’t see appetite for further acquisitions in Brazil at this stage,” Enel CEO Francesco Starace told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday after the company released first-half results. In June, Europe’s biggest utility agreed to spend almost $1.5 billion to buy a majority stake in Brazilian power company Eletropaulo (ELPL3.SA) and also said it could spend more than $2.3 billion to buy a Latin American fiber company. Last year it bought Brazilian power distributor CELG for about $640 million. Earlier this month Starace told a Brazilian newspaper Enel was eyeing more electricity distributors in Brazil. Enel, which controls Spanish utility Endesa SA (ELE.MC), is one of the biggest energy players in South America and is reordering its portfolio and restructuring business there. The state-controlled utility, one of the world’s biggest green energy companies, is focusing on grids, renewable energy and retail business to drive growth, especially in emerging markets.  It is also rolling out a fast fiber broadband network across Italy using its power infrastructure to house cable, a project it plans to duplicate in other regions such as Latin America. Asked about disposals in the second half of the year, Enel CFO Alberto De Paoli said the group expected to wrap up the sale of renewable energy assets in Mexico and Brazil as well as coal and biomass operations. “Overall we could raise between 1.2 and 1.5 billion euros,” he said. Earlier this week a source said Enel was ready to discuss the sale of its stake in solar joint venture EF Solare to partner F2i. Asked about the issue, Starace said it was “something that could happen”. Earlier on Tuesday, Enel said net debt at the end of June rose 11.2 percent from December to 41.6 billion euros mainly due to acquisitions, dividend payments and investments. The utility stuck to its full-year targets after core earnings in the first six months rose 2.6 percent, boosted by higher margins at its green energy business. Enel is targeting ordinary core earnings for the year of around 16.2 billion euros.

2018-07-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) on Tuesday missed Wall Street quarterly profit estimates but beat expectations on revenue as production increased and margins improved in its U.S. shale operations.  Revenue rose to $3.29 billion in the second quarter from $1.4 billion a year ago, topping analysts’ consensus estimate of $3.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusting for divestitures, U.S. onshore oil volumes rose by 54,000 barrels per day from a year ago, and per-barrel margins totaled close to $31.60, Chief Executive Al Walker said in a statement. U.S. oil producers have benefited from a roughly 40 percent jump in crude prices in the past year to around $70 a barrel as major oil producers agreed to cut output to stabilize prices and some countries faced supply disruptions. This month, U.S. oil production hit a record 11 million barrels per day, aided by surging production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.  Anadarko grew its Delaware Basin production in West Texas by 88 percent from the previous year, averaging a record 62,000 barrels per day during the second quarter.  The company earned 5 cents per share in the quarter, missing Wall Street estimates for 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reported $267 million in pre-tax losses on the settlement of commodity derivatives, which resulted in a 40-cent per share hit to earnings. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $278 million, or 54 cents per share, 2 cents per share below analysts’ expectations. Total sales volumes for the quarter, including crude, natural gas and natural gas liquids, averaged 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up only slightly from the prior year.  The company increased full-year capital investment expectations by $250 million from prior guidance to between $4.5 billion and $4.8 billion. Anadarko shares were trading at $71.67, down about 1 percent.

2018-07-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, closing out the largest monthly decline in two years on supply worries after OPEC output reached a 2018 high in July, overshadowing reports that the United States and China might reopen trade talks that could boost demand. October Brent crude futures LCOV8 fell $1.34 to settle at $74.21 a barrel. The September contract LCOU8, which expires later on Tuesday, settled at $74.25. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell $1.37, or nearly 2 percent, to settle at $68.76. Brent lost more than 6 percent in July, while U.S. crude futures slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly decline for both benchmarks since July 2016. Oil prices extended losses in post-settlement trade, with U.S. crude at $68.32 a barrel, after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed domestic crude inventories rose 5.6 million barrels last week.[API/S] A Reuters poll forecast stocks fell 2.8 million barrels. The U.S. Energy Information Administration data is due on Wednesday. [EIA/S]  Signs that a supply disruption in the Bab al-Mandeb Strait in the Red Sea could be resolved weighed on prices throughout the trading session, said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Yemen’s Houthi group said it was ready to unilaterally halt attacks in the Red Sea to support peace efforts. Saudi Arabia suspended oil shipments through the strait last week after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers. Russia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries boosted output in July, according to a Reuters production survey on Monday. It showed OPEC members boosted output in July by 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.64 million bpd, a high for the year. “We’re seeing some more production come online, so that weighs on prices,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  A Reuters poll showed that oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the United States meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions. [O/POLL] OPEC has pledged to offset the loss of supply from Iran, the group’s No. 3 producer. Looming U.S. sanctions have already started to cut Iranian exports. Iran said U.S. President Donald Trump was mistaken to expect Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to compensate for supply losses caused by U.S. sanctions. The market largely overlooked reports that U.S. and China may restart negotiations to defuse the trade war between the two countries.

2018-07-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) on Tuesday reported a second-quarter adjusted profit that missed Wall Street expectations despite higher oil prices and production.  U.S. shale operators have increased output across the nation to record levels as U.S. oil prices have climbed toward $70 per barrel.  The Denver-based oil producer reported adjusted net of $57.2 million, or 62 cents per share, as both crude prices and its oil production rose. Wall Street had expected the company to report adjusted profit of 65 cents per share.  One of the largest oil producers in North Dakota’s Bakken shale boosted its production 12 percent to an average of 126,180 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), near the high end of its guidance.  Its output totaled 11.5 million boepd for the quarter. The company drilled 33 wells in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, where its output averaged more than 103,000 boepd. It spent $203 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.  Whiting’s operating revenue rose to $526.4 million in the second quarter, compared with $311.5 million year-on-year. Its average sales price rose to $67.91 per barrel of oil, up from $48.32 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017.  The company during the quarter closed a $130 million purchase of almost 55,000 acres (22,258 hectares) of properties in the Williston Basin that currently produce 1,290 boepd.

2018-07-31,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Senate president on Tuesday became the latest senior politician to leave the ruling party, dealing a new blow to President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of an election next year. Bukola Saraki, the country’s third most senior politician, defected to rejoin the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), becoming the highest-profile figure to leave the All Progressives Congress (APC). Last week, 16 lawmakers in the upper house left the APC, as did 32 in the lower house and earlier this month an APC faction said it no longer backed Buhari.   The APC in a statement queried Saraki, alleging that he facilitated the defection of some lawmakers thereby violating the party’s constitution. The ruling party asked him to respond within 48 hours or face sanctions. The threat of sanctions could have led the senate president to defect, analysts say, adding that the loss of influential figures and divisions in the party peels support from Buhari within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of the election scheduled for February 2019. “After extensive consultations I have decided to take my leave of the All Progressives Congress (APC),” Saraki said in a statement. “Today, I start as I return to the party where I began my political journey, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).” The PDP welcomed Saraki from the APC alongside Ahmed Abdulfatah, governor of Saraki’s home state of Kwara in central Nigeria. The country’s ambassador to South Africa, Ahmed Ibeto, also defected to the PDP after resigning his post, the PDP said. The opposition PDP said on Twitter Saraki had “dumped the failed and dysfunctional” APC. The PDP was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari took office in 2015. The APC coalition united to unseat Buhari’s predecessor Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 but it is now divided between Buhari loyalists and those who say they have been targeted by him. Saraki’s supporters said he had for years been targeted by the presidency. He has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since taking the post in 2015 with the support of opposition lawmakers but has not been convicted. Saraki’s defection was expected, said Antony Goldman of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting, saying that defections to the APC helped Buhari to defeat Jonathan.  “The challenge now for the opposition will be to overcome factional differences and personal ambitions and find, at this relatively late stage, a credible candidate to challenge President Buhari next February,” he said.  Nigeria’s main opposition parties earlier in July agreed to form an alliance to field a joint candidate to contest the election.  Buhari said in April he would seek another term and he looks set to receive party approval. Party primaries to choose presidential candidates run from Aug. 18 to Oct. 7.  Divisions in the APC emerged since its conference in June when new party leaders were elected and others saw their hopes of party advancement dashed. All but two of the 16 senators who left the APC last week joined the opposition PDP. As a result, the APC has lost its Senate majority.

2018-07-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets inched up on Tuesday helped partly by a report that the United States and China were seeking to resume talks to defuse the battle over import tariffs, while the U.S. dollar rose against the yen after the Bank of Japan said it intends to keep interest rates low. Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have been speaking privately as they seek to restart negotiations and avoid a full-scale trade war, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.  The White House, the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to comment but Mnuchin has repeatedly said in recent weeks he was ready to restart talks if China was prepared to make “meaningful changes” to its trade and technology transfer policies. A public comment period on the proposed U.S. tariffs of 25 percent on a further $16 billion of Chinese imports ends on Tuesday.  “The most important influence on the markets today is some tempering of the trade war escalation,” said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.36 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,415.19, the S&P 500 gained 13.69 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,816.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.79 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,671.79.[L4N1UR6DC] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.24 percent while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. Regional indexes for Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all climbing. The U.S. equities market has withstood the recent sell-off in technology stocks and fears of a full-blown trade war remarkably well, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in  Radnor, Pennsylvania.  U.S. President Donald Trump pays attention to the stock market and if there were a significant sell-off on trade tariff headlines, Smith said, Trump would reverse positions. “The economy has momentum to withstand these tit-for-tat trade spats that are going on right now. The market is, at least for now, seeing this as negotiations as opposed to the beginning of an all out-out global trade war,” Smith said. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan reassurances that it will maintain super-easy monetary policies for an “extended period of time” pushed the yen down and bond yields lower worldwide. The U.S. dollar was 0.69 percent higher against the yen, its best day in nearly three weeks after the BOJ said it would keep rates “very low” in comments that brought some relief to a market that had braced for bigger changes. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond dropped five basis points after the announcement.  Investors await policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday. “We still have a decent amount of news ahead of us,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. rate strategy at Nomura Securities International. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.9617 percent.

2018-07-31,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group said on Tuesday it is unilaterally halting attacks in the Red Sea for two weeks to support peace efforts, days after Saudi Arabia suspended oil exports through a strategic Red Sea channel following attacks on crude tankers last week. Yemen - where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in a three-year-old war - lies on one of the world’s most important trade routes for oil tankers, the Bab al-Mandeb strait. “The unilateral halt in naval military operations will be for a limited time period and could be extended and include all fronts if this move is reciprocated by the leadership of the coalition,” the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement. A statement from the Houthi-controlled defence ministry said later that the movement was halting naval operations for two weeks, starting at midnight (2000 GMT) on Aug. 1. “We welcome any initiative to spare bloodshed and stop aggression against Yemen,” the statement published on the state news agency SABA said, quoting a defence ministry official. Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the strait after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers, one of which sustained minimal damage, until the waterway was safe. Analysts say Riyadh is trying to encourage its Western allies to take the danger posed by the Houthis more seriously and step up support for its war in Yemen, where thousands of air strikes and a limited ground operation have produced only modest results while deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.  A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Houthi leader said the group’s initiative aimed to supports efforts to find a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people according to the United Nations. U.N. special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has been shuttling between the warring parties to avert a coalition assault on the main port city of Hodeidah, that the U.N. fears risks causing a famine. Hodeidah port is the main port of the impoverished Arab country, where around 8.4 million people are believed to be on the verge of starvation. The Western-backed coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government in exile and thwart what Riyadh sees as Iran’s expansionary ambitions in the region.

She declined to comment on the spy satellite images. “What we are going on is the commitment that Chairman Kim made to our president, and that is the commitment to denuclearize. That is something that we certainly anticipate that he will hold up his end of the bargain,” Nauert said. One photo image showed a truck and covered trailer similar to those the North has used to move its ICBMs. Since the trailer was covered, it was not possible to know what, if anything, it was carrying. Photos and infrared imaging, however, indicate vehicles moving in and out of the facility at Sanumdong, but do not show how advanced any missile construction might be. The evidence obtained this month is the latest to suggest ongoing activity in North Korea’s nuclear and missile facilities. Trump declared soon after the summit that North Korea no longer posed a nuclear threat.

2018-07-31,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italian utility Enel SpA (ENEI.MI) has called a halt to further acquisitions in Brazil for the time being as it gears up to complete asset sales of up to 1.5 billion euros (1.34 billion pounds)in the second half of the year. “I don’t see appetite for further acquisitions in Brazil at this stage,” Enel CEO Francesco Starace told analysts on a conference call on Tuesday after the company released first-half results. In June, Europe’s biggest utility agreed to spend almost $1.5 billion to buy a majority stake in Brazilian power company Eletropaulo (ELPL3.SA) and also said it could spend more than $2.3 billion to buy a Latin American fiber company. Last year it bought Brazilian power distributor CELG for about $640 million. Earlier this month Starace told a Brazilian newspaper Enel was eyeing more electricity distributors in Brazil. Enel, which controls Spanish utility Endesa SA (ELE.MC), is one of the biggest energy players in South America and is reordering its portfolio and restructuring business there. The state-controlled utility, one of the world’s biggest green energy companies, is focusing on grids, renewable energy and retail business to drive growth, especially in emerging markets.  It is also rolling out a fast fiber broadband network across Italy using its power infrastructure to house cable, a project it plans to duplicate in other regions such as Latin America. Asked about disposals in the second half of the year, Enel CFO Alberto De Paoli said the group expected to wrap up the sale of renewable energy assets in Mexico and Brazil as well as coal and biomass operations. “Overall we could raise between 1.2 and 1.5 billion euros,” he said. Earlier this week a source said Enel was ready to discuss the sale of its stake in solar joint venture EF Solare to partner F2i. Asked about the issue, Starace said it was “something that could happen”. Earlier on Tuesday, Enel said net debt at the end of June rose 11.2 percent from December to 41.6 billion euros mainly due to acquisitions, dividend payments and investments. The utility stuck to its full-year targets after core earnings in the first six months rose 2.6 percent, boosted by higher margins at its green energy business. Enel is targeting ordinary core earnings for the year of around 16.2 billion euros.

2018-07-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) on Tuesday missed Wall Street quarterly profit estimates but beat expectations on revenue as production increased and margins improved in its U.S. shale operations.  Revenue rose to $3.29 billion in the second quarter from $1.4 billion a year ago, topping analysts’ consensus estimate of $3.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Adjusting for divestitures, U.S. onshore oil volumes rose by 54,000 barrels per day from a year ago, and per-barrel margins totaled close to $31.60, Chief Executive Al Walker said in a statement. U.S. oil producers have benefited from a roughly 40 percent jump in crude prices in the past year to around $70 a barrel as major oil producers agreed to cut output to stabilize prices and some countries faced supply disruptions. This month, U.S. oil production hit a record 11 million barrels per day, aided by surging production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico.  Anadarko grew its Delaware Basin production in West Texas by 88 percent from the previous year, averaging a record 62,000 barrels per day during the second quarter.  The company earned 5 cents per share in the quarter, missing Wall Street estimates for 54 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reported $267 million in pre-tax losses on the settlement of commodity derivatives, which resulted in a 40-cent per share hit to earnings. Adjusted net income for the quarter was $278 million, or 54 cents per share, 2 cents per share below analysts’ expectations. Total sales volumes for the quarter, including crude, natural gas and natural gas liquids, averaged 637,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, up only slightly from the prior year.  The company increased full-year capital investment expectations by $250 million from prior guidance to between $4.5 billion and $4.8 billion.

2018-07-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, closing out the largest monthly decline in two years on supply worries after OPEC output reached a 2018 high in July, overshadowing reports that the United States and China might reopen trade talks that could boost demand. October Brent crude futures LCOV8 fell $1.34 to settle at $74.21 a barrel. The September contract LCOU8, which expires later on Tuesday, settled at $74.25. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell $1.37, or nearly 2 percent, to settle at $68.76. Brent lost more than 6 percent in July, while U.S. crude futures slumped about 7 percent, the biggest monthly decline for both benchmarks since July 2016.

2018-07-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Whiting Petroleum Corp (WLL.N) on Tuesday reported a second-quarter adjusted profit that missed Wall Street expectations despite higher oil prices and production.  U.S. shale operators have increased output across the nation to record levels as U.S. oil prices have climbed toward $70 per barrel.  The Denver-based oil producer reported adjusted net of $57.2 million, or 62 cents per share, as both crude prices and its oil production rose. Wall Street had expected the company to report adjusted profit of 65 cents per share.  One of the largest oil producers in North Dakota’s Bakken shale boosted its production 12 percent to an average of 126,180 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), near the high end of its guidance.  Its output totaled 11.5 million boepd for the quarter. The company drilled 33 wells in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, where its output averaged more than 103,000 boepd. It spent $203 million in capital expenditures in the quarter.  Whiting’s operating revenue rose to $526.4 million in the second quarter, compared with $311.5 million year-on-year. Its average sales price rose to $67.91 per barrel of oil, up from $48.32 per barrel in the second quarter of 2017.  The company during the quarter closed a $130 million purchase of almost 55,000 acres (22,258 hectares) of properties in the Williston Basin that currently produce 1,290 boepd.

2018-07-31,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria’s Senate president on Tuesday became the latest senior politician to leave the ruling party, dealing a new blow to President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of an election next year. Bukola Saraki, the country’s third most senior politician, defected to rejoin the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), becoming the highest-profile figure to leave the All Progressives Congress (APC). Last week, 16 lawmakers in the upper house left the APC, as did 32 in the lower house and earlier this month an APC faction said it no longer backed Buhari.   The APC in a statement queried Saraki, alleging that he facilitated the defection of some lawmakers thereby violating the party’s constitution. The ruling party asked him to respond within 48 hours or face sanctions. The threat of sanctions could have led the senate president to defect, analysts say, adding that the loss of influential figures and divisions in the party peels support from Buhari within powerful patronage networks and among voters ahead of the election scheduled for February 2019. “After extensive consultations I have decided to take my leave of the All Progressives Congress (APC),” Saraki said in a statement. “Today, I start as I return to the party where I began my political journey, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).” The PDP welcomed Saraki from the APC alongside Ahmed Abdulfatah, governor of Saraki’s home state of Kwara in central Nigeria. The country’s ambassador to South Africa, Ahmed Ibeto, also defected to the PDP after resigning his post, the PDP said. The opposition PDP said on Twitter Saraki had “dumped the failed and dysfunctional” APC. The PDP was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari took office in 2015. The APC coalition united to unseat Buhari’s predecessor Goodluck Jonathan in 2015 but it is now divided between Buhari loyalists and those who say they have been targeted by him. Saraki’s supporters said he had for years been targeted by the presidency. He has been dogged by accusations of misconduct and investigations since taking the post in 2015 with the support of opposition lawmakers but has not been convicted. Saraki’s defection was expected, said Antony Goldman of Nigeria-focused PM Consulting, saying that defections to the APC helped Buhari to defeat Jonathan.  “The challenge now for the opposition will be to overcome factional differences and personal ambitions and find, at this relatively late stage, a credible candidate to challenge President Buhari next February,” he said.  Nigeria’s main opposition parties earlier in July agreed to form an alliance to field a joint candidate to contest the election.  Buhari said in April he would seek another term and he looks set to receive party approval. Party primaries to choose presidential candidates run from Aug. 18 to Oct. 7.  Divisions in the APC emerged since its conference in June when new party leaders were elected and others saw their hopes of party advancement dashed. All but two of the 16 senators who left the APC last week joined the opposition PDP. As a result, the APC has lost its Senate majority.

2018-07-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets inched up on Tuesday helped partly by a report that the United States and China were seeking to resume talks to defuse the battle over import tariffs, while the U.S. dollar rose against the yen after the Bank of Japan said it intends to keep interest rates low. Representatives of U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He have been speaking privately as they seek to restart negotiations and avoid a full-scale trade war, Bloomberg reported, citing sources.  The White House, the Treasury and the U.S. Trade Representative’s office declined to comment but Mnuchin has repeatedly said in recent weeks he was ready to restart talks if China was prepared to make “meaningful changes” to its trade and technology transfer policies. A public comment period on the proposed U.S. tariffs of 25 percent on a further $16 billion of Chinese imports ends on Tuesday.  “The most important influence on the markets today is some tempering of the trade war escalation,” said Bill Northey, senior vice president at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Helena, Montana. By the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.36 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,415.19, the S&P 500 gained 13.69 points, or 0.49 percent, to 2,816.29 and the Nasdaq Composite added 41.79 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,671.79.[L4N1UR6DC] The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.24 percent while MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent. Regional indexes for Britain’s FTSE 100, Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC 40 all climbing. The U.S. equities market has withstood the recent sell-off in technology stocks and fears of a full-blown trade war remarkably well, said Hank Smith, co-chief investment officer at Haverford Trust in  Radnor, Pennsylvania.  U.S. President Donald Trump pays attention to the stock market and if there were a significant sell-off on trade tariff headlines, Smith said, Trump would reverse positions. “The economy has momentum to withstand these tit-for-tat trade spats that are going on right now. The market is, at least for now, seeing this as negotiations as opposed to the beginning of an all out-out global trade war,” Smith said. Meanwhile, Bank of Japan reassurances that it will maintain super-easy monetary policies for an “extended period of time” pushed the yen down and bond yields lower worldwide. The U.S. dollar was 0.69 percent higher against the yen, its best day in nearly three weeks after the BOJ said it would keep rates “very low” in comments that brought some relief to a market that had braced for bigger changes. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond dropped five basis points after the announcement.  Investors await policy meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England on Thursday. “We still have a decent amount of news ahead of us,” said George Goncalves, head of U.S. rate strategy at Nomura Securities International. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.9617 percent.

2018-07-31,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group said on Tuesday it is unilaterally halting attacks in the Red Sea for two weeks to support peace efforts, days after Saudi Arabia suspended oil exports through a strategic Red Sea channel following attacks on crude tankers last week. Yemen - where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in a three-year-old war - lies on one of the world’s most important trade routes for oil tankers, the Bab al-Mandeb strait. “The unilateral halt in naval military operations will be for a limited time period and could be extended and include all fronts if this move is reciprocated by the leadership of the coalition,” the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement. A statement from the Houthi-controlled defence ministry said later that the movement was halting naval operations for two weeks, starting at midnight (2000 GMT) on Aug. 1. “We welcome any initiative to spare bloodshed and stop aggression against Yemen,” the statement published on the state news agency SABA said, quoting a defence ministry official. Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the strait after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers, one of which sustained minimal damage, until the waterway was safe. Analysts say Riyadh is trying to encourage its Western allies to take the danger posed by the Houthis more seriously and step up support for its war in Yemen, where thousands of air strikes and a limited ground operation have produced only modest results while deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.  A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Houthi leader said the group’s initiative aimed to supports efforts to find a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people according to the United Nations. U.N. special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has been shuttling between the warring parties to avert a coalition assault on the main port city of Hodeidah, that the U.N. fears risks causing a famine. Hodeidah port is the main port of the impoverished Arab country, where around 8.4 million people are believed to be on the verge of starvation. The Western-backed coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognised government in exile and thwart what Riyadh sees as Iran’s expansionary ambitions in the region.

2018-07-31,"* 10-year JGB yields pull away from 1-1/2 year highs * U.S. tech sell-off weighs on world stocks * Fed and BOE rate meetings now in market focus (updates prices throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Reassurance by the Bank of Japan that it will keep its super-easy monetary policies in place for an extended period pushed the yen and global bond yields lower on Tuesday, though mounting concerns about the tech sector kept world stocks under pressure. A recent Reuters report that the BOJ could be debating scaling back its massive stimulus programme had sent Japanese bond yields to 1-1/2 year highs, spilling into euro zone and U.S. debt markets. That helped push the yen more than 2 percent off six-month lows hit against the dollar in early July . But while the BOJ announced some tweaks to its equity purchase programme and said its stimulus plan would be more flexible, the changes did not show any inclination for radical shifts from its accommodative stance. In response, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds <JP10YT=RR fell 3 basis points, and 40-year yields slid nearly 9 basis points, pushing 10-year U.S. and German yields down around 2-3 bps. “The BOJ is important in the sense of what they didn’t do,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “It was disappointing for some investors who thought they would be more hawkish in their approach and the market reaction, with lower yen and bond yields, shows that view which many people held, is mistaken.” Euro zone yields later inched up to trade around flat after data showed inflation above forecast, though this was driven by higher energy costs. Separate data revealed the bloc’s economic growth had been slower than expected in the second quarter of 2018. The yen fell 0.4 percent to trade around 111.2 yen per dollar. Many analysts now see it easing to around 113, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve delivers a hawkish interest rate message when its policy meeting ends on Wednesday . The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies but looks likely to snap a three-month streak of gains as markets have more or less priced in two more Fed rate hikes this year. The greenback had rallied more than 5 percent in the second 2018 quarter. The BOJ’s dovish pledge failed to offer a boost to equities, however. Markets have been roiled by growing concerns about the global tech sector which had seemed relatively immune to trade tensions between the United States, Europe and China. Lacklustre earnings from Netflix and Facebook have triggered losses across the tech sector, with Wall Street’s tech index shedding 6 percent in the past three sessions. That pushed world stocks to one-week lows and even Japan’s Nikkei failed to hold on to earlier BOJ-fuelled gains. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific tech shares fell almost one percent. European tech followed suit, losing 0.6 percent and lagging broader equities that were flat on the day. Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open, futures signalled as investors await second quarter earnings from the biggest company, iPhone maker Apple. But the tech retreat has overshadowed an otherwise buoyant U.S. earnings season, with average 22.6 percent profit growth and 83 percent of companies beating consensus estimates so far. Milligan attributed the setback to a re-assessment of share prices and summer profit-taking rather than a fundamental loss of confidence in the sector. World stocks are still set to end July with the best monthly returns since January, he noted. “The market is saying ‘you are fairly valued around these prices so let’s wait for the next big story’. That will either be on the downside with trade tensions in autumn or it could positive if Chinese stimulus turns out to be greater than expected,” Milligan added. He was referring to Beijing’s announcements, offering more fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of U.S. trade tariffs and incentives for banks to lend to small business. Markets now await Wednesday’s Fed policy statement to see if the expected two rate hikes for the remainder of 2018 can be cemented in. In Britain, a 25 basis-point hike is now widely expected on Thursday, despite economic weakness linked to Britain’s looming European Union exit. The British pound has already priced the move, David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said, adding: “I think they will do it but it will be one and done.” The pound firmed 0.2 percent to around $1.3159, having drifted off 10-month troughs of $1.2955 touched earlier in July.

2018-07-31,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s president called on Tuesday for the immediate implementation of a plan to widen the use of biodiesel that his economic ministers hope will cut the country’s fuel import bill by billions of dollars and halt a decline in the rupiah currency. Joko Widodo also sounded an alarm on the foreign exchange reserves of Southeast Asia’s largest economy, less than a week after he pleaded with exporters to bring home earnings they currently keep offshore to stem the slide in the rupiah. “The country needs dollars now,” Widodo said at the opening of a cabinet meeting, before reporters were ushered out. “I don’t want to keep doing meetings without good implementation.” Concerns about tighter U.S. monetary policy and a global trade war have put emerging market currencies under pressure. Indonesia's central bank has spent about $12 billion of its foreign exchange reserves in recent months and hiked policy interest rates by 100 basis points to defend the rupiah IDR=ID, which has lost about 6 percent of its value against the dollar this year. Cabinet ministers have met at least six times since the start of July to tackle concerns over trade and the rupiah, said a senior government official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. “Like any other central bank in the world, Bank Indonesia can only slow things down and smooth things out, but cannot stop underlying trends driven by fundamentals,” the official said. One key remedy the government sees as a way to cut the current account deficit - which the central bank estimated would widen by $8 billion this year - is a plan to substitute fuel imports with palm oil-based biodiesel by making it mandatory for all diesel vehicles, including locomotive engines and heavy equipment. The present rules, intended to boost consumption of palm-oil-based biodiesel, apply only to subsidized diesel, which some users and vehicles are not allowed to buy. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of palm oil, the raw ingredient for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), which can be used to make biodiesel. Vegetable oil prices are currently low in relation to fossil fuel prices, which have risen sharply, so government planners see sense in consuming more palm oil domestically to curb imports of diesel. Expanding the so-called B20 biodiesel program could save Indonesia $2-4 billion in import costs a year, the official said. Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto told reporters this week the saving could be as much as $5 billion. “In the short term, this would be a faster solution compared to trying to boost exports,” said Josua Pardede, an economist at Bank Permata in Jakarta. “Replacing imports would be one alternative to maintain the current account deficit at a healthy level.” A presidential regulation on expanding B20 had been completed and it would start no later than next month, said Chief Economic Minister Darmin Nasution. Along with low prices, Indonesian palm oil exporters are already facing pressure Europe due to concerns over environmental damage related to deforestation, so more domestic consumption will be welcome to plantation companies. However, while biodiesel can cut fuel costs and reduce emissions, some varieties need special handling and equipment as the fuel has a solvent effect, corroding engine seals and gasket materials, and it can solidify in the cold. Indonesia’s auto industries group, GAIKINDO, has said stepping up biodiesel blends can increase fuel consumption and could cause engines to overheat. Kyatmaja Lookman, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Trucking Association, said fuel consumption could increase by 2 percent. “The question is, when our drivers have to spend more on fuel, their welfare is also declining,” he told reporters. “Who will be responsible for this 2 percent increase? The transportation business margin is only around 6-8 percent.” Additional reporting by Tabita Diela and Bernadette Christina Munthe; Writing by John Chalmers and Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Neil Fullick",https://uk.reuters.com/article/indonesia-economy/update-2-indonesia-president-pushes-biodiesel-plan-to-stop-currency-tanking-idUKL4N1UR303,31 Jul 2018,"* That could ease pressure on current account

At least 15 government critics were arrested since mid-May, some of whose whereabouts are unknown amid a serious lack of transparency in the processing of their cases, the rights office said.  They included prominent women’s rights advocate Hatoon al-Fassi, arrested in June as she was planning to take journalists in her car to celebrate the much-hyped end of the world’s last ban on female drivers, long seen as an emblem of repression in the deeply conservative Muslim country. “We urge the Government of Saudi Arabia to unconditionally release all human rights defenders and activists who have been detained for their peaceful human rights work, including their decades-long campaigns for the lifting of the driving ban for women,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne set to become the first Saudi king from a new generation after a succession of six brothers dating back to 1953, has initiated broad reforms to diversify the economy from oil and update deeply conservative social norms. But critics say the reforms have not extended into politics in an absolute monarchy where all public opposition to the authorities is still banned. Genuine reforms appear to be taking place in the kingdom, “but this has not extended to the civil and political rights sphere”, Shamsadani told a Geneva news briefing “Dissent, criticism of the government is still not accepted in the country. That can explain why many of these human rights defenders and activists have been jailed. All of them have criticised government policies in one way or another,” she said.

2018-07-31,JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom said on Tuesday that one of the coal-fired units at its Arnot power station was not working but denied claims by two union sources that five of the units were down because of low coal supplies and wage protests.  Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe did confirm union reports of intimidation at the plant by protesting employees preventing non-striking colleagues from showing up to work. He could not confirm reports that three other units at two power stations were down.  The utility has warned that there was a high risk of electricity cuts this week because of the disruptions.

2018-07-31,"* Iran sanctions, political tensions to support prices * Global trade tensions likely to weigh on oil markets * Analysts raise price forecasts for 10th straight month * For a table of crude price forecasts, click By Sumita Layek July 31 - Oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the U.S. meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. A survey of 44 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude to average $72.87 a barrel in 2018, 29 cents higher than the $72.58 projected in the previous month’s poll and above the $71.68 average so far this year. U.S. crude futures were seen averaging $67.32 a barrel in 2018, compared with $66.79 forecast last month and an average of $66.16 until now. This is the 10th consecutive month in which analysts have raised their oil price forecasts. “We expect prices will largely remain range-bound in the second half of 2018 and 2019. On the one hand, robust U.S. shale production and market concerns over the brewing U.S.-China trade war will help keep a lid on prices,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “On the other hand, the recent decline in global stocks will make prices more sensitive to any geopolitical risk, which will keep prices from falling significantly below current levels.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC countries agreed to raise supply in a meeting last month to meet rising global demand, but the group did not specify a clear target for the output increase. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions on Iran that will come into force later this year will force a decline in exports and help support prices, analysts said. “The disruption to Iranian barrels will weigh on oil markets in the second half of 2018 and H1 2019 as there are few spare barrels in the market that can offset a big disruption to Iranian supplies,” said Emirates NBD commodities analyst Edward Bell. The United States pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran in early May casting uncertainty over global oil supplies, and since then it has been preparing to work with countries to help them to cut Iran oil imports. Analysts expect a drop of about 500,000-1 million barrels per day (bpd) in Iranian output due to the sanctions. But they also said the ongoing global trade tensions could hurt demand. “A trade war will slow down economic growth and demand for oil but also eventually spill over into other asset classes, mostly equities, that can have an impact on oil prices through a negative market sentiment,” Jette Jørgensen of Global Risk Management Ltd said. Analysts continued to see Asia as the main demand driver, projecting an additional 800,000-900,000 bpd in demand this year and the next from the region. “The market is facing different questions — Is global demand slowing due to weakening worldwide economic growth, will U.S. production keep up its incredible pace, will output in Venezuela keep plummeting, what will U.S. sanctions do to Iranian production, and is OPEC really willing to raise output up to 1 mbpd!” Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW, said.

2018-07-31,"LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump was mistaken to expect Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to compensate for supply losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran, after OPEC production rose only modestly in July. The comments, from Iran’s OPEC governor, came a day after a Reuters survey showed OPEC production rose by 70,000 barrels per day in July. Saudi production increased but was offset by a decline in Iranian supply due to the restart of U.S. sanctions, the survey found. “It seems President Trump has been taken hostage by Saudi Arabia and a few producers when they claimed they can replace 2.5 million barrels per day of Iranian exports, encouraging him to take action against Iran,” Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters. “Now they and Russia sell more oil and more expensively. Not even from their incremental production but their stocks.” He said oil prices, which Trump has been pressuring the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down by raising output, will rise unless the United States grants waivers to buyers of Iranian crude. “They are also calling for the use of the U.S. SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). This will also mean higher prices. U.S. waivers to our clients if they come is due to the failure of bluffers (Saudi and the other producers) and, if not given, will again push the prices higher,” he said. “So they hanged him (Trump) on the wall. Now they want to have a mega OPEC, congratulations to President Trump, Russia and Saudi Arabia.” OPEC governors represent their respective country on the organisation’s board of governors and are typically the second most senior person in a country’s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. “The longer-term solution, Mr President, is to support and facilitate capacity building in all countries, proportionate to their reserves of oil and gas. And we will remain the biggest opportunity,” Kazempour said.

In May, the United States pulled out of the 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would be willing to meet Iran’s leader without preconditions to discuss how to improve ties. Iran and other signatories, especially European powers, have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement despite the withdrawal of the United States. “After the U.S. illegal withdrawal from the nuclear deal, the ball is in Europe’s court now,” Rouhani was quoted as saying by his official website in a meeting with British Ambassador to Tehran Rob Macaire. “The Islamic Republic has never sought tension in the region and does not want any trouble in global waterways, but it will not easily give up on its rights to export oil,” Rouhani said.

2018-07-31,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa faces power cuts with 15 units down at nine Eskom stations, taking over 6,000 megawatts or 13 percent of the utility’s output off the national grid, an internal document seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday. Eskom provides more than 90 percent of the power for Africa’s most industrialised economy, but the state-owned utility has been hit by labour unrest over wage talks as it tries to reverse a decade of financial decline by cutting costs. The power utility said later on Tuesday it had implemented controlled electricity cuts from 5 p.m. (1500 GMT) to 10 p.m., citing “a shortage of capacity” after power supply was affected by labour unrest by workers who are demanding higher wages. Power cuts during the ongoing winter are likely to cause hardship for millions. The document, sent on Tuesday to senior staff of the struggling utility, shows that four units are down at the Arnot station, contradicting an earlier claim by Eskom that only one of the six coal-fired units there was not functioning.  Reasons cited for the outages at the 15 units in total include an ongoing wildcat strike and low coal levels which union sources say are related to the industrial unrest along the coal belt east of Johannesburg. Eleven of the units went down on Monday and Tuesday, underscoring the impact of the protests.  The other four went down months ago or last year for reasons unrelated to the protests. Only two of the 15 units, both at Arnot, are expected to come back on line on Tuesday, according to the document. Nine are expected to start generating power again this week.  Non-striking employees at the Arnot station on Tuesday were prevented from showing up to work by striking colleagues, according to Eskom and union sources. The threat of protests and outages had appeared to recede after Eskom offered to raise salaries by around 7 percent annually over the next three years, but trade unions want bonuses to be paid before they agree a wage deal. Eskom, which has a total national output of 45,000 MW, was forced to implement controlled electricity outages in mid-June after workers protested over wages.  Previously, Eskom implemented such measures, known locally as “load shedding”, in 2015, denting economic output. Last week Eskom said it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after swinging to a $171 million loss which underlined the gravity of its financial position. South Africa’s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, replaced Eskom’s entire board and top executives in January, in a bid to revive a crucial state enterprise.

2018-07-31,"LUANDA (Reuters) - The daughter of a former president of Angola failed to respond to her first summons from state prosecutors to answer questions about her time running Sonangol, the state oil company, Angola’s state news agency Angop reported. Isabel dos Santos is allowed to provide reasons for not appearing three times, Angop said late on Monday, citing a source in the prosecutor general’s office. After that, however, she might face arrest. The investigation relates to allegations made in February by current Sonangol chairman Carlos Saturnino. He said an internal audit had uncovered suspicious transactions overseen by dos Santos, including a payment of $38 million (£29 million) made to a Dubai-based company she approved after she was dismissed from Sonangol. Dos Santos has denied any wrongdoing and accused Saturnino of trying “to rewrite history.” A spokeswoman for dos Santos said she had not received any summons. “Ms Isabel dos Santos was surprised when she was informed by the media that she had been notified to respond regarding her management at Sonangol,” the spokeswoman said. Angop said the summons was made on July 17 for her to appear before prosecutors the next day. A spokesman for the prosecutor general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  President Joao Lourenço, who took office in September when Jose Eduardo dos Santos stepped down after nearly four decades in power, has acted to sideline powerful figures associated with his predecessor and tackle rampant corruption. He sacked Isabel dos Santos as chair of Sonangol and her half-brother Jose Filomeno dos Santos as head of the Sovereign Wealth Fund. The latter is also a suspect in a fraud case involving a transfer of $500 million from the central bank. He has said he is cooperating with authorities.

2018-07-31,"ROME, July 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Adopting some of the most stringent measures needed to curb climate change across all industries could cause hunger levels to rise by three times as much as global warming itself, according to a study released on Tuesday. Including agriculture in schemes such as a global carbon tax could put 78 million more people at risk of hunger by 2050 by pushing up the price of food, said the researchers, whose paper was published in Nature Climate Change. That compares with an estimated 24 million from climate change alone, they said. Globally, 815 million people are already going hungry, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “It will become difficult for the poor and vulnerable people to buy enough food,” said Tomoko Hasegawa, one of the lead researchers of the paper, which recommends countries instead adopt specific policies for agriculture. “Some people may also shift from nutrition-rich products to less nutritious food.” Agriculture, forestry and other land uses together account for nearly a quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according the FAO. But introducing carbon taxes, expanding biofuel plantations and planting trees - all measures that would help countries meet their commitments under the Paris climate agreement - would increase the cost of food production, the paper said. “By 2050, stringent climate mitigation policy, if implemented evenly across all sectors and regions, would have a greater negative impact on global hunger and food consumption than the direct impacts of climate change,” it said. “The negative impacts would be most prevalent in vulnerable, low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where food security problems are already acute.” The findings underscore the challenges of cutting emissions produced through agriculture, which experts say is essential to cap the rise in global temperatures at a manageable level as agreed under the Paris deal. Hasegawa, a scientist with Japan’s National Institute for Environmental Studies, said the researchers were not trying to downplay the need for mitigation, but rather wanted policymakers to be flexible in designing policies. Alternatives to carbon taxes - levies on emissions - include transferring technologies that improve crop yields from developed nations to help vulnerable countries farm more efficiently, she said. Taxing red meat and dairy products and making farming livestock in developing countries more efficient, could also cut both emissions and improve nutrition, the paper said. Scientists around the world are already working on making livestock less gassy to fight global warming. France, Britain, Japan and parts of Canada have introduced carbon taxes, while large agricultural producers including the United States and Brazil have initiated policies to support biofuels, the paper said.

2018-07-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (015760.KS) has lost its preferred bidder status to buy Toshiba’s (6502.T) NuGen nuclear project in Britain as Toshiba looks at other alternatives, the Japanese company said on Tuesday. The project in Moorside, northwest England, was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain’s electricity when built, but has faced setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. Following the Westinghouse bankruptcy, NuGen joint venture partner Engie (ENGIE.PA) pulled out of the project, which has been estimated to cost between $15 and $20 billion (£11.4 billion and £15.2 billion), leaving the Japanese firm searching for new investors. KEPCO was chosen as preferred bidder last year but delays in concluding the deal have led to a review of operations at NuGen and of the roles of its 60 direct employees plus around 40 contractors. While KEPCO is no longer the preferred bidder, Toshiba said it remained in the frame as a possible buyer. “Toshiba continues to consider additional options including the sale of its shares in NuGen to KEPCO, and we are carefully monitoring the situation, in consultation with stakeholders including the UK government,” a spokesperson for Toshiba said in an email to Reuters. South Korea’s energy ministry said Toshiba notified it of the withdrawal of preferred bidder status on July 25 so it has opportunities for negotiation with other companies. However, Toshiba said it understands that an additional review is needed for a new business model and will keep talking to KEPCO as a first priority, the ministry said in a statement. The ministry added that it, British government officials and KEPCO met in London and they agreed to carry out a joint feasibility study on the project.  Once the study is completed, KEPCO will consult with the South Korean government over the possibility of it taking part in the project, the ministry said.  Britain needs to invest in new capacity to replace ageing coal and nuclear reactors that are due to close in the 2020s, but large new plants have struggled to get off the ground due to high costs and weak electricity prices.

2018-07-31,"MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Across Maracaibo, the capital of Venezuela’s largest state, residents unplug refrigerators to guard against power surges. Many only buy food they will consume the same day. Others regularly sleep outside.  The rolling power blackouts in the state of Zulia pile more misery on Venezuelans living under a fifth year of an economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition, hyperinflation and mass emigration. OPEC member Venezuela’s once-thriving socialist economy has collapsed since the 2014 fall of oil prices LCOc1. “I never thought I would have to go through this,” said bakery worker Cindy Morales, 36, her eyes welling with tears. “I don’t have food, I don’t have power, I don’t have money.”  Zulia, the historic heart of Venezuela’s energy industry that was for decades known for opulent oil wealth, has been plunged into darkness for several hours a day since March, sometimes leaving its 3.7 million residents with no electricity for up to 24 hours. In the past, Zulians considered themselves living in a “Venezuelan Texas”, rich from oil and with an identity proudly distinct from the rest of the country. Oil workers could often be seen driving new cars and flew by private jet to the Dutch Caribbean territory of Curacao to gamble their earnings in casinos.  Once famous for its all-night parties, now Maracaibo is often a sea of darkness at night due to blackouts.  The six state-owned power stations throughout Zulia have plenty of oil to generate electricity but a lack of maintenance and spare parts causes frequent breakdowns, leaving the plants running at 20 percent capacity, said Angel Navas, the president of the national Federation of Electrical Workers. Energy Minister Luis Motta said this month that power cuts of up to eight hours a day would be the norm in Zulia while authorities developed a “stabilization” plan. He did not provide additional details and the Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.  The Zulia state government did not respond to a request to comment. Although Caracas has fared far better than Maracaibo, a major outage hit the capital city on Tuesday morning for around two hours due to a fault at a substation. The energy minister said “heavy rains” had been reported near the substation.  Venezuelans were forced to walk or cram into buses as much of the subway was shut. Long lines formed in front of banks and stores in the hopes power would flick back on. The fault also affected some phone lines and the main Maiquetia airport just outside the capital. “This is terrible. I feel helpless because I want to go to work but I am in this queue instead,” said domestic worker Nassari Parra, 50, as she waited in a line of 20 people in front of a closed bank. Retiree Judith Palmar, 56, took advantage of having power to cook one afternoon last week in Maracaibo. When the lights do go out, Palmar wheels her paralysed mother outside because the house becomes intolerably hot. One power cut damaged an air conditioning unit, which Palmar cannot afford to replace on her pension of about $1.50 a month due to inflation, estimated by the opposition-run Congress in June at 46,000 percent a year. Outages are taking a toll on businesses in Zulia.      Zulia used to produce 70 percent of Venezuela’s milk and meat but without power to milk cows and keep meat from spoiling, the state’s production has fallen nearly in half, according to Venezuela’s National Federation of Ranchers. Zulia’s proportion of Venezuela’s total oil production has also slipped over the past 10 years from 38 percent to 25 percent, figures from state oil company PDVSA show. Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second largest city, seems like a “ghost town,” said Fergus Walshe, head of a local business organisation. He said businesses had shortened their operating hours due to the lack of power. “Before, business activity here was booming,” he said. Small businesses are also affected. In an industrial park in Maracaibo’s outskirts, 80 percent of the 1,000 companies based there are affected by the power cuts, according to another business association in Zulia. Sales at Americo Fernandez’ spare parts store are down 50 percent because card readers, which are crucial because even the cheapest goods require unwieldy piles of banknotes, cannot be used during power cuts.  “I have had to improvise to stay afloat. I connect the car battery to the store so that the card readers can work,” Fernandez said during a power outage at his home, surrounded by candles.

2018-07-31,"(Reuters) - U.S. Silica Holdings Inc’s (SLCA.N), which makes sand used in hydraulic fracturing, forecast an upbeat second half of the year on strong demand for locally sourced sand, helping its shares recover after disappointing quarterly results. Permian producers are increasingly using locally available sand for fracking to save transport costs. U.S. silica said it signed four new local sand delivery contracts in the second quarter. Chief Executive Officer Bryan Shinn said on a post-earnings conference call that he expects 15-16 percent of all Permian sand demand to be met locally by mid-2019. “The trend towards longer laterals and more sand per well is continuing and will drive strong demand into 2019 and beyond.” Shinn said. The company’s shares, which were down as much as 4.3 percent on results, were up 1 percent at $27.24. The U.S. shale revolution, centered around the Permian basin, has driven oil and gas producers to dig deeper for oil. Latest designs involve longer lateral wells that are kept open by the use of proppants like sand. Shinn said he does not see oil and gas producers from the Oklahoma, Arkansas and Mississippi basins buying frac sand from the regional and in-basin sand producers yet. “The concern is real as trucking rates continue to climb limiting the cost-effective transportability of sand,” Tudor Pickering & Co analyst George Leary said. Shinn said U.S. Silica will continue to double its oil and gas volumes to meet growing demand for frac sand. “We expect to start accreting cash in the second half of the year, and quickly generate significant cash flows in 2019, delivering free cash flow yield approaching 15 percent next year,” he said. Revenue from its oil and gas proppants business, its biggest, rose about 38 percent to $324.1 million, while total oil and gas volumes sold rose 26 percent to 3.465 million tons in the second quarter. The Katy, Texas-based company said it expects oil & gas volumes to be up in the range of 20-25 percent in the third quarter.  Net income fell 40 percent to $17.6 million, or 22 cents per share, in the second-quarter ended June 30 on higher costs. Excluding items, the company earned 64 cents per share.  Total sales rose 47.2 percent to $427.4 million..  Analysts were expecting the company to report a profit of 68 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

In May, Trump pulled the United States out of the multilateral deal concluded before he took office, denouncing it as one-sided in Iran’s favour. On Monday, he declared that he would be willing to meet Rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve relations. The head of Iran’s Strategic Council on Foreign Relations said on Tuesday Tehran saw no worth in Trump’s offer, made only a week after he warned Iran it risked dire consequences few had ever suffered in history if it made threats against Washington. “Based on our bad experiences in negotiations with America and based on U.S. officials’ violation of their commitments, it is natural that we see no value in his proposal,” Kamal Kharrazi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. “Trump should first make up for his withdrawal from the nuclear deal and show that he respects his predecessors’ commitments and international law,” added Kharrazi, a former foreign minister. The council was set up by Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to help formulate long-term policies for the Islamic Republic. Trump’s move to force Iran into fresh negotiations has for now reunited Iranian hardliners who opposed the nuclear deal and moderates like Rouhani who championed it to end the Islamic Republic’s economically crippling stand-off with Western powers. Ali Motahari, the deputy speaker of Iran’s parliament who is seen as part of Iran’s moderate camp, said that to negotiate with Trump now “would be a humiliation”. “If Trump had not withdrawn from the nuclear deal and not imposed (new) sanctions on Iran, there would be no problem with negotiations with America,” he told state news agency IRNA. Iran’s interior minister chimed in that Tehran did not trust Washington as a negotiating partner. “The United States is not trustworthy. How can we trust this country when it withdraws unilaterally from the nuclear deal?” Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency. A senior aide to Rouhani said the only way back to talks was for Washington to return to the nuclear agreement. “Respecting the Iranian nation’s rights, reducing hostilities and returning to the nuclear deal are steps that can be taken to pave the bumpy road of talks between Iran and America,” Hamid Aboutalebi tweeted on Tuesday. Under the 2015 deal, the fruit of Rouhani’s efforts to ease Iran’s international isolation to help revive its economy, Iran curbed its shadowy nuclear programme and won relief from U.N. and Western sanctions in return. Trump condemned the deal in part because it did not cover Iran’s ballistic missile programme and involvement in Middle East conflicts. He reactivated U.S. sanctions, the most all-encompassing measures against Iran, and warned countries to stop importing Iranian oil from Nov. 4 or risk U.S. penalties. The three major European signatories to the 2015 deal have been searching for ways to salvage it but cautioned Tehran that they may not be able to persuade many major investors not to bolt from business with Iran to avoid U.S. punishment. Rouhani said during a meeting with Britain’s ambassador on Tuesday that after what he called the “illegal” U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal, “the ball is in Europe’s court now”. He added, “The Islamic Republic has never sought tension in the region and does not want any trouble in global waterways, but it will not easily give up on its rights to export oil.” Rouhani and some senior military commanders have said Iran could disrupt oil shipments from Gulf states through the Strait of Hormuz if Washington tries to choke off Iranian oil exports. Reiterating Tehran’s official stance, Iranian Navy Commander Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency on Tuesday that the strait would remain open “if Iran’s national interests are preserved”. Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters on Tuesday that Trump was mistaken to expect Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to compensate for losses of Iranian oil caused by U.S. sanctions. “It seems President Trump has been taken hostage by Saudi Arabia and a few producers when they claimed they can replace 2.5 million barrels per day of Iranian exports, encouraging him to take action against Iran,” Ardebili said. “Now they and Russia sell more oil and more expensively. Not even from their incremental production but their stocks.” He said oil prices, which Trump has been pressuring the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down by raising output, will instead rise unless the United States grants waivers to buyers of Iranian crude. Iran’s currency plumbed new depths on Monday, dropping past 120,000 rials to the dollar, but Trump’s expressed willingness to negotiate with Tehran sparked a minor recovery on Tuesday to 110,000 rials on the unofficial market. Iranian Vice-President Eshagh Jahangiri said the government and the central bank would unveil a new economic plan by the end of this week to tackle the U.S. sanctions and the rial’s fall. Videos on social media showed hundreds of people rallying in Isfahan in central Iran in protest at high prices caused in part by the rial’s devaluation under heightened U.S. pressure.

2018-07-31,"(Adds detail from report, background, EXCLUSIVE tag) By Ed Stoddard JOHANNESBURG, July 31 (Reuters) - Fifteen units are down at nine South African power stations, taking over 6,000 megawatts or 13 percent of Eskom’s output off the national grid, an internal document seen by Reuters showed on Tuesday. Eskom provides more than 90 percent of the power for Africa’s most industrialised economy, but the state-owned utility has been hit by labour unrest over wage talks as it tries to reverse a decade of financial decline by cutting costs. Earlier, it warned there was a high risk of electricity cuts on Tuesday because of “unplanned outages”. Power cuts during the ongoing winter are likely to cause hardship for millions. The document, sent on Tuesday to senior staff of the struggling utility, shows that four units are down at the Arnot station, contradicting an earlier claim by Eskom that only one of the six coal-fired units there was not functioning. Reasons cited for the outages at the 15 units in total include an ongoing wildcat strike and low coal levels which union sources say are related to the industrial unrest along the coal belt east of Johannesburg. Eleven of the units went down on Monday and Tuesday, underscoring the impact of the protests. The other four went down months ago or last year for reasons unrelated to the protests. Only two of the 15 units, both at Arnot, are expected to come back on line on Tuesday, according to the document. Nine are expected to start generating power again this week. Non-striking employees at the Arnot station on Tuesday were prevented from showing up to work by striking colleagues, according to Eskom and union sources. The threat of protests and outages had appeared to recede after Eskom offered to raise salaries by around 7 percent annually over the next three years, but trade unions want bonuses to be paid before they agree a wage deal. Eskom was forced to implement controlled electricity outages in mid-June after workers protested over wages. Previously, Eskom implemented such measures, known locally as “load shedding”, in 2015, denting economic output. Last week Eskom said it was considering cutting staff and selling assets after swinging to a $171 million loss which underlined the gravity of its financial position. South Africa’s new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, replaced Eskom’s entire board and top executives in January, in a bid to revive a crucial state enterprise.

2018-07-31,"DUBAI, July 31 (Reuters) - Yemen’s Houthi group said on Tuesday it is ready to unilaterally halt attacks in the Red Sea to support peace efforts, days after Saudi Arabia suspended oil exports through a strategic Red Sea channel following an attack on crude tankers last week. Yemen, where a Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement in a three-year-old war, borders the Bab al-Mandeb strait, which is one of the world’s most important trade routes for oil tankers. “The unilateral halt in naval military operations will be for a limited time period and could be extended and include all fronts if this move is reciprocated by the leadership of the coalition,” the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, said in a statement. It was not clear whether the group would halt its attacks immediately or how long the cessation would last. Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it was suspending oil shipments through the strait after the Houthis attacked two Saudi oil tankers, one of which sustained minimal damage, until the waterway was safe. Analysts say Riyadh is trying to encourage its Western allies to take more seriously the danger posed by the Houthis and step up support for its war in Yemen, where thousands of air strikes and a limited ground operation have produced only modest results while deepening the world’s worst humanitarian crisis. A coalition spokesman did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The Houthi leader said the group’s initiative aimed to supports efforts to find a political solution to the conflict, which has killed more than 10,000 people according to the United Nations. U.N. special envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths has been shuttling between the warring parties to avert a coalition assault on the main port city of Hodeidah, that the United Nations fears risks triggering a famine. Hodeidah port is the main port of the impoverished Arab country, where around 8.4 million people are believed to be on the verge of starvation. The Western-backed coalition of Sunni Muslim Arab states intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to restore the internationally recognized government in exile and thwart what Riyadh sees as Iran’s expansionary ambitions in the region.

2018-07-31,"Oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the U.S. meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.     A survey of 44 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 to average $72.87 a barrel in 2018, 29 cents higher than the $72.58 projected in the previous month’s poll and above the $71.68 average so far this year. To view a graphic on Reuters monthly oil price poll, click: reut.rs/2KchnZF U.S. crude futures CLc1 were seen averaging $67.32 a barrel in 2018, compared with $66.79 forecast last month and an average of $66.16 until now. This is the 10th consecutive month in which analysts have raised their oil price forecasts.  “We expect prices will largely remain range-bound in the second half of 2018 and 2019. On the one hand, robust U.S. shale production and market concerns over the brewing U.S.-China trade war will help keep a lid on prices,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “On the other hand, the recent decline in global stocks will make prices more sensitive to any geopolitical risk, which will keep prices from falling significantly below current levels.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC countries agreed to raise supply in a meeting last month to meet rising global demand, but the group did not specify a clear target for the output increase. To view a graphic on OPEC's crude output cuts and the Brent price, click: reut.rs/2LILZaU Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions on Iran that will come into force later this year will force a decline in exports and help support prices, analysts said. “The disruption to Iranian barrels will weigh on oil markets in the second half of 2018 and H1 2019 as there are few spare barrels in the market that can offset a big disruption to Iranian supplies,” said Emirates NBD commodities analyst Edward Bell. The United States pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran in early May casting uncertainty over global oil supplies, and since then it has been preparing to work with countries to help them to cut Iran oil imports. Analysts expect a drop of about 500,000-1 million barrels per day (bpd) in Iranian output due to the sanctions. But they also said the ongoing global trade tensions could hurt demand. “A trade war will slow down economic growth and demand for oil but also eventually spill over into other asset classes, mostly equities, that can have an impact on oil prices through a negative market sentiment,” Jette Jørgensen of Global Risk Management Ltd said. Analysts continued to see Asia as the main demand driver, projecting an additional 800,000-900,000 bpd in demand this year and the next from the region. “The market is facing different questions — Is global demand slowing due to weakening worldwide economic growth, will U.S. production keep up its incredible pace, will output in Venezuela keep plummeting, what will U.S. sanctions do to Iranian production, and is OPEC really willing to raise output up to 1 mbpd!” Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW, said.

2018-07-31,"(Repeats with no changes to text) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 31 (Reuters) - Two recent deals by the world’s two biggest mining companies both looked positive for shareholders, but also underscore the challenges facing major commodity producers. BHP Billiton last week agreed to sell its U.S. shale oil and gas assets for $10.5 billion, while Rio Tinto appears on track to exit its troubled investment in the giant Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia for about $3.5 billion. Both deals were generally well-received by investors, largely because they resolve long-running sores for the mining giants and will likely result in a return of the proceeds to shareholders. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie has said the proceeds of the sale of the U.S. shale assets will be returned to shareholders, but hasn’t yet given details of how and when. Rio Tinto has been cautious over the announced agreement to sell its Indonesian unit to the state-owned miner PT Inalum, which would effectively mean selling its 40 percent interest in Grasberg, which is operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. However, the chances are good that at least some of the proceeds, should the deal be finalised, will wind up in the hands of shareholders. While investors are usually pleased to get their hands on a pile of cash, the fact that BHP intends to hand over the cash and Rio Tinto may do the same illustrates that there really are very few suitable investment opportunities. Mining companies were heavily criticised for over-investing in the last boom period, which ended in 2011 and was followed by five years of declining prices for most major commodities, such as iron ore and coal. This resulted in the companies turning their focus to operational efficiencies and boosting returns to shareholders, a shift that is still the current mantra most often heard from top mining executives. But while this was a necessary change in mindset, it is also a strategy that’s unlikely to work in the long term. BHP retains offshore crude oil assets in the United States, and its interest in liquefied natural gas in Australia. But the sale of the shale oil and gas assets, mainly to BP Plc, is an effective retreat from a business that has transformed the global energy landscape. Exiting shale also came at a substantial overall price for BHP, given the assets cost about $20 billion when purchased in 2011 and have been written down in value several times since then. Handing the money back to shareholders through boosted dividends or a share buyback will provide investors with a sugar hit, but do little to enhance the long-term value of BHP. BHP’s biggest division is its Western Australia iron ore, and the company remains heavily exposed to the fortunes of the Chinese steel sector, the buyer of two-thirds of the world’s seaborne iron ore supplies. Rio Tinto is even more exposed to iron ore, with its operations in Western Australia accounting for about 70 percent of its earnings. Both BHP and Rio Tinto have struggled to diversify away from iron ore, and both have made costly and unsuccessful acquisitions in the past 20 years. BHP’s massive Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia has had problems ramping up production, while similar issues have impacted Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. These assets are good enough to be worth investing time, money and effort to get them working efficiently, but the difficulties both companies have encountered show there are probably no easy major projects left in the world. This poses the question: What next for BHP, Rio Tinto and other major miners such as Anglo American and Brazil’s Vale ? They run the risk of being companies that can return cash to shareholders in the good times, but will lag when commodity prices go through the inevitable cyclical downturns. While it would be foolish to advocate the companies jumping headlong into new mining areas such as battery metals like lithium and cobalt, it’s likely that eventually investors will demand more from the top resource companies.

2018-07-31,"MARACAIBO, Venezuela, July 31 (Reuters) - Across Maracaibo, the capital of Venezuela’s largest state, residents unplug refrigerators to guard against power surges. Many only buy food they will consume the same day. Others regularly sleep outside. The rolling blackouts in the state of Zulia pile more misery on Venezuelans living under a fifth year of an economic crisis that has sparked malnutrition, hyperinflation and mass emigration. The OPEC member’s once-thriving socialist economy has collapsed since the 2014 fall of oil prices. “I never thought I would have to go through this,” said bakery worker Cindy Morales, 36, her eyes welling with tears. “I don’t have food, I don’t have power, I don’t have money.” Zulia, the historic heart of Venezuela’s energy industry that was for decades known for opulent oil wealth, has been plunged into darkness for several hours a day since March, sometimes leaving its 3.7 million residents with no electricity for up to 24 hours. In the past, Zulians considered themselves living in a “Venezuelan Texas”, rich from oil and with an identity proudly distinct from the rest of the country. Oil workers could often be seen driving new cars and flew by private jet to the Dutch Caribbean territory of Curacao to gamble their earnings in their casinos. Once famous for its all-night parties, now Maracaibo is often a sea of darkness at night due to blackouts. The six state-owned power stations throughout Zulia have plenty of oil to generate electricity but a lack of maintenance and spare parts causes frequent breakdowns, leaving the plants running at 20 percent capacity, said Angel Navas, the president of the national Federation of Electrical Workers (Fetraelec). Energy Minister Luis Motta said this month that power cuts of up to eight hours a day would be the norm in Zulia while authorities developed a “stabilization” plan. He did not provide additional details and the Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The Zulia state government did not respond to a request to comment. Retiree Judith Palmar, 56, took advantage of having power to cook one afternoon last week. When the lights do go out, Palmar wheels her paralyzed mother outside because the house becomes intolerably hot. One power cut damaged an air conditioning unit, which Palmar cannot afford to replace on her pension of about $1.50 a month due to inflation, estimated by the opposition-run Congress in June at 46,000 percent a year. Outages are taking a toll on businesses in Zulia. Zulia used to produce 70 percent of Venezuela’s milk and meat but without power to milk cows and keep meat from spoiling, the state’s production has fallen nearly in half, according to Venezuela’s National Federation of Ranchers (Fedenaga). Zulia’s proportion of Venezuela’s total oil production has also slipped over the past 10 years from 38 percent to 25 percent, figures from state oil company PDVSA show. Maracaibo, Venezuela’s second largest city, seems like a “ghost town,” said Fergus Walshe, head of a local business organization. He said businesses had shortened their operating hours due to the lack of power. “Before, business activity here was booming,” he said. Small businesses are also affected. In an industrial park in Maracaibo’s outskirts, 80 percent of the 1,000 companies based there are affected by the power cuts, according to another business association in Zulia. Sales at Americo Fernandez’ spare parts store are down 50 percent because card readers, which are crucial because even the cheapest goods require unwieldy piles of banknotes, cannot be used during power cuts. “I have had to improvise to stay afloat. I connect the car battery to the store so that the card readers can work,” Fernandez said during a power outage at his home, surrounded by candles. Reporting by Mayela Armas;

2018-07-31,"ROAD TOWN, July 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Nearly a year after Hurricane Irma knocked out power across the British Virgin Islands, electricity boss Leroy Abraham will be among the last residents to have their homes reconnected. But Abraham, general manager of the British overseas territory’s electricity corporation (BVIEC), has barely had time to notice his own domestic outage. “I was far too exhausted from giving everybody else electricity,” said the 48-year-old, gazing at his two-storey house, which was wrecked by the ferocious storm that tore across the Caribbean archipelago last September. Abraham and other officials are working to avoid a repeat of the ordeal. One avenue they are pursuing is to diversify sources of electricity by adding renewables to the energy mix. The British Virgin Islands (BVI) were plunged into darkness for six months when Irma, packing winds of 185 miles per hour (295 kph), uprooted electricity poles and left 400 miles (645 km) of cable littering streets and hillsides. Like many small islands, the territory has long relied on costly imported fossil fuels to generate electric power. But to better withstand future disasters, it is now moving toward solar and geothermal alternatives, like many others in the region from Montserrat to St. Lucia. A series of solar energy projects is due to kick off soon, said Mark Vanterpool, BVI minister for communications and works. “It’s in our interest to work very hard at getting as much as possible renewable energy produced,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. If there is a silver lining to the trauma of a blanket power outage amid a humanitarian crisis, it is the growing urgency of bolstering the electricity grid with renewable energy, officials and observers say. Before the hurricane, there was interest in green power, but people were “moving in different directions”, said Kaitlyn Bunker of the Rocky Mountain Institute, a U.S.-based non-profit helping the BVI with its renewable energy transition. The experience of the hurricane has “catalysed” plans, she added. On the main island of Tortola, a privately funded 3-megawatt solar project led by local firm Caribbean Alternative Energy is close to being agreed, BVIEC’s Abraham said. The state utility, meanwhile, aims to set up a 300-kilowatt hybrid solar, wind and energy storage system on Anegada, a remote northern island, once an agreement to lease crown land is signed. The deal, four years in the pipeline, only made headway after Irma, Abraham noted. Plans are also being developed to fit solar panels on car-ports and school roofs on Tortola and Virgin Gorda, the BVI’s third-largest island. Key to the islands’ clean energy future are new regulations, now awaiting final approval, allowing residents to be paid for surplus renewable power they feed into the grid. The move should encourage home and business owners to install solar photovoltaic panels on their properties, and could increase the islands’ resilience to disasters, said Abraham. “We can’t put all our eggs in one basket,” he said. Studies show that when solar panels are well-engineered and installed, they can withstand hurricane-force winds, said Louis Gritzo, research manager at FM Global, a U.S. insurer that simulates natural hazards to test materials. At Green VI, a BVI non-profit that has long advocated for a law enabling the renewable energy sector, executive director Charlotte McDevitt said the regulatory development was “huge”. “We need options because these storms are going to come again,” she said, noting that some islanders who had solar panels got them working again soon after Irma. Three years ago, the law did not permit residents to produce most of their own power - including from renewables such as solar - in areas covered by the utility, said McDevitt. Now, BVIEC has received a proposal from its main fuel provider, St. Kitts and Nevis’ Delta Petroleum, to set up a small solar project next to its diesel storage facility, said Abraham. “Although we are a fossil fuel company... we decided to diversify out of our portfolio into solar,” said Bevis Sylvester, Delta’s general manager for the Caribbean. Despite the new enthusiasm for clean energy, not all experts are convinced the BVI can deliver on a promise made five years ago that by 2023 it would meet a third of its total energy needs of about 30 megawatts with renewables. “We’ve been told for the last decade that renewable energy would go ahead, but it has not yet gone ahead,” said Dana Miller, the owner of aTec, a BVI-based clean energy company. David Crane, former CEO of U.S.-based NRG Energy, travelled to the BVI a handful of times when his firm bid on a 2-megawatt solar project there. His was one of four companies that responded in 2014 to a request for proposals by BVIEC to install solar panels on public land, including the main airport. But the project was derailed by discussions over possible expansion plans for the airport, whose revamp is still under negotiation, said Abraham. The episode speaks to a problem facing small islands the world over, said Rolando Gonzalez-Bunster, head of InterEnergy Holdings, a power company that has helped pioneer renewables in the Caribbean. Though the cost of setting up solar farms has plummeted in the last five years - from about $3,000 per kilowatt to $1,000 - smaller-scale projects remain pricier, at about $1,500 per kilowatt. “When you build small (facilities) you have to mobilise a lot of infrastructure for a small amount (of power),” leading to a higher unit cost, said Gonzalez-Bunster. Speaking from his temporary office in Tortola Pier Park, a tourist complex, minister Vanterpool said the government would push ahead, overcoming obstacles and skepticism. ""We have to go to renewable energy,"" he said. ""We have to get there. I don't think that's a choice we have."" (Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-07-31,"LUANDA, July 31 (Reuters) - The daughter of a former president of Angola failed to respond to her first summons from state prosecutors to answer questions about her time running Sonangol, the state oil company, Angola’s state news agency reported. Isabel dos Santos is allowed to provide reasons for not appearing three times, state news agency Angop said late on Monday, citing a source in the prosecutor general’s office. After that, she may be arrested. The investigation relates to allegations made in February by Sonangol’s current chairman, Carlos Saturnino. He said an internal audit had uncovered suspicious transactions overseen by dos Santos, including a payment of $38 million made to a Dubai-based company she approved after she was dismissed from the oil company. Dos Santos has denied all wrongdoing and accused Saturnino of trying “to rewrite history.” Representatives of dos Santos did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for the prosecutor general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. President Joao Lourenço, who took office in September when Jose Eduardo dos Santos stepped down after nearly four decades in power, has moved to push aside powerful figures associated with his predecessor and tackle rampant corruption. He sacked Isabel dos Santos as chair of Sonangol and her half-brother Jose Filomeno dos Santos as head of the Sovereign Wealth Fund. The latter is also a suspect in a fraud case involving a transfer of $500 million from the central bank. He has said he is cooperating with authorities. State prosecutors opened an investigation into the allegations by Saturnino against Isabel dos Santos in March but have issued no public statements since.

2018-07-31,"DUBAI/RIYADH, July 31 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s top sovereign wealth fund is seeking to raise between $6 and $8 billion from banks as it seeks to boost its firepower to help finance the kingdom’s economic transformation plans, according to sources familiar with the matter. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) issued a request for proposals to banks several weeks ago about raising money for a syndicated loan, said two of the sources, with a third adding the deal is not expected to close before September. A spokesman for PIF declined to comment. It would be the first commercial loan for PIF, which has been charged with helping to deliver the Vision 2030 reform plan announced by the government in 2016, an ambitious economic programme designed to free the kingdom from dependence on oil exports. PIF is also investing billions of dollars in investments, including contributing to a fund with U.S. private equity firm Blackstone and money to SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Proceeds from the loan would be used for general corporate purposes, two of the sources said. Until recently, the principal sources of funding for PIF were capital injections and asset transfers from the government, in addition to earnings from existing investments. But as part of PIF’s expanded role, it is seeking to fund more of its expansion through loans and other debt instruments, said a source close to the PIF, adding that the sovereign wealth fund expected to become one of the most prominent users of banking services in the region and was looking to form a core group of banks to offer some of those services. The source said the loan would be of “material size”, without elaborating, with the proceeds used for general investment activities by the fund, which set a goal in 2017 of increasing its asset portfolio to 1.5 trillion riyals ($400 billion) by 2020. Two of the sources said the loan was likely to be between $6 and $8 billion, with another adding the amount was expected to be a minimum of $5 billion. Although financing details have not yet been confirmed, banks anticipate tight pricing as PIF seeks to build relationships with lenders, two of the sources said. PIF will also potentially receive tens of billions of dollars as part of plans by Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE to acquire a stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) from PIF. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, is 70 percent owned by the PIF. It has a market capitalisation of 388.17 billion riyals.

2018-07-31,"* 10-year JGB yields pull away from 1-1/2 year highs * U.S. tech sell-off weighs on world stocks * Fed and BOE rate meetings now in market focus (updates prices throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Reassurance by the Bank of Japan that it will keep its super-easy monetary policies in place for an extended period pushed the yen and global bond yields lower on Tuesday, though mounting concerns about the tech sector kept world stocks under pressure. A recent Reuters report that the BOJ could be debating scaling back its massive stimulus programme had sent Japanese bond yields to 1-1/2 year highs, spilling into euro zone and U.S. debt markets. That helped push the yen more than 2 percent off six-month lows hit against the dollar in early July . But while the BOJ announced some tweaks to its equity purchase programme and said its stimulus plan would be more flexible, the changes did not show any inclination for radical shifts from its accommodative stance. In response, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds <JP10YT=RR fell 3 basis points, and 40-year yields slid nearly 9 basis points, pushing 10-year U.S. and German yields down around 2-3 bps. “The BOJ is important in the sense of what they didn’t do,” said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Edinburgh. “It was disappointing for some investors who thought they would be more hawkish in their approach and the market reaction, with lower yen and bond yields, shows that view which many people held, is mistaken.” Euro zone yields later inched up to trade around flat after data showed inflation above forecast, though this was driven by higher energy costs. Separate data revealed the bloc’s economic growth had been slower than expected in the second quarter of 2018. The yen fell 0.4 percent to trade around 111.2 yen per dollar. Many analysts now see it easing to around 113, especially if the U.S. Federal Reserve delivers a hawkish interest rate message when its policy meeting ends on Wednesday . The dollar was flat against a basket of currencies but looks likely to snap a three-month streak of gains as markets have more or less priced in two more Fed rate hikes this year. The greenback had rallied more than 5 percent in the second 2018 quarter. The BOJ’s dovish pledge failed to offer a boost to equities, however. Markets have been roiled by growing concerns about the global tech sector which had seemed relatively immune to trade tensions between the United States, Europe and China. Lacklustre earnings from Netflix and Facebook have triggered losses across the tech sector, with Wall Street’s tech index shedding 6 percent in the past three sessions. That pushed world stocks to one-week lows and even Japan’s Nikkei failed to hold on to earlier BOJ-fuelled gains. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific tech shares fell almost one percent. European tech followed suit, losing 0.6 percent and lagging broader equities that were flat on the day. Wall Street was set for a modestly firmer open, futures signalled as investors await second quarter earnings from the biggest company, iPhone maker Apple. But the tech retreat has overshadowed an otherwise buoyant U.S. earnings season, with average 22.6 percent profit growth and 83 percent of companies beating consensus estimates so far. Milligan attributed the setback to a re-assessment of share prices and summer profit-taking rather than a fundamental loss of confidence in the sector. World stocks are still set to end July with the best monthly returns since January, he noted. “The market is saying ‘you are fairly valued around these prices so let’s wait for the next big story’. That will either be on the downside with trade tensions in autumn or it could positive if Chinese stimulus turns out to be greater than expected,” Milligan added. He was referring to Beijing’s announcements, offering more fiscal stimulus to counter the effect of U.S. trade tariffs and incentives for banks to lend to small business. Markets now await Wednesday’s Fed policy statement to see if the expected two rate hikes for the remainder of 2018 can be cemented in. In Britain, a 25 basis-point hike is now widely expected on Thursday, despite economic weakness linked to Britain’s looming European Union exit. The British pound has already priced the move, David Riley, chief investment strategist at BlueBay Asset Management, said, adding: “I think they will do it but it will be one and done.” The pound firmed 0.2 percent to around $1.3159, having drifted off 10-month troughs of $1.2955 touched earlier in July.

2018-07-31,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia’s president called on Tuesday for the immediate implementation of a plan to widen the use of biodiesel that his economic ministers hope will cut the country’s fuel import bill by billions of dollars and halt a decline in the rupiah currency. Joko Widodo also sounded an alarm on the foreign exchange reserves of Southeast Asia’s largest economy, less than a week after he pleaded with exporters to bring home earnings they currently keep offshore to stem the slide in the rupiah. “The country needs dollars now,” Widodo said at the opening of a cabinet meeting, before reporters were ushered out. “I don’t want to keep doing meetings without good implementation.” Concerns about tighter U.S. monetary policy and a global trade war have put emerging market currencies under pressure. Indonesia's central bank has spent about $12 billion of its foreign exchange reserves in recent months and hiked policy interest rates by 100 basis points to defend the rupiah IDR=ID, which has lost about 6 percent of its value against the dollar this year. Cabinet ministers have met at least six times since the start of July to tackle concerns over trade and the rupiah, said a senior government official, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. “Like any other central bank in the world, Bank Indonesia can only slow things down and smooth things out, but cannot stop underlying trends driven by fundamentals,” the official said. One key remedy the government sees as a way to cut the current account deficit - which the central bank estimated would widen by $8 billion this year - is a plan to substitute fuel imports with palm oil-based biodiesel by making it mandatory for all diesel vehicles, including locomotive engines and heavy equipment. The present rules, intended to boost consumption of palm-oil-based biodiesel, apply only to subsidized diesel, which some users and vehicles are not allowed to buy. Indonesia is the world’s top producer of palm oil, the raw ingredient for fatty acid methyl ester (FAME), which can be used to make biodiesel. Vegetable oil prices are currently low in relation to fossil fuel prices, which have risen sharply, so government planners see sense in consuming more palm oil domestically to curb imports of diesel. Expanding the so-called B20 biodiesel program could save Indonesia $2-4 billion in import costs a year, the official said. Industry Minister Airlangga Hartarto told reporters this week the saving could be as much as $5 billion. “In the short term, this would be a faster solution compared to trying to boost exports,” said Josua Pardede, an economist at Bank Permata in Jakarta. “Replacing imports would be one alternative to maintain the current account deficit at a healthy level.” A presidential regulation on expanding B20 had been completed and it would start no later than next month, said Chief Economic Minister Darmin Nasution. Along with low prices, Indonesian palm oil exporters are already facing pressure Europe due to concerns over environmental damage related to deforestation, so more domestic consumption will be welcome to plantation companies. However, while biodiesel can cut fuel costs and reduce emissions, some varieties need special handling and equipment as the fuel has a solvent effect, corroding engine seals and gasket materials, and it can solidify in the cold. Indonesia’s auto industries group, GAIKINDO, has said stepping up biodiesel blends can increase fuel consumption and could cause engines to overheat. Kyatmaja Lookman, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Trucking Association, said fuel consumption could increase by 2 percent. “The question is, when our drivers have to spend more on fuel, their welfare is also declining,” he told reporters. “Who will be responsible for this 2 percent increase? The transportation business margin is only around 6-8 percent.” Additional reporting by Tabita Diela and Bernadette Christina Munthe; Writing by John Chalmers and Fransiska Nangoy; Editing by Neil Fullick",https://uk.reuters.com/article/indonesia-economy/update-2-indonesia-president-pushes-biodiesel-plan-to-stop-currency-tanking-idUKL4N1UR303,31 Jul 2018,"* That could ease pressure on current account

2018-07-31,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office called on Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to release all peaceful activists, including women held for campaigning against a ban on driving even as it was being lifted. At least 15 government critics were arrested since mid-May, some of whose whereabouts are unknown amid a serious lack of transparency in the processing of their cases, the rights office said.  They included prominent women’s rights advocate Hatoon al-Fassi, arrested in June as she was planning to take journalists in her car to celebrate the much-hyped end of the world’s last ban on female drivers, long seen as an emblem of repression in the deeply conservative Muslim country. “We urge the Government of Saudi Arabia to unconditionally release all human rights defenders and activists who have been detained for their peaceful human rights work, including their decades-long campaigns for the lifting of the driving ban for women,” U.N. human rights spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the heir to the throne set to become the first Saudi king from a new generation after a succession of six brothers dating back to 1953, has initiated broad reforms to diversify the economy from oil and update deeply conservative social norms. But critics say the reforms have not extended into politics in an absolute monarchy where all public opposition to the authorities is still banned. Genuine reforms appear to be taking place in the kingdom, “but this has not extended to the civil and political rights sphere”, Shamsadani told a Geneva news briefing “Dissent, criticism of the government is still not accepted in the country. That can explain why many of these human rights defenders and activists have been jailed. All of them have criticised government policies in one way or another,” she said.

2018-07-31,"* Iran sanctions, political tensions to support prices * Global trade tensions likely to weigh on oil markets * Analysts raise price forecasts for 10th straight month * For a table of crude price forecasts, click By Sumita Layek July 31 - Oil prices are likely to hold fairly steady this year and next as increased output from OPEC and the U.S. meets growing demand led by Asia and helps to offset supply disruptions from Iran and elsewhere, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday. A survey of 44 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude to average $72.87 a barrel in 2018, 29 cents higher than the $72.58 projected in the previous month’s poll and above the $71.68 average so far this year. U.S. crude futures were seen averaging $67.32 a barrel in 2018, compared with $66.79 forecast last month and an average of $66.16 until now. This is the 10th consecutive month in which analysts have raised their oil price forecasts. “We expect prices will largely remain range-bound in the second half of 2018 and 2019. On the one hand, robust U.S. shale production and market concerns over the brewing U.S.-China trade war will help keep a lid on prices,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. “On the other hand, the recent decline in global stocks will make prices more sensitive to any geopolitical risk, which will keep prices from falling significantly below current levels.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC countries agreed to raise supply in a meeting last month to meet rising global demand, but the group did not specify a clear target for the output increase. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions on Iran that will come into force later this year will force a decline in exports and help support prices, analysts said. “The disruption to Iranian barrels will weigh on oil markets in the second half of 2018 and H1 2019 as there are few spare barrels in the market that can offset a big disruption to Iranian supplies,” said Emirates NBD commodities analyst Edward Bell. The United States pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran in early May casting uncertainty over global oil supplies, and since then it has been preparing to work with countries to help them to cut Iran oil imports. Analysts expect a drop of about 500,000-1 million barrels per day (bpd) in Iranian output due to the sanctions. But they also said the ongoing global trade tensions could hurt demand. “A trade war will slow down economic growth and demand for oil but also eventually spill over into other asset classes, mostly equities, that can have an impact on oil prices through a negative market sentiment,” Jette Jørgensen of Global Risk Management Ltd said. Analysts continued to see Asia as the main demand driver, projecting an additional 800,000-900,000 bpd in demand this year and the next from the region. “The market is facing different questions — Is global demand slowing due to weakening worldwide economic growth, will U.S. production keep up its incredible pace, will output in Venezuela keep plummeting, what will U.S. sanctions do to Iranian production, and is OPEC really willing to raise output up to 1 mbpd!” Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW, said.

2018-07-31,"LONDON, July 31 (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday U.S. President Donald Trump was mistaken to expect Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to compensate for supply losses caused by U.S. sanctions on Iran, after OPEC production rose only modestly in July. The comments, from Iran’s OPEC governor, came a day after a Reuters survey showed OPEC production rose by 70,000 barrels per day in July. Saudi production increased but was offset by a decline in Iranian supply due to the restart of U.S. sanctions, the survey found. “It seems President Trump has been taken hostage by Saudi Arabia and a few producers when they claimed they can replace 2.5 million barrels per day of Iranian exports, encouraging him to take action against Iran,” Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters. “Now they and Russia sell more oil and more expensively. Not even from their incremental production but their stocks.” He said oil prices, which Trump has been pressuring the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to bring down by raising output, will rise unless the United States grants waivers to buyers of Iranian crude. “They are also calling for the use of the U.S. SPR (Strategic Petroleum Reserve). This will also mean higher prices. U.S. waivers to our clients if they come is due to the failure of bluffers (Saudi and the other producers) and, if not given, will again push the prices higher,” he said. “So they hanged him (Trump) on the wall. Now they want to have a mega OPEC, congratulations to President Trump, Russia and Saudi Arabia.” OPEC governors represent their respective country on the organisation’s board of governors and are typically the second most senior person in a country’s OPEC delegation after the oil minister. “The longer-term solution, Mr President, is to support and facilitate capacity building in all countries, proportionate to their reserves of oil and gas.

The move in JGBs pushed 10-year Treasury yields lower too. However, the reaction in currencies was muted as some market participants awaited further clarity. The dollar pared losses against the yen and was last flat at 111.06. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, was barely changed at 94.314. “The market is definitely cautious at this point. Hopefully we’ll get some more clarity when Kuroda speaks later today,” said Rodrigo Catril, senior forex analyst at National Australia Bank. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will hold a news conference at 3:30 p.m. (0630 GMT) to explain the policy decision. “At this point, it’s very unclear what the BoJ means by allowing long-term rates to go up and down. That is as vague as it can be,” Catril added. “The proof will be in how they react in the open market operations. It will be interesting to see how they allow 10-year JGB rates to increase. That will set a tone for the market.” Elsewhere, Asian share markets pared some of their early losses as easy monetary policy is seen as positive for risk assets although a global rout in technology shares put a lid on gains. Japan’s Nikkei was last down 0.1 percent, after falling more than 0.5 percent earlier in the day. South Korea’s Kospi index dipped 0.1 percent despite solid second-quarter results from Samsung Electronics which posted a 5.7 percent rise in profit. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was also down 0.3 percent while Australian shares were mostly unchanged.. Overnight in Wall Street, the Dow and the S&P 500 each lost 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq skidded 1.4 percent largely led by losses in tech stocks. The technology index crumbled 1.8 percent as disappointing results from Facebook, Twitter and Netflix spurred concerns about future growth for a sector that has led U.S. equities to record highs. Investors will next turn their attention to other central bank decisions this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday and the Bank of England is seen raising interest rates on Thursday. Month-end macroeconomic data is also due from China on Wednesday. The British pound held at $1.3132, drifting away from a more than 10-month trough of $1.2955 touched earlier in July. In commodities, U.S. crude fell 35 cents to $69.78 a barrel after a sharp rally overnight while Brent fell 36 cents to $74.61. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,222 an ounce.

2018-07-31,"(Corrects to Monday, not Tuesday, in second and sixth paragraphs; removes repeated word in first.) TOKYO, July 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday after a report showed that OPEC production reached a 2018 high in the month of July, although the losses were limited as concerns about supply lingered. September Brent crude futures fell 7 cents to $74.90 a barrel by 0109 GMT, after rising 68 cents, or 0.9 percent, on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI) were down 6 cents at $70.08, after rising more than 2 percent in the previous session. A Reuters survey showed the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries increased production in July. OPEC hiked production by 70,000 barrels per day to 32.64 million bpd, a 2018 high. Further supply increases could offset production outages and pressure prices. WTI rose on Monday on expectations that U.S. inventories fell last week and worries that an outage at a Syncrude facility in Canada will not be solved as soon as expected, traders said. Crude inventories at the Oklahoma delivery point for WTI have been dwindling, in part due to the Syncrude outage that has reduced the flow of oil into the hub. Stocks at the Cushing storage hub fell to 23.7 million barrels, the lowest since November 2014 in the week to July 20. Energy information company Genscape, however, said that inventories at Cushing rose almost 200,000 barrels, or nearly 1 percent, from Tuesday to Friday last week, according to traders. Oil prices have rebounded from recent lows over the last two weeks, as looming sanctions on Iran have already started to curtail exports from that country. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would meet with Iran’s President, Hassan Rouhani.

2018-07-31,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The province of Liaoning in China’s rustbelt northeast has established a parliamentary committee to scrutinize government spending and control debt, the first province to do so, local media reported. The Beijing News said the new body, set up by the standing committee of the Liaoning People’s Congress, was part of the province’s push to tackle rising debt. Earlier this month, the Ministry of Finance said total debt in Liaoning stood at around 845.5 billion yuan ($124 billion) at the end of last year, 168.8 billion yuan higher than the figure given by the provincial government in February, the Beijing News said on Monday. According to a notice issued by the Liaoning People’s Congress last week, the province’s performance when it comes to controlling expenditure has not been satisfactory, and some old industrial regions have relied too much on high debt to drive growth. It said the new body would bring spending budgets at all levels under greater scrutiny and control. The official China Daily said in an editorial on Tuesday that the move would “set a good example” for other regions when it comes to tackling debt.   Liaoning province, which has long depended on heavy industries like steel, coal and machinery manufacturing, has sought to spend its way out of a long-term economic decline, investing huge amounts of public money on new infrastructure as part of the state’s 15-year “Rejuvenate the Northeast” program. But it continues to struggle to overcome slowing growth as well as a rapidly ageing population. After reporting negative economic growth in 2016, Liaoning began to recover last year and its GDP rose 5.6 percent in the first half of 2018, though it still lagged the national rate.

2018-07-31,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2K3n5Nn By John Kemp LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Hedge funds appear to have completed the recent wave of liquidation, with bullish positions increased slightly last week after heavy falls the week before, helping to steady the main crude oil benchmarks. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 37 million barrels in the week to July 24. The boost was a marked turnaround from the previous week, when net long positions were cut by 178 million barrels, one of the heaviest bouts of liquidation on record. In the most recent week, portfolio managers raised net long positions in Brent (+14 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (+11 million), U.S. heating oil (+12 million) and European gasoil (+11 million). The only selling came in NYMEX and ICE WTI, where net long positions were reduced by 11 million barrels last week, according to data published by regulators and exchanges (tmsnrt.rs/2K3n5Nn). The recent wave of liquidation, which started in late April, and accelerated in mid-July, has blown off some of the froth from the top of the market. Portfolio managers remain exceptionally bullish on the outlook, but some of the momentum-chasing and more tactical long positions have been squared up. Long positions in the petroleum complex outnumber short ones by more than 1 billion barrels, but that is down from a net long position of more than 1.4 billion barrels three months ago. Long positions still outnumber shorts by a ratio of more than 9:1, leaving the market stretched, but that is down from almost 14:1 at the peak. For now, bullishness about supply disruptions, the impact of Iran sanctions, and strong growth in oil consumption is outweighing concerns about the global economic outlook and the impact of high prices on oil demand.

2018-07-31,"* Asian stock markets subdued on global tech sell-off * Bank of Japan rate decision due later in the day * Investors see possible hawkish tilt from BoJ, yen firmer By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, July 31 (Reuters) - Asian share markets weakened on Tuesday, taking cues from the rout in global technology shares while the yen edged higher ahead of the Bank of Japan’s rate review, at which it could flag a shift away from its massive monetary stimulus. Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.5 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index dipped 0.1 percent despite solid second-quarter results from Samsung Electronics which posted a 5.7 percent rise in profit. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was mostly unchanged at 543.23 as were Australian shares. Overnight in Wall Street, the Dow and the S&P 500 each lost 0.6 percent and the Nasdaq skidded 1.4 percent. The technology index crumbled 1.8 percent overnight as disappointing results from Facebook, Twitter and Netflix spurred concerns about future growth for a sector that has led U.S. equities to record highs. “U.S. equities took another leg lower overnight but sentiment towards risk looks more upbeat across other asset classes,” analysts at JP Morgan said in a note. “The BoJ decision today is the main focus,” they added. The yen climbed 0.1 percent to 110.92 per dollar from a more than six month trough of 113.15 touched earlier in July. Speculation that the BoJ will dial back its easing also saw yields on Japanese Government Bonds tick up overnight. Other government bond yields edged higher too. Japan’s central bank will likely consider taking steps to make its massive stimulus programme more sustainable, such as allowing greater swings in interest rates and widening its stock-buying selection, according to sources.. “We would look to fade the recent yen rally ahead of the BoJ,” analysts at NAB said. “Looking further out, a BoJ that remains very accommodative for an extended period will challenge our expectations for yen to appreciate amid its fundamental cheap valuation and our expectations of a softer USD environment in 2019.” Elsewhere, most major currencies stuck to narrow trading ranges ahead of several central bank decisions. The U.S. Federal Reserve concludes its policy meeting on Wednesday and the Bank of England is seen raising interest rates on Thursday. Month-end macroeconomic data is also due from China on Wednesday. The British pound held at $1.3132, drifting away from a more than 10-month trough of $1.2955 touched earlier in July.

2018-07-31,"(Reuters) - A steep global decline in the price of solar modules in recent weeks is nearly offsetting the effect of the Trump administration’s 30 percent tariff on imported panels, the chief executive of a major U.S. solar company said on Monday. While the price drop is trimming the profit margins of manufacturers, it is welcome news for purchasers of solar systems, who had been facing higher prices since the tariffs went into effect in February. “If you are building a large power plant your pricing has certainly come back at least halfway to what it was pre-tariff if not all the way,” Tom Werner, the CEO of SunPower Corp (SPWR.O), said in an interview following the company’s second-quarter financial results announcement. “It’s muting the impact of tariffs.” Solar module prices are down about 12 percent globally since China announced changes to its incentives for solar power on June 1 that have led to an oversupply of panels that had been intended for installation in China, the world’s largest solar market. SunPower is both a manufacturer of solar panels and an installer of solar power systems. The San Jose, California-based company makes its products primarily in the Philippines and Mexico and is seeking an exclusion from the U.S. tariffs. SunPower makes high-efficiency, premium-priced panels, and Werner told analysts on a conference call that the company was “responding” to the price declines and would not allow its premium to expand. The company is in the process of buying rival SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing in Oregon to stem the impact of the tariffs.  The price decline “makes domestic manufacturing that much more challenging,” Werner said, adding that SunPower was committed to closing its deal to acquire SolarWorld. “We’re going to have to increase scale to compete,” he said. SunPower expects to spend $51 million on tariffs in the second half of this year, an amount the company would prefer to invest in its next-generation technology and scaling up its U.S. manufacturing, Werner said on a conference call with analysts. SunPower reported a narrower-than-expected second-quarter loss and revenue that topped estimates due to strength in its rooftop solar business and cost controls. The company also said it would begin manufacturing its next-generation technology later this year. SunPower’s stock was up 4.8 percent at $7.22 in after-hours trade.

2018-07-31,"WASHINGTON, July 30 (Reuters) - The Keystone XL crude oil pipeline project cleared a hurdle on Monday as the Trump administration said in a draft environmental assessment that an alternative route through Nebraska would not do major harm to water and wildlife. The State Department’s assessment of a plan for an alternative route through Nebraska submitted by TransCanada Corp , the company trying to complete the pipeline, said Keystone XL’s cumulative effects would be “minor to moderate” on issues including water and biological resources. It said the pipeline would have only minor impacts on cultural resources, such as Native American graves. The Nebraska Public Service Commission approved the pipeline, but not TransCanada’s preferred path. The alternative route will cost TransCanada millions of dollars more than its original route. The $8 billion 1,180-mile (1,900-km) pipeline that would transport heavy crude from Canada’s oilsands in Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska, has been fought by environmentalists and ranchers for more than a decade. Canadian oil producers who face price discounts for their crude due to transportation bottlenecks, support the project. TransCanada did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the draft assessment which will be open for 30 days of public comment by the State Department before being finalized. TransCanada plans to start preliminary work in Montana in coming months and full construction in 2019, according a letter sent in April from the State Department to Native American tribes. Former President Barack Obama rejected the pipeline in 2015 saying it would mainly benefit Canadian oil producers. President Donald Trump’s State Department approved the pipeline last year based on an environmental impact statement from 2014 that environmentalists said was outdated. The Sierra Club, an environmental group, said the State Department was attempting a short cut to get the project built and a full review is required that considers changes in oil prices and market forces. Keystone “is a threat to our land, water, wildlife, communities, and climate, and we will continue fighting, in the courts and in the streets, to ensure that it is never built,” said Kelly Martin, the director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign. The State Department said it could not comment on the new assessment due to ongoing litigation. Reporting by Timothy Gardner

2018-07-31,"SHANGHAI, July 31 (Reuters) - Levels of wasted power in China’s renewable sector fell in the first half of this year, but securing grid access for many new clean energy projects remains a challenge for the industry, an energy bureau official said. China’s renewable energy capacity has soared thanks to generous subsidies and ambitious targets, but the country does not have enough transmission capacity to deliver all the new power to customers, a problem known as curtailment. To resolve the issue, the government has been trying to adjust the timing of construction and has set up an early warning system forcing regions suffering from excess capacity growth to slow down the pace of new approvals. “From this year, the situation has improved,” said Liang Zhipeng, vice-director of the renewable energy office of the National Energy Administration during a media briefing on Monday. “But absorbing renewable power remains a long term problem.” China’s total renewable energy capacity reached 680 gigawatts by the end of June, up 13 percent on the year, accounting for nearly 40 of total energy capacity. Non-fossil fuel power - renewables and nuclear - accounted for 66.1 percent of China’s new installed energy capacity in the first half, up 5.4 percentage points compared to a year earlier. Wind curtailment rates stood at 8.7 percent, down 5 percentage points on the year, while solar curtailment also fell 3.2 percentage points to 3.6 percent during the first half. Liang said new demand had created more favourable conditions for the renewable sector, but it still faced big challenges. “Over the long term, it is very important to establish an effective mechanism to absorb and utilise renewable energy,” he said. Amid overcapacity fears, China has already taken action to restrict the number of new solar power generation projects this year after record growth in 2017. The state planning agency said at the end of June that it would cap new capacity at 30 GW in 2018, compared to 53 GW last year.

2018-07-31,"BRASILIA, July 30 (Reuters) - Brazil’s geological service is studying auctioning off mining rights in 2019 to six previously unexplored areas that have significant potential output of copper, gold, phosphate and other minerals, the head of the organization told Reuters on Monday. The geological service CPRM, which operates as a state company and carries out functions similar to the United States Geological Survey, has amassed the rights to mining exploration in more than 300 areas in Brazil since its founding in 1969. It is beginning to auction those rights off under an initiative to encourage private investment, launched after President Michel Temer took office in 2016. Last week, it announced that in December it would auction off mining rights for coal in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul and for an area that includes copper, lead and zinc in central Tocantins. Royalty payments are expected to total 550 million reais ($148 million) or more. Companies generally pay relatively small amounts for initial exploration rights, but royalty payments can stack up over the life of any mines built. CPRM is studying following up December’s auction with another one in the second half of 2019, with six areas under consideration, Esteves Pedro Colnago said in an interview. The service has already commissioned studies to put a value on areas of copper in the central state of Goais and phosphate along the border of Paraiba and Pernambuco states, he said. It plans to commission four more studies this year on potential sites of diamonds in Bahia, gold in Tocantins, ceramics ingredient kaolin in Para and coal in Rio Grande do Sul. He did not give details of the size of potential deposits. It is not guaranteed that the auctions will take place. With a new Brazilian president set to take office next year, a new CPRM chief could be appointed with other priorities, Colnago said. But all the information for the potential auction would be available to the incoming administration, and there were already preliminary indications that the sites have economic potential, he said. “The market is demanding these auctions,” Colnago said.
