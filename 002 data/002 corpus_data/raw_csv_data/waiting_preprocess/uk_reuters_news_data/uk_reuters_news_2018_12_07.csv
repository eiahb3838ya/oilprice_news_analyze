2018-12-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Utilities are shutting down at least 18 of General Electric Co’s (GE.N) newest gas turbines for repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France, according to more than a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts. The shutdowns, which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas, come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes. GE is setting aside $480 million to repair its 9HA, 7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business. The 126-year-old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut down, or when it would replace parts - if needed - in as many as 130 such turbines it has produced. Power plant operators in Japan, Taiwan, France and at multiple U.S. sites have shut down - or plan to shut down - at least 18 of the 55 new HA-model turbines that GE has shipped so far, French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry experts, including executives, plant operators, insurance specialists, engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show. FACTBOX [L2N1Y51I4] In an interview, GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data, saying that GE turbines are performing “extremely well,” despite the need for “early maintenance” to fix the blades. Considering all of the power turbines it has in use, GE has “the most reliable fleet in the world - 99 percent, give or take, reliability,” he added. GE previously disclosed that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of them in September. Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut down. Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine, owned by Exelon Corp (EXC.N). The turbines are now running after two months of repairs, Exelon said. GE told Reuters it identified the oxidation problem in 2015, and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on other turbine models. Three plant operators using GE equipment that are shutting for blade repairs, Invenergy, Exelon and Tennessee Valley Authority, told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in installing new blades for free under warranty. “Overall, we’ve been very pleased with GE’s HA technology and its performance capabilities,” said Beth Conley, a spokeswoman at Invenergy, which is receiving replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant that has not yet opened. Following the problems in Texas, state-owned utility Electricite de France (EDF.PA) closed its plant in the northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late September for blade replacements. Bouchain was the first plant worldwide to install GE’s 9HA turbine. Bouchain has logged 86 outages for equipment failure, testing or other reasons from January 2017 to October 2018, five times the average for non-GE plants, according to data from French grid operator RTE analysed by Reuters. Reuters excluded outages for planned maintenance. The French data also show that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing, on average, more than twice as often as non-GE gas-fueled plants in France with turbines made by Alstom, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) and Ansaldo Energia SpA. GE acquired Alstom’s power business in 2015. (For a graphic, click: tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3) GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the data from grid operator RTE, an independent subsidiary of EDF, are “not wrong,” but should not be used to assess turbine performance because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants. EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain, which opened in 2016, and that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their break-in period. EDF said Bouchain’s output is cycled up and down to meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly. The other gas-fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and have been in operation for many years. RTE, Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE), Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems (7011.T) declined to comment. Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how often GE’s turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world. Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to be serviced or tested, or when equipment failure or other problems cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly. While GE plants still produce a third of the world’s electricity, GE fell from first to third place in new turbine orders by capacity, behind Mitsubishi and Siemens, according to a first-half tally by McCoy Power Reports, a widely watched industry data source. GE said its market share was 51 percent in the third quarter, according to McCoy.  GE said it booked seven HA turbine orders in the first nine months of this year, half as many as in the same period last year. GE’s HA turbines have come under particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing competition. The success of GE’s new turbines are of increasing importance as it slims down to focus on power plants, jet engines and wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring. GE spent more than two decades developing the 400-ton machines, but brought them to market after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share, forcing GE to catch up. GE undercut its rivals’ prices by about 20 percent “to go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by 2016,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report this year. Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE’s profit and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its power unit, and its credit rating fell to just three notches above junk. Culp is splitting up the power division, consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new leaders for it. Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23-year low, forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive. Scott Strazik, the new chief executive of GE Gas Power, said in an interview that customers are happy with GE’s response to the blade issue and GE has no plans to change how it handles customer issues, or how it tests turbines, noting GE’s test facility is the largest and most comprehensive in the world. “The HA is the fastest-selling gas turbine that we have, and customers continue to have a strong desire for the HA,” Strazik said.

2018-12-07,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil environmental regulator Ibama said on Friday it had denied a permit to French oil major Total SA to drill in the environmentally sensitive Foz do Amazonas Basin for a fifth and final time. Ibama said in a statement that it agreed with a technical assessment that indicated oil exploration in the area would present risks to reefs and biodiversity.  BP Plc and Petroleo Brasileiro SA are also investors in the project near the mouth of the Amazon river, which is being operated by Total. Ibama said it had given Total all possible opportunities to correct problems found during the technical evaluation and that the company had been informed of the decision earlier on Friday. Total has been seeking to explore the offshore basin, which geologists believe could contain up to 14 billion barrels of petroleum, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, for more than four years. The French company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

2018-12-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Concerns over China-U.S. trade tensions gave European shares their worst week of losses in two months and sank U.S. stocks on Friday, overshadowing the lift from higher oil prices and jobs data. While Europe was higher on the day with a small recovery after three sessions of heavy losses, the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing was still a major lingering worry for investors. “Volatility is high and investors are twitchy. It has been a dreadful week for European markets, and today’s positive move can’t mask the previous losses,” said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.62 percent, while an index of London’s 100 largest listed companies rose 1.1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 558.72 points, or 2.24 percent, to 24,388.95, the S&P 500 lost 62.87 points, or 2.33 percent, to 2,633.08 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 219.01 points, or 3.05 percent, to 6,969.25. Wall Street saw its biggest weekly losses since March, led by declines in big internet and technology shares. The fall was a reversal from earlier in the day, when stocks were higher on U.S. labor data that showed employers hired fewer workers than expected in November. That supported a view that U.S. growth is moderating and the Federal Reserve may stop raising rates sooner than previously thought. Non-farm payrolls increased by 155,000 last month, but missed economists’ expectation for a rise of 200,000. “It is still consistent with the Fed raising short-term interest rates, said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “But I think the main theme here is that investors are expecting the Fed to be even more gradual, a little bit more cautious, in raising interest rates in 2019.” Oil climbed after big Middle East producers in OPEC agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market.  U.S. crude rose 1.42 percent to $52.22 per barrel and Brent was last at $61.39, up 2.21 percent on the day.     MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.11 percent. Stock markets around the world tumbled on Thursday after Canadian officials announced the Dec. 1 arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies. Also contributing to this week’s sell-off were rising concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown signaled by a flattening Treasury yield curve. The front half of the yield curve remained inverted after two-year and three-year yields rose above five-year yields for the first time in over a decade earlier this week. That inversion has stoked speculation about whether a U.S. recession is looming.  The U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies after the U.S. jobs data. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, fell 0.17 percent, with the euro up 0.24 percent to $1.1401.

2018-12-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices ended more than 2 percent higher on Friday after OPEC members and allies like Russia agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market, but the gains were capped by concerns that the cuts would not offset growing production. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies, referred to as “OPEC+,” agreed to slash production by a combined 1.2 million barrels per day next year in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. This was larger than the minimum 1 million bpd that the market had expected, despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. OPEC will curb output by 800,000 bpd from January while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 400,000 bpd of cuts, Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said after the organisation concluded two days of talks in Vienna. The deal had hung in the balance for two days - first on fears that Russia would cut too little, and later on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement. But after hours of talks, Iran gave OPEC the green light and Russia said it was ready to cut more. Russia gave a commitment to reduce output by 228,000 bpd from October levels of 11.4 million bpd, though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months. “Without cuts there would have been extreme downward pressure on the market,” said John Paisie, executive vice president at Stratas Advisors, a consultancy.  “I think the Saudis tried to walk a tightrope: they want to make sure they maintain their relationship with the U.S., but they also need to make some cuts because they need a higher oil price to balance their budget.” Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.61, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $61.67 a barrel. In early trading, the global benchmark had dropped below $60 when it looked as if the oil exporters might leave output targets unchanged. It then rallied to a session high of $63.73 on news of the agreement, before pulling back late in the session. U.S. crude CLc1 rose $1.12, or 2.2 percent, to $52.61 a barrel, after earlier reaching a session high of $54.22.  U.S. crude was up 3 percent on the week and Brent was 4.8 percent higher. Oil prices have plunged 30 percent since October as supply has surged and global demand growth has weakened. While the announcement of the cuts initially sent prices higher, some of the enthusiasm cooled, on fears that the cut would not absorb new output coming online in the United States that has made it the word’s top producer. A 1.2 million-bpd cut, if implemented fully, “should be enough to largely attenuate, but not eliminate, expected implied global inventory builds in the first half of next year,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.  Given supply due to come online, some analysts and market participants said the cut may not be sufficient to end oil’s rout.  “Relative to how big this looming supply tsunami is, it is not nearly enough to prevent big inventory builds next year,” said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group in Washington. “President Trump and President Putin prevented OPEC+ from cutting by more, which was certainly needed to put a sturdy floor under prices. They are putting a fuzzy floor under prices.” Trump has asked OPEC to keep prices low, pleading with the Saudis in twitter messages. Russia had initially balked at cutting production alongside OPEC.   Output from the world’s biggest producers - OPEC, Russia and the United States - has increased by 3.3 million bpd since the end of 2017 to 56.38 million bpd, meeting almost 60 percent of global consumption. PRODN-TOTAL C-RU-OUT C-OUT-T-EIA The surge is mainly due to soaring U.S. oil production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has jumped by 2.5 million bpd since early 2016 to a record 11.7 million bpd. U.S. drillers this week cut oil rigs by the most in over two years, after adding rigs in recent weeks, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report. RIG-OL-USA-BHI. [RIG/U]  The rig count, an indicator of future production, fell by 10 oil rigs in the week to Dec. 7, the biggest weekly decline since May 2016.

2018-12-07,"WASHINGTON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Turkey’s head of intelligence has traveled to Washington to meet with U.S. lawmakers and intelligence officials, sources said, in an apparent bid to improve ties with the Americans after a breakdown in the NATO allies’ relationship last summer. Hakan Fidan, a close confidant of Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan, has met with senators to discuss NATO issues and was expected to meet with U.S. intelligence officials later on Friday, according to five sources familiar with the matter, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was discussed in the meeting with members and staff of the NATO Observer Group, a bipartisan group of senators that advocates for the alliance, two sources familiar with the matter said. But it was not a central subject in discussions with senators and the Turkish side has refrained from making it the focus of their meetings, the sources added. Top U.S. senators have said they want to punish Saudi Arabia for the killing, despite President Donald Trump’s decision to stand by the long-time ally. While the two countries have collaborated on the Khashoggi investigation, U.S.-Turkey ties have been strained by disagreements over a number of issues from Syria to Turkey’s desire to buy Russian defense systems. Relations between Ankara and Washington began to improve after U.S. pastor Andrew Brunson, who was on trial over terrorism-related charges in Turkey, was released in October. But the NATO allies remain divided on other issues, including U.S. policy in Syria, Ankara’s ambition to purchase Russian missile defense systems and Turkey’s request for the United States to extradite Fethullah Gulen, a cleric Ankara blames for organizing an abortive 2016 putsch. Gulen denies involvement. Fidan was expected to discuss the murder of Khashoggi, a Washington post columnist and critic of the Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, in his meeting with U.S. intelligence officials, sources said. It was not immediately clear if Fidan was to meet with Gina Haspel, director of the CIA. The CIA has assessed with medium to high confidence that the crown price, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, ordered the killing of Khashoggi when he visited the consulate on Oct. 2. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge. Trump cast doubt on the CIA assessment, saying the agency had not formed a definitive conclusion. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there was no direct evidence linking the prince to the killing.

2018-12-07,"(Reuters) - U.S. drillers this week cut oil rigs by the most in over two year even as record production has turned the United States into a net oil exporter for the first time in history. Energy companies cut 10 oil rigs in the week to Dec. 7, the biggest weekly decline since May 2016, bringing the total count down to 877, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday.  More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there declined by four this week to their lowest since early November. The United States last week exported more crude and refined products than it imported for the first time on record, even as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies agreed to fresh output cuts to support prices amid a global glut of oil. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 751 rigs were active because energy companies have spent more this year to ramp up production to capture higher prices. U.S. crude futures were trading below $54 a barrel on Friday, boosted by the OPEC-led production cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day, putting the front-month contract on track for its biggest weekly percentage gain since June. Looking ahead, crude futures for calendar 2019 CLYstc1 and 2020 CLYstc2 were trading around $55 per barrel. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 23 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $89.1 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,029. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. The U.S. government projected average annual U.S. production will rise to a record high 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019 from 9.4 million bpd in 2017.

2018-12-07,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday to slash oil production by more than the market had expected despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. The producer club will curb output from January by 0.8 million barrels per day versus October levels while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd of cuts, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April.  Oil prices jumped about 5 percent to more than $63 a barrel as the combined cut of 1.2 million bpd was larger than the minimum 1 million bpd that the market had expected. Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has faced demands from Trump to help the global economy by refraining from paring supplies.  An output curtailment also would provide support to Iran by increasing the price of oil amid attempts by Washington to squeeze the economy of OPEC’s third-largest producer. Asked whether the decision to cut could sour Riyadh’s relations with Washington, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters the kingdom was ready to pump more should a major supply outage occur. “We will not squeeze consumers beyond what they can afford,” he said, adding that given the United States had recently become the biggest oil-producing nation, its energy companies were “breathing a sigh of relief”. Further complicating Riyadh’s decisions this week was the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on the kingdom. Falih refrained from answering a question on whether the OPEC decision might prompt Washington to withdraw support, but said Saudi-U.S. relations were based on shared values. TWO-DAY MARATHON The OPEC deal had hung in the balance for two days - first on fears that Russia would cut too little, and later on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement. But after hours of talks, Iran gave OPEC the green light and Russia said it was ready to cut more. Russia gave a commitment to reduce output by 228,000 bpd from October levels of 11.4 million bpd, though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months.  The country’s energy minister, Alexander Novak, said Russian President Vladimir Putin had discussed an output decrease with Saudi Prince Mohammed. Iraq, OPEC’s second-largest producer, pledged to cut 140,000 bpd. Falih said Saudi production had dropped to 10.7 million bpd in December from 11.1 million in November and was set to decline to 10.2 million bpd in January. Iran, Libya and Venezuela were effectively given exemptions. Nigeria, which has been exempt since the previous round of cuts from January 2017, agreed to participate. Helima Croft, managing director at RBC Capital Markets, said the deal exceeded expectations.  “Having the next meeting in April will be important for planning purposes to speed the cycle up a bit,” she said. OPEC normally meets once every six months. “We don’t know what will Iran’s sanctions picture look like. We don’t know the Iranian volumes which will be coming off the market,” Croft said. But Bob McNally, president of U.S.-based Rapidan Energy Group, said the details of the cut were “fuzzy” and would likely result in a lesser reduction than the headline figure. “President Trump will not be happy to see today’s headlines, but how strongly he reacts depends mainly on whether crude prices rise strongly as a result in coming days and weeks.” U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook met Falih in Vienna this week, in an unprecedented development ahead of an OPEC meeting. Saudi Arabia first denied the Hook-Falih discussion took place but later confirmed it. “U.S. political pressure is clearly a dominant factor at this OPEC meeting, limiting the scope of Saudi actions to rebalance the market,” said Gary Ross, chief executive of Black Gold Investors and a veteran OPEC watcher. The price of crude LCOc1 has fallen almost a third since October as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output to offset lower exports from Iran. [O/R] Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States have been vying for the position of top crude producer in recent years. The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. On Thursday, U.S. government figures showed the country had become a net exporter of crude oil and refined products for the first time on record, underscoring how the surge in production has altered the supply equation in world markets.

2018-12-07,"DAKAR, Dec 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major chocolate companies have failed to keep a promise they made a year ago to stop forests in West Africa being destroyed for cocoa production, a campaign group said on Friday. Companies from Mars to Hershey to Barry Callebaut joined the governments of Ivory Coast and Ghana to launch the Cocoa and Forests Initiative last year, pledging to eliminate the production and sourcing of cocoa from protected forests. But satellite images of Ivory Coast’s southwest cocoa-growing region showed about the same amount of forest had been lost in the 12 months since the pledge was made as in the previous year, campaign group Mighty Earth said in a report. “I would have expected to see some deforestation continue, because it’s very hard to transform an entire industry overnight, but I did not expect to see it continue exactly the same as before,” said the report’s author, Etelle Higgonet. If deforestation continues unabated, Ivory Coast - the world’s top cocoa producer - risks losing all its forest cover by 2034, environmental campaigners say. But stopping it is a challenge since the cocoa grown on that land provides livelihoods for hundreds of thousands of farmers and their families. Land is scarce, so poor farmers often expand into forests or parks to raise their incomes, experts say. Mighty Earth recorded 13,748 hectares of deforestation - equivalent to 15,000 football fields - in Ivory Coast’s southwest region between Nov. 2017 and Sept. 2018. This put it on track to reach about the same figure as last year - 14,827 ha - by November, Higgonet said. The group was not able to obtain data as precise from Ghana, but observed a similar lack of change there, she added. The World Cocoa Foundation (WCF), the industry group behind the Cocoa and Forests Initiative, said recent reports show there has been progress in national parks and classified forests. “Our immediate priority has been to stop deforestation in the most ecologically important and environmentally sensitive areas, and we are encouraged to see positive results in less than one year,” said WCF president Richard Scobey. Most of the recent deforestation hotspots are in rural areas outside protected forests, which is legal but still environmentally damaging, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Mighty Earth also accused companies of not upholding their pledge to stop buying cocoa from national parks. Ivory Coast has estimated 40 percent of its cocoa comes from protected areas. “I feel like people are taking me for a fool. Because if you do the math ... somebody’s buying it,” said Higgonet.

2018-12-07,"* Dollar weak as jobs report disappoints * Oil surges after OPEC output decision * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world were mixed, with U.S. shares retreating on Friday amid continuing concerns over U.S.-China trade ties, while pledges by key oil producers to trim output boosted oil prices. Oil prices surged 4 percent after big Middle East producers in OPEC agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market. Shares on Wall Street fell more than 1 percent, with a drop in technology stocks sparking a turnaround from earlier in the day amid the trade standoff. U.S. employers hired fewer workers than expected in November, supporting a view that U.S. growth is moderating and the Federal Reserve may stop raising rates sooner than previously thought. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 155,000 last month, but missed economists expectation of 200,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 360.85 points, or 1.45 percent, to 24,586.82, the S&P 500 lost 38.23 points, or 1.42 percent, to 2,657.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 137.53 points, or 1.91 percent, to 7,050.73. Wall Street was also weighed down by sinking technology shares with Apple Inc down more than 2 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.36 percent. European shares staged a small recovery after three days of heavy losses, amid growing worries the U.S.-China trade row may slow world economic growth. The euro zone’s STOXX index closed up 0.6 percent. U.S. stock futures had pared losses to move higher early on Friday after the jobs report, but the advance was shortlived. “It is still consistent with the Fed raising short term interest rates, said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. “But I think the main theme here is that investors are expecting the Fed to be even more gradual, a little bit more cautious, in raising interest rates in 2019. Stock markets around the world tumbled on Thursday after Canadian officials announced the Dec. 1 arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone-maker Huawei for extradition to the U.S. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the world’s two superpowers reaching a trade resolution. Also contributing to this week’s selloff were rising concerns about a U.S. economic slowdown signalled by a flattening Treasury yield curve. The entire yield curve steepened on Friday, while the front half of the yield curve remained inverted after two-year and three-year yields rose above five-year yields for the first time in over a decade earlier this week. That inversion has stoked speculation as to whether a U.S. recession is looming. The U.S. dollar weakened against major currencies after the U.S. jobs data, which backed a view that U.S. growth is moderating and the Federal Reserve may stop raising rates sooner than previously thought. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, fell 0.05 percent, with the euro up 0.09 percent to $1.1384. Oil prices jumped more than 4 percent as Saudi Arabia and other producers in OPEC, as well as allies in Russia agreed to reduce output. Brent crude rose $2.94, or 4.4 percent, to $63.00 a barrel.  U.S. crude rose 4.3 percent $53.70 a barrel, after earlier reaching a session high of $54.22.

2018-12-07,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - H eat-trapping emissions from buildings and construction appear to have peaked at a global level, the United Nations said on Friday, a trend that could encourage countries to take up the issue more aggressively as a way of curbing climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions attributed to buildings levelled off over 2015-2017, but still represent about a third of the global emissions that cause climate change, a report by UN Environment and its partners said. The finding is a rare bright spot amid a spate of warnings that not enough is being done to stop the planet heating up. Global carbon emissions are set to rise nearly 3 percent this year due to continued fossil fuel use, scientists said this week, dashing hopes that an increase in 2017 was temporary after two years of slowdown. The UN Environment report called for more pledges to make building construction greener, in national climate action plans submitted for the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb climate change. “It’s a very complex field, but one that’s absolutely critical,” Nick Nuttall, a UN Environment spokesman told reporters on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland. Delegates from more than 190 nations party to the Paris Agreement are gathered in the Polish city of Katowice to meet an end-of-year deadline to agree rules on how to enforce the pact. The “rule book”, as it is known, is expected to include details about how countries will report and monitor curbs on greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen their national plans. A positive outcome at the negotiations could encourage governments to double down on promises to cut emissions from the construction industry, said Nuttall. “That might increase the enthusiasm of nations to revise their (action plans),” he said. “If they’re revised upwards to include the building and construction sector, then what happens here will have a very strong impact on the sector being able to move forward faster.” To encourage energy-efficient buildings, the national plans could push for better insulation and windows by aspiring to revamp building codes and set up energy certification schemes. They could also plan to lower emissions from common building materials like cement and steel whose manufacturing generates large amounts of carbon, the report said. Even if such rules require consumers to open their wallets to retrofit a home, for example, it is unlikely to cause the kind of public anger seen recently in France over fuel taxes, said Jennifer Layke, global director for energy with the Washington-based World Resources Institute. Higher fuel taxes proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron to fight climate change have stoked violent protests in the European nation, forcing the government to shelve the plan this week. “If you told everyone they had to spend $1,000 next month to renovate their home, you would see a backlash,” said Layke. But most countries had “proven strategies” to help consumers shoulder the costs, such as financing or rebates, she said. In June, the European Union gave its member states 20 months to put into law a goal to dramatically increase the energy efficiency of buildings by 2050.

2018-12-07,"* Last week’s backwardation prompts sale of floating cargoes * Demand remains subdued as storage still high * Yamal to sell all winter cargoes to Europe By Ekaterina Kravtsova and Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) slumped this week to a six-month low, bucking the usual winter trend, as low demand persisted and supplies were boosted by deliveries from tankers that had been floating in north Asian waters for weeks. Spot prices for January delivery dropped a dollar to $8.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since May and below the levels of a year ago, for the first time in 2018. Prices for February delivery, although also weaker, dropped less and returned to contango with the January. Prices were estimated at around $9.00 to $9.30 per mmBtu for February. Low demand during the northern hemisphere winter and falling prices follow frantic buying by Asian utilities in September and October, filling up storage for the coming months. Nevertheless, some traders bet on continued high demand and began using laden LNG carriers as storage in waters off Singapore, Malaysia and South China, while others had cargoes waiting there for delivery slots to become free. When the market turned to backwardation last week, some of these traders sold the cargoes if only to gain from sky-high shipping rates by subleasing the newly freed-up tankers. Despite the low demand, several cargoes were sold in both Pacific and Atlantic basins, according to trade sources. U.S. producer ExxonMobil has sold a late December cargo from Australia’s Gorgon plant on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, a trader said. Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) sold a DES cargo for January below $9 per mmBtu, a shipping source said. Commodity trader Trafigura was marketing an early January cargo from Singapore this week, with one trader saying on Thursday the cargo was gone. Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (Kufpec) is closing on Friday a tender for a free on board (FOB) cargo loading on Jan. 18-23 from Australia’s Wheatstone plant. Japan’s utility Kansai Electric was one of the few buyers this week, securing a late January cargo, a trader said. Russia’s Novatek will sell the rest of its winter cargoes to Europe, having covered three positions in Asia — a way of cutting down on shipping costs from Europe to Asia, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Novatek bought cargoes for December at a $1.60 premium to the Dutch gas hub benchmark price, a January cargo at a slight discount to the spot Asian LNG price and February cargo linked to Brent crude, the source said. Novatek is trying to sell two summer cargoes to Asia, with prices expected to be linked to oil, according to the source. In the Atlantic, Nigeria LNG sold an FOB cargo for December loading from its Bonny plant, after offering at least two at the end of November, several sources said. In the Middle East, Gunvor won an FOB tender from Abu Dhabi’s state-owned ADNOC for loading between Dec. 26 and 28. Reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova and Sabina Zawadzki; editing

2018-12-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investors pulled billions from bonds and stocks this week as U.S. bond movements triggered fears over global growth and a trade tussle between the United States and China heated up, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday.  This week’s selloff was precipitated by the inversion of part of the U.S. yield curve, which has previously been a reliable indicator of an impending recession. It deepened on Thursday after the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei was arrested on a U.S. request, sending markets spiraling further as investors predicted a worsening of relations between the world’s two biggest economies.  The anxiety drove investors to pull $5.2 billion from equity funds and $8.1 billion from bond funds, according to EPFR data cited by BAML. “Markets starting to price in recession, but policymakers yet to price in recession,” argued the BAML strategists. Equity outflows were made up of opposite flows in ETFs and mutual funds, with $5.3 billion driven into ETFs while $10.5 billion was taken out of mutual funds. But investors were continuing to edge back into emerging market stocks, which saw their eighth week of inflows with $2.7 billion.  This helped push BAML’s “Bull & Bear” indicator of market sentiment up from 2.4 to 2.7 - “not yet an extreme bearish reading”, BAML strategists said.  The starting point for a fall to lower equity allocations is high, they pointed out, with the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund at 67 percent equity allocations. Hedge funds are still at a net 35 to 40 percent net long, and BAML’s fund manager survey shows cash levels under 5 percent. The global consensus forecast is for 8.3 percent growth in earnings-per-share in 2019, which the strategists said was too high, predicting a “Big Low” in markets next year. In bond flows investors were pulling out of corporate debt and into government debt, the EPFR data showed.  Some $15 billion flowed into government bond funds over the past eight weeks, while $49 billion flowed out of investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. In equity sectors, a building preference for value stocks over growth inverted this week, as tech had its biggest inflows in 11 weeks and financials saw heavy outflows. Healthcare, tech, energy, and real estate saw inflows while consumer stocks, utilities, and materials saw outflows. Financials were the least preferred with investors pulling $1.3 billion from the sector.

2018-12-07,"PARIS (Reuters) - France hunkered down for another wave of potentially violent protests on Saturday as embattled President Emmanuel Macron planned to address the nation next week over public fury at the high cost of living, senior allies said. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said the three-week-old “yellow vest” revolt had “created a monster” and vowed police would have no tolerance for violence, with much of Paris in lockdown and tens of thousands of police deployed nationwide. Named after the fluorescent safety vests that all French motorists must carry, the protesters are billing their planned action on Saturday as “Act IV” of worst unrest seen in the capital since the 1968 student riots.  Castaner warned that radicals would likely again infiltrate the protest movement - a backlash against high living costs but also, increasingly, a revolt against Macron himself, including his perceived loftiness and reforms favouring a moneyed elite. “These last three weeks have created a monster,” Castaner told reporters. “Our security forces will respond with firmness and I will have no tolerance for anyone who capitalises on the distress of our citizens.” Some 89,000 policemen will be on duty nationwide to forestall a repeat of last Saturday’s destructive mayhem in exclusive central districts of Paris. Police in Paris will be backed up by armoured vehicles equipped to clear barricades.  Senior allies of Macron said the president would address the nation early next week. Navigating his biggest crisis since being elected 18 months ago, Macron has left it largely to his prime minister, Edouard Philippe, to deal in public with the turmoil and offer concessions. But the 40-year-old is under mounting pressure to speak more fully as his administration tries to regain the initiative following three weeks of unrest in the G7 nation. “The President will speak early next week. I think this is what the French people want, they want answers,” Transport Minister Elisabeth Borne told Sud Radio on Friday. Macron has not spoken in public since he condemned last Saturday’s disturbances while at the G20 summit in Argentina and opposition leaders accused him of turning the Elysee Palace into a bunker where had taken cover. “Is Macron still in Argentina? He must surely have an opinion,” hard-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on Twitter on Tuesday. “The president himself must speak,” main opposition conservative Republicains leader Laurent Wauquiez told Europe 1 radio on Thursday.  After the Dec. 1 riots in central Paris and sometimes violent demonstrations in dozens of other cities and towns across France, the government offered a rush of sweeteners to soothe public anger. It started by scrapping next year’s planned hikes to fuel taxes, the first major U-turn of Macron’s presidency and costing the Treasury 4 billion euros (3.5 billion pounds). But protesters want Macron to go further to help hard-pressed households, including an increase to the minimum wage, lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy, better retirement provisions and even Macron’s resignation. But, mindful of France’s deficit and not wanting to flout EU rules, Macron will have scant wriggle room for more concessions.  The “gilets jaunes” (yellow vest) movement remains amorphous and hard to define, with a rapidly shifting agenda and internal divisions. One faction, which dubs itself the “Free Yellow Vests”, called on protesters not to travel to Paris on Saturday but criticised Macron for refusing to hold direct talks. “We appeal for calm, for respect of public property and the security forces,” Benjamin Cauchy declared in front of the National Assembly. His group are seen as moderates within the broader movement. “The forgotten France is the France of the regions and it is in the regions that the France will show peacefully their anger,” Cauchy said.  The Eiffel Tower, opera house, and Louvre are among dozens of museums and tourist sites in Paris that will close on Saturday to pre-empt feared attacks by yellow vest militants. Luxury boutiques and restaurants in fancy neighbourhoods and near the presidential palace erected barricades and boarded up windows. Department stores Galerie Lafayette and Printemps said they would not open in the capital on Saturday.  The trouble is jeopardising a timid economic recovery in France just as the Christmas holiday season kicks off. Retailers have lost about 1 billion euros in revenue since the protests erupted, the retail federation said.   On the French stock market, retailers, airlines and hoteliers suffered their worst week in months. Patrick Delmas, 49, will shut his “Le Monte Carlo” bar next to the Champs Elysees on Saturday, blaming hoodlums from anarchist and anti-capitalist groups, as well as the yellow vest movement’s violent fringe. “We have lost 60 percent of business over the last 15 days,” he said. “The problem is all those people who arrive with the sole intention of smashing things up.” Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry, Dominique Vidalon, Sudip Kar-Gupta, Richard Lough and Marine Pennetier; Writing by Richard Lough; Editing by Mark Heinrich",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests-macron/update-3-france-braces-for-trouble-macron-to-address-yellow-vest-anger-idUKL8N1YC0UD,07 Dec 2018,"* Graphic on hit to French companies: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RDxLXu

2018-12-07,"(Adds comments by the public prosecutor) NAIROBI, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Kenya has appointed an acting chief executive to the state pipeline company KPC after five of its senior executives, including the CEO, were arrested in connection with the loss of funds at the firm, the latest move to crack down on corruption. Dozens of Kenyan government officials and business people have appeared in court since May on charges relating to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of shillings from public coffers in a new drive to tackle widespread graft. Hudson Andambi, an official at the ministry of petroleum has been picked as acting CEO of KPC, the ministry said, saying the move was due to “unfolding events at the Kenya Pipeline Company and the arrest of the top management.” “This is to ensure that operations continue without interference for purposes of ensuring security of supply of petroleum products,” the ministry said in a statement. Joe Sang, the MD of KPC, was arrested with four other senior officials in connection with the loss of an unspecified amount of money during the construction of an oil jetty in the western city of Kisumu, the Daily Nation reported on its website. Police were not immediately available for comment. Sang did not answer calls to his mobile phone from Reuters. In a statement the director of public prosecutions Noordin Haji said there was “sufficient evidence to support various charges” against six suspects related to the oil jetty project which cost 2 billion shillings ($19.55 million). He listed the charges as abuse of office, failure to comply with procedures and executing a project without prior planning. Earlier on Friday he had told a local TV station he had authorised the arrest of the suspects that: “we shall arraign them in court on Monday,” he told NTV. Sang, who has been in his post since early 2016, wrote to KPC’s board earlier this week saying he would not seek an extension of his contract on its expiration next April. He cited unspecified personal reasons for his decision. KPC’s board said on Tuesday it had decided to allow oil marketing companies to carry out a forensic audit of their fuel stocks after they complained about excessive losses. President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013, but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials. No high profile convictions have occurred since he took office. Also in another statement on Friday, the public prosecutor said he had sanctioned several charges including abuse of office, executing a project without proper planning and failure to comply with public funds management laws against 21 officials at the state-run National Hospital Insurance Fund. The charges relate to an irregular award and extension of a contract in which 1.1 billion shillings was lost, he said.

2018-12-07,"* Necsa a producer of medical radioisotopes * Board members backed nuclear power expansion * Ramaphosa opposed to nuclear expansion * Board plans legal challenge over its removal (Adds Rosatom detail, lawyer, context) By Alexander Winning PRETORIA, Dec 7 (Reuters) - South African Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said on Friday that the government had replaced the entire board of directors of state-run nuclear firm Necsa and suspended its chief executive over problems with how it was governed. The previous Necsa board included prominent backers of plans to expand South Africa’s nuclear power capacity which were shelved by President Cyril Ramaphosa after he succeeded scandal-plagued Jacob Zuma as head of state in February. Necsa is one of the world’s largest producers of medical radioisotopes and promotes research and development in nuclear energy. “The Necsa board failed to execute its statutory mandate in a satisfactory and prudent manner,” Radebe told a news conference. He said several board members had shown “ineptitude and deliberate acts of defiance” which had resulted in setbacks including a halt in production of radioisotopes at Necsa subsidiary NTP. Necsa also signed an agreement with Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom earlier this year to explore joint production of nuclear medicines, despite an “express instruction” from the South African government to not go ahead with the signing, Radebe said. The new board will be headed by Rob Adam, a former Necsa executive who has also served as director of the Square Kilometre Array telescope project. The decision to appoint Adam and other new Necsa board members could still be overturned, however, as a lawyer for the previous board told Reuters that he would lodge an urgent interdict on Friday to overturn the appointments. “From a legal standpoint we think the minister’s decision to replace the Necsa board is completely without merit,” lawyer Douglas Molepo said. “He clearly did not properly apply his mind to the board’s representations as to why it should not be removed.” Asked about the previous Necsa board’s plan to challenge their removal, Radebe said: “I hear that they want to oppose. Opposing what? They have been removed as a board, and cabinet has approved the new board. So they are ex-board members.” South Africa currently has two nuclear reactors with an installed capacity of around 1,800 megawatts at a power plant near Cape Town. Under Zuma, there were plans to build up to 9,600 additional megawatts of new nuclear capacity, but Ramaphosa has said the country cannot currently afford to expand.

2018-12-07,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Global stocks staged a modest rebound on Friday with Asian and European markets gaining after a selloff the previous day, while crude oil edged up after indications Russia would contribute a bigger output cut than previously suggested to producers. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 1.1 percent by 1222 GMT, after falling as much as 3.2 percent during Thursday’s rout, which was triggered by the arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone-maker Huawei in Canada. The arrest, coming on the heels of a 90-day trade truce between the United States and China, triggered fears that the dispute could escalate further and dented hopes for a resolution. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day, on track to end the week down 2 percent. Chinese shares, which were up earlier in the day, slipped into negative territory with the blue chips off 0.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.1 percent, though that followed a 1.8 percent drubbing on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.8 percent. Markets also face a test from U.S. payrolls data later in the session amid speculation that the U.S. economy is heading for a tough patch after years of solid growth. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down 0.5 percent. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasised the strength of the labour market in remarks late on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters estimated that jobs rose by 200,000 in November after surging 250,000 in October. The data is due at 1330 GMT. “Investors are increasingly anxious about the longevity of the economic cycle, given recent financial market weakness, and they are focusing more on the timing of the next global downturn and the various stresses this could expose,” wrote HSBC economist James Pomeroy in a note. “But for all of the volatility in the equity, credit and oil markets, most of the global economic data have stayed relatively sanguine. US data remain robust - with business optimism and job openings up at cycle highs, and the hard activity data are consistent with a robust pace of growth.” The mood in risk-asset markets brightened a little after the Wall Street Journal reported Fed officials were considering whether to signal a new wait-and-see mentality after a likely rate increase at their meeting in December. That only added to recent speculation that the central bank was almost done hiking rates, given concerns about global growth and the disinflationary impact of collapsing oil prices. Interest rate futures rallied hard in massive volumes with the market now pricing in less than one hike next year. A month ago they had been betting on three increases. The news helped Wall Street pare steep losses and the Dow ended Thursday down 0.32 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15 percent. The Nasdaq managed to advance 0.42 percent. Treasuries extended their rally, driving 10-year yields down to a three-month trough at 2.8260 percent, before last trading at 2.8827 percent. Yields on two-year notes fell a huge 10 basis points at one stage on Thursday and were last at 2.75 percent. Investors also steamrolled the yield curve to its flattest in over a decade, a trend that has historically presaged economic slowdowns and even recessions. “The sort of flattening of the yield curve that we have seen recently usually indicates that investors think the Fed is nearing the end of a tightening cycle, and that rate cuts may even be on the horizon,” argued analysts at Capital Economics. Yields on 10-year paper sank to the lowest in six months in Germany, almost 12 months in Canada and 16 months in Australia. The sea change in expectations took a toll on the U.S. dollar as bulls had been counting heavily on a steady widening rate differential to propel the currency. The greenback was flat against a basket of currencies at 96.801, and fell to 112.83 yen from a 113.85 high at the start of the week. The euro was down 0.1 percent at $1.13735. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin took a fresh spill, sinking almost 18 percent on the week to $3,396.19. In commodity markets, gold firmed to near a five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood 0.3 percent higher at $1,240.73 per ounce. Oil edged up after indications Russia would contribute a bigger output cut than previously suggested to an OPEC and non-OPEC deal, although prospects for an overall agreement still hung in the balance. Brent futures rose 1.4 percent to $60.87 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose half a percent to $51.75.

2018-12-07,"(Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate the thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 1/ CURVE-BALLS With major parts of the U.S. economy visibly slowing, the Treasury market has reacted in a striking manner - the 10-year yield is close to falling below the two-year yield, which would mark the curve inversion that has preceded every recession in the last 40 years. Signs of slowdown have persuaded markets to bet the Fed will slow the pace of rate increases next year. But wait. Inflation is running at a 9-month high, annual wage growth a 9-1/2 year high and unemployment at a near-50 year low. So November inflation, due on Dec. 12, will play into how Fed chair Jerome Powell frames the path of future tightening. So it remains to be seen where the curve goes from here. There are reasons to believe it can steepen and reasons to believe it will invert. Depending on how the incoming data looks - stagflation, anyone? - the Fed’s view on where neutral is and what its policy response should be in the coming months is far from clear. - One part of the U.S. yield curve just inverted; what does that mean? - Tariff effects broaden across U.S., wage growth higher - Fed - As Fed says on track, narrowing yield curve could complicate debate 2/ MAYDAY! MAYDAY! Buckle up for another wild week of Brexit may-hem on sterling and other UK-focused markets. Britain’s parliament is - at the time of writing at least - set to vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit transition deal on Tuesday, but the chances of it being approved don’t look good. What happens then is... well that’s the thing, there are multiple possibilities, all with very different implications. A really heavy defeat would make it difficult for May to carry on. She has staggered through the last couple of years, taking direct hits from all angles but this could finally bring her down. Could that then lead to a hard Brexiteer taking the reins and ripping up the deal? Perhaps and sterling won’t like that one bit. But it’s equally possible that whoever takes over would press pause on the whole process by withdrawing the so-called Article 50 notice. That could even raise the chances of a second public Brexit vote and that could send sterling soaring. - As Brexit crunch nears, campaign for new referendum gathers pace - May's Brexit deal under fire as legal advice stiffens opposition 3/ QE NO MORE Thursday marks the end of an era for the ECB, which is set to formally announce the end of its three-year long, 2.6 trillion-euro monetary stimulus scheme. For markets, that’s a done deal. What matters now is what the ECB does in the face of a weakening economy, global trade tensions, Brexit and Italy. Policymakers have already been floating ideas to support the economy when QE ends. One suggestion is for multi-year loans to banks. What investors appear more certain about is that the ECB will struggle to bring interest rates back up to zero percent - especially if a U.S. slowdown encourages the Fed to pause its rate-hike cycle. Money market pricing suggests investors expect roughly a 75 pct chance of a ECB rate hike in 2019. But that’s down from 100 percent just a few weeks ago. - ECB policymakers debate new ways out of easy money - Italy, Spain and France would face 90 billion euro hit on new ECB ""key"" - Euro zone inflation dips as ECB braces to end bond buying 4/ TRADE OFF So much for the U.S.-China trade truce. If financial markets are any guide, the detente between Washington and Beijing struck over a steak dinner at the G20 in Buenos Aires barely lasted 24 hours. Fears of global trade war and economic slowdown are again driving investor sentiment. On oil markets, that signals that a 30 percent price slump since October has little hope of reversing. Oil has also had to contend with OPEC, whose failure to agree an output cut accelerated the slump in prices, pushing Brent below $60/barrel and WTI futures close to breaking below $50. The possibility of small cuts by the likes of Russia and Kazakhstan are unlikely to save the day, given the magnitude of market oversupply. Commodities overall are in some trouble. Copper is near three-week lows, having lost around 15 percent so far in 2018, while most base metals are down a similar amount. And the Australian dollar, a good proxy for commodities, Chinese demand and world trade, was the worst-performing major currency in the world all week. Without good news on the trade front, respite is unlikely. - Iran agrees to OPEC oil cut, focus shifts back to Russia - U.S. trade deficit hits 10-year high; private hiring slows - China says confident it can clinch trade deal with U.S. as doubts grow 5/ BEIJING COCKTAIL The United States has just reported its trade deficit hit a 10-year high in October, and its politically sensitive deficit with China surged to a record $43 billion. So markets will watch to see how China hawks in the Trump administration react to China’s trade data due for release on December 8. The data should show whether China is carrying out promises to import more from America. It could well provide more grist for the mill - for U.S. officials pushing for more reasons to punish China and for investors sceptical of the trade ceasefire. The prospect of a Chinese growth slowdown is keeping investors edgy. So while trade contributes far less to the country’s GDP than it used to, there are other data points coming up too - credit growth and retail sales among others - which should show how badly the economy is hurting from the trade war. - China downplays front-loading as reason behind strong export growth     (Reporting by Jennifer Ablan in New York, Vidya Ranganathan in Singapore; Marc Jones, Jamie McGeever and Dhara Ranasinghe in London; compiled by Sujata Rao; Edited by Andrew Heavens)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets-themes/graphic-take-five-uk-may-day-and-us-curveballs-world-markets-themes-for-the-week-ahead-idUKL8N1YB498,07 Dec 2018,"Following are five big themes likely to

2018-12-07,"(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text) * At least 18 GE turbines shutting down worldwide for blade repairs-sources * GE says it found turbine blade problem in 2015 By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Utilities are shutting down at least 18 of General Electric Co’s newest gas turbines for repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France, according to more than a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts. The shutdowns, which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas, come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes. GE is setting aside $480 million to repair its 9HA, 7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business. The 126-year-old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut down, or when it would replace parts - if needed - in as many as 130 such turbines it has produced. Power plant operators in Japan, Taiwan, France and at multiple U.S. sites have shut down - or plan to shut down - at least 18 of the 55 new HA-model turbines that GE has shipped so far, French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry experts, including executives, plant operators, insurance specialists, engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show. FACTBOX In an interview, GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data, saying that GE turbines are performing “extremely well,” despite the need for “early maintenance” to fix the blades. Considering all of the power turbines it has in use, GE has “the most reliable fleet in the world - 99 percent, give or take, reliability,” he added. GE previously disclosed that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of them in September. Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut down. Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine, owned by Exelon Corp. The turbines are now running after two months of repairs, Exelon said. GE told Reuters it identified the oxidation problem in 2015, and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on other turbine models. Three plant operators using GE equipment that are shutting for blade repairs, Invenergy, Exelon and Tennessee Valley Authority, told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in installing new blades for free under warranty. “Overall, we’ve been very pleased with GE’s HA technology and its performance capabilities,” said Beth Conley, a spokeswoman at Invenergy, which is receiving replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant that has not yet opened. Following the problems in Texas, state-owned utility Electricite de France closed its plant in the northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late September for blade replacements. Bouchain was the first plant worldwide to install GE’s 9HA turbine. Bouchain has logged 86 outages for equipment failure, testing or other reasons from January 2017 to October 2018, five times the average for non-GE plants, according to data from French grid operator RTE analyzed by Reuters. Reuters excluded outages for planned maintenance. The French data also show that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing, on average, more than twice as often as non-GE gas-fueled plants in France with turbines made by Alstom, Siemens AG and Ansaldo Energia SpA. GE acquired Alstom’s power business in 2015. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3 GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the data from grid operator RTE, an independent subsidiary of EDF, are “not wrong,” but should not be used to assess turbine performance because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants. EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain, which opened in 2016, and that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their break-in period. EDF said Bouchain’s output is cycled up and down to meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly. The other gas-fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and have been in operation for many years. RTE, Siemens AG, Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems declined to comment. Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how often GE’s turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world. Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to be serviced or tested, or when equipment failure or other problems cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly. While GE plants still produce a third of the world’s electricity, GE fell from first to third place in new turbine orders by capacity, behind Mitsubishi and Siemens, according to a first-half tally by McCoy Power Reports, a widely watched industry data source. GE said it booked seven HA turbine orders in the first nine months of this year, half as many as in the same period last year. GE’s HA turbines have come under particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing competition. The success of GE’s new turbines are of increasing importance as it slims down to focus on power plants, jet engines and wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring. GE spent more than two decades developing the 400-ton machines, but brought them to market after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share, forcing GE to catch up. GE undercut its rivals’ prices by about 20 percent “to go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by 2016,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report this year. Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE’s profit and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its power unit, and its credit rating fell to just three notches above junk. Culp is splitting up the power division, consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new leaders for it. Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23-year low, forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive. Scott Strazik, the new chief executive of GE Gas Power, said in an interview that customers are happy with GE’s response to the blade issue and GE has no plans to change how it handles customer issues, or how it tests turbines, noting GE’s test facility is the largest and most comprehensive in the world. “The HA is the fastest-selling gas turbine that we have, and customers continue to have a strong desire for the HA,” Strazik said.

2018-12-07,"NAIROBI, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Kenya has appointed an acting chief executive to the state pipeline company KPC after five of its senior executives, including the CEO, were arrested in connection with the loss of funds at the firm, the latest move to crack down on corruption. Dozens of Kenyan government officials and business people have appeared in court since May on charges relating to the alleged theft of hundreds of millions of shillings from public coffers in a new drive to tackle widespread graft. Hudson Andambi, an official at the ministry of petroleum has been picked as acting CEO of KPC, the ministry said, saying the move was due to “unfolding events at the Kenya Pipeline Company and the arrest of the top management.” “This is to ensure that operations continue without interference for purposes of ensuring security of supply of petroleum products,” the ministry said in a statement. Joe Sang, the MD of KPC, was arrested with four other senior officials in connection with the loss of an unspecified amount of money during the construction of an oil jetty in the western city of Kisumu, the Daily Nation reported on its website. Police were not immediately available for comment. Sang did not answer calls to his mobile phone from Reuters. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji told a local TV station he had authorised the arrest of people suspected of corruption at KPC, without giving details. “Arrests are going on and we shall arraign them in court on Monday,” he told NTV. Sang, who has been in his post since early 2016, wrote to KPC’s board earlier this week saying he would not seek an extension of his contract on its expiration next April. He cited unspecified personal reasons for his decision. KPC’s board said on Tuesday it had decided to allow oil marketing companies to carry out a forensic audit of their fuel stocks after they complained about excessive losses. President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to stamp out graft when he was first elected in 2013, but critics say he has been slow to pursue top officials.

2018-12-07,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change are nearing the end of a first week in the Polish city of Katowice, the capital of the Silesian mining district.  The aim is to make an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce global action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. 1110 GMT - 2018 Nobel Economics prize winner William Nordhaus has called on countries at the COP 24 conference to rethink their approach to fighting climate change, saying voluntary agreements were doomed to failure.     Limiting global warming to 2 degrees is achievable if nations agree binding targets and face penalties for failing to meet them.      “It’s not that it’s not technologically and economically  feasible, it’s that we don’t have the political will and consensus to do it,” Nordhaus told Reuters correspondent Simon Johnson in Stockholm.     “I would focus on a carbon price, say $40 to $50 a tonne and then countries could decide how they wanted to do that - they could do cap and trade, they could do a carbon tax.”  Negotiations continue to clean up a messy text ahead of Saturday’s deadline to have a document ready for ministers to fight over in the second and final week of the conference. Negotiators say there has been progress, but it’s slow and, as ever, finance is a big stumbling block. After a series of reports documenting the widening gap between greenhouse gas emissions and action to reduce them,   Michal Kurtyka, the Polish leader of the talks, said this had given rise to an in-joke among negotiators. Before a day off on Sunday, and the arrival of ministers on Monday, the aim is to cut down the number of options in a draft of about 300 pages so ministers will have less work to finalise a deal. “The joke right now is ‘Narrow the gap’,” he said. The latest reports show continued use of fossil fuel means global carbon emissions are expected to rise again this year following on from an increase in 2017. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were roughly flat from 2014-16, which inspired hopes that emissions had peaked in 2013. While the talks drag on behind the closed doors of the conference centre, there’s no missing the sound of newly-mined coal rumbling down chutes some 50 km up the road. JSW, the European Union’s biggest coking coal miner, has plans to expand, possibly with Chinese money, and says coking coal, used in steel, has decades of rosy future ahead of it.

2018-12-07,"(Adds context, govt forecast as background) ALMATY, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan’s central bank has trimmed its forecast for the country’s oil output in 2019 and said it expects Brent crude oil to average $60 a barrel next year. The bank said in a statement on Friday that it expects the country to produce 91 million tonnes of oil next year, down from its previous estimate of 93 million tonnes, and taking into account scheduled maintenance work at oilfields. It also reduced its forecast for oil production this year to 90 million tonnes from 91 million tonnes. The new forecasts would still be above forecasts in the government’s budget for oil production of 87 million tonnes this year and 88 million tonnes in 2019. Oil is the Central Asian nation’s chief export and the bank said it expects the price of Brent crude oil to average $71.80 a barrel this year and $60 next year. Brent was trading at $60 a barrel on Friday. The central bank also cut its forecast for Kazakhstan’s 2018 current account deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic product, from 2.3 percent in its previous outlook. However, it said it now expected the current account deficit to widen to 3.9 percent of GDP next year, from 3.8 percent in its previous forecast, due to lower oil prices and slower growth in oil production than it previously forecast.

2018-12-07,"OSLO, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Equinor has received government approval for its plan to boost output and extend the lifetime of Troll, Norway’s largest oil and gas field, the company said on Friday. The field accounts for about 40 percent of the natural gas reserves on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS) and meets about 7-8 percent of Europe’s consumption. Norway is Europe’s second largest gas supplier after Russia. The approved 7.8 billion Norwegian crowns ($915 million)Phase 3 development will help to produce an extra 2.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent and extend gas production beyond 2050, the company said. In Phase 3, a gas cap located above the Troll West oil column will be produced at the same time as oil production continues. “With a break-even of less than $10 per barrel, Troll Phase 3 is one of the most profitable and resilient projects ever in our company,” said Torger Roed, Equinor’s senior vice president for the project. Equinor and its partners have awarded 950 million crowns in contracts for marine installations and subsea facilities to Nexans, Deep Ocean, IKM, Allseas and Marubeni . In addition, the partnership has awarded contracts worth about 2 billion crowns for subsea facilities and the construction of a new processing module on the Troll A platform to Aker Solutions. In October, Equinor said it had upgraded its oil-producing Troll B platform to process natural gas for export until the Phase 3 comes on stream in 2021. “In a few years Troll will only produce from the large remaining gas reserves. The production horizon for gas from Troll lasts beyond 2050,” it said. Equinor, the field’s operator, has a 30.58 percent stake, state-owned Petoro has 56 percent, Shell 8.1 percent, Total 3.69 percent and ConocoPhillips 1.62 percent. $1 = 8.5238 Norwegian crowns

2018-12-07,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian markets for liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil are closely related, and both now awash in oversupply. But while data shows forward oil prices rising, LNG prices for future delivery are veering in the opposite direction. This makes it unprofitable for the LNG market to store excess gas, as the forward curve for Asian LNG shows prices for February are 40 cents below January’s $9.67 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). That means the market is in what’s called ‘backwardation’ - where prices for future delivery are lower than those for immediate dispatch. That has baffled many traders. Because crude oil has a price curve pointing the other way - into what markets call ‘contango’, when immediate prices are lower than those in the future, traders can store unwanted oil profitably for later sale. For a graphic on Oil vs LNG price curve, see - tmsnrt.rs/2QfIgnh Oil markets moved from backwardation in October into contango from November due to an emerging glut. LNG markets are also clotted, with several tankers storing the fuel sitting off the region’s energy trading hub of Singapore. For a graphic on Brent crude oil curve falls into contango, see - tmsnrt.rs/2R1kFDa Although oil and gas markets are usually closely related to each other, current conditions have drawn them apart. The current LNG price curve is at the mercy of the weather. While oil is mostly used in Asia to fuel cars, trucks, ships and planes, a lot of LNG is used in power stations and for heating: LNG demand tends to rise during the northern hemisphere’s winter season. With the icy blasts of last winter in mind, and a huge programme under way in China to shift millions of households to using gas for heating instead of coal, traders prepared for this winter by loading up on LNG. But so far this winter real cold snaps have yet to show up, thanks to an El Nino weather pattern gripping North Asia. Hence, the LNG market is sitting on lots of unneeded gas. And system could get even more clogged once demand sinks with the arrival of mild spring weather next year. For a graphic on Japan & South Korea temperature forecast, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RFuxmt Even if the outlook was for a tighter market and forward prices were higher, storing LNG for later sale rarely happens. That’s because unlike oil, which can be stored easily on tankers, keeping LNG on a ship is necessary in Asia and costly - it must be chilled to -160 degrees Celsius (-260 degrees Fahrenheit). What’s more, LNG also gradually evaporates when stored aboard tankers, so cargoes steadily lose value. In Europe, excess LNG is re-gasified and put into vast underground storage facilities. But Asia has far fewer sites for this, forcing traders to keep the current excess LNG on ships - at a princely charter rate of $160,000 a day.

2018-12-07,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - World stocks attempted a rebound on Friday with Asian and European markets gaining modestly after the previous day’s selloff, while oil prices fell as producers bickered over the details of an output cut. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was up 1.2 percent by 0857 GMT, after falling as much as 3.2 percent during Thursday’s rout, which was triggered by the arrest of the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone-maker Huawei in Canada. The arrest, coming on the heels of a 90-day trade truce between the United States and China, triggered fears that the dispute could escalate further and dented hopes for a resolution. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day, on track to end the week down 2 percent. Chinese shares, which were up earlier in the day, slipped into negative territory with the blue chips off 0.1 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 also started firmer but were last down 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.2 percent, though that followed a 1.8 percent drubbing on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.8 percent. Markets also face a test from U.S. payrolls data later in the session amid speculation that the U.S. economy is heading for a tough patch after years of solid growth. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell emphasised the strength of the labour market in remarks made late Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast jobs rose by 200,000 in November after surging 250,000 in October. The data is due at 1330 GMT. “After the G20 Summit, markets have focused on the most recent U.S. yield curve developments,” analysts at Credit Suisse wrote, noting the inversion of the spread between 2-year and 5-year U.S. yields. “Yet we believe that the risks of a downturn are very limited, considering how strong labor markets are in most economies. We therefore think that risk assets should rebound and regard the yield curve developments essentially as a reflection of a more neutral Federal Reserve going forward.” The mood in risk-asset markets brightened a little after the Wall Street Journal reported Fed officials were considering whether to signal a new wait-and-see mentality after a likely rate increase at their meeting in December. That only added to recent feverish speculation that the central bank was almost done hiking rates, given concerns about global growth and the disinflationary impact of collapsing oil prices. Interest rate futures rallied hard in massive volumes with the market now pricing in less than one hike next year. A month ago they had been betting on three increases. The news helped Wall Street pare steep losses and the Dow ended Thursday down 0.32 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15 percent. The Nasdaq managed to advance 0.42 percent. Treasuries extended their blistering rally, driving 10-year yields down to a three-month trough at 2.8260 percent, before last trading at 2.8827 percent. Yields on two-year notes fell a huge 10 basis points at one stage on Thursday and were last at 2.75 percent. Investors also steamrolled the yield curve to its flattest in over a decade, a trend that has historically presaged economic slowdowns and even recessions. “The sort of flattening of the yield curve that we have seen recently usually indicates that investors think the Fed is nearing the end of a tightening cycle, and that rate cuts may even be on the horizon,” argued analysts at Capital Economics. The seismic shock spread far and wide. Yields on 10-year paper sank to the lowest in six months in Germany, almost 12 months in Canada and 16 months in Australia. The sea change in expectations took a toll on the U.S. dollar as bulls had been counting heavily on a steady widening rate differential to propel the currency. The greenback eased against a basket of currencies to 96.823 , and fell to 112.80 yen from a 113.85 high at the start of the week. The euro was flat at $1.13750. The cryptocurrency Bitcoin took a fresh spill to be down almost 18 percent for the week at $3,362.89. In commodity markets, gold firmed to near a five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood 0.1 percent higher at $1,239.49 per ounce. Oil was less favoured, however, falling further as OPEC delayed a decision on output cuts while awaiting support from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia.

2018-12-07,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s Iranian oil imports are set to rebound in December after two state-owned refiners in the world’s largest oil importer began using the nation’s waiver from U.S. sanctions on Iran, according to industry sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon.  Sinopec (600028.SS) resumed Iran oil imports shortly after Tehran’s biggest crude buyer received its waiver in November, while China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC)will restart lifting from its own Iranian production in December, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Reuters reported in November that China’s waiver on U.S. sanctions allows it to buy 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil for 180 days.  Top Chinese energy group CNPC, which has invested billions of dollars in Iranian oilfields, is ready to load its full share of production from December, said an oil executive with direct knowledge of CNPC’s Iran activities.  The executive, who asked not to be named, estimated CNPC will load at least two million barrels a month from December, doubling previous levels to help compensate for cuts made before sanctions on Iran’s oil exports went into effect on Nov 5.      Before the waivers had been announced, Sinopec, Asia’s largest oil refiner, had planned to stop loading Iran oil in November, but resumed imports within days of getting the exemption, a second source said, also asking to remain unnamed.  “We continued lifting Iranian oil in November because we received the waiver,” the second source said.  Sinopec and CNPC will likely use up the 360,000 bpd of Iranian oil imports allowed to China under the waiver.  Another source said Iranian oil is “attractively priced” versus rival supplies from the Middle East.  For November and December, Iranian Heavy crude sold to Asia has been priced at $1.25 a barrel below Saudi’s Arab Medium, a discount not seen since 2004.  The source also said many Chinese refiners were geared toward processing Iranian crude grades.  At 360,000 bpd, China’s purchases would still be 45 percent less than the average 655,000 bpd imported during the January-September period.  GRAPHIC: China's crude oil imports from Iran - tmsnrt.rs/2QhuRLt The rise in Iranian oil supply and surging production from the United States, Russia and OPEC countries has pulled down crude oil prices LCOc1 by almost a third since October.  Ahead of the sanctions being implemented in early November, China’s crude oil imports from Iran fell to 1.05 million tonnes (247,260 bpd) in October, the lowest since May 2010, Chinese customs data shows.  Data from Refinitiv Eikon, however, shows that 2.77 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Chinese ports in October, including into bonded storage tanks in Dalian.     GRAPHIC: Iran crude prices versus Saudi Arabia oil -  tmsnrt.rs/2RG5Bv8 By December, China’s Iran oil imports could reach almost 3 million tonnes, the Eikon data showed. A total 2.51 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Dalian in October and November, according to the data.  Other major Iranian oil buyers, including India, South Korea and Japan, are also increasing or resuming orders.  It is still not clear whether Iran will be able to export much oil after the U.S. sanctions waivers expire around the start of May.

2018-12-07,"* At least 18 GE turbines shutting down worldwide for blade repairs-sources * GE says it found turbine blade problem in 2015 By Alwyn Scott NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Utilities are shutting down at least 18 of General Electric Co’s newest gas turbines for repairs at power plants from Taiwan to France, according to more than a dozen interviews with plant operators and industry experts. The shutdowns, which follow a recent GE turbine blade failure in Texas, come as GE grapples with financial losses and a drop in orders for the massive generators that can supply electricity to hundreds of thousands of homes. GE is setting aside $480 million to repair its 9HA, 7HA and 9FB model turbines as it restructures its power business. The 126-year-old conglomerate has declined to say how many have been shut down, or when it would replace parts - if needed - in as many as 130 such turbines it has produced. Power plant operators in Japan, Taiwan, France and at multiple U.S. sites have shut down - or plan to shut down - at least 18 of the 55 new HA-model turbines that GE has shipped so far, French utility data and interviews with more than 20 industry experts, including executives, plant operators, insurance specialists, engineers and consultants with direct knowledge of GE turbines show. FACTBOX In an interview, GE gas power systems CEO Chuck Nugent played down the significance of turbine shutdowns and the French data, saying that GE turbines are performing “extremely well,” despite the need for “early maintenance” to fix the blades. Considering all of the power turbines it has in use, GE has “the most reliable fleet in the world - 99 percent, give or take, reliability,” he added. GE previously disclosed that its equipment needing blade repairs includes four 7HA turbines in Texas that were shut after oxidation caused a blade to fail in one of them in September. Those turbines are included in the 18 being shut down. Photographs of the damaged turbine reviewed by Reuters show dozens of jagged and broken blades inside the massive machine, owned by Exelon Corp. The turbines are now running after two months of repairs, Exelon said. GE told Reuters it identified the oxidation problem in 2015, and developed a fix before the failure in Texas. The fix uses an earlier casting method that was employed on other turbine models. Three plant operators using GE equipment that are shutting for blade repairs, Invenergy, Exelon and Tennessee Valley Authority, told Reuters GE has been transparent and responsive in installing new blades for free under warranty. “Overall, we’ve been very pleased with GE’s HA technology and its performance capabilities,” said Beth Conley, a spokeswoman at Invenergy, which is receiving replacement blades for three new HA turbines at a Pennsylvania plant that has not yet opened. Following the problems in Texas, state-owned utility Electricite de France closed its plant in the northern French town of Bouchain for a month starting in late September for blade replacements. Bouchain was the first plant worldwide to install GE’s 9HA turbine. Bouchain has logged 86 outages for equipment failure, testing or other reasons from January 2017 to October 2018, five times the average for non-GE plants, according to data from French grid operator RTE analyzed by Reuters. Reuters excluded outages for planned maintenance. The French data also show that plants with GE turbines have closed for repairs or testing, on average, more than twice as often as non-GE gas-fueled plants in France with turbines made by Alstom, Siemens AG and Ansaldo Energia SpA. GE acquired Alstom’s power business in 2015. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2Rs5mU3 GE and EDF officials told Reuters that the data from grid operator RTE, an independent subsidiary of EDF, are “not wrong,” but should not be used to assess turbine performance because some outages might be due to other equipment at the plants. EDF said there are no problems at Bouchain, which opened in 2016, and that frequent shutdowns are not unusual for new plants during their break-in period. EDF said Bouchain’s output is cycled up and down to meet peaks in electricity demand rather than running constantly. The other gas-fired plants tracked by RTE also can be used for peaking and have been in operation for many years. RTE, Siemens AG, Ansaldo Energia SpA and Mitsubishi Hitachi Power Systems declined to comment. Reuters could not obtain comparable data on how often GE’s turbines shut down for repair at utilities around the world. Shutdowns are triggered when utilities determine that a plant needs to be serviced or tested, or when equipment failure or other problems cause the plant to shut down unexpectedly. While GE plants still produce a third of the world’s electricity, GE fell from first to third place in new turbine orders by capacity, behind Mitsubishi and Siemens, according to a first-half tally by McCoy Power Reports, a widely watched industry data source. GE said it booked seven HA turbine orders in the first nine months of this year, half as many as in the same period last year. GE’s HA turbines have come under particular pressure and its plant repair business is facing growing competition. The success of GE’s new turbines are of increasing importance as it slims down to focus on power plants, jet engines and wind turbines in a flurry of restructuring. GE spent more than two decades developing the 400-ton machines, but brought them to market after rivals Siemens and Mitsubishi were gaining market share, forcing GE to catch up. GE undercut its rivals’ prices by about 20 percent “to go from 0 percent to about 45 percent share of this turbine class by 2016,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a report this year. Now Chief Executive Officer Larry Culp is battling to restore GE’s profit and slash debt after the company lost $22.8 billion last quarter, mostly from its power unit, and its credit rating fell to just three notches above junk. Culp is splitting up the power division, consolidating its power headquarters to cut costs and has named new leaders for it. Demand for large gas turbines is at a 23-year low, forcing GE and rivals to fight hard for fewer deals as utilities buy more wind and solar systems that have become cost competitive. Scott Strazik, the new chief executive of GE Gas Power, said in an interview that customers are happy with GE’s response to the blade issue and GE has no plans to change how it handles customer issues, or how it tests turbines, noting GE’s test facility is the largest and most comprehensive in the world. “The HA is the fastest-selling gas turbine that we have, and customers continue to have a strong desire for the HA,” Strazik said.

2018-12-07,"NEW DELHI, Dec 7 (Reuters) - State-run Indian oil refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp will buy Iranian crude in January after a gap of six months, with the nation’s overall purchases from Tehran at 9 million barrels in the month, four industry sources said. The United States in early November granted India a six-month waiver from sanctions against Iran’s oil exports. Under the agreement, New Delhi must restrict its Iran oil purchases to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels. As part of the deal, HPCL will lift 1 million barrels of Iranian crude oil in January, one source with knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named due to the political sensitivity of Iran sanctions. It was unclear whether HPCL would continue to buy Iranian oil on a regular basis during the waiver period. HPCL had halted Iranian oil purchases in July after its insurance company refused to provide coverage for the crude because of U.S. sanctions, although its chairman said last month that HPCL may resume buying Iranian oil under sanctions waivers. Indian Oil Corp, the country’s top refiner, will lift 5 million barrels of Iranian oil in January compared to 6 million this month, while Mangalore Petrochemicals Ltd will buy 3 million barrels, another source said, also asking not to be identified. An IOC official had previously said his firm would lift 180,000 bpd - the full volume contracted under an annual deal with Iran for this fiscal year ending March 31, 2019. Some of India’s oil imports from Iran will be paid for in rupee under a payment mechanism with Indian state-owned UCO Bank HPCL, IOC and MRPL did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2018-12-07,"* OPEC agrees supply cut but wants support from Russia * Oil supply has surged, pulling down crude by 30 pct since Oct * OPEC, Russia & U.S. oil production: tmsnrt.rs/2QczFSp By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices stabilised on Friday, buoyed by a fall in U.S. crude oil inventories, but sentiment remained weak as producer group OPEC postponed a final decision on output cuts, awaiting support from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.61 per barrel at 0037 GMT, 12 cents above their last close. WTI was supported by drop in U.S. commercial crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA, which fell by 7.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 30, to 443.16 million barrels International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. The stabilising prices came after crude slumped by almost 3 percent the previous day, with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ending a meeting at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, on Thursday without announcing a decision to cut crude supply, instead preparing to debate the matter on Friday. Analysts still expect some form of supply reduction to be decided. “We are beginning to witness the outline of the next iteration of production cuts, with OPEC conforming to cut its own production by around 1 million barrels per day, with the cartel lobbying non-OPEC members to contribute more,” Japan’s MUFG bank said in a note. Oil producers have been hit by a 30-percent plunge in crude prices since October as supply surges just as the demand outlook weakens amid a global economic slowdown. Oil output from the world’s biggest producers - OPEC, Russia and the United States - has increased by 3.3 million bpd since the end of 2017, to 56.38 million bpd, meeting almost 60 percent of global consumption.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan nudged up 0.l3 percent, though that followed a 1.8 percent drubbing on Thursday. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.9 percent and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent. Concerns over Sino-U.S. relations remain heightened after the arrest of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, which threatened to chill talks on some form of trade truce. Markets also face a test from U.S. payrolls data later in the session amid speculation the economy was heading for a tough patch after years of solid growth. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasised the strength of the labour market in remarks made late Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters forecast jobs rose by 200,000 in November after surging 250,000 in October. “A view has developed of U.S. growth normalising a little faster than expected from the fiscal ‘sugar rush’, while inflationary pressures remain contained given the sharp fall in the oil price,” said National Australia Bank economist Tapa Strickland. “Payrolls will be very important in helping to validate whether the economy is indeed slowing faster than expected.” The mood brightened a little after the Wall Street Journal reported Fed officials are considering whether to signal a new wait-and-see mentality after a likely rate increase at their meeting in December. That only added to recent feverish speculation the central bank was almost done on hiking rates given concerns on global growth and the disinflationary impact of collapsing oil prices. Interest rate futures rallied hard in massive volumes with the market now pricing in less than one hike next year. A month ago they had been wagering on three increases. The news helped Wall Street pare early steep losses and the Dow ended 0.32 percent lower, while the S&P 500 lost 0.15 percent. The Nasdaq even added 0.42 percent. Treasuries extended their blistering rally, driving 10-year yields down to a three-month trough at 2.8260 percent, before last trading at 2.8973 percent. Yields on two-year notes fell a huge 10 basis points at one stage on Thursday and were last at 2.77 percent. Investors also steamrolled the yield curve to its flattest in over a decade, a trend that has historically presaged economic slowdowns and even recessions. “The sort of flattening of the yield curve that we have seen recently usually indicates that investors think the Fed is nearing the end of a tightening cycle, and that rate cuts may even be on the horizon,” argued analysts at Capital Economics. The seismic shock spread far and wide. Yields on 10-year paper sank to the lowest in six months in Germany, almost 12 months in Canada and 16 months in Australia. The sea change in expectations took a toll on the U.S. dollar as bulls had been counting heavily on a steady widening rate differential to propel the currency. The greenback eased against a basket of currencies to 96.779 , and fell to 112.69 yen from a 113.85 high at the start of the week. The euro was up around 0.5 percent on the week so far at  $1.1376. Cyber currency Bitcoin took another spill, sliding more than 6 percent to $3,446.17. In commodity markets, gold firmed to near a five-month peak as the dollar eased and the threat of higher interest rates waned. Spot gold stood at $1,237.61 per ounce. Oil was less favoured, however, falling nearly 3 percent on Thursday after OPEC and its allies ended a meeting without announcing a decision to cut crude output. OPEC had tentatively agreed to cut output but was waiting for a commitment from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding volumes. Brent futures had ended with a loss of $1.21 at $60.67 a barrel. U.S. crude edged up 6 cents in early trade Friday to $51.55, having lost $1.31 overnight.

2018-12-07,"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to spend $20 billion next year on oil and natural gas projects, the second-largest U.S. oil producer said on Thursday in a statement, its first increase in four years. Its 2019 capital spending budget is at the high end of an $18 billion to $20 billion per-year range that Chevron executives set earlier this year as the annual target through 2020. The company has said it expects to spend $19.8 billion this year.  San Ramon, California-based Chevron and other energy companies have pledged to restrain spending after the oil-price collapse earlier this decade forced many to borrow to cover their costs of expensive and long-term projects.   “Operating cash flow is strong, so it should be able to cover spending along with the dividend,” said Brian Youngberg, an oil and gas analyst with investment firm Edward Jones. Among the highlights of its budget, Chevron plans to spend more on shale production next year and more on investments in refining and chemicals, according to its spending projection.  It plans to spend $3.6 billion in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico and $1.6 billion for other shale regions, or $5.2 billion in total, up from $4.3 billion on such investments this year.  Two-thirds of the 2019 budget will go toward projects that “realize cash flow within two years,” Chief Executive Michael  Wirth said in a statement. Chevron also said it would spend $4.3 billion on the giant Tengiz field in Kazakhstan, up from the $3.7 billion budgeted this year. About $2.5 billion of planned spending will go towards its  business that refines, transports and markets fuels and petrochemicals, up $300 million from the amount it projected to spend this year. Most oil producers have yet to disclose their 2019 budgets, which generally are released in December and January.  Chevron shares were off $1.33 on Thursday, to $115.91 per share and are down 7.4 percent year to date.
