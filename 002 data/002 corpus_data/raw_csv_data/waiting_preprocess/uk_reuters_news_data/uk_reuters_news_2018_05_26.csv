2018-05-26,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler (DAIGn.DE) faces an investigation of 40,000 diesel Vito vans and 80,000 C-Class model cars for possible illicit software that allowed the vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection, Bild am Sonntag reported, citing no sources. Daimler has submitted a software update for the engines for regulatory approval, the German weekly paper said on Sunday. The report comes after German motor authority KBA this week ordered Daimler to recall around 6,300 Vito vans fitted with 1.6 liter diesel Euro-6 engines globally because of engine control features to reduce exhaust emissions which KBA said breached regulations. The carmaker reiterated it was cooperating fully with KBA but would appeal against the Vito recall decision and fight it in court, if necessary. German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has summoned Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche to a meeting at the ministry scheduled for Monday to discuss the Vito recall. Daily Bild reported on Friday that Daimler also faces a recall order for more than 600,000 diesel-engine vehicles including C-Class and G-Class models. Since rival Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating U.S. emissions tests, German carmakers including VW, Daimler and BMW (BMWG.DE) have faced a backlash against diesel technology in which they have invested billions of euros.

2018-05-26,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A truckers protest over diesel prices in Brazil that is hurting supplies of fuel, food and medicines continued for the sixth day on Saturday despite President Michel Temer ordering the military to clear blocked roads the day before.  Major cities have declared a state of emergency as gas stations and airports ran out of fuel, supermarket shelves went bare and hospitals said they were running out of supplies. Public transport and trash collection were reduced or halted across the country and prices for some food items jumped.  The government said there were fewer blockades on major highways across the country on Saturday compared to Friday. However, the main entity representing truckers, ABCAM, said they have not changed their main argument that they will call off protests only when federal taxes over diesel are scrapped. Later on Saturday, federal forces and police appeared to be gaining an edge on clearing some roads. They were escorting convoys with fuel and other products in some areas in the country, including the airport in the capital Brasilia.    Negotiators for several trucker groups initially agreed on Thursday to suspend the protests as the government promised to subsidise and stabilise diesel prices, which may cost 5 billion reais ($1.4 billion) this year. But truckers say they want a definitive solution, that they will end the protest only when a decision to eliminate federal diesel taxes is published in the official gazette. Local TV showed footage overnight of federal forces being deployed to some critical areas to help police remove trucks from highways. There were no reports of violence, but main roads remained blocked in the morning. Some business sectors that depend on daily supplies were suffering.  Lack of animal feed may cause the deaths of one billion birds and 20 million hogs, Brazilian meat group ABPA said, adding that more than 150 poultry and pork processing plants had indefinitely suspended production. Brazil’s sugar industry, the world’s largest, is slowly halting cane harvest operations as machines ran out of fuel. Blockades continue to prevent trucks from entering the port of Santos, Latin America’s largest, and oilseeds crushing group Abiove said soy exports would halt on Saturday if truckers did not allow access to major ports. Auto production, which contributes about a quarter of Brazil’s industrial output, ground to a halt on Friday.

2018-05-26," (This May 25 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraphs 1 and 4 to OPEC discussions being triggered by Trump’s tweet) By Katya Golubkova, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Rania El Gamal ST PETERSBURG/DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia are discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production by some 1 million barrels a day, sources said, weeks after U.S. President Donald Trump complained about artificially high prices.  Riyadh and Moscow are prepared to ease output cuts to calm consumer worries about supply adequacy, their energy ministers said on Friday, with Saudi Arabia’s Khalid al-Falih adding that any such move would be gradual so as not to shock the market. Raising production would ease 17 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far, with oil having hit its highest since late 2014 at $80.50 a barrel this month. Trump tweeted last month that OPEC had “artificially” boosted oil prices. “We were in the meeting in Jeddah, when we read the tweet,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said, referring to a meeting in Saudi Arabia on April 20. “I think I was prodded by his excellency Khalid Al-Falih that probably there was a need for us to respond. We in OPEC always pride ourselves as friends of the United States,” Barkindo told a panel with the Saudi and Russian energy ministers in St. Petersburg at Russia’s main economic forum. OPEC officials said by “the need to respond” Barkindo was referring to a tweet he sent the same day, rather than the need to act.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia have agreed to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) through 2018 to reduce global stocks, but the inventory overhang is now near OPEC’s target. In April, pact participants cut production by 52 percent more than required, with falling output from crisis-hit Venezuela helping OPEC deliver a bigger reduction than intended. Sources familiar with the matter said an increase of about 1 million bpd would lower compliance to 100 percent of the agreed level. Barkindo also said it was not unusual for the United States to put pressure on OPEC as some U.S. energy secretaries had asked the producer group to help lower prices in the past. Oil prices fell more than 2 percent towards $77 a barrel on Friday as Saudi Arabia and Russia said they were ready to ease supply curbs. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said current cuts were in reality 2.7 million bpd due to a drop in Venezuelan production - somewhere around 1 million bpd higher than the initially agreed reductions. Novak declined to say, however, whether OPEC and Russia would decide to boost output by 1 million bpd at their next meeting in June. “The moment is coming when we should consider assessing ways to exit the deal very seriously and gradually ease quotas on output cuts,” Novak said in televised comments. Initial talks are being led by the energy ministers of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia at St. Petersburg this week along with their counterpart from the United Arab Emirates, which holds the OPEC presidency this year, the sources said. OPEC and non-OPEC ministers meet in Vienna on June 22-23, and the final decision will be taken there. Current discussions are aimed at relaxing record-high compliance with the production cuts, the sources said, in an effort to cool the market after oil hit $80 a barrel on concerns over a supply shortage. China has also raised concerns about whether enough oil is being pumped, according to a Saudi statement issued after Energy Minister Falih called China’s energy chief on Friday to discuss cooperation between their countries and to review the oil market. Nur Bekri, administrator of China’s National Energy Administration, told Falih he hopes Saudi Arabia “can take further substantial actions to guarantee adequate supply” in the crude oil market, the Saudi Energy Ministry statement said.     While Russia and OPEC benefit from higher oil prices, up almost 20 percent since the end of last year, their voluntary output cuts have opened the door to other producers, such as the U.S. shale sector, to ramp up production and gain market share. The final production number is not set yet as dividing up the extra barrels among deal participants could be tricky, the sources said. “The talks now are to bring compliance down to the 100 percent level, more for OPEC rather than for non-OPEC,” one source said. OPEC may decide to raise oil output as soon as June due to worries over Iranian and Venezuelan supply and after Washington raised concerns the oil rally was going too far, OPEC and oil industry sources told Reuters on Tuesday. However, it is unclear which countries have the capacity to raise output and fill any supply gap other than Gulf oil producers, led by Saudi Arabia, and Russia, the sources said. “Only a few members have the capability to increase production, so implementation will be complicated,” one OPEC source said. So far, OPEC had said it saw no need to ease output restrictions despite concerns among consuming nations that the price rally could undermine demand. The rapid decline in oil inventories and worries about supplies after the U.S. decision to withdraw from the international nuclear deal with Iran, as well as Venezuela’s collapsing output, were behind the change in OPEC’s thinking.

2018-05-26,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian state gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) said on Saturday it had signed a protocol with the Turkish government on a planned gas pipeline and agreed with Turkish firm Botas to end an arbitration dispute over the terms of gas supplies. The protocol concerned the land-based part of the transit leg of the TurkStream gas pipeline, which Gazprom said meant that work to implement it could now begin. Turkey had delayed issuing a permit for the Russian company to start building the land-based parts of the pipeline which, if completed, would allow Moscow to reduce its reliance on Ukraine as a transit route for its gas supplies to Europe. A source said in February the permit problem might be related to talks between Gazprom and Botas about a possible discount for Russian gas. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said earlier on Saturday Turkey and Russia had reached a retroactive agreement for a 10.25 percent discount on the natural gas Ankara buys from Moscow. Gazprom said in the Saturday statement, without elaborating, that the dispute with Botas would be settled out of court.

2018-05-26,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A return to the oil production levels that were in place in October 2016, baseline for the current deal to cut output, is one of the options for easing curbs, Russia’s energy minister said on Saturday. Sources said this week that Saudi Arabia and Russia were discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil production to ease 17 months of strict supply curbs amid concerns that a price rally has gone too far. “When we extended the agreement until the end of 2018, we spoke about such possibilities (of returning to the October 2016 level),” Novak told reporters. “But a decision will be made in June,” he added, referring to meetings of OPEC and non-OPEC countries in Vienna on June 22-23. The existing deal came into force on January 1, 2017, and envisaged global oil producers reducing their combined output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) to cut bloated stockpiles and prop up oil prices. Russia’s oil output reached a 30-year high of 11.247 million bpd in October 2016 and it pledged to cut it by 300,000 bpd to 10.947 mln. In March and in April this year it failed to fully comply with the deal, pumping at the pace of 10.97 million bpd, a 11-month high.    Oil prices have risen to $80 per barrel, levels unseen since late 2014. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that the price of $60 “suits Russia”.     Novak was also quoted as saying on Saturday he expected Iran to reduce its output by no more than 10 percent as a result of the move by the United States to withdraw from a nuclear deal and reinstate sanctions against Tehran. “I think the output reduction will not be as significant as many expect,” RIA news agency quoted Novak as saying when asked if he agreed with an estimate that the sanctions could remove as much as 800,000 barrels a day from the market. “Some 10 percent is probably the maximum level,” he said. Novak also estimated that the “geopolitical risk” premium to the oil price was around $5-$7 per barrel.

2018-05-26,"DUBAI, May 26 (Reuters) - The start-up of the Arab world’s first nuclear reactor - in the United Arab Emirates - has been delayed and should start operations between the end of 2019 and early 2020, the plant’s operator said on Saturday. Nawah Energy Company, the operator of the Barakah Nuclear Energy Plant in the Al-Dhafra Region of Abu Dhabi, said it “has completed a comprehensive operational readiness review” for an updated start-up schedule for the reactor. The $24.4 billion Barakah power plant is the world’s largest nuclear project under construction and will be the first in the Arab world. “The results of Nawah’s review forecast that the loading of nuclear fuel assemblies required to commence nuclear operations at Barakah Unit 1 will occur between the end of 2019 and early 2020,” it said in a statement. Reuters reported in March that the start-up had been pushed back to 2019 due to training delays. “The resulting projection for the start-up of Unit 1 operations reflects the time required for the plant’s nuclear operators to complete operational readiness activities and to obtain necessary regulatory approvals,” Nawah said. The first of four reactors being built by Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) in the UAE is part of the Barakah power plant project that was originally scheduled to open last year. Barakah One is a joint venture between Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) and KEPCO. The UAE will be the first new country to acquire nuclear power in more than two decades. Bangladesh, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are preparing to follow suit and the World Nuclear Association estimates that nuclear power is planned in over 20 countries which do not currently have it.

The three missing were Asian nationals, state news agency ONA reported. Mekunu started to weaken to a tropical storm in Oman and authorities began clearing operations on Saturday after the heavy rain but warned residents to stay in their homes, with run-off from river valleys flooding most main roads in Dhofar. The cyclone also killed at least seven people in the Yemeni island of Socotra, a Yemeni official said on Saturday. At least 40 people were missing. Yemen declared a state of emergency on Thursday for Socotra, which lies between southern Yemen and the Horn of Africa and is renowned for its unique animal and plant life. Largely untouched by Yemen’s three-year-old war, it is under the control of the internationally recognized government whose president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, is in exile in Saudi Arabia. The storm flooded Socotra’s villages and capsized boats, leaving much of the island without access to communications. Authorities in Oman have said they expected the cyclone to pass over the city of Salalah on Friday night.

2018-05-26,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese fighter pilots have carried out night landings on the country’s first aircraft carrier, the official China Daily reported on Saturday, the latest demonstration of military muscle as Beijing’s pushes to modernise its armed forces. Pilots flying J-15 jets landed at night on the Liaoning, the official paper said, citing a video posted by China’s navy. It said this was a complex manoeuvre that marked a “huge leap towards gaining full combat capability”. China has ambitious plans to overhaul its armed forces as it ramps up its presence in the disputed South China Sea and around self-ruled Taiwan, an island China considers its own. The official newspaper of the People’s Liberation army also said on Saturday that Chinese fighter jets had recently carried out live-fire drills in the South China Sea. China has been ramping up naval military exercises amid growing tensions with Taiwan. Last month, President Xi Jinping presided over the navy’s largest-ever military display, with 76 fighter jets and a flotilla of 48 warships and submarines. China’s first domestically developed aircraft carrier set off on sea trials earlier this month. The older Liaoning, which is expected to serve more as a training vessel, was bought second-hand from Ukraine in 1998. Its navy has also been taking an increasingly prominent role in recent months, with the Liaoning sailing around Taiwan and new Chinese warships popping up in far-flung places. State media has quoted experts as saying China needs at least six carriers. The United States operates 10 and plans to build two more. Many experts agree that developing such a force would be a decades-long endeavour but that the drive to bolster its forces at sea will be crucial in the longer term as China looks to erode U.S. military prominence in the region.

2018-05-26,"(Adds dropped letter to word in first paragraph) By Tom Polansek and Michael Hirtzer CHICAGO, May 25 (Reuters) - The biggest U.S. biodiesel lobbying group has dropped its nine-year push to convert a $1-per-gallon tax credit available to blenders of the biofuel into one for producers, the vice president of federal affairs said on Friday. The tax credit benefits companies that blend biodiesel into gasoline sold at U.S. gas stations. It first went into effect as part the American Jobs Creation Act from 2005 to 2009 and has often been renewed retroactively in the years since. The National Biodiesel Board previously sought to change the credit to benefit biodiesel producers it represents, saying the credit was intended to support the domestic industry. By contrast, some blenders who benefited from the credit were also importing millions of gallons of foreign biodiesel. But import duties imposed by the U.S. Commerce Department have nearly stopped biodiesel imports from Indonesia and Argentina that were being sold below fair-market value, Kurt Kovarik, the board’s vice president of federal affairs, told Congressional staff members this week in an email that was obtained by Reuters. “The change recognizes the success of the trade case in preventing imports of illegally dumped and subsidized biodiesel,” he said. The board also wants Congress to extend the blender’s tax credit over a long period of time, Kovarik said. The National Biodiesel Board had pushed this year for the credit to be installed retroactively to 2017 and extended through 2018, but U.S. lawmakers as part of a budget deal in February only approved the credit for 2017. Scott Irwin, agriculture economist at the University of Illinois, said the group is recognizing it will probably fail to convince Congress to adjust the credit to apply to biodiesel producers instead of blenders. “The political environment for getting the tax credit extended is getting more difficult,” he said. “They are putting all their eggs on the extension of the credit rather than a conversion.” (Reporting by Tom Polansek and Michael Hirtzer; Additional reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in New York; editing by Grant McCool)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biodiesel-credit/refile-u-s-biodiesel-lobby-drops-effort-to-adjust-1-per-gallon-tax-credit-idUKL2N1SW242,26 May 2018,"The biggest U.S. biodiesel
