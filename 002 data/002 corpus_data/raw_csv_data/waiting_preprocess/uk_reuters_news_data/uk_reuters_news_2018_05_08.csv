2018-05-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude oil prices ended down about 2.0 percent on Tuesday, but off the lows for the day, after President Donald Trump confirmed the U.S. will withdraw from the deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program.    Brent crude oil futures briefly turned positive after Trump said the U.S. will withdraw from a 2015 international agreement designed to deny Tehran the ability to build nuclear weapons and said the U.S. will institute the “highest level” of sanctions on Iran. Iran produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) and the country is the third-biggest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Its production accounts for about 4.0 percent of the world’s oil supplies.  “As an energy investor, Trump announced everything that one could possibly have wanted him to say,” said Eric Nuttall, partner and senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners in Toronto. “It gives one confidence that there could be a reduction in the physical movement of barrels and this also puts at stake the medium and long-term growth ambitions of Iran to grow their production and capacity.” Oil prices had been supported over the past month by expectations that Trump would pull out of the deal, which could hit Iranian crude exports and feed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to a third of the world’s daily oil supply. Since the exemption from sanctions came into effect, Iran’s crude oil exports have risen to about 2.5 million bpd from less than one million bpd. Goldman Sachs said in a note that it was unclear if a million bpd in exports would be at risk as it was from 2012 to 2015. A majority of Iran’s exports currently go to Asia, with Europe receiving about 600,000 bpd.  Earlier in the session, prices plunged as media reports rattled markets with doubts about whether Trump would withdraw Washington from the deal as most had expected.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled 1.7 percent lower at $74.85 a barrel while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 ended the session 2.4 percent lower at $69.06 per barrel.   Prices rallied post settlement after data from the American Petroleum Institute showed crude inventories fell by 1.9 million barrels in the week to May 4, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 719,000 barrels. [API/S] Official data from the U.S. Energy Department’s Energy Information will be released at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) on Wednesday. [EIA/S] Trading volumes in both contracts rose, with about 1.2 million front-month WTI contracts changing hands, its busiest trading day since the OPEC agreement to cut output was struck on Nov. 30, 2016. More than 507,000 lots of front-month Brent crude futures changed hands, the highest since early February.  During the session, prices fell as much as 4.0 percent, with U.S. crude hitting a session low of $67.63 a barrel and Brent touched $73.10 a barrel.  “Trump’s announcement had been baked into the cake in recent days, hence we saw prices selling off today given the air of certainty surrounding it,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.  “That said, the tough stance taken has helped prices pare losses into the close.” Under the deal to limit Iran’s nuclear program, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the United States agreed to ease a series of sanctions on Iran and has done so under a string of “waivers” that effectively suspend them. Market participants said oil was also pressured by strength in the U.S. dollar, which advanced to its highest level of 2018 against a basket of currencies .DXY on safe-haven buying.  “If the dollar continues to rally from here, regardless of what Trump does with this Iran deal, any gains (for oil) are going to be short-lived as the greatest risk here is the risk of the dollar,” said Brian LaRose, technical analyst at United-ICAP.

2018-05-08,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar company SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Tuesday on higher demand for solar panels in its U.S. residential and commercial business. But shares fell 3.0 percent in extended trade when the company said U.S. tariffs on solar imports would reduce a key earnings metric by $55 million this year. SunPower is refocusing its business on so-called distributed generation (DG), or projects that generate power on-site for homes and businesses. That market is expected to increase about 40 percent over the next five years, SunPower said, compared with flat growth for power plants. SunPower’s high-efficiency, premium panels are well-suited to the DG market, the company said, because they can generate more power in smaller spaces than rival products. The San Jose, California-based company makes its solar products primarily in the Philippines and Mexico, and opposed the Trump administration’s 30 percent tariffs on imported panels. Last month, the company said it would buy U.S. panel maker SolarWorld Americas, expanding its domestic manufacturing to stem the impact of the tariffs. On Tuesday, SunPower Chief Executive Tom Werner declined to disclose the purchase price, but said it was not material to the company’s financials. SunPower will be able to expand upon the 280 jobs at SolarWorld’s Hillsboro, Oregon factory if it receives a tariff exemption on some of its solar products, Werner said in an interview. It requested an exclusion from the U.S. Trade Representative, which has not yet made a decision. “There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” Werner said. “There is virtually no way SunPower can expand that facility and pay tariffs.” SunPower said it expects a net loss of $100 million to $125 million in the second quarter. It also forecast 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization to be between $75 million and $125 million, including an estimated $55 million impact from the tariffs. SunPower’s net loss attributable to shareholders narrowed to $115.97 million, or 83 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 1, from a loss of $219.73 million, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company lost 20 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting the company to report a loss of 32 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. SunPower is majority owned by French energy giant Total SA (TOTF.PA). Shares slid to $8.18 in extended trade after closing at $8.47 on the Nasdaq.

2018-05-08,"NOUAKCHOTT (Reuters) - An al Qaeda affiliate threatened attacks on Western companies’ operations across North and West Africa on Tuesday, calling them “legitimate targets” and urging Muslims to boycott them.  Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) has launched raids on installations in the past, in particular in Algeria where it carried out a major assault on a gas plant in 2013 that killed dozens of workers. Its fighters have also carried out high-profile attacks on hotels frequented by foreigners in Mali, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast. “This statement calls to boycott all Western companies and foundations ... that operate in the Islamic Maghreb ...  and the countries of the Sahel, and gives a warning to them that they are legitimate target for the mujahideen,” it said. The statement, which was circulated on social media and translated by the extremism watchdog SITE, singled out France - the former colonial power in much of North and West Africa - and its allies in the region. “We have decided to strike that which prolongs the continuity of these agent governments and enables the French occupier to provide a lavish life and prosperity to its people,” it said. The region has witnessed a rise in Islamist militancy since an uprising in Libya toppled longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, sparking chaos during which armed factions looted government weapons stocks. France led a military intervention in Mali in 2013 to drive back Islamist groups that had seized the country’s desert north a year earlier. Paris still has thousands of troops deployed in West Africa’s arid Sahel region as part of an operation to stamp out militant groups, and the United States is also ramping up its presence in the region.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK/SEOUL/TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Iran’s exports of oil to China, Europe and other countries will decline later this year and into 2019 if the United States can enforce President Donald Trump’s decision to reimpose the “highest level” of economic sanctions targeting oil trade with Iran. Refining company sources said Asia’s petroleum refiners have shifted purchases to other exporters in preparation for the renewal of U.S. sanctions against OPEC member Iran, which currently exports about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, with China, India and other Asian nations the primary customers. Trump on Tuesday announced the withdrawal from the Iran deal, which was struck between major world powers and the Middle Eastern nation in 2015, and the renewal of sanctions to the “highest level” on Tehran. “We’re expecting it to dissuade some buyers from purchasing Iranian crude,” said Bob McNally, president of consultancy Rapidan Energy Group in Washington. The deal had limited Iran’s nuclear ambitions in exchange for removing joint U.S.-Europe sanctions against the Middle Eastern country. Iran now produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), accounting for about 4 percent of world supply. Any decline in shipments would not be immediate, as sanctions would not come into effect for 180 days. U.S. allies in Europe on Tuesday said they were looking to find ways to preserve what was left of the agreement. European and Asian importers may, however, soon find themselves faced with the choice of doing business with the United States or Iran. “We think everyone is going to scramble to call the White House and get an exemption,” McNally said. The trajectory of sales could match what happened after tough Western sanctions were put in place in early 2012. Then, Iran’s foreign sales fell to just over 1 million bpd, with the majority coming from four buyers - China, India, Japan and South Korea. Currently, the biggest buyer of Iran’s crude is China, whose imports peaked at about 900,000 bpd in mid-2016 but have dropped to around 600,000 bpd in 2018, according to Thomson Reuters ship tracking data. Chinese refiners said Iran currently had a relatively small share in its supplies, and alternatives would be easy to find in Russia, Saudi Arabia, West Africa and the United States. International oil prices hit their highest since late 2014 this week on worries that revived sanctions would tighten global supplies. Moody’s Analytics said sanctions would reduce Iranian production by about 400,000 bpd. The United States may struggle to enforce sanctions against Iran to the same level as earlier in the decade. Then, the European Union’s support for the United States’ measures made it difficult for refiners to transport and purchase crude. This time, European countries do not support U.S. policy. The governments of France, Germany and the United Kingdom all said on Tuesday they wanted to stick to the deal and urged the U.S. not to obstruct that. “What made the multi-lateral sanctions enforced during the Obama era so effective was precisely the fact that they were multi-lateral, whereas President Trump’s sanctions are not,” wrote Chris Lafakis, Moody’s chief economist. Some refiners in Japan and South Korea said they had already taken measures to prepare for potential new curbs on Iranian supplies by shifting to alternatives. A source with a Korean petrochemical company said that the main problem for Korean importers was finding equivalent oil specifications for Iran’s supplies. Refiners are designed to use specific qualities of crude, and Korean facilities are geared for Iranian condensate, a super-light form of crude. While there are alternatives, including from the United States or Qatar, specifications and prices vary. “We can source from Qatar, depending on price,” the source said. “In the case of U.S. light crude, it’s not that economical to use at the moment and doesn’t fit well with Korean facilities.” During the last round of sanctions, India enjoyed waivers that allowed it to continue to import limited amounts of Iranian oil under certain fiscal restraints, including paying Iran in India’s rupee instead of the U.S. dollar. “The impact (of potential new sanctions) in India will be there, but not so high,” said R Ramachandran, head of refineries at Bharat Petroleum Corp, a major state-owned oil firm. Iran is the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The top producer in the group, Saudi Arabia, would work with other OPEC and non-OPEC producers to lessen the impact of any shortage in oil supplies, a Saudi energy official said on Wednesday. Inventories in major developed nations have fallen sharply in the last year-and-a-half to 2.85 billion barrels, slightly above their five-year average, after OPEC and non-OPEC producers such as Russia cut supply at the beginning of 2017 to end a global glut. Now, some market participants say the market could tighten dramatically after years of oversupply. “I think we’re going to $80 next year for (U.S. oil),” said Eric Nuttall, partner and senior portfolio manager at Ninepoint Partners in Toronto. “We see inventories reaching a 10-year low by the end of this year.” Reporting by Jessica Resnick Ault and Stephanie Kelly in NEW

2018-05-08,"(Adds details, background) By Rania El Gamal DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia indicated on Wednesday that it could raise its oil output to offset any potential supply shortage as a result of new sanctions on Tehran, after U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington was withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal. Oil prices had been supported by expectations that Trump would pull out of the deal, which could hit Iranian crude exports and feed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to one-third of the world’s daily oil supply. Trump said on Tuesday that the United States was reimposing the “highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran, but he did not provide details. The original 2015 agreement had lifted sanctions in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program. Saudi Arabia “will work with major producers and consumers within and outside OPEC to limit the impact of any supply shortages,” a Saudi energy ministry official said on Wednesday, according to state news agency SPA. “Following the U.S. decision to withdraw from the nuclear agreement with Iran, Saudi Arabia is committed to supporting the stability of oil markets for the benefit of producers and consumers and the sustainability of the global economic growth,” the official said. U.S. crude settled down $1.67 at $69.06 per barrel and Brent settled down $1.32 at $74.85. It was the busiest day in U.S. front-month contracts since August, and for Brent the busiest in almost a month. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is in the midst of an oil supply-cutting deal with non-OPEC producers such as Russia that has helped erase a global glut and boosted oil prices above $75, the highest since 2014. OPEC meets next in June, where it is widely expected to continue with the supply cuts until the end of 2018. But a drop in Iranian exports due to a return of U.S. sanctions, plus involuntary supply losses in other OPEC members such as Venezuela, would mean the supply cut would be significantly larger than intended. That raised worries of a quick rise in oil prices. Iran produces about 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd) and the country is OPEC’s third-biggest producer, behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Its production accounts for about 4 percent of the world’s oil supplies. Since the Iran nuclear deal went into effect, its exports have risen to about 2.5 million bpd, from less than 1 million bpd. A majority goes to Asia, with Europe receiving about 600,000 bpd. Last month, Trump accused OPEC in a tweet of “artificially” boosting oil prices.

2018-05-08,"May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the 2015 accord. Some sanctions take effect after a 90-day “wind-down” period ending on Aug. 6, and the rest, most notably on the petroleum sector, after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4. Both deadlines are meant to give firms and other entities time in which to conclude trade and other business activities with or in Iran, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday. THE 90-DAY “WIND-DOWN PERIOD” SANCTIONS The United States will reimpose sanctions on the purchase or acquisition of U.S. dollars by the Iranian government, Iran’s trade in gold and precious metals, and on the direct and indirect sale, supply and transfer to or from Iran of graphite, raw or semi-finished metals, coal and industrial-related software. When the 90-day period expires, sanctions also will be reapplied to the importation into the United States of carpets and foodstuffs made in Iran, and on certain related financial transactions. THE 180-DAY ‘WIND-DOWN PERIOD’ SANCTIONS On Nov. 4, sanctions will be reinstated on Iran’s energy sector and on the provision of insurance or underwriting services. They also will be reapplied to petroleum-related transactions, including purchases of Iranian oil, petroleum products or petrochemical products, with the government-owned National Iranian Oil Company and other firms, and on Iran’s shipping and shipbuilding sectors. Foreign financial institutions will face sanctions for transactions with the Central Bank of Iran or other Iranian financial institutions designated under legislation passed by Congress in 2012. With the expiration of the 180-day period, the United States will reimpose sanctions “as appropriate” on individuals who were on U.S. blacklists on Jan. 16, 2016, the date when most sanctions on Iran were suspended under the nuclear deal.

2018-05-08,"WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday he does not anticipate major oil price hikes after renewed sanctions hit Iranian production because some countries are willing to increase output to offset such losses. Mnuchin, speaking to reporters at a news briefing, declined to identify countries which may add output, saying there had been conversations with “different parties that would be willing to increase oil supply to offset this. So my expectation is not that oil prices will go higher - to a certain extent, some of this was already in the market on oil prices.” Mnuchin said that licenses for Boeing Co and Airbus to sell aircraft and components to Iran will be revoked as a result of the reimposed sanctions on Tehran. “Under the original deal, there were waivers for commercial aircraft, parts and services and the existing licenses will be revoked,” Mnuchin said.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told a group of senators on Tuesday he is considering allowing exported ethanol to count toward the volumes mandated under the nation’s biofuels law, a move intended to appease both Big Oil and Big Corn by cutting the refiners’ regulatory costs while preserving demand for corn. According to two sources briefed on Trump’s meeting with the Republican senators, Trump also reiterated his support for expanding sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, and backed away from a proposal to cap the price of credits called RINs that refiners must acquire and turn into the government each year to prove compliance with the biofuels quotas. The proposed changes follow months of fractious negotiations between Big Corn and Big Oil over the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) that requires biofuels to be added to gasoline and diesel, after refiners increasingly complained the regulation was costing them a fortune. The ethanol industry criticized the export plan. “Offering RIN credits, which are supposed to be derived from a domestic renewable fuel use, for ethanol exports would threaten trade markets and impact corn farmers’ economic livelihoods,” said Kevin Skunes, president of the National Corn Growers Association. Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who attended the meeting, declared the plan a victory for both the refining industry and for corn growers. “More corn will be sold (good for farmers), plus lower RINs (saves blue-collar refinery jobs), plus more ethanol exports (good for America),” Cruz wrote on Twitter. Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who also attended the meeting, applauded the move to expand the use of higher ethanol blends of gasoline but expressed caution over the export plan. “Devil in details,” he wrote. Republicans Joni Ernst of Iowa and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania also attended the meeting. Sources said the export plan emerged from discussions on Tuesday about the Trump administration’s expanded use of hardship waivers that free small refineries from their obligations under the RFS. Industry experts say the waivers provided by Trump’s EPA have taken a big chunk out the 15 billion ethanol credit market. Senators concerned about the use of waivers wanted to know how the administration planned on making up, or reallocating, the lost credits, and the plan to attach RINs to exports was offered as a solution, the sources said.  Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and EPA head Scott Pruitt are expected to work out the details on the export plan.  A proposal to allow exported ethanol and other biofuels to generate the tradable RINs credits under the RFS was floated by the Trump administration last year to help lower RIN costs to refiners, but was quickly shot down by the powerful corn lobby. The oil industry, meanwhile, has also expressed opposition to expanding the sale of gasoline containing 15 percent ethanol, known as E15, mainly on the grounds that it cuts into petroleum’s share of the fuel market. The RFS is intended to help farmers, reduce air pollution, and cut petroleum imports. But some merchant refiners, like PBF Energy and Valero Energy Corp, say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The Trump administration waded into the issue late last year after fielding complaints from the refining sector, and hosted a series of meetings with lawmakers and company executives representing both sides.  Both the corn lobby and the merchant refining industry have said a misstep could threaten the same blue-collar jobs Trump has vowed to support.  But pressure to rein in regulatory costs has also softened in recent weeks as the price of compliance credits have hit five-year lows of around 30 cents. Those declines were driven mainly by news the EPA had granted more than two dozen hardship exemptions from the RFS to small refineries that say compliance would have been too financially difficult. In the past, the EPA has tended to give out less than ten such waivers annually, according to former officials. The expansion of the small refinery waiver program is due in part to a federal court decision last year that said the EPA had been too stingy with the exemptions in the past. But biofuel groups say the EPA is using the cover of the court to gut the RFS.

2018-05-08,"May 8 (Reuters) - The United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear pact negotiated in 2015 and re-impose sanctions it had previously withdrawn, President Donald Trump said, calling the deal “defective” at its core. STORIES: OIL: Oil prices initially slumped on conflicting headlines about President Trump’s intentions, rebounded after Trump’s announcement at the end of the trading session, and then sold off again to settle lower. STOCKS: Equities were volatile, and ended the day mostly unchanged. CURRENCIES: The dollar pulled back against other major currencies. COMMENTS: BOB MCNALLY, PRESIDENT, RAPIDAN GROUP, WASHINGTON D.C.: “He could have been tougher. He could have reimposed all sanctions right away. I think it was combined with this message of we’re still going to talk, and it could have been worse.” “My sense is its not going to be 500,000 barrels by the end of the year. “I think it is going to be very difficult to tell what it will be on a volumetric basis. It is going to be on a case by case, country-by-country basis. “We think everyone is going to scramble to call the White House on Monday and get an exemption. We’re expecting it to dissuade some buyers from purchasing Iranian crude. We assume Iran will stay in, and not kick out inspectors, as long as the Europeans stick close to them.” DAVID DIXON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF OILFIELD SERVICE COMPANY MCDERMOTT INTERNATIONAL INC: “It takes a lot of product out of the market. There’s nothing we can do about it.” BRIAN LAROSE, TECHNICAL ANALYST, ICAP-TA, NEW YORK: “Sanctions will take time to reimpose. It’s not going to happen overnight. At this point we don’t know what the new sacntions will be. About 1 mln bpd of production might be at risk. There are plenty of other players that would be more than willing to step up to the plate to fill that void. “1 mln bpd, I don’t think, is a big enough story to jolt the markets higher. Not too many folks are paying attention to the fact that the dollar is up.” MATTHEW BOLTON, PACE UNIVERSITY POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR: “The decision to withdraw from the Iran deal is truly irresponsible, putting political posturing above human security. The Iran nuclear deal made the world safer and less at risk of nuclear proliferation. The agreement cut off all the pathways to an Iranian bomb. This plays into the hands of hardliners in Iran who also want to scuttle the deal. It is a blow to America’s credibility, undercutting its capacity to persuade others that the US keeps its promises. The rest of the signatories of the Iran Deal - Iran, China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the EU – should forge ahead with upholding the agreement.” JOE MCMONIGLE, SENIOR ENERGY POLICY ANALYST, HEDGEEYE POTOMAC RESEARCH, WASHINGTON, D.C.: “It was very much as advertised. A lot of people were second-guessing this, and it became clear today that is not the case. “He’s very focused on the oil revenue to the regime. There are other sanctions that will go into effect as well, and I think he spelled that out in his remarks as well. “He indicated in the speech that countries that do business with Iran will also be subject to sanctions. China, dealing with a different currency, could potentially escape some sanctions. But any country that wants to be doing business with the U.S. needs to think about sanctions. “It’s going to have a potential chilling effect in companies doing business with Iran.” BRIAN DAINGERFIELD, MACRO STRATEGIST AT NATWEST MARKETS IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: “The market has been preparing, in a sense, for this announcement. The combination of the changeover in the president’s team from (Secretary of State Rex) Tillerson to (Mike) Pompeo and the appointment of John Bolton was a signal to the market of the direction that the administration was going. “You have seem some modest flight to quality, though it hasn’t been major. I think right now there’s still quite a bit of uncertainty about the future of the deal even now that the U.S. has made its intentions clear. “We do know that the European Union has said they will continue to uphold the accord regardless of the U.S. decision. We need to know how Iran will respond to this. There’s still plenty up in the air. “You could argue that President Trump being open to negotiation of a better deal while also hanging the risk of sanctions over Iran...that if an agreement could still be reached, a risky scenario could be avoided.” ERIC NUTTALL, PARTNER AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT NINEPOINT PARTNERS IN TORONTO: “As an energy investor, Trump announced everything that one could possibly have wanted him to say... The term that he used was the ‘highest’ level of sanctions, we’re obviously looking for the detail to this. “But it gives one confidence that there could be a reduction in the physical movement of barrels and this also puts at stake the medium- and long-term growth ambitions of Iran to grow their production and capacity. Today’s announcement gives energy bulls that much more confidence that the bull market for oil has even greater longevity for it. “I think we’re going to $80 next year for WTI. We see the inventories reaching a 10-year low by the end of this year.” BRIAN BATTLE, DIRECTOR OF TRADING AT PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS IN CHICAGO “This is a really telegraphed policy position so I don’t think the market is surprised. The economic effects will be minimal. Really this is a political story it’s not a markets or an economic story.” Investors are also reacting to Trump’s tone: “He’s not closed the door and shunned them. He wants a new deal. The door is open to try again which is probably less harsh than what he could have said.” MICHAEL O’ROURKE, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT JONESTRADING IN GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: “There was so much of this leaked out there in the media. It doesn’t seem to be much of a surprise to the market. The initial reaction was that defense names popped and rallied, oil had rallied, but they’re giving back now as well. Overall, we haven’t moved beyond the range we were trading in.” JACQUES ROUSSEAU, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF CLEARVIEW ENERGY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.: “I think people are sorting through what could actually happen. Is there actually any oil that’s going to leave the market? It doesn’t appear so in the near-term. “If you take a look at what’s going on now, Iran ships about 2.2 million barrels per day to Asia. And that oil is unlikely to get changed at all. Those buyers, which are mainly China, India, and Korea, are unlikely to adjust their plans. “The piece that could come into play is what goes to Europe. About 600,000 barrels a day goes to Europe, and so it depends on the level that Europe is cooperating with Trump. “One important thing in all of this: the oil in Iran is very different to the oil in Venezuela. One of the issues Venezuela has is that their oil is very heavy and sour and so not many refiners in the world can actually process it. If, for example, the U.S. stops importing the oil from Venezuela, it’s a little more difficult to find a home for it... Whereas the oil from Iran is medium quality, so there’s a lot more places it could go.” “If you look back on the last time sanctions came into effect; the Asian buyers did not cut back on their purchases. So now, that’s something that is unlikely to occur. “There’s definitely a lot of little ins and outs that could try and steer things in that direction; in terms of whether cargoes would be insured, there’s a lot of pieces to the puzzle and I’m not sure when exactly all of that is going to be put out. But it doesn’t seem like there’s going to be volumes affected in the near term.” STEPHEN MASSOCCA, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, WEDBUSH SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO: “It’s difficult to see how going back to the old Iranian sanctions without cooperation from major European countries will be effective. It might have an impact on oil pricing more than anything else...But to the stock market, I don’t see a big move one way or the other. At the end of the day, it’s not that important.” LEO MARIANI, ENERGY SPECIALIST, NATALLIANCE SECURITIES, AUSTIN, TEXAS: “I do think that there is a good chance that Iranian production will start to decline by YE18 and Iran could lose roughly 250-600,000 Bopd over the next 12-18 months. This should set-up oil prices to continue to act well into 2019, and our 2019 oil price forecast is $67 WTI and $71 Brent.” MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, HEAD OF EQUITY DERIVATIVES STRATEGY, WEEDEN & CO: “The big risk is a crude spike which Trump doesn’t want ahead of the midterms. Does Trump really want that from a political strategy point of view? So, does he bark at 2 p.m., then walk it back if oil prices go too high? But the secondary impact is that it drives up inflation which could lift bond yields higher.” BLU PUTNAM, CHIEF ECONOMIST, CME GROUP, CHICAGO: “A pullout from the Iran deal could lead China to buy more Iranian oil over the long term in place of the excess shale oil it imports from the U.S. “A U.S. pullout from the nuclear deal could raise gas prices at the pump, with the possibility of forecasts for $5 a gallon during the summer driving season, stoking inflation. “Shale producers will decide on whether to increase production and hedge it based on futures prices six to 24 months out, which are now significantly lower than spot prices. Energy ETFs are influenced by this backwardation price structure.” DANIEL FLYNN, ENERGY ANALYST TRADER, PRICE FUTURES GROUP, CHICAGO: “Everybody knows we’re going to pull out of the nuclear deal. Investors are going to be looking to see if our European allies are on board with us. I see us going higher. Definitely going higher. Unless we have a black swan event, $80 is not out of the question.” CHAD MORGANLANDER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, WASHINGTON CROSSING ADVISORS, FLORHAM PARK, NEW JERSEY: “We’ve already seen a run-up within oil prices that has been quite violent, so this sell-off on oil prices is basically ‘buy the rumor, sell on the news’ overall. That intraday move to positive territory (in stocks), investors should not take any special note of that. I really think the current administration rehearsed its signals in an effective manner, the decision to pull out of the Iran deal. So any type of intraday shift within the market is playing off of oil prices continuing to hit lower lows. It applies additional pressure to the overall sentiment of the market as the dollar continues to grind higher and (Treasury) yields continue to move higher as well. That’s the overall real driver of the market. The news out of Iran hasn’t surprised the system at all.” MICHAEL ANTONELLI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INSTITUTIONAL SALES TRADING, ROBERT W. BAIRD, MILWAUKEE: “We’re getting conflicting reports about the Iran deal. CNN reported that (Trump) would not withdraw but the New York Times is reporting that he will withdraw. The market will struggle until we get clarity on this. “The original report was that he would stay in the agreement and the market liked that because its less global tensions. Then the NY Times said he will withdraw, so that brings back to the table the thought of global tensions with Iran. “We’re just looking at Iran today, nothing else. We’re all over the place. Nobody knows what the right answer is right now.” STAN SHIPLEY, STRATEGIST, EVERCORE ISI, NEW YORK: “Trump is going to leave the deal, but this is pretty well anticipated here. The market has priced this in pretty well here. There are still deals between Iran with the Europeans, Russia and China. Does it cause Iran more problem to move money around the world? Yes. It is lose/lose deal for the U.S. It raises the risk that Iran might forgo negotiations and go ahead with its nuclear program.” Reporting By Stephanie Kelly, April Joyner, Ayenat Mersie,

2018-05-08,"(Adds earnings comparison, stock market reaction) HOUSTON, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday, with profit jumping more than six-fold on rising crude prices, cost cuts and improving chemical sales. Oxy, the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, posted net income of $708 million, or 92 cents per share, compared to $117 million, or 15 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts expected earnings of 70 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Oxy’s U.S. oil operations swung to a profit in the quarter, largely due to rising crude prices. In the company’s chemical division, which makes plastics used in pipes and siding, profit more than doubled to $230 million. Overall production jumped 4 percent in the quarter to 609,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. The Houston-based company plans a conference call with reports to discuss the quarterly results early on Wednesday. Oxy shares rose less than 1 percent to $78.26 in after-hours trading.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices pared losses that earlier on Tuesday ran as deep as 4 percent after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, while the dollar edged off fresh 2018 highs. Brent futures, the global crude benchmark, briefly turned positive after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement aimed at stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Trump said the United States was reimposing the “highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran, but he did not provide details. Oil prices plunged earlier as markets were rattled by media reports on doubts over whether Trump would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as most had expected. U.S. crude settled down $1.67 at $69.06 per barrel and Brent settled down $1.32 at $74.85. Both contracts continued to pare losses in post trade. It was the busiest day in U.S. front-month contracts since August, and for Brent the busiest in almost a month. Oil prices had been supported by expectations that Trump would pull out of the deal, which could crimp Iranian crude exports and feed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to one-third of the global daily oil supply. “Trump’s announcement had been baked into the cake in recent days, hence we saw prices selling off today given the air of certainty surrounding it,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. The announcement weighed heavily on some hard currency bonds issued by Iranian neighbors Turkey and Iraq, as well as Lebanon, which suffered the biggest declines. Lebanese markets had already come under pressure after Sunday’s election underscored Tehran’s growing clout in the region.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s expanded use of waivers to free small refineries from the nation’s biofuels law has saved the industry as a whole hundreds of millions of dollars, according to a Reuters review of public filings. Dozens of refineries have received the financial hardship waivers from EPA in recent months, meaning they no longer have to earn or purchase blending credits known as RINs. They can also sell any RINs they have on hand into the market, which helps other refiners by cutting market prices. Savings for the refining industry represent a win for President Donald Trump, whose administration has been under pressure from Valero Energy Corp, PBF Energy, and others to overhaul the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) to cut compliance costs. But the increase in waivers has incensed the U.S. corn lobby, which claims Trump’s EPA is undermining demand for biofuels such as corn-based ethanol. The RFS was intended to help U.S. farmers by requiring refiners to add more biofuels into gasoline and diesel supplies. The EPA has said it has handed out more than two dozen waivers in recent months to refineries that have demonstrated complying with the RFS would cause them “disproportionate economic hardship.” That is a big increase, according to former officials who said the EPA has tended to grant fewer than 10 discretionary waivers a year since the program began in 2013. Expansion of the waiver program is due in part to a federal court decision last year that said the EPA had been too stingy with exemptions. But ethanol groups and their legislative backers have complained EPA has gone too far expanding a program that was never meant to benefit deep-pocketed oil companies. One group recently asked a federal judge to determine whether the program expansion was legal. Andeavor, which sources told Reuters has secured waivers for some of its refineries, said on Monday it saved $100 million in biofuels compliance costs for 2016 and 2017. A company spokesman declined to comment when asked if the savings were related to waivers. CVR Refining, controlled by billionaire Trump ally Carl Icahn, reported a rare $23 million profit in the biofuels credit market in the first quarter. Sources told Reuters its Oklahoma facility was recently granted an exemption. The company also said in a recent earnings call that it expects its cost of complying with RFS requirements in 2018 to fall to $80 million from a previous estimate of $200 million, and from roughly $249 million in 2017.         Delek U.S. Holdings reported compliance savings of $79 million, while HollyFrontier said it saved $71 million. Those companies confirmed they received waivers from EPA. EPA does not disclose the recipients of waivers, saying the information is business sensitive. Refiners that did not get waivers are also posting savings as RIN prices have dropped more than 70 percent since late last year to five-year lows around 30 cents apiece, according to traders.     PBF Energy and Valero do not have refineries small enough to qualify for waivers, but they still are forecasting huge savings in compliance costs. Valero, the largest U.S. refiner, said it now expects $550 million on compliance credits this year. That is down sharply from its April forecast of up to $850 million and far lower than the $942 million spent on compliance credits last year, according to filings. PBF Energy expects to spend $100 million this year, half of what it spent in 2017, CEO Tom Nimbley told investors last week. “Small refinery waivers granted by the EPA have had the effect of lowering RINs prices, and thereby reducing a significant headwind for our business,” Nimbley said.

2018-05-08,"* Regional upheaval feared after Trump’s tack on Iran * Syrians say Israel attacks army base, no casualties (Recasts for alleged Israeli attack in Syria) By Dan Williams and Angus McDowall JERUSALEM/BEIRUT, May 8 (Reuters) - Syrian state media accused Israel of launching missiles at a target near Damascus on Tuesday, shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump announced he was quitting the Iranian nuclear deal, a move that had prompted Israel to go on high alert. The Israeli military said that, upon identifying “irregular activity” by Iranian forces in Syria, it instructed civic authorities on the Golan Heights to ready bomb shelters, deployed new defences and mobilised some reservist forces. Israel’s top general, Gadi Eizenkott, cancelled a scheduled appearance at an annual security conference and was conferring with Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman and other national security chiefs, officials said. Trump’s hard tack against the nuclear deal, while welcomed by Israel, has stirred fears of a possible regional flare-up. Within two hours of the White House announcement, Syrian state news agency SANA reported explosions in Kisweh, south of Damascus. Syrian air defences fired at two Israeli missiles, destroying both, SANA said. A commander in the regional alliance supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told Reuters that Israel’s air force had struck an army base at Kisweh without causing casualties. Asked about those statements, an Israeli military spokeswoman said: “We do not respond to such foreign reports.” Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah have been helping Assad beat back a seven-year-old rebellion. Israel has carried out repeated air strikes against them, hoping to stop the formation of a Lebanese-Syrian front to its north. An April 9 strike killed seven Iranian military personnel at a Syrian airbase. Iran blamed Israel and vowed to retaliate. Israeli media said Tuesday’s order to prepare bomb shelters on the Golan was unprecedented during Syria’s civil war. Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it in a moved no recognised internationally. Israel has posted Iron Dome short-range air defences on the Golan, local media said, suggesting that the anticipated attack could be by ground-to-ground rockets or mortars. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made a televised address lauding Trump’s Iran policy and alluding to the tensions over Syria. “For months now, Iran has been transferring lethal weaponry to its forces in Syria, with the purpose of striking at Israel,” Netanyahu said. “We will respond mightily to any attack on our territory.” On Twitter, Lieberman said he had spoken to his U.S. counterpart James Mattis and “updated him on regional developments”.

Brent futures, the global crude benchmark, briefly turned positive after Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the 2015 international agreement aimed at stopping Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb. Trump said the United States was reimposing the “highest level of economic sanctions” on Iran, but he did not provide details. Oil prices plunged earlier as markets were rattled by media reports on doubts of whether Trump would withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal as most had expected. U.S. crude settled down $1.67 at $69.06 per barrel and Brent settled down $1.32 at $74.85. Both contracts continued to pare losses in post trade. It was the busiest day in U.S. front-month contracts since August, and for Brent the busiest in almost a month. Oil prices had been supported by expectations that Trump would pull out of the deal, which could crimp Iranian crude exports and feed geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to one-third of the global daily oil supply. “Trump’s announcement had been baked into the cake in recent days, hence we saw prices selling off today given the air of certainty surrounding it,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. The dollar advanced to new highs for 2018 against a basket of six trading currencies on worries about political turmoil in Italy but later pared gains on the U.S. decision to withdraw from the Iran deal.

2018-05-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision on Tuesday to pull out of the Iran nuclear accord and reinstate tough economic sanctions could scupper French oil major Total’s (TOTF.PA) multibillion-dollar gas project in the country unless it can secure a waiver. Total signed a deal with Tehran in July 2017 to develop phase 11 of Iran’s South Pars field with an initial investment of $1 billion (738.83 million pounds), marking the first major Western energy investment in the Islamic Republic since the lifting of sanctions. However, Trump described the nuclear agreement that made such an investment possible as “horribly one-sided” and said Iran had used proceeds from the lifting of sanctions in 2015 to “build nuclear-capable missiles, support terrorism and cause havoc across the Middle East and beyond”.          He said he would be instituting the highest level of economic sanctions against Tehran, raising questions over the viability of investments made in Iran by foreign companies with a U.S. footprint.  “Any nation that helps Iran for their quest for nuclear weapons could also be strongly sanctioned by the United States,” Trump said. Total buys Iranian crude for its European refineries, carries out transactions in U.S. dollars and billions of dollars in U.S. investments including its Port Arthur refinery.  Company officials were not immediately available for comment. Total expects the South Pars 11 project, part of the world’s largest gas field, to have production capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day, or 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day including condensate, to supply the Iranian domestic market from 2021.  Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne has previously said that one option open to the company if Trump withdrew from the Iran accord and imposed new sanctions would be to seek a waiver allowing it to continue working in Iran.   “If the sanctions are back, we will have to apply for specific sanctions waivers,” Pouyanne told journalists on the sidelines of a conference on April 19.  Total has history of success in such moves. In the 1990s it obtained a waiver for the South Pars 2 and 3 projects after the imposition of U.S. sanctions at the time.  It argued then, as it might do now, that it made its investment at a time sanctions were not in place.  Pouyanne said that Total has been lobbying the French government and other European capitals to obtain such a waiver again and protect its investments in Iran. Total has a 50.1 percent stake in the $5 billion South Pars 11 project. Terms of the partnership show it is committed to investing an initial $1 billion to get the project off the ground and a further billion to develop the project.  Sources say it has already spent several tens of millions of dollars on studies and tenders. China’s CNPC has a 30 percent stake in the project, while the Iran’s national oil company’s subsidiary PetroPars holds the remaining 19.9 percent. If Total were to fail in an eventual attempt to obtain a waiver, the company is expected to take a backseat and allow  CNPC to become lead operator, according to people with knowledge of the deal. Total has previously expressed its commitment to Iran and desire to press ahead with the project as long as it can find a way to continue operating legally in the country.

2018-05-08,"(Adds more comment from company paragraph 3) By Scott DiSavino May 8 (Reuters) - Southern California Gas (SoCalGas) cautioned on Tuesday that  pipeline outages and restrictions on the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility could reduce its ability to deliver natural gas this year to a level even lower than California state regulators and others have predicted. On Monday, regulators, power companies and grid operators issued a technical report warning of a “moderate threat” to gas and electric reliability this summer and a “more serious threat” next winter. “We remain concerned that some of the assumptions made in the technical assessment are overly optimistic,” SoCalGas spokesman Chris Gilbride said in an email. SoCalGas is a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy. The SoCalGas system has been operating at less than full capacity because of the pipeline outages and restrictions on the use of Aliso Canyon, the utility’s biggest storage field, which suffered a devastating leak between October 2015 and February 2016. “The potential for additional (pipeline) outages means that the situation may be getting worse, not better,” the Aliso Canyon Technical Assessment Group said in a report released Monday, noting SoCalGas avoided serious problems last winter due to unusually warm weather. “With so many pipeline outages, it will be difficult for SoCalGas to fill storage to a level sufficient to ensure energy reliability throughout the coming winter,” the group said. SoCalGas’ Gilbride said that “Service reductions or interruptions to electric generators may be necessary this summer and withdrawals from Aliso Canyon may be required to prevent more extensive customer outages.” SoCalGas wants the state to lift some of the restrictions that were imposed on Aliso Canyon after the months-long leak which forced the evacuation of residents form a nearby Los Angeles neighborhood. The state has limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into the 86-billion cubic feet Aliso Canyon to just 24.6 bcf and only allows the utility to pull fuel from the field when other options are not available. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. To avoid power and gas interruptions this summer and next winter, the technical group recommended SoCalGas import liquefied natural gas from Costa Azul in Mexico and that state regulators allow the utility to boost the capacity and use of Aliso Canyon. The report said this summer’s challenges stem primarily from continuing outages and reductions on key pipelines, including Lines 2000, 3000 and 4000 and 235-2. The group projected capacity on SoCalGas’ system would total 3.555 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this summer, which includes 2.655 bcfd from pipelines and 0.900 bcfd from storage. That is lower than the 3.638 bcfd available without Aliso Canyon last summer and well below the 4.668 bcfd maximum the system could send out without Aliso Canyon if all pipelines were available, the group has previously forecast. This summer’s projected system capacity is just enough to cover forecast peak demand of 3.511 bcfd, the report said, warning higher gas usage or loss of additional pipelines could result in curtailments of the fuel to electric generators.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel signalled on Tuesday that she thought the chances were increasing of German carmakers building up battery production for electric cars in Europe. Europe has no significant production of the constituent cells of battery packs - a market currently dominated by a handful of firms including China’s CATL and Korean rivals LG Chem 0519.KS and Samsung (005930.KS). “I’m detecting a certain rethink among carmakers,” Merkel said at an event in Berlin hosted by the National Academy of Science and Engineering, known as acatech. She said she backed a call from Henning Kagermann - the academy’s outgoing president - who said Europe needed such battery production. Merkel argued that battery production would form a significant part of the value-added chain for electric cars, so if Europe lacked a home-grown battery industry, it would have a smaller share in the value-added chain of the car industry in future. She said it might still be possible to “achieve something” in Europe in this field but added that businesses would need to be willing. Merkel said she was in favour of doing more for Germany as a research location and boosting innovation there. She pointed to the government’s intention to raise the proportion of research and development spending in Germany to 3.5 percent of economic output by 2025, adding that the automobile industry played an important role in that. Last month, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the German government was ready to offer support to the makers of batteries for electric vehicles, adding that one possibility might be to exempt them from some energy levies. Volkswagen-owned (VOWG_p.DE) truckmaker Scania said in January it would invest 10 million euros in a 4 billion euro (3.51 billion pounds) project to build Europe’s biggest battery cell plant in northern Sweden.

2018-05-08,"(Adds close of European markets) * Crude falls sharply ahead of news on U.S. sanctions on Iran * Dollar sets fresh 2018 high on Iran, Italy jitters * Stocks mostly decline ahead of Trump announcement By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit fresh 2018 highs on Tuesday on safe-haven demand amid conflicting accounts of whether President Donald Trump will scotch a nuclear accord with Iran, while oil gyrated over the potential for U.S. sanctions against the country. The New York Times reported that Trump had told French President Emmanuel Macron that he was going to pull out of the international agreement but the French presidency said the U.S. leader gave no indication of a decision on Iran. In answer to a Reuters question, Macron’s office denied the Times story. Trump is expected to make an announcement on the future of the Iranian deal at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Tuesday. Oil prices dived as much as 4 percent after a CNN report raised doubts about whether Trump would impose sanctions as quickly as the market had expected, a decision that would reduce global crude supplies and feed tensions in the Middle East. U.S. crude fell 2.93 percent to $68.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.28, down 2.48 percent on the day. U.S. and European equity markets mostly edged lower, weighed by technology and consumer discretionary stocks, as investors awaited Trump’s decision. A U.S. withdrawal from the multination accord could impact Iranian crude exports and also fan geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to one-third of the world’s daily oil supply. “There’s uncertainty as to what the announcement will be at 2 o’clock,” said John Carey, portfolio manager at Amundi Pioneer Asset Management in Boston. “If there is an announcement by the president that we’re withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, people will wondering what impact that will have on oil prices,” he said. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a group of six major trading currencies, has surged about 4.5 percent in three weeks as hopes were dashed that other major central banks would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in normalizing monetary policy. The euro and sterling fell under renewed pressure, the former on prospects of early elections in Italy and the latter as hopes waned of a Bank of England rate increase this week. “The dollar reflects the incremental economic strength of the U.S. versus Europe and other places,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “The dollar is somewhat undervalued relative to the euro and the pound but it is very overvalued relative to the Japan yen.” The euro fell 0.36 percent against the dollar to $1.1877 , the lowest since December. Against the yen, the dollar pared gains to slip 0.03 percent to 109.05 per $1. MSCI’s gauge of global equity markets fell 0.14 percent while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.04 percent to close at 1,528.27. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 73.68 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,283.64. The S&P 500 lost 9.12 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,663.51 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.88 points, or 0.31 percent, to 7,242.33. Italian government bond yields jumped, lifting southern European peers, as the possibility of an early election increased with the largest anti-establishment parties polling strongly. The Italy/Germany 10-year government bond yield spread hit its widest in three weeks at 128 basis points, while Italian 10-year yields shot up to yield 1.863 percent.

2018-05-08,"May 8 (Reuters) - California regulators said reduced capacity in Southern California Gas’ (SoCalGas) natural gas system poses a “moderate threat” to gas and electric reliability this summer and a “more serious threat” next winter. The SoCalGas system has been operating at less than full capacity because of pipeline outages and restrictions on the use of the Aliso Canyon gas storage facility, the utility’s biggest, following a leak between October 2015 and February 2016. “The potential for additional (pipeline) outages means that the situation may be getting worse, not better,” the Aliso Canyon Technical Assessment Group said in a report released Monday, noting SoCalGas avoided serious problems last winter due to unusually warm weather. “With so many pipeline outages, it will be difficult for SoCalGas to fill storage to a level sufficient to ensure energy reliability throughout the coming winter,” the group made up of state regulators and regional power companies said. Officials at SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy, could not immediately comment on the report. To avoid power and gas interruptions this summer and next winter, the group recommended SoCalGas import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Costa Azul in Mexico and that state regulators allow the utility to boost the capacity and use of Aliso Canyon. The state has limited the amount of gas SoCalGas can inject into the 86-billion cubic feet (bcf) Aliso Canyon to just 24.6 bcf and only allows the utility to pull gas from the field when other options are not available to meet demand. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. The report said this summer’s challenges stem primarily from continuing outages and reductions on key pipelines, including Lines 2000, 3000 and 4000 and 235-2. The technical group projected capacity on SoCalGas’ system would total 3.555 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) this summer, which includes 2.655 bcfd from pipelines and 0.900 bcfd from storage. That is lower than the 3.638 bcfd available without Aliso Canyon last summer and well below the 4.668 bcfd maximum the system could send out without Aliso Canyon if all pipelines were available, the group has previously forecast. This summer’s projected system capacity is just enough to cover forecast peak demand of 3.511 bcfd, the report said, warning higher gas usage or loss of additional pipelines could result in curtailments of the fuel to electric generators.

2018-05-08,"(Updates throughout) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is expected to rise more than previously expected to 12 million barrels per day by the fourth quarter of 2019, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday in a monthly report. The agency forecast that U.S. crude oil output will rise by 1.14 million barrels per day (bpd) to 11.86 million bpd on average next year, according to the short term energy outlook. Last month, it expected a 750,00-bpd year-over-year increase to 11.44 million bpd. Overall, the agency’s forecast has increased by more than 1 million bpd since January. The forecast projects that U.S. crude output could reach 12 million bpd by the fourth quarter of 2019, nearly 500,000 bpd above previous estimates for production in that quarter. The agency lifted its 2018 production estimate to 10.72 million bpd, expecting growth of 1.37 million bpd, according to the report. U.S. crude output has surged since 2010, fueled by output from formations in states including Texas, New Mexico and North Dakota. This year, it has surpassed a previous long-standing output record. At the same time, the agency left its projections for U.S. oil demand in 2018 unchanged at 20.38 million bpd and slightly lowered its 2019 forecast to 20.64 million bpd from 20.70 million bpd previously. The crude market on Tuesday was gripped by reports on U.S. President Donald Trump’s nuclear plans, so any reaction to the data was muted. The report also suggested high crude prices will pressure retail gasoline prices upward, to just below $3 a gallon during the summer driving season. Reporting By Jessica Resnick-Ault

2018-05-08,"(Reuters) - Canada’s WestJet Airlines Ltd (WJA.TO) on Tuesday said uncertainty from a labor dispute, along with higher expenses would weigh on second quarter earnings, after the carrier missed analyst estimates for the first three months of the year, sending its shares down to their lowest in over two years. The country’s second-largest carrier is negotiating a first contract with its unionized pilots, even as it plans to launch a new budget carrier in June, and expand premium seating. Pilots are expected to decide by May 10 whether to give their union a mandate to strike, which could be held as early as May 19.    “What we’ve seen over the last two weeks is a significant deferral of bookings,” WestJet Chief Executive Ed Sims told analysts, as some passengers either postpone travel or make other plans. Sims said the company was “making progress” in the talks. Chief Financial Officer Harry Taylor told analysts the strike vote “has really thrown a wrench into RASM (revenues per available seat mile) for the quarter.” Airlines like WestJet are also battling rising fuel costs as oil prices rebound from multi-year lows in 2016 to touch $70 per barrel. Shares of WestJet’s larger rival Air Canada (AC.TO) slipped 2.7 percent by midday, while the benchmark Canadian share index was largely flat. WestJet forecast lower than expected RASM, a key airline metric, for the second quarter, even as it said it would achieve a C$200 million ($154 million) cost savings by 2020, ahead of its initial target. WestJet expects second quarter RASM to be flat to 2 percent lower. BMO Capital Markets forecast RASM growth of 2.5 percent while Canaccord Genuity forecast growth of 4.2 percent. Taylor also told analysts the second half of year would look “very different” from the first half with new revenues streams kicking in from the budget carrier Swoop and other programs.  Costs per available seat mile (CASM), excluding fuel and profit share is expected to increase by 7.5 percent to 8.5 percent during the second quarter. WestJet reported first-quarter profit that missed analysts’ due to higher fuel costs, which jumped 14 percent per liter in the quarter. WestJet shares were down 10.5 percent at C$19.78 by midday. Excluding certain items, WestJet earned 32 Canadian cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 36 Canadian cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

2018-05-08,"ACCRA (Reuters) - Sub-Saharan African nations are at growing risk of debt distress because of heavy borrowing and gaping deficits, despite an overall uptick in economic growth, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday.  The sober assessment came as African countries continue to tap international debt markets and issue record levels of debt in foreign currencies, spurred on by insatiable investor demand for yields.    “What really we’re concerned about is the pace of increase, rather than the average,” IMF Africa Director Abebe Aemro Selassie told Reuters at the launch of its economic outlook for the region in Accra. “What we’re calling for right now is that those countries are going to need to go through fiscal consolidation,” he said, adding that oil producers and other resource-dependent economies were seeking the sharpest growth in their debt loads. The Fund projected the rate of economic expansion would rise to 3.4 percent this year, up from 2.8 percent in 2017, boosted by global growth and higher commodity prices. Slower growth in South Africa and Nigeria - the continent’s two largest economies - weighed on the region-wide average, but the IMF expects growth to pick up in around two-thirds of African nations. However, under current policies, that rate is expected to plateau below 4 percent over the medium term.  Meanwhile, around 40 percent of low-income countries in the region are now in debt distress or at high risk of it, the IMF report said. And refinancing that debt could soon become more costly.  “The current growth spurt in advanced economies is expected to taper off, and the borrowing terms for the region’s frontier markets will likely become less favorable ... which could coincide with higher refinancing needs for many countries across the region,” it said. African governments issued a record $7.5 billion in sovereign bonds last year, 10 times more than in 2016. And they have issued or plan to issue over $11 billion in additional debt in the first half of 2018 alone, the report said.   Foreign currency debt increased by 40 percent from 2010-13 to 2017 and now accounts for about 60 percent of the region’s total public debt on average, IMF data showed. Average interest payments, meanwhile, increased from 4 percent of expenditures in 2013 to 12 percent in 2017. Six countries - Chad, Eritrea, Mozambique, Congo Republic, South Sudan and Zimbabwe - were judged to be in debt distress at the end of last year. And the IMF’s ratings for Zambia and Ethiopia were changed from moderate to “high risk of debt distress.”  The IMF conceded that Africa’s enormous needs will continue to demand heavy investments to build infrastructure and social development. But to do so while avoiding the risk of a debt trap, the continent, which currently has the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratio in the world, will need to become more self-reliant. “Borrowing to finance spending is part of the macroeconomic policy tool kits which all countries use,” Selassie said. “But over the medium to long-term they have to rely more on domestic revenues, tax revenues to address their development spending needs.” Editing by Joe Bavier and Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/africa-imf/update-1-imf-warns-of-rising-african-debt-despite-faster-economic-growth-idUKL8N1SF6VI,08 May 2018,"* Pace of growth, though faster in 2018, is expected to

2018-05-08,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA reported a 57 percent surge in quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by higher oil prices and asset sales, fanning hopes that the state-controlled oil company may be moving past a massive corruption scandal.  Petrobras (PETR4.SA), as the firm is known, posted a net profit of 6.961 billion reais ($1.96 billion) in the first quarter, the biggest in five years, as it continued to cut debt. It also announced a dividend of 0.05 reais a share, its first in three years.  Shares were largely unchanged in early afternoon trading in Sao Paulo after initially rising following the results.  Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, crept up just 2 percent to 25.669 billion reais in the first quarter.  The results represented progress for a company striving under Chief Executive Pedro Parente to move past the fallout from a probe, begun in 2014, that showed construction firms bribed Petrobras officials and politicians to win inflated contracts.  The scandal sent Petrobras’ share price tumbling, hammered its bottom line, drove up debt and led to a series of lawsuits. In a client note, JPMorgan described the latest results as a “solid quarter,” adding that the “deleveraging story continues to be delivered.”    Petrobras, which still holds the dubious title of the world’s most indebted oil company, said it generated 3.223 billion reais from the sale of stakes in assets like the Lapa field, and the Iara area in the offshore Santos basin. It said net debt fell more than 3 percent to 270.71 billion reais ($76.23 billion) in the period on a sequential basis. Rising international oil prices, which increased from an average $54.04 per barrel in the fourth quarter to $60.18 per barrel in the first three months of the year, helped boost results, the company said. Parente also said the company was making progress in talks with the Brazilian government over the so-called transfer-of-rights area and could reach a deal by May 17. Petrobras was granted rights to drill for 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in that area, located in Brazil’s coveted offshore pre-salt layer, though the value of the contract has been disputed. Executives also said they saw the company further recovering market share in Brazil’s gasoline and diesel markets.  The company said preliminary figures showed it had boosted its share of the gasoline market to 86 percent last month from 80 percent in March while its share of the diesel market rose to 79 percent from 77 percent in the same period.      Free cash flow was positive for the second quarter in a row  but down 3 percent year-on-year as the result of the first payment to U.S. investors who won a class action against the company in January tied to the graft scandal.

2018-05-08,"LAGOS, May 8 (Reuters) - A Nigerian civil rights group launched a legal case on Tuesday aimed at forcing the government to revoke a disputed 2011 oilfield deal at the centre of a string of international corruption investigations. The case, heard at a court in the commercial hub Lagos, relates to the purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in 2011. The field has estimated reserves of 9 billion barrels. At the core of the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block from Malabu Oil and Gas, allegedly controlled by former Nigerian oil minister Dan Etete. Rasheed Adegoke, lawyer to Human & Environmental Development Agenda (HEDA), said the rights group decided to go to court after it became aware of a trial in Milan relating to corruption allegations over the oilfield purchase. HEDA is a rights group at the forefront of Nigeria’s corruption fight. “After the judgement in Milan the Nigerian government refused to do something about it so we decided to go to court. What we are saying is that the attorney general ... should revoke the license granted to ... Mr. Dan Etete, when he was minister,” Adegoke told Reuters after the hearing in Lagos. In December, Shell and Eni were ordered to stand trial over alleged corruption in Nigeria. Milan prosecutors alleged bribes were paid to win the licence to explore the field which never entered into production. Nigeria’s attorney general, Abubakar Malami, was absent in court on Tuesday. However, Etete’s lawyer told the court that his client would seek to join the case to defend ownership of the oilfield, Adegoke said. The case was adjourned to June 13. Etete was Nigeria’s oil minister at the time of the deal and was convicted of money laundering in France in 2007. He could not be reached for comment. Another local court has set a hearing over the same oilfield for June 18, after the country’s financial crimes watchdog filed a case accusing several former government officials, former and current managers at Shell and Eni of being part of a scheme to defraud the Nigerian government. The Nigerian court case has been repeatedly delayed as defendants have failed to appear for hearings. Both Eni and Shell have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in relation to the deal, which is also being investigated in Italy and the Netherlands, where Eni and Shell are respectively based.

2018-05-08,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Brent drops ahead of news on U.S. sanctions on Iran * Italian shares, bonds drop on election uncertainty By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar hit fresh 2018 highs on Tuesday on safe-haven demand amid expectations President Donald Trump will pull out of a key nuclear accord with Iran, while oil prices slumped ahead of news on whether the U.S. will reinstate sanctions on Iran. U.S. officials indicated late Monday that Trump would withdraw from the deal but it was unclear on what terms and whether sanctions would be announced, said a senior European official closely involved in Iran diplomacy. Brent crude futures dropped 3.1 percent to $73.82 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 3.2 percent at $68.45. Equity markets in the U.S. and Europe edged lower, weighed by technology and consumer discretionary stocks, as investors awaited Trump’s decision at 2:00 p.m. ET (1800 GMT). A U.S. withdrawal from the multination accord could impact Iranian crude exports and also fan geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, home to one-third of the world’s daily oil supply. The possibility of Trump walking away from the Iran deal has been widely telegraphed, said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. “A lot of strength in oil has already occurred, this could be just buy-the-rumor sell-the-news with oil,” Ablin said. If (Trump) decides to keep the deal and negotiate you could see oil prices fall.” The dollar index, tracking it against a group of six major currencies, has surged about 4.5 percent in three weeks as hopes were dashed that other major central banks would follow the U.S. Federal Reserve in normalizing monetary policy. The euro and sterling fell under renewed pressure, the former on prospects of early elections in Italy and the latter as hopes waned of a Bank of England rate increase this week. “The dollar reflects the incremental economic strength of the U.S. versus Europe and other places,” Ablin said. “The dollar is somewhat undervalued relative to the euro and the pound but it is very overvalued relative to the Japan yen.” The euro fell 0.55 percent against the dollar to $1.1854 , the lowest since December.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN/OSLO (Reuters) - Swedish utility Vattenfall has no legal grounds to ask a U.S. arbitration court if it can claim 4.7 billion euros (4.1 billion pounds) from Berlin for forcing it to halt nuclear production, the German government has said in a letter. The letter, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, was addressed to a German lawmaker who had inquired about the government’s position on Vattenfall’s attempts to seek damages from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). In 2016 Germany’s highest court ruled that utility companies were allowed to seek limited damages from the German government over the hastening of nuclear plant shutdowns after Japan’s Fukushima disaster. As a non-German company, Vattenfall first turned to the ICSID in 2012 with the filing of a complaint against the German state. Utilities E.ON (EONGn.DE), RWE (RWEG.DE) and Vattenfall  sued the German government, arguing that the decision to close all nuclear plants by 2022 amounted to expropriation. “In the pending arbitration case of Vattenfall against the Federal Republic of Germany, the federal government has requested that the arbitration be dismissed,” Deputy Economy Minister Thomas Bareiss wrote in the letter, dated April 21. Pointing to a recent ruling by the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) on a similar case, Berlin said that an arbitration from a court outside an EU country in relation to a case between a company and a member state is invalid. In March the ECJ ruled that arbitration clauses common to almost 200 investment agreements between EU member countries violate EU law, casting doubt on such deals and others struck by the bloc as a whole. The ECJ found that an award of damages in 2012 to Dutch insurer Achmea from Slovakia under a bilateral investment treaty inherited from former Czechoslovakia breached EU law. Vattenfall, which is expecting a decision from the United States-based ICSID this year, said the ECJ ruling has no effect on its pending case against Germany. “Unlike the Achmea case, this procedure is based on the European Energy Charter Treaty ... The contract was signed not only by all member states and third countries, but also by the EU,” said Vattenfall’s media relations head Sandra Kuhberger. Germany also rejected as baseless compensation claims by utilities, arguing that its decision to end nuclear power was justified because nuclear risks had changed after the Fukushima meltdown in 2011. It also says a majority of voters back the phasing out of nuclear power. “Vattenfall is not questioning the decision to phase out nuclear power in Germany. But we insist on receiving compensation for the financial loss suffered by the company,” Kuhberger added. Vattenfall, which derives much of its turnover from activities in Germany, had to idle the Kruemmel and Brunsbuettel reactors in northern Germany permanently in 2011 when the government decided to close old reactors and accelerate the exit programmes for the remainder. ICSID declined to comment on any potential implications of the previous ECJ judgment, saying it did not have the parties’ consent to disclose further information on the status of proceedings.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN/MUNICH (Reuters) - Audi has discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars, it said on Tuesday, dealing a fresh setback to parent Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) more than 2-1/2 years after it  first admitted to cheating U.S. diesel exhaust tests.  Audi said it had stopped deliveries of A6 and A7 models with a certain type of diesel engine after finding a previously unidentified problem with emissions software. It did not give details of the problem.  A person familiar with the matter said 60,000 cars would have to be recalled for a software update, taking the total number of vehicles with Audi engines to be recalled over the “dieselgate” emissions scandal to more than 900,000.  Volkswagen (VW) has recalled millions of vehicles in total and paid out billions of dollars in fines since it admitted in September 2015 to using illegal “defeat device” software that masked the level of pollution emitted by its diesel engines.  Having announced a multibillion-dollar investment in electric vehicles, and a new chief executive only last month, Europe’s largest carmaker has been looking to move on from the biggest business crisis in its history.  Audi’s announcement came a day before its annual shareholder meeting, where it was hoping to focus on its electric car plans.  The German transport ministry said earlier on Tuesday that the KBA motor vehicle authority had summoned Audi for a formal hearing about its A6/A7 diesel models. “The KBA has requested a hearing on suspicion the Audi V6TDI A6/A7 models have been fitted with an illegal defeat device,” the ministry said in a statement. German magazine Der Spiegel was first to report that Audi had discovered the problem.  Prosecutors in Munich, which in the past have raided Audi’s headquarters and are investigating 18 of its current and former employees, said on Tuesday they would widen their probe to include the affected A6/A7 models. However, Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst did not see a big financial impact from the latest setback.  “As painful, annoying and incomprehensible as these issues are, they will unlikely trigger massive incremental legal risks. Best guess, this could trigger 15-30 million euros in additional costs which should be covered by VW’s existing diesel provisions,” he said in a note.  Audi said it had informed the U.S. monitor tasked with overseeing VW’s post-dieselgate reforms of its latest problem, but added no cars in the United States were affected by it. Audi said in November 2015 - two months after the admission of wrongdoing by VW - that defeat device software was installed  in about 85,000 cars in the United States fitted with its larger engines.

2018-05-08,"MOSCOW, May 8 (Reuters) - Russia has exported less crude oil to Europe this year as the quality of the fuel on offer deteriorated and tense diplomatic relations prompted it to redirect more volumes to China. Russia increased oil pipeline exports to China by almost 50 percent in January-April from a year earlier to 12.4 million tonnes, Igor Dyomin, a spokesman for Transneft, Russia’s oil pipeline monopoly, said on Tuesday. Moscow has embarked on a so-called “pivot East” strategy and tried to boost ties with Asia as its relations with the West have chilled over Russia’s role in Ukraine’s conflict and its alleged meddling in the U.S. presidential election in 2016. The increase in oil supplies to China has resulted in a worsening quality of Europe-bound Urals blend, including an increase of unwanted sulphur content. Dyomin said that Hungary, Slovakia and Poland cut Russian oil imports by around 10 percent in January-April, and shipments to Europe via the two branches of the Soviet-built Druzhba pipeline declined by 225,000 tonnes to 15.75 million tonnes in the first fourth months of the year. “The decrease in purchasing volumes happened as the countries want to get oil with sulphur content of 1.5 percent, though the sulphur content is capped at 1.8 percent in the contract,” Dyomin said, adding the figure stands at 1.75 percent now. According to Reuters calculation, the sulphur content in Urals as of February had increased on average by 0.15 percent from 2017. There are no legal consequences for Urals’ quality falling below the standards, but it has dampened its price and prompted buyers to think about the possibility of reducing the volumes they buy, according to traders and sources close to European refineries.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - Andeavor, one of the largest U.S. refining companies has reported saving $100 million over the past two years due to lower compliance costs related to the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, which requires refiners to mix biofuels like ethanol into the nation’s fuel or purchase credits from rivals that do. The company’s announcement late on Monday came after Reuters reported last month that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency had granted the company a financial hardship waiver that freed its smallest refining facilities from the regulation. The biofuels industry has accused the Trump administration’s EPA of undermining demand for biofuels by improperly granting waivers to highly-profitable companies like Andeavor. EPA has rejected that charge. Andeavor said in its earnings statement Monday that it saved “approximately $100 million primarily related to a reduction in the RINs obligation for the 2016 and 2017 compliance periods for some of the company’s Inland refineries.” Andeavor recorded net profits of $1.4 billion in 2017. Reuters reported that Andeavor’s EPA hardship exemptions had freed Andeavor’s refineries in North Dakota, Utah and New Mexico from having to blend biofuels or buy RINs for the 2016 compliance period. The report did not mention any waivers for 2017. The company did not explicitly credit small refinery exemptions for the savings. A company official did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The EPA said it has granted more than two dozen hardship exemptions in recent months to small refineries that say compliance would have been too financially difficult. This was a major expansion of the program. This was a major expansion for waivers. Since the EPA began issuing discretionary exemptions in 2013, the EPA has tended to give out less than 10 such waivers a year, according to former officials. The EPA has said its criteria for granting the waivers has not changed, and that applications are considered on a case by case basis. The expansion of the small refinery waiver program is due in part to a federal court decision last year that said the EPA had been too stingy with the exemptions in the past. But biofuel groups say the EPA has gone beyond the court mandate, and is using the cover of the court to gut the RFS.

2018-05-08,"VIENNA, May 8 (Reuters) - The fate of the landmark nuclear deal signed by Iran and six major powers in July 2015 hangs in the balance ahead of an announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump due on Tuesday at 1800 GMT. European officials said Trump is expected to announce that he is pulling out of the agreement. Below are some key restrictions that the deal, officially called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, imposes on Iran’s nuclear activities. Those restrictions are policed by the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. The biggest obstacle to building a nuclear weapon is obtaining enough fissile material — highly enriched uranium or plutonium — for the core of the bomb. A central aim of the deal was to extend the time Iran would need to do that, if it chose to, to a year from about 2-3 months. The JCPOA, which took effect in January 2016, cuts off the plutonium track while severely restricting uranium enrichment. Iran was building a heavy-water reactor at Arak that could eventually have produced spent fuel from which plutonium could be separated. Under the JCPOA: - The core of that reactor has been removed and filled with concrete to make it unusable - The reactor is being redesigned so as to “minimise the production of plutonium and not to produce weapon-grade plutonium in normal operation”. - All spent fuel from Arak will be shipped out of Iran. (For the reactor’s lifetime) - Iran commits not to engage in reprocessing or reprocessing research activities. (For 15 years) Iran has two vast enrichment sites, at Natanz and Fordow. Much of Natanz is deep underground and Fordow is buried inside a mountain, which is widely believed to protect them from aerial bombardment. The deal allows Iran to continue enrichment at Natanz but with a series of constraints. It turns Fordow into a ""nuclear, physics and technology centre"" where centrifuges are used for purposes other than enrichment, like producing stable isotopes here The JCPOA: - Slashes the number of centrifuges installed in Iran to roughly 6,000 from around 19,000 before the deal here. (For 10 years, though a centrifuge cap at Fordow remains in place for 15 years) - Caps at 3.67 percent the purity to which Iran can enrich uranium — far below the roughly 90 percent threshold of weapons-grade. Before the deal, it enriched uranium to up to 20 percent purity. (For 15 years) - Restricts Iran’s stock of low-enriched uranium to 202.8 kg, or technically 300 kg of uranium hexafluoride (UF6), the gas that is fed into centrifuges. Iran produced more than 15 tonnes of enriched UF6 before the deal. (For 15 years) - Bans enrichment and nuclear material from Fordow. (For 15 years) - Only allows Iran to enrich uranium with its first-generation IR-1 centrifuges. (For 10 years) - Lets Iran carry out research with small numbers of more advanced centrifuges, but without accumulating enriched uranium. The text of the deal also: - Requires Iran to provisionally apply the IAEA Additional Protocol — which grants the agency wide-ranging inspection powers — and “subsequently seek ratification and entry into force”. For more on inspections, click on - Grants U.N. nuclear inspectors daily access to Natanz and Fordow (for 15 years) - Says the deal’s signatories must vet Iran’s purchases of nuclear or dual-use equipment - Bans Iran from carrying out a range of activities that could contribute to making a nuclear bomb, such as computer simulations of a nuclear explosion or designing certain multi-point detonation systems. In some cases, those activities can be carried out with the other signatories’ approval.

2018-05-08,"* U.S.-educated engineer rose through ranks to top job * CEO brushes off boycott as business “stress test” * Al-Kaabi aims to keep Qatar’s No. 1 LNG exporter ranking By Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov DOHA, May 8 (Reuters) - When Qatar’s Gulf neighbours and Egypt sought to isolate Doha with a boycott imposed last year, the nation’s top energy official kept a cool head and ensured oil and gas exports barely felt a hiccup. Saad Al-Kaabi, a U.S.-educated engineer who rose the ranks to become chief executive of Qatar Petroleum (QP) in 2014, had a contingency plan to hand to maintain energy flows that account for 60 percent of the Arab nation’s state revenues. “It was the best stress test we can have for our system to show whether we are really up for a challenge,” Al-Kaabi said in a Reuters interview in Doha, brushing of the boycott’s impact. “When the blockade happened we had a business continuity plan in every company,” he said in his simply furnished, first floor office in the capital of a nation that has become the world’s wealthiest per capita because of its huge gas reserves. His understated office layout gives little indication that Al-Kaabi is one of Qatar’s most powerful figures, a man who is not a member of the ruling family but who has nonetheless climbed to one of the country’s top jobs. He has gained a reputation among executives of the world’s energy majors, such as Exxon, Shell and Total , as a reliable counterpart for energy projects that have made the tiny nation of 2.6 million people the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) on the planet. “QP has been a top partner for many years and Saad made it even more solid,” said an executive at one of the three majors. His steady hand proved critical when neighbours Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, alongside Egypt, severed diplomatic, economic and transport ties in June, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges Qatar denies. The boycott came as a particular surprise given Al-Kaabi had been in talks months earlier to supply gas to Saudi Arabia and increase supplies to UAE. Qatar has continued pumping gas to UAE under existing deals despite the boycott. Undeterred by sanctions, Al-Kaabi announced a plan on July 4 to produce 100 million tonnes of LNG a year, equivalent to a third of current global supplies, in the next five to seven years. Al-Kaabi, who said his business strategy was driven by commercial factors not politics, said the boycott meant Qatar would no longer consider pipelines for gas exports. “Basically the decision was: if this is what they are doing to us I am just going to go full LNG and never think of pipeline supplies in the future,” Al-Kaabi said He added that “if things go back to normal in the future” Qatar’s neighbours could buy LNG rather than piped gas. Al-Kaabi’s restructuring of QP, one of the world’s biggest energy firms with a daily output of 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent, had also put the company on a better footing to manage the challenge of the boycott, although the initial catalyst for corporate changes was the low price of oil. Crude plunged from above $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016, prompting Al-Kaabi and other industry executives to focus on cutting costs and tightening up a corporate structures that had expanded in the oil boom years. “My vision is to focus on our core business and get out of anything that is not core business,” he said. “A lot of people talked about downsizing, I was trying to rightsize QP.” QP integrated Qatar Petroleum International, which had been formed in 2007 as a wholly owned foreign investment arm, and Tasweeq, its marketing arm. He also merged two state-owned LNG producers, Qatargas and RasGas. Al-Kaabi said QP’s operating costs would be 4 billion Qatar riyals ($1.1 billion) a year lower due to the restructuring, which included cutting As many as 8,000 jobs to create a more streamlined operation. Responding to the boycott, QP also said it would set up a fuel oil bunkering business in Qatar after ships heading to Qatar were banned from using the UAE’s Fujairah bunkering hub. Al-Kaabi, who joined QP in 1986 after graduating from Pennsylvania State University, is also chairman of Qatar’s petrochemicals, metals and fertiliser industries, and he sits on the board of Qatar Investment Authority, the world’s ninth largest sovereign wealth fund with about $300 billion in assets. Before becoming QP’s CEO, he had worked in the reservoir and field development department, and then becoming manager of gas development for the North Field, the huge gas reservoir that Qatar shares with Iran on the other side of the Gulf. Al-Kaabi’s vision to develop LNG production beyond Qatar’s borders remains undimmed. “We are not just going to be in Qatar,” he said. “We are always going to strive to be the number one LNG producer in the world for a very long time.” ($1 = 3.6400 Qatar riyals) Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/qatar-energy-qp-ceo/newsmaker-saad-al-kaabi-keeping-qatars-gas-flowing-under-gulf-boycott-idUKL8N1SE3FO,08 May 2018,"When Qatar's Gulf neighbours and

2018-05-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - British regulators have launched an in-depth investigation into the tie-up between the retail power unit of SSE Plc (SSE.L) and Npower, owned by Germany’s Innogy (IGY.DE), saying it may reduce competition and increase prices for some households. The merger would create Britain’s second-largest retail power provider and reduce the “Big Six” dominating the market to five companies when they are already facing political scrutiny for their tariffs and pressure from smaller rivals. It also comes as German energy giants RWE (RWEG.DE) and E.ON (EONGn.DE) plan to carve up Innogy. The deal would make E.ON, another of the “Big Six”, the parent company of Npower. Analysts say this may complicate the SSE-Npower merger. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) warned at the end of April it would launch a deeper probe, which typically lasts 24 weeks and can be extended, unless the two companies propose solutions that would lift its concerns. “SSE and Npower did not offer measures to address the CMA’s concerns, and so it has referred the merger for a more in-depth, Phase 2 investigation,” the regulator said in a statement. “The deadline for the final report is Oct. 22.” Combined, SSE and Npower would have 11.5 million customers, making the new company second only to Centrica’s (CNA.L) British Gas, which has more than 14 million customer accounts. E.ON Chief Financial Officer Marc Spieker said he expected the SSE-Npower deal to go ahead but should it be blocked, E.ON’s own plans for a larger asset swap with Innogy’s parent company, RWE, would not be affected.  Even before the announcement of the merger last November, the industry had faced criticism as household bills doubled over the past decade despite years of market liberalization that was meant to make energy more affordable. Last month, the influential Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee of lawmakers said the deal could damage competition and would reduce consumer choices. They had already called the energy market “broken”.  On Tuesday, however, the two parent companies disagreed. “We did not put forward measures to address the CMA’s concerns because we firmly believe this merger will be good for competition as it stands,” Innogy said in an emailed statement. “It will create an independent, customer-focused company, offering customers a more efficient, improved service - and bring benefits to the wider market as well.” SSE said it was on track to complete the formation and listing of the new company in the last quarter of 2018 or first quarter of 2019 despite the investigation. “A Phase 2 referral is a well-established process for transactions of this nature and we remain confident that the proposed merger will deliver benefits for customers and the energy market as a whole,” SSE Chief Executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said in a statement. The British market is dominated by British Gas, SSE, Iberdrola’s (IBE.MC) Scottish Power, Npower, E.ON and EDF Energy (EDF.PA), which account for about 80 percent of the retail electricity market. But those six companies held 95 percent of the market share just three years ago and have shed customers to much smaller rivals; increasing pressure on their revenues. Additionally, the government plans to impose price caps on the most common tariff from these companies, the standard variable tariff, by the winter of this year to tackle what Prime Minister Theresa May called “rip-off” prices.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A stronger-than-expected rebound in German industrial output in March and an increase in exports in the same month helped to ease concern on Tuesday that growth in Europe’s biggest economy had come to a standstill at the start of the year. The Federal Statistics Office said industrial production rose 1.0 percent on the month, the strongest increase since November and above expectations for a 0.8 percent rise. “The upswing remains intact,” the Economy Ministry said. The government expects growth of 2.3 percent this year, up from 2.2 percent in 2017. Seasonally adjusted exports rose 1.7 percent while imports fell 0.9 percent, widening Germany’s trade surplus to 22 billion euros (19.3 billion pounds) in March, the data showed. “German companies continue to do well on international markets,” said Holger Bingmann, head of the BGA trade body. In the first quarter, exports rose nearly 3 percent on the year, he said, adding: “Trade is still driving the German economy.” U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticised Germany’s export strength, arguing that U.S. import tariffs would protect American manufacturing jobs and reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Germany and other EU countries. The bullish output and export figures brought some relief after weak data for January and February pointed to a massive slowdown in the first quarter. “Rebounding exports and industrial production show that talk of a downswing has been premature,” ING Bank economist Carsten Brzeski said. But given the first two disappointing months, data on overall gross domestic product growth in the first quarter, due next week, are likely to come in weaker than the 0.6 percent registered in the final three months of 2017. Unicredit economist Andreas Rees said the data pointed to a quarterly growth rate of up to 0.4 percent. “Maybe this is just a blip in the first quarter, but this weaker performance could also continue in spring,” Rees added. The outlook for German exporters has clouded as factories face rising protectionism and a stronger euro. This was also reflected in data on Monday, which showed factory orders dropped for a third month running in March as foreign demand weakened. A string of unexpectedly weak economic data had pointed to a cooling in the euro zone economy as a whole, possibly making it more difficult for the European Central Bank to begin scaling back its unprecedented monetary stimulus later this year. In the full first quarter, German industrial output edged up 0.1 percent on the quarter, the Economy Ministry said. “After the strong performance in the course of 2017, production in manufacturing took a breather in the first quarter,” the ministry said. The ministry blamed the slow start to the year on a flu epidemic, an unusually high number of strikes and an above-average number of holidays over Easter falling in March. “After a calm phase, industrial output will gain momentum in the course of the year,” the ministry said, pointing to full order books and favourable economic conditions for trade. The DIW economic institute has said it expected economic growth to slow to 0.4 percent in the first quarter and bounce back to around 0.7 percent in the second. ING’s Brzeski agreed there was little reason to doubt the underlying strength of Germany’s current upswing, which is now in its ninth year. The biggest domestic problem for the German economy is that factories are struggling to increase production, he said, pointing to record employment and widespread labour shortages as well as filled order books and capacity constraints. “Against this background, more investment seems to be the best and easiest way forward. It would increase production capacity and could lift the current speed limits,” he added. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition government has promised to invest billions of euros in digital infrastructure, education and social housing in the coming four years. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz from the centre-left Social Democrats will present the government’s updated tax estimates on Wednesday, which could show additional room for fiscal spending.

2018-05-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmakers cannot be forced to retrofit polluting diesel cars unless excessive pollution is caused by deliberate fraud, an expert report being reviewed by Germany’s transport ministry  showed on Tuesday. The expert opinion supports Germany’s current stance of relying on software upgrades rather than compulsory rebuilds of exhaust management systems on cars with high pollution levels. So far, no manufacturer other than Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has admitted to using software to recognise when a car is being put through an emissions test cycle in order to deliberately mask pollution levels under normal driving conditions. A regulatory clamp-down on toxic emissions has, however, revealed several carmakers often exceed pollution limits because they make use of a so-called “thermal window” to legally throttle back emissions filtering systems to protect engines from condensation. German environmental groups argue upgrades to exhaust systems on polluting cars should be made compulsory, but Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer has said software updates to improve the effectiveness of filtering systems is sufficient. The expert group was divided on the cost and merit of retrofits.  Retrofitting diesel cars would cost at least 5,000 euro (4,395 pounds) per vehicle for cars with Euro-5 engines, and the environmental benefits would only become effective in three to four years, some members said. Others calculated retrofits would cost only about 2,500 euros and recommended them as a viable solution. A federal court ruled in February that German cities could  ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets. Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to avoid such bans, calling instead for tailored solutions to bring down car emissions in heavily polluted cities.  The states of Bavaria and also Lower Saxony, home to Germany’s biggest car manufacturers, want to introduce incentives or tax breaks to encourage car owners to retrofit  vehicles.  Lower Saxony, home to Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest carmaker, suggested vehicle owners should receive up to 2,000 euros in incentives and tax breaks to fund retrofits, the cost of which should be borne by manufacturers and the federal government.  Germany’s finance ministry has shown no willingness to subsidise such incentives. The German car industry, which accounts for some 800,000 jobs in Europe’s biggest economy, is struggling with a global backlash against diesel cars after Volkswagen admitted in 2015 that it had cheated U.S. diesel exhaust tests. On Tuesday, Germany’s transport ministry said Audi, a premium brand owned by Volkswagen, faced another investigation of 30,000 vehicles suspected of being fitted with illegal  software.

2018-05-08,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The semi-autonomous Kurdistan region of northern Iraq, which voted overwhelmingly in favour of independence last year in a referendum rejected by Baghdad, will hold an election on Sept. 30. A Kurdistan Regional Government media official said KRG Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani had approved the date. The vote should elect both a parliament and a president for Kurdish regions which have gained self-rule in 1991, when a U.S-led coalition forced Saddam Hussein’s Iraqi army to withdraw from them in the wake of his eight-month occupation of Kuwait. A federal Iraqi election, which includes the Kurdistan region, is set to take place on Saturday and its results will give clues as to the importance of the different Kurdish political parties. Longtime Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani stepped down from the KRG presidency on Nov. 1 after the independence referendum last September. Opposition to the ruling Kurdish establishment, represented by the Barzani and Talabani dynasties, has become more vocal over the past years, especially after the referendum. The Iraqi government and Shi’ite militias allied to Iran dislodged Kurdish forces from the oil region of Kirkuk in retaliation for the vote, curtailing the oil income of the KRG and leading to an economic crisis in the region. Unpaid public servants hold regular demonstrations in Kurdish cities, and new parties have been formed to challenge the Barzani’s Kurdistan Democratic Party and the Talabani’s Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.  The Kurdish elections were set for Nov. 1 but were delayed as the KRG had to deal with the conflict with Baghdad. Nechirvan Barzani has been exercising the function of the presidency since his uncle Masoud stepped down.  The current parliament was elected in 2013. Gorran, or “Change” movement, and Barham Salih’s Coalition for Democracy and Justice are the main parties challenging the KDP and PUK’s grip on Iraqi Kurdish politics. Salih is himself an ex-KRG prime minister and a PUK dissenter.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) Chief Executive Herbert Diess travelled to the United States last week to testify to authorities there about the carmaker’s emissions scandal, German newspaper Bild reported on Tuesday. At the meeting, which Bild said took place around May 1, Diess spoke with representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the daily newspaper reported, without citing the source of the information. Diess, who joined Volkswagen in July 2015, about two months before the “Dieselgate” scandal broke, was accompanied by Larry Thompson, the U.S. monitor appointed last year to oversee reforms at the German group, the newspaper said. VW declined comment on the report. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that Diess and Thompson had travelled to the U.S. recently for talks with relevant authorities, without being more specific. A second source said Diess had talks with U.S. authorities several months ago and denied that a meeting around May 1 had taken place.  Last week, the U.S. disclosed criminal charges against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn, accusing him of conspiring to cover up the emissions manipulations.  They subsequently issued an arrest warrant against Winterkorn, 70, who resigned days after “Dieselgate” broke in September 2015.  Winterkorn in January 2017 told German lawmakers he had not been informed of the cheating early, and would have halted it had he been aware. The indictment against Winterkorn was filed by the DoJ in secret on March 14, one month before Diess replaced former CEO Matthias Mueller at the helm of Europe’s largest automaker.     Bloomberg reported on Monday that Diess was granted a rare safe-passage deal by the United States, allowing the former BMW (BMWG.DE) executive to travel freely without risk of being arrested in connection with the emissions investigation. A source close to VW said there was nothing unusual about the travel arrangements for Diess. VW declined comment.

2018-05-08,"WARSAW, May 8 (Reuters) - Poland’s imports of Russian oil last year fell to their lowest level since 2005, a central bank report published on Tuesday showed, though Warsaw’s bid to diversify its energy imports also meant paying higher prices. Russian oil accounted for 76 percent of all oil purchases, down from 96 percent in 2012, as state-run refiners PKN Orlen and Lotos increased their purchases of oil from sources other than Russia. PKN Orlen signed a long-term agreement on regular oil supplies with Saudi Aramco in 2016 and since then both PKN and Lotos have also purchased oil from Iran and the United States. But Poland is paying a price for its diversification. While the cost of Russian crude in December averaged $59.70 per barrel, Kazakh oil was $60.20 and U.S. oil $65.60 a barrel, the report said. Polish refineries rely mostly n Russian oil delivered via pipelines built in the 1960s but last year every third barrel of oil imported was shipped, the report also said.

2018-05-08,"(Reuters) - Oil and gas company Energen Corp EGN.N reported higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on Tuesday and raised its production guidance for the year as it seeks to reap the benefits of $70-a-barrel crude. For the year, the company said it now expects annual production in the range of 92,000-99,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) up from the 91,500-98,500 it forecast along with fourth-quarter results in February. “We are pleased to report that we have all of the rigs and services lined up to execute on our 2018 drilling and development plans,” said Chief Executive Officer James McManus. Energen has been shedding non-core assets to focus on its core assets in the Permian basin, the mainly Texas-based oilfield that is the United States’ largest. The company had previously set a three-year timeline to improve production from Delaware and Midland, the two main portions of the Permian. The company, which settled a long tussle with activist investor Keith Meister in March, sold oil at $57.65 per barrel, up from an average of $46.95 per barrel in the same period a year ago. Like many U.S. oil producers, the Alabama-based company has drawn strength from a resurgence in prices of U.S. light crude CLc1, which rose to highs of $66.66 during the quarter after hitting lows of $26.05 in 2016 due to a global crude glut. Energen increased production by 76 percent to 92,900 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the quarter, nearing the higher end of the first quarter guidance the company had set. The company’s net income more than tripled to $118.9 million, or $1.22 per share, in the three months ended March 31 from $33.4 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier.

2018-05-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese trading house Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) on Tuesday said its profit for the last financial year jumped 27 percent to record levels due to stronger prices for coking coal and other commodities, while forecasting another profit-rise this year. Japanese trading houses have been enjoying their best profits in several years, driven by a rally in commodities from coking coal and base metals to oil and natural gas as well as stronger earnings in non-resource businesses. Mitsubishi’s results follow record earnings reported last week by its peer Itochu Corp (8001.T). Mitsui & Co Ltd (8031.T), Sumitomo Corp (8053.T) and Marubeni Corp (8002.T) also booked growth in annual profits on Tuesday. Net profit for Mitsubishi, Japan’s largest trading house by assets, for the year through March 31 came to 560.17 billion yen ($5.1 billion), beating its own estimate of 540 billion yen and a mean estimate of 546.54 billion yen among nine analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The result surpassed its previous highest profit of 471.3 billion yen, reached in the year to March, 2008. “We have fully capitalised on a rally in commodities,” Mitsubishi Corp’s Chief Financial Officer Kazuyuki Masu told a news conference, pointing to higher prices in coking coal, iron ore and copper.  Australian premium coking coal futures in Singapore SCAFc1 had risen nearly 40 percent to around $218 a tonne by the end of March from about $157 a year earlier. They have since eased to around $187 a tonne.  Strong auto sales in Asia, where the company operates auto dealers, and solid performance in the firm’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) business also supported profits, Masu added. For the year that started in April, Mitsubishi forecast its net profit would grow 7 percent to a fresh record of 600 billion yen, above a mean estimate of 568.18 billion yen from nine analysts. To reflect healthy earnings, Mitsubishi increased its annual dividend for the year ended March 31 to 110 yen per share from 80 yen a year earlier, while forecasting 115 yen for this year.

2018-05-08,"CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia’s center-right government said in its annual budget on Tuesday that it would return the country’s finances to a small surplus in 2019/20, a year earlier than planned and after almost a decade of deficits. The improved budgetary position was welcomed by two biggest ratings agencies - Standard & Poor’s Global and Moody’s Investors Service. The ruling Liberal-National coalition also unveiled some big spending measures, including a package of personal income tax cuts for low and middle-income earners, as a revenue windfall from company taxes enabled a shift away from its previous “debt and deficit disaster” rhetoric.  “We are no longer borrowing to pay for everyday expenses,” Treasurer Scott Morrison told reporters. “We have reached a turning point for debt.” Morrison predicted a budget surplus of A$2.2 billion ($1.6 billion) in 2019/20, a remarkable turnaround on the A$2.6 billion deficit forecast in the government’s mid-year review in December. The projected surpluses increase to A$11 billion in 2020/21 and A$16.6 billion in 2021/22. Net debt is seen peaking at 18.6 percent of Australia’s A$1.8 trillion ($1.4 trillion) gross domestic product (GDP) in the current 2017/18, also a year earlier than forecast, before falling to 3.8 percent by 2028/29. In a statement after the budget release, S&P said strength in the Australian and global economies, and “fiscal prudence” by the government, had helped ease negative pressure on the country’s credit rating. It said that global trade tensions may dampen economic growth among Australia’s key trading partners.  “The outlook on the long-term Australian sovereign ratings remains negative for now to reflect these uncertainties,” S&P said. S&P put Australia on a “negative outlook” in mid-2016, citing deteriorating government finances. Moody’s said Australia’s AAA rating continues to reflect its strong institutions and solid growth potential.   On Tuesday, the Australian dollar hit an 11-month low as a rally in its U.S. counterpart overshadowed the upbeat budget.  The marked improvement in Australia’s finances will likely be positive for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after a series of political setbacks. The budget is widely viewed as the unofficial campaign kick-off for federal elections due in the first half of 2019. Morrison maintained the government continued to “live within its means” despite the budget spending splash. The government estimated total 2018/19 revenues would rise to A$486.1 billion, or 25.5 percent of GDP, largely from corporate taxes and as a crackdown on black economic activity and multinational tax avoidance bears fruit. Despite the additional expenditure, spending levels were at just below the 30-year average of 24.8 percent.   Australia’s economy, which has outperformed many rich world peers since the global financial crisis, has now entered a 27th straight year of growth, but the pace has slowed significantly as the country recalibrates following the end of a once-in-a-generation mining investment boom. The government predicted domestic activity would accelerate at 3 percent annually through 2021/22, unchanged from December. Its outlook for unemployment and inflation were also unchanged. The budget included a number of voter-friendly spending plans, as Turnbull seeks to improve his standing after a dual citizenship crisis and a sex scandal involving his deputy, that have seen his popularity plummet in polls from record highs of late 2015. Revelations of serious misconduct in Australia’s powerful banking sector - during an ongoing inquiry the government initially resisted as unnecessary - have ramped up the pressure. The budget did not address that crisis in detail, saying only the government would continue to roll out stronger penalties, powers and enforcement for the sector. It also steered clear of discussing a plan to lower taxes for big businesses, which did not have parliamentary support. A A$13.4 billion four-year income tax package included immediate cuts for low- and mid-income households, and a proposal to flatten the overall tax structure by abolishing the highest income bracket, 37 percent, in 2024/25. The extra money will be welcomed by Australia’s heavily indebted households. Monthly retail sales data released on Tuesday showed spending falling on everything from clothes to restaurants. Paul Dales, Capital Economics’ chief economist for Australia, said the tax cuts probably wouldn’t prompt the central bank to hike interest rates before late 2019. “Overall, the treasurer appears to be using a rosy outlook for the economy to justify income tax cuts and an earlier surplus,” Dales said.  “We believe that low wage growth and a weakening housing market will mean the economy doesn’t live up to those high hopes.” The government will continue its A$75 billion 10-year infrastructure plan to build rail and road projects and a A$30 billion five-year investment plan for hospitals. It will also spend A$2.5 billion in public technology infrastructure, A$1.6 billion in residential aged care and A$294 million to improve national security.

2018-05-08," LONDON (Reuters) - For all the bullish commentary around oil prices at the moment, hedge fund managers have made only minor changes to their overall position in petroleum futures and options in the last few weeks. To the extent they have made any changes at all, fund managers have been reducing rather than adding to bullish positions since the middle of April. (Click here for a chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ImLn8d) Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 28 million barrels in the most recent week. Fund managers have reduced their net long position for two consecutive weeks, to 1.376 billion barrels by May 1 from a recent peak of 1.411 billion barrels on April 17. In a repeat of the week before, the liquidation last week was concentrated in crude oil, while portfolio managers increased their exposure to refined products slightly. Funds cut their net long position in Brent (-21 million barrels) as well as NYMEX and ICE WTI (-12 million barrels). By contrast, they increased their net position in U.S. gasoline (+1 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (+1 million barrels) and European gasoil (+2 million barrels). The fundamental outlook remains fairly bullish with strong growth in oil consumption, continued output restraint by OPEC and a draw down in oil inventories below the five-year average. Production and exports from Venezuela are declining and the United States is threatening to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement which could cut that country’s exports in the coming months. But hedge fund managers have already amassed a near-record bullish position in futures and options contracts linked to crude and fuels. Positioning has become exceptionally stretched and lopsided across the petroleum complex, with hedge funds’ long positions outnumbering short ones by a ratio of almost 12:1 (and as much as 17:1 in the case of Brent). Fund managers show no inclination to add substantially to their existing longs, which may indicate they are fully invested for the time being. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-05-08,"BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - Swedish utility Vattenfall has no legal grounds to ask a U.S. arbitration court if it can claim 4.7 billion euros  ($5.6 billion) from Berlin for forcing it to halt nuclear production, the German government has said in a letter. The letter, seen by Reuters on Tuesday, was addressed to a German lawmaker who had inquired about the government’s position on Vattenfall’s attempts to seek damages from the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). As a non-German company, Vattenfall turned to the ICSID after Germany’s highest court ruled in 2016 that utility companies were allowed to seek limited damages from the German government over hastening the shutdown of nuclear plans after Japan’s Fukushima disaster. Utilities E.ON, RWE and Vattenfall sued the German government, arguing the decision to close all nuclear plants by 2022 amounted to expropriation. “In the pending arbitration case of Vattenfall against the Federal Republic of Germany, the federal government has requested that the arbitration be dismissed,” Deputy Economy Minister Thomas Bareiss wrote in the letter, dated April 21. Vattenfall is expecting a decision from the U.S.-based ICSID this year. Germany has rejected as baseless compensation claims by utilities, arguing its decision to end nuclear power was justified as nuclear risks had changed after the Fukushima meltdown in 2011. It also says a majority of voters back phasing out nuclear power. Vattenfall, much of whose turnover is derived from its activities in Germany, had to permanently idle the Kruemmel and Brunsbuettel reactors in northern Germany in 2011 when the government decided to immediately close old reactors and accelerate the exit programmes for the remaining ones. $1 = 0.8418 euros

2018-05-08,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Siemens (SIEGn.DE) has reached an agreement in principle with trade unions about its plans to cut jobs and restructure its struggling Power and Gas (PG) and Process Industries and Drives (PD) businesses in Germany, it said on Tuesday. The German industrial company is targeting savings of several hundred million euros in the program designed to tackle plummeting demand caused by a switch away from fossil fuel generated electricity to renewable energy sources.  The downturn has dragged down Siemens’ results in recent quarters, with demand for large gas turbines not expected to recover in the near future, according to analysts. Siemens’ rival General Electric (GE.N) has also been hit, and last year announced plans to axe 12,000 jobs at its power business. Power and gas orders at Siemens are expected to drop 23 percent during the company’s second quarter, with results due on  Wednesday, while profit from the division is forecast to plunge 62 percent, according to a Reuters poll. In November, Siemens said it would cut 6,900 jobs worldwide, mainly at the PG division.  Around 3,400 of the jobs will go in Germany. Concrete details of the deal will now be negotiated in the coming months in Germany, Siemens said on Tuesday. Although the company was seeking voluntary job cuts, compulsory redundancies could not be ruled out, it said. “Last November we told you how dramatically and sustained the markets, particularly with regards to fossil fuel energy generation, have been falling ... and how we want to tackle this situation,” said Janina Kugel, Siemens’ chief human resources officer and member of the managing board. An agreement was made with German unions on Monday night after both sides agreed on the need to reduce costs, Kugel said. Siemens’ plants in Berlin, Duisburg and Mulheim  will see job cuts, along with Erfurt after an attempt to sell the site failed. Operations in Offenbach and Erlangen in western Germany will be combined, with the Offenbach site eventually closing. Siemens said it would keep its Goerlitz plant in eastern Germany, which will be transformed into a center for steam turbine production. The company will also look into a possible sale of its operations in Leipzig.  As part of the deal, Siemens said it would invest an extra 100 million euros to develop skills for those whose jobs have been affected by the changing industry, including increased digitalization. German unions said they were pleased the originally planned plant closures had been avoided. Under the original proposals the Goerlitz and Leipzig plants were likely to close. Excluding its services business, the PG division has around 30,000 employees worldwide, of which 12,000 are based in Germany. The cuts are separate from the temporary shutdown at PG sites around the world reported by Reuters on Monday.  Around 30,000 workers globally will be affected by the week-long shutdown, which will take place in May or June.

U.S. President Donald Trump will announce at 1800 GMT whether Washington will withdraw from a deal that eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme. A decision to leave the accord could give another boost to this year’s 13 percent oil rally, by constraining Iranian crude exports. Brent futures nevertheless eased one percent after hitting new highs above $75 a barrel and MSCI’s world equity index hovered around flat after two days of gains, having touched one-week highs in the previous session. “(Trump’s decision) has been so well covered, it’s probably all in the price by now. And most recent commentary seems to be that after all the bluster, he may only partially withdraw from the deal,” said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. Hudson noted that oil prices had bucked the recent rise in the dollar - usually the two are inversely correlated - suggesting investors remained optimistic about the world economy and hence future demand for crude. “It’s telling you that people are still in glass-half-full mode as far as the economy is concerned,” Hudson said. Downplaying concerns that oil’s rise could stoke inflation and dent company profits, she added: “I don’t think energy costs for many companies these days are a big enough proportion of their cost base, especially for tech and service sector shares.” Wall Street was lifted on Monday by a strong rally in Apple shares to new record highs following forecast-beating results last week and billionaire Warren Buffett’s decision to increase his stake in the firm. Nearly 80 percent of the S&P 500 companies which have reported first quarter earnings have topped profit estimates, according to Thomson Reuters. MSCI’s global tech index closed Monday at six-week highs . That helped lift emerging Asian shares by 0.5 percent and Japanese equities by 0.2 percent . Momentum fizzled in Europe, however, with a pan-European equity benchmark and European tech down 0.2 percent . Futures for S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq also slipped about 0.2 percent, signalling Wall Street weakness . Italian shares were the day’s worst performers, slipping 1.5 percent as chances grew of new elections following an inconclusive March 4 vote. Italian 10-year bond yields rose almost nine basis points to end-March highs. “It’s not a good day for Italian assets. Markets are starting to feel the pressure of elections,” said Carlo Franchini, head of institutional clients at Italy’s Banca Ifigest. Italy’s fragile economic recovery was at risk, he added. Countering this was good news from China, where April exports and imports beat forecasts. Trade tensions between China and the United States also seem to have abated slightly, with talks resuming next week. Mainland Chinese shares rose 1.3 percent. On currencies, the prospect of solid U.S. growth propelled the dollar to a new 2018 high Expectations of further rises in U.S. interest rates are forcing investors to buy back dollars they sold earlier this year on worries about Trump’s protectionist policies. “For the foreseeable future attractive interest rates at favourable risk conditions will only be on offer in the United States,” Commerzbank said, referring to the fading likelihood of near-term policy tightening in Europe and Japan. The euro fell 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.1977 , the lowest since end-December.

2018-05-08,"BONN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany must build new power transmission lines if it wants to nearly double its renewable energy share by 2030 - a challenge given that grid expansion is already behind target, the head of the federal network regulator said on Tuesday. “There is a simple correlation, the more volatile renewables there are, the more the grids will have to be expanded,” said Jochen Homann, president of the Bundesnetzagentur, responsible for keeping the lights on in Europe’s biggest economy. Germany aims to raise wind and solar power’s energy share from a third now to 65 percent by 2030 to help cut carbon dioxide emissions and achieve its climate commitments, in line with the wishes of the new coalition government. Before these goals were set, the Bundesnetzagentur or Federal Network Agency had made plans based on a renewable share of 47.5-52.5 percent by 2030, Homann told a news conference. “Now we’re dealing with significantly more,” he said. Germany is set to quit nuclear power by 2023, losing 11,000 megawatts (MW) of reliable capacity between 2016 and then.  While Germany’s renewable power capacity of around 100,000 MW can theoretically meet 100 percent of demand under favourable weather conditions, the problem is that, if the weather turns, there can be next to no green power. Bundesnetzagentur data show that of some 5,900 kms (3,700 miles) of additional grids and power line improvements planned to accommodate the rise of renewable installations in the next decade, only 450 km have been approved and 150 km have been implemented. The picture for plans up to 2020 is a bit more favourable. Power network operators overseen by the authority expect that around 80 percent of the 1,800 km of new lines due to be completed by that date can be achieved. Even if digitalisation meant that existing networks could be better tapped, as unused resources could be better allocated, “this must not come at the expense of security,” Homann said. Transmission grid firms, dependent on weather patterns, reduce or add power capacity to grids to keep supply stable. Costs for such measures have been exploding due to the volatile nature of renewables, posing a burden for consumers, who share these as part of their final bills. Last year should have seen another rise to above 1 billion euros (879 million pounds) in these so-called “re-dispatch” costs, after 2016 was below and those in 2015 above that figure, Homann said. To ensure grid stability next winter, the authority said last week it foresees network reserve needs of 6,600 MW, well down from 10,400 MW in the winter just past. This is because Germany’s and Austria’s power market zones will be split from October 2018, allowing for lower costs and fewer technical risks in cross-border power flows.

2018-05-08,"LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices are at more than three-year highs, driven by an expectation that renewed U.S. sanctions on Tehran over the country’s nuclear programme will disrupt Iranian crude flows. But without the Europe Union, or Iran’s other big crude customers, joining the effort, as the EU did in 2012, it will be harder for Washington to hit Iran where it really hurts. U.S. President Donald Trump has given Britain, France and Germany a May 12 deadline to fix what he views as the flaws of the 2015 nuclear deal, or he will reimpose sanctions. Trump has all but decided to withdraw from the agreement, sources said, though exactly how he will do so remains unclear. Europe now buys close to a quarter of all Iranian oil exports, yet it is still the Asian heavyweights — China, India, Korea and Japan — that take the bulk of the shipments. Turkey is Iran’s other major non-Asian buyer and flows there have nearly trebled since January 2016, rising by 170,000 bpd. Since January 2016, Iran’s crude output has risen by around a quarter, or 800,000 bpd, to 3.82 million bpd, making it the sixth largest oil producer in the world. Exports meanwhile, have more than doubled to record highs of 2.6 million bpd this April, up around 1.5 million bpd in the same time, most of which has been driven by shipments to refineries in the European Union. France, Italy, Spain and Greece are Iran’s biggest EU customers and Europe’s share of the pie is a full 600,000 bpd larger now than it was in early 2016. Over the three years of record global surplus of oil and refined products and rock-bottom prices, Iran has learned to do more with less. According to the IMF, Iran will need an average oil price of $58.80 a barrel in 2018 to balance its budget, down from $100 back in 2014.

2018-05-08,"May 8 (Reuters) - Nikol Pashinyan, the Armenian opposition figure who led mass protests against the ruling establishment, was elected on Tuesday to become the ex-Soviet state’s prime minister. Here are some details about him: * Pashinyan was born in Ijevan, northeastern Armenia, in 1975. * He worked as a journalist and produced work critical of Robert Kocharyan and Serzh Sarksyan, the two men who have dominated political life in Armenia since the late 1990s. He rose to be editor of Armenian newspaper Haykakan Zhamanak. * During the 2008 presidential campaign, Pashinyan aligned himself with Levon Ter-Petrosyan, Armenia’s first president since it became an independent state in 1991, who was making an unsuccessful comeback bid. * Pashinyan was imprisoned in June 2009 on charges of fomenting unrest during post-election protests that turned violent. Pashinyan was sentenced to four years in prison. He was released two years later under an amnesty. * In the 2017 parliamentary election, Pashinyan was elected a member of the national assembly. * Pashinyan emerged as the leader of a protest movement after Sarksyan, forced to step down as president because of constitutional term limits, announced he would seek to become prime minister instead. After days of mass protests, Sarksyan announced he was quitting the prime minister’s post. * Pashinyan has not questioned Armenia’s geopolitical alignment with Russia under Sarksyan and his criticism has focused on domestic issues such as corruption and poverty. * In public appearances, he often wears a camouflage T-shirt and cap, though he swapped that outfit for a jacket and tie last week when he asked parliament to choose him as the next prime minister.

2018-05-08,"NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to lay out his plans for the nation’s biofuel policy on Tuesday in a closed door briefing with senators, after months of hearing arguments about the hotly contested regulation, according to two sources. The meeting could bring to an end a tumultuous several months of talks between Big Corn and Big Oil over the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, discussions that were mediated by the White House and intended to help oil refiners cope with the costs of the regulation. “The White House is saying this is the last meeting, so we are expecting some type of resolution or some plan going forward,” said one of the sources. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst of major corn growing state Iowa will attend the meeting, along with Republican Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, whose constituents include big oil refining companies, the sources said on Monday, asking not to be named. The RFS requires refining companies to mix increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year, or purchase credits from companies that do. The policy is intended to help farmers and cut petroleum imports. But some merchant refiners, like PBF Energy and Valero Energy Corp, say it costs them hundreds of millions of dollars annually. The Trump administration waded into the issue late last year after fielding complaints from the refining sector, and hosted a series of meetings with lawmakers and company executives representing both sides. But the talks ended in dispute, with both sides complaining that they were not getting what they wanted. At one point, Trump threw his support behind a proposal from Cruz to cap compliance credits at 10 cents apiece - a fraction of the current level - to reduce refiner costs. But the administration backed off the idea after corn states said it would weaken the incentive to blend biofuels. Trump had also said he supports the idea of expanding sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, a concession to the corn industry, but a drawback for the oil industry which complains it would reduce petroleum’s share of the fuel market. The sources familiar with Tuesday’s meeting said they did not know what, if any, new ideas Trump might propose. Both the corn lobby and the merchant refining industry say a misstep could threaten the same blue-collar jobs Trump has vowed to support. But pressure to rein in regulatory costs has also softened in recent weeks as the price of compliance credits have hit five-year lows of around 30 cents. Those declines were driven mainly by news the Environmental Protection Agency had granted more than two dozen hardship exemptions from the RFS to small refineries that say compliance would have been too financially difficult. In the past, the EPA has tended to give out less than ten such waivers annually, according to former officials. The expansion of the small refinery waiver program is due in part to a federal court decision last year that said the EPA had been too stingy with the exemptions in the past. But biofuel groups say the EPA is using the cover of the court to gut the RFS.

2018-05-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s exports rebounded more strongly than expected in April after a surprise drop the previous month, suggesting global demand remains relatively resilient and providing a cushion to the economy amid a heated trade dispute with the United States. Imports in April also grew more robustly than anticipated, signalling China’s domestic demand is holding up well, good news for policymakers looking to soften the blow from any trade shocks.  China’s April exports rose 12.9 percent from a year earlier,  beating analysts’ forecasts for a 6.3 percent increase and snapping back from a 2.7 percent drop in March that economists believe was heavily distorted by seasonal factors. Some analysts, however, warned the strong April export showing was mostly seasonal and that a multi-year global trade recovery may have topped out. “Shipments still look healthy but today’s data does point to a softening in external demand recently,” Capital Economics senior China Economist Julian Evans-Pritchard wrote in a note, estimating that exports by volume may have actually slipped on a month-on-month basis.  “The backdrop of the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the U.S. is one in which global growth has already peaked and China’s export performance is waning as a result.”  Still, China has outperformed other major Asian trade-reliant economies such as Japan and South Korea recently, suggesting its exporters may be ramping up shipments of finished goods and purchases of raw materials and parts in case of  supply chain disruptions following both sides’ tariff threats. “We may see some retreat in exports in the following months,” said Betty Wang, senior China Economist at ANZ, referring to the risk of a slowdown after a burst of “front-loading” by shippers eager to beat any punitive measures. Export growth was led by a 20.7 percent increase in shipments of high-tech products, led by mobile phones. Imports also beat expectations, growing 21.5 percent on-year, beating forecasts of 16 percent growth, and accelerating from a 14.4 percent rise in March. The strong readings suggest China’s domestic demand remains resilient despite rising corporate borrowing costs and cooling property sales, the two risk factors most commonly cited by economists who are expecting a slowdown. Imports were drive by China’s continued appetite for  resources and agricultural commodities but also by hi-tech products, especially electronic integrated circuits, which have surged 36 percent since the start of the year. The tech buying binge comes as China’s strategic industrial policies come under increased global scrutiny due to complaints about forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft, with integrated circuits, or chips, an especially sensitive area. China imported $94.7 billion (70 billion pounds) of chips in the first four months of the year, accounting for nearly 15 percent of total imports and possibly pointing to solid growth in electronics exports for at least a few more months.   The world’s two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars’ worth of exports in recent months, leading to worries that Washington and Beijing may plunge into a full-scale trade war that could damage global growth and destabilise financial markets. While economists still believe a compromise can be reached and the worst-case scenario avoided, the risk of disruptions in trade and investment have added to existing concerns about an economic slowdown in China this year. High-level discussions between the two sides in Beijing last week appeared to make little substantive progress in defusing trade tensions apart from an agreement to hold more talks. China’s top economic official will visit Washington next week to resume trade talks with the Trump administration, the White House said on Monday. The Trump administration has drawn a hard line, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States by 2020, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, according to people familiar with the top-level U.S.-China talks last Friday. President Xi Jinping pledged recently to increase imports, in comments that were seen as a bid to defuse tensions with the United States and other trading partners. But, highlighting the challenge of reducing that gap any time soon, China’s trade surplus with the United States widened to $22.19 billion in April, from $15.43 billion in March, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data released on Tuesday. For January-April, it rose to $80.4 billion, from about $71 billion in the same period last year. China’s exports to the United States rose 9.7 percent in April from a year earlier, slowing from a 14.8 percent rise in the first quarter. Its imports from the U.S. rose 20.3 percent in April, the fastest growth in three months. China posted a total trade surplus of $28.78 billion for the month, compared with forecasts for a $24.7 billion surplus in April and a rare deficit of $4.98 billion in March. While neither the United States nor China has set a hard time frame for imposition of tariffs, the threat of disruptions and higher costs may already be altering global trade patterns as well as companies’ production and marketing strategies. Companies in both countries have said that they are adjusting business plans and becoming more cautious in the face of the worsening trade environment and the threat of more tariffs. China’s global exports of steel and aluminium — a major point of contention with Washington and other countries — both rose in April as U.S. tariffs and sanctions caused a spike in global prices, prompting mills and smelters to send more metal abroad, analysts said.

Fortum last year agreed to buy a 46.65 percent stake in energy group Uniper from E.ON (EONGn.DE) for 3.8 billion euros ($4.5 billion), despite opposition from Uniper’s management which has argued the two companies are not a good fit. Last month, Fortum won approval from a government commission in Russia to buy up to 50 percent in Uniper, marking a key step in getting the deal done, but Fortum also said Uniper’s management had actively worked against the deal there. “We’ve done nothing wrong,” Uniper CEO Klaus Schaefer told analysts during a call to discuss first-quarter results, adding the company’s behavior had been open and transparent with regard to both Fortum and Russian officials. “In view of the situation after the decision in Russia, which is tolerable for both sides, I’m not quite seeing why Fortum appears to be somewhat annoyed,” Schaefer added. A Fortum spokeswoman said the company stood by its previous accusations, but declined to comment further. It expects to get final regulatory clearances for the acquisition by the middle of the year. Uniper shareholder Cornwall Luxembourg S.a.r.l., which Schaefer says is backed by activist investor Elliott Management, will propose appointing a special auditor at Uniper’s annual general meeting on June 6 to identify possible breaches of duty and violations of the law by members of the management board.

2018-05-08,"* Pace of growth, though faster in 2018, is expected to plateau * Growing number of countries in debt distress or at risk of it * African governments increasingly tapping global debt markets By Kwasi Kpodo ACCRA, May 8 (Reuters) - Sub-Saharan African nations are at growing risk of debt distress because of heavy borrowing and gaping deficits, despite an overall uptick in economic growth, the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday. The sober assessment comes as African countries continue to tap international debt markets and issue record levels of debt in foreign currencies, spurred on by insatiable investor demand for yields. In its economic outlook for the region released in Accra Ghana, the Fund projected the rate of economic expansion would rise to 3.4 percent this year, up from 2.8 percent in 2017, boosted by global growth and higher commodity prices. Slower growth in South Africa and Nigeria - the continent’s two largest economies - weighed on the region-wide average, but the IMF expects growth to pick up in around two-thirds of African nations. However, under current policies, that rate is expected to plateau below 4 percent over the medium term. Meanwhile, around 40 percent of low-income countries in the region are now in debt distress or at high risk of it, the IMF said. And refinancing that debt could soon become more costly. “The current growth spurt in advanced economies is expected to taper off, and the borrowing terms for the region’s frontier markets will likely become less favourable ... which could coincide with higher refinancing needs for many countries across the region,” it said. African governments issued a record $7.5 billion in sovereign bonds last year, 10 times more than in 2016. And they have issued or plan to issue over $11 billion in additional debt in the first half of 2018 alone, the report said. Foreign currency debt increased by 40 percent from 2010-13 to 2017 and now accounts for about 60 percent of the region’s total public debt on average, IMF data showed. Average interest payments, meanwhile, increased from 4 percent of expenditures in 2013 to 12 percent in 2017. Six countries - Chad, Eritrea, Mozambique, Congo Republic, South Sudan and Zimbabwe - were judged to be in debt distress at the end of last year. And the IMF’s ratings for Zambia and Ethiopia were changed from moderate to “high risk of debt distress.” The IMF conceded that Africa’s enormous needs will continue to demand heavy investments to build infrastructure and social development. But to do so while avoiding the risk of a debt trap the continent, which currently has the lowest revenue-to-GDP ratio in the world, will need to become more self-reliant. “With debt vulnerabilities rising in the region, sub-Saharan African countries will need to further rely on sustainable sources of financing, making domestic revenue mobilisation one of the most urgent policy challenges for the region,” it said.

2018-05-08,"* Brent crude stays near $75 on worries U.S. may exit nuclear deal * Dollar surges to new 2018 high on relative strength of US growth * Resilient tech sector underpins world shares after two days of gains By Sujata Rao LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased on Tuesday from 3-1/2-year highs hit on worries the United States may be set to pull out of a key nuclear accord with Iran, while robust tech sector gains in Asia helped support world stocks. U.S. President Donald Trump will announce at 1800 GMT whether Washington will withdraw from a deal that eased economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear programme. A decision to leave the accord could give another boost to this year’s 13 percent oil rally, by constraining Iranian crude exports. Brent futures nevertheless eased 0.8 percent after hitting new highs above $75 a barrel and MSCI’s world equity index inched a touch higher after two days of gains and having touched one-week highs in the previous session. “(Trump’s decision) has been so well covered, it’s probably all in the price by now. And most recent commentary seems to be that after all the bluster, he may only partially withdraw from the deal,” said Frances Hudson, global thematic strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. She noted that oil prices had bucked a recent rise in the dollar — usually the two are inversely correlated — suggesting investors remained optimistic about the world economy and hence future demand for crude. The dollar surged to a new 2018 high versus a basket of currencies. “It’s telling you that people are still in glass-half-full mode as far as the economy is concerned and despite the recent weak data in Europe. Growth remains on a an even keel in most places,” Hudson added. Wall Street was lifted on Monday by a strong rally in Apple shares to new record highs following forecast-beating results last week and Warren Buffett’s decision to increase his stake in the firm. MSCI’s global tech index closed Monday at six-week highs and the gains fed into Asian tech companies, boosting emerging Asian shares by 0.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei index by 0.2 percent. Momentum fizzled in Europe, however, with a pan-European index trading flat and Europe’s tech index down 0.2 percent. Italian shares slipped 1.5 percent, albeit from nine-year highs as chances grew of new elections following an inconclusive March 4 vote. Equity futures signalled a weaker open for Wall Street . ASI’s Hudson also played down fears that a fresh oil price rise could further stoke global worries about inflation and growth, especially after some multinational companies warned that rising input costs could dent future profits. “I don’t think energy costs for many companies these days are a big enough proportion of their cost base, especially for tech and service sector shares,” she said, noting the tech sector’s resilience. There was some good news from China as Beijing reported that April exports and imports had beaten forecasts. Trade tensions between China and the United States also seem to have abated slightly, with talks set to resume next week. That helped lift China’s blue-chip CSI300 index 1.3 percent. In currency markets, the prospect of solid U.S. economic growth, helped by Trump’s tax cuts and spending, propelled the dollar to a new 2018 high against a basket of currencies. The greenback is being supported by expectations of further rises in U.S. interest rates, which are prompting investors to buy back dollars they had sold earlier this year on worries about Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “For the foreseeable future attractive interest rates at favourable risk conditions will only be on offer in the United States,” Commerzbank analysts said, referring to the fading likelihood of policy tightening in Europe and Japan. The euro fell 0.3 percent against the dollar to $1.1977 , the lowest since end-December. The dollar gains have rippled through foreign exchange markets in recent days, prompting investors to unwind some of this year’s best performing trades, especially in emerging markets. The combination of higher oil prices, a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates is risky for some emerging market assets as it could significantly worsen their trade balance and possibly make it harder to service dollar-denominated debt. JPMorgan’s index of sovereign emerging dollar debt saw spreads over Treasuries surge to the highest since early-2017 while currencies such as the Indian rupee and Indonesian rupiah fell to multi-month lows.

Qatar is one of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ smallest producers but is also one of the most influential players in the global liquefied natural gas (LNG) market due to its annual production of 77 million tonnes. “We are in Mexico, we are in Brazil, we are contemplating investing in the U.S. in many areas, in shale gas, in conventional oil. We are looking at many things,” Al-Kaabi said in an interview at QP’s headquarters in Doha. “We are looking very critically at the United States because we have a position there. We have the Golden Pass that we are investing in,” he said.  Qatar Petroleum is the majority owner of the Golden Pass LNG terminal in Texas, with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) holding smaller stakes. Al-Kaabi said “depending on the project’s cost and feasibility” he expects to take a final investment decision on expanding the Golden Pass LNG by the end of the year.  “I’m not in the business of infrastructure. I’m not going to have a liquefaction plant only. It has to be something that will be linked with an upstream business that we would buy in the U.S. so we need to be naturally hedged,” he added. To maintain its dominance in the United States and Australia, QP is cutting costs at home and seeking to expand overseas through joint ventures with international companies. “We will always go with one of our international partners that we have business with here in Qatar,” Al-Kaabi said. “Some of our partners want to divest, some of our partners want to acquire something together.” QP is focusing on other opportunities in Mexico, Latin America, Africa and in the Mediterranean, he said. QP is also looking to enter Mozambique, where Exxon and Eni operate, he added.  Al-Kaabi said the share of overseas upstream production will be “a good portion” in the long-term but it won’t compare to its share at home. “Our strategy says we are going to expand in upstream business with a little bit of downstream that will be connected to some other businesses that we are doing and a few one-off deals in petrochemicals,” he said. For Qatar, which is locked in a dispute with four Arab states, broadening its investments outside the Middle East would cement its position as the world’s largest LNG supplier and help it to weather the boycott with its neighbours. In June last year, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic, economic and transport ties with Qatar, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies. In an apparent show of strength, a month later QP announced plans to raise LNG production capacity by 30 percent to 100 million tonnes per year.  Qatar has lifted a self-imposed ban on the development of the North Field, the world’s biggest natural gas field, which it shares with Iran, in April last year and announced a new project to develop its southern section, increasing output in five to seven years. The announcement came at a time of an oversupply in the LNG market, but Al-Kaabi said such a glut would disappear in 2021-2022 driven by the rising demand for gas amid the global move towards cleaner fuels and climate change concerns. QP has selected Japan’s Chiyoda Corp (6366.T) for the front-end engineering and design (FEED) of the onshore facilities of the North Field expansion project and awarded McDermott (MDR.N) a contract for the offshore engineering work, Al-Kaabi said.  QP has abandoned plans to debottleneck its existing liquefaction trains because it involved shutdowns and prompted safety concerns, and opted to build three new LNG trains, he said. “Stay tuned,” Al-Kaabi said, when asked if QP’s announcement that the award to Chiyoda included a pre-investment for a fourth train as had been announced. If QP decided to build a fourth train, that could mean possibly expanding gas production beyond 100 million tonnes per year. Al-Kaabi said QP will award the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the first LNG train by the end of next year, with its start-up set for the end of 2023. QP is in talks with international oil companies for the new expansion project. Oil companies operating in Qatar now include Exxon, Total (TOTF.PA) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L). QP will make a decision on the foreign partners by the end of 2018, Al-Kaabi said. “There are some new companies that have come and put forward some proposals ... but I don’t see the face of what we are doing and the companies that we have changing much.”     Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Louise Heavens",https://uk.reuters.com/article/qatar-energy-qp/exclusive-qatar-petroleum-ceo-says-pushing-ahead-with-expansion-despite-gulf-embargo-idUKL8N1SF2RA,08 May 2018,"State energy giant Qatar Petroleum

2018-05-08,"BERLIN, May 8 (Reuters) - Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess travelled to the United States this month to testify to authorities there about the carmaker’s emissions scandal, German newspaper Bild reported on Tuesday. Diess, who took office last month after his predecessor Matthias Mueller was ousted as CEO by major stakeholders, spoke with representatives of the U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Bild said, without citing the source of the information. Diess, who joined Volkswagen (VW) in July 2015, about two months before the “Dieselgate” scandal broke, was accompanied by Larry Thompson, the U.S. monitor appointed last year to oversee reforms at the German group, the newspaper said. VW declined comment on the report. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that Diess and Thompson had travelled to the U.S. recently for talks with relevant authorities, without being more specific. Last week, the U.S. filed criminal charges against former VW CEO Martin Winterkorn accusing him of conspiring to cover up the emissions manipulations. They subsequently issued an arrest warrant against Winterkorn, 70, who resigned days after “Dieselgate” broke in September 2015. Bloomberg reported on Monday that Diess was granted a rare safe-passage deal by the U.S., allowing the former BMW executive to travel freely without risk of being arrested in connection with the emissions investigation. A source close to VW said there was nothing unusual about the travel arrangements for Diess. VW declined comment.

2018-05-08,"(Adds background) LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - Iran seeks constructive relations with the world but will continue domestic development despite possible sanctions, President Hassan Rouhani said on Tuesday, hours before U.S. President Donald Trump announces a decision on Iran’s nuclear deal. Trump has repeatedly threatened to withdraw from the deal, which lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear ambitions, unless European allies who also signed the deal fix what he has called its shortcomings. Trump will announce his final decision on Tuesday 1800 GMT. “The foundation of our foreign policy is constructive relations with the world,” Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television. “If we are under sanctions or not, we should stand on our own feet. This is very important for the development of our country,” Rouhani said in a meeting with oil managers in Tehran. Iran said on Monday that its oil industry would continue to develop even if the United States re-imposed sanctions on Tehran. Sanctions imposed on Iran in early 2012 by the United States and European Union over its nuclear programme cut Iran’s crude exports from a peak of 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) before the sanctions to a little more than one million bpd. But Iran re-emerged as a major oil exporter in January 2016 when international sanctions were suspended.

2018-05-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund said on Tuesday it would support a resolution to be presented at Kinder Morgan’s (KMI.N) annual general meeting calling on the U.S. energy infrastructure firm to reduce its methane emissions.  The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund is seeking to get the 9,000 firms it invests in to disclose non-financial data, including on carbon emissions, and to stress tests their businesses against the risks posed by climate change. “We will support the shareholder resolution asking for a report reviewing Kinder Morgan’s policies, actions and plans to measure, monitor, mitigate, disclose and set quantitative reduction targets for methane emissions from all operations, including storage and transportation,” it said in a statement. Kinder Morgan owns and controls oil and gas pipelines and terminals in North America.  The motion is one of three motions to be presented by some shareholders of Kinder Morgan that the fund will support and that Kinder Morgan’s management opposes, fund data shows.  The other two are shareholder proposals for the firm to have a report on sustainability and another for it to assess the impact on its portfolio of policies to limit a rise in global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).  The fund has a stake of 0.87 percent in Kinder Morgan valuing it at $352 million at end-2017. It rarely discloses its voting intentions ahead of time.

2018-05-08,"(Adds details, quotes, analyst comment) MOSCOW, May 8 (Reuters) - Russian steelmaker MMK on Tuesday reported core first-quarter earnings of $560 million, up 23.9 percent compared with the same period last year, missing analysts’ forecasts. Analysts in a Reuters poll had expected MMK, controlled by Russian businessman Viktor Rashnikov, to report a 26 percent rise in earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to $571 million. On a quarterly basis, EBITDA fell 5.4 percent, as higher raw material prices and a stronger rouble drove up the cost of sales, MMK said. MMK said rising sales volumes and prices helped to boost revenues by 23.8 percent year-on-year to $2.06 billion in the first quarter of 2018. MMK’s board on Tuesday recommended dividends of 0.801 roubles per share for the first quarter, which amounts to approximately $145 million or 100 percent of free cash flow for the period, the company said. “Dividends are stronger than expected, but lower versus peers, so they will not be a driver for the street to shift attention to MMK,” BCS Global Markets analyst Oleg Petropavlovsky said. Looking ahead to the next quarter, MMK said it expected healthy domestic demand, but sales could be restrained by scheduled equipment maintenance. “The company’s financial performance will be driven by higher prices for steel on the domestic market amid the seasonal recovery in demand and devaluation of the rouble, along with correction in prices for key raw materials,” MMK said.

European shares are seen steady to slightly firmer after Asian shares picked up, helped by technology stocks as generally upbeat earnings overcame weakness in the global smartphone market and concerns about more regulation. Spread-betters expect Britain’s FTSE to rise 0.2 percent and Germany’s Dax to inch up 0.1 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures on Monday rose above $70 for the first time since November 2014, putting it more than 18 percent above this year’s low touched in February. On Tuesday, some of those oil-price gains were pared as traders took profit after Trump said in a tweet he would announce his decision on the nuclear deal at 1800 GMT Tuesday. “The oil market has priced in the high likelihood of Trump withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran. If he is going to impose sanctions similar to those the U.S. had in 2012, that would likely cause a shortage in oil,” said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. Adding to market pressures, falls in Venezuelan oil production due to problems at the country’s oil company PDVSA also added to the rally. U.S. crude futures last traded at $70.11 per barrel, down 0.9 percent from Monday’s settlement price. Global benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $75.64 per barrel, down 0.7 percent, having risen as high as $76.34 on Monday. While caution on Trump’s statement kept investors edgy in early trade, technology firms helped to generate gains for Asian equities. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.6 percent, with information technology shares rising 1.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.2 percent higher. Some analysts cautioned that the rally in technology shares could face a short-term correction as valuations soar. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo, noted that technology shares have been moving higher, taking up a larger share of indices as more money flows into the exchange trade funds (ETF) market. There is currently a “positive feedback loop”, but if some sort of unforeseen negative event takes place, it “may turn into a negative feedback loop,” he said. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.3 percent after the White House said on Monday that U.S.-China trade talks would resume next week. On Tuesday, China reported exports and imports jumped in April, beating forecasts, but the news did not impact markets. On Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 gained 0.35 percent, boosted by Apple’s sixth straight day of gains. In currency markets, the dollar broadly held firm on the prospect of solid U.S. economic growth, helped partly by Trump’s tax cuts and spending, pointed to further rises in U.S. interest rates down the road. That prompted investors to buy back dollars they had sold earlier this year on worries about Trump’s protectionist trade policies. The euro hit a four-month low of $1.1897 on Monday and last stood at $1.1930. Against the yen, the dollar stood little changed at 108.93 yen, off its three-month high of 110.05 yen. The combination of higher oil prices, a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates is risky for some emerging market assets as it could significantly worsen their trade balance and also encourage investors to shift funds to higher-yielding U.S. assets. “The emerging market currencies are now playing catch up with some of the excessive losses seen in developed currencies ... Asian currencies have also fallen victim to the latest round of USD buying momentum,” Jameel Ahmad, Global Head of Currency Strategy & Market Research at FXTM wrote in a note. JPMorgan’s emerging market bond index hit its lowest level in more than a year. The Indian rupee hit a 15-month low while the Indonesian rupiah hit its lowest level since December 2015 on Tuesday. Dhian Karyantono, fixed income analyst at Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said that the rupiah had weakened after weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth data. Indonesia’s economy grew at 5.06 percent in January-March, down from 5.19 percent in the previous quarter. The divergence between developed and emerging markets was also visible in equity prices. Brazil’s Bovespa hit three-month lows on Monday, when Germany’s Dax hit three-month highs and Italian shares hit 8-1/2-year highs. Additional reporting by Gayatri Suroyo in JAKARTA; Editing by

April shipments were 39.46 million tonnes, or 9.6 million barrels per day (bpd), the General Administration of Customs said, beating the previous daily record of 9.57 million bpd set in January. That compared with 39.17 million tonnes in April last year. Imports for the first four months of 2018 rose 8.9 percent versus the same period a year ago to 151.43 million tonnes, or 9.21 million bpd. “Both state-run and independent plants were ramping up refinery production supported by steady margins,” said Gao Lei, analyst with China Sublime Information Group based in the eastern province of Shandong. Independent plants in Shandong have also received some backlog cargoes from the previous month, said Gao. Tuesday’s data also showed China’s refined fuel exports were 46-percent higher than a year earlier at 5.12 million tonnes, but eased from a record-high in March at 6.69 million tonnes.

2018-05-08,"* U.S. crude stays near $70 on worries U.S. may exit nuclear deal * Dollar near 2018 high on relative strength of US growth * Resilient tech sector underpins Asian shares * China shares rise as U.S.-China trade talks set to resume By Hideyuki Sano and Andrew Galbraith TOKYO/SHANGHAI, May 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices eased slightly on Tuesday, a day after hitting 3-1/2 year highs, as investors braced for President Donald Trump’s decision on whether to withdraw the United States from the Iran nuclear deal, a move that could disrupt global oil supply. Asian shares picked up, helped by technology stocks as generally upbeat earnings overcame weakness in the global smartphone market and concerns about more regulation. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures on Monday rose above $70 for the first time since November 2014, putting it more than 18 percent above this year’s low touched in February. On Tuesday, some of those oil-price gains were pared as traders took profit after Trump said in a tweet he would announce his decision on the nuclear deal at 1800 GMT Tuesday. “The oil market has priced in the high likelihood of Trump withdrawing from the nuclear deal with Iran. If he is going to impose sanctions similar to those the U.S. had in 2012, that would likely cause a shortage in oil,” said Tatsufumi Okoshi, senior commodity economist at Nomura Securities. Adding to market pressures, falls in Venezuelan oil production due to problems at the country’s oil company PDVSA also added to the rally. U.S. crude futures last traded at $69.97 per barrel, down 1.1 percent from Monday’s settlement price. Global benchmark Brent crude futures stood at $75.54 per barrel, down 0.8 percent, having risen as high as $76.34 on Monday. While caution on Trump’s statement kept investors edgy in early trade, technology firms helped to generate gains for Asian equities. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.6 percent, with information technology shares rising 1.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was 0.3 percent higher. Tech shares also lifted South Korea’s Kospi index, which rose 0.4 percent. Some analysts cautioned that the rally in technology shares could face a short-term correction as valuations soar. Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo, noted that technology shares have been moving higher, taking up a larger share of indices as more money flows into the exchange trade funds (ETF) market. There is currently a “positive feedback loop”, but if some sort of unforeseen negative event takes place, it “may turn into a negative feedback loop,” he said. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index rose 1.3 percent after the White House said on Monday that U.S.-China trade talks would resume next week. On Tuesday, China reported exports and imports jumped in April, beating forecasts, but the news did not impact markets. On Wall Street on Monday, the S&P 500 gained 0.35 percent, boosted by Apple’s sixth straight day of gains. In currency markets, the dollar broadly held firm on the prospect of solid U.S. economic growth, helped partly by Trump’s tax cuts and spending, pointed to further rises in U.S. interest rates down the road. That prompted investors to buy back dollars they had sold earlier this year on worries about Trump’s protectionist trade policies. The euro hit a four-month low of $1.1897 on Monday and last stood at $1.1925. Against the yen, the dollar stood little changed at 108.93 yen, off its three-month high of 110.05 yen. The combination of higher oil prices, a strong dollar and higher U.S. rates is risky for some emerging market assets as it could significantly worsen their trade balance and also encourage investors to shift funds to higher-yielding U.S. assets. “The emerging market currencies are now playing catch up with some of the excessive losses seen in developed currencies ... Asian currencies have also fallen victim to the latest round of USD buying momentum,” Jameel Ahmad, Global Head of Currency Strategy & Market Research at FXTM wrote in a note. JPMorgan’s emerging market bond index hit its lowest level in more than a year. The Indian rupee hit a 15-month low while the Indonesian rupiah hit its lowest level since December 2015 on Tuesday. Dhian Karyantono, fixed income analyst at Mirae Asset Sekuritas Indonesia, said that the rupiah had weakened after weaker-than-expected first-quarter growth data. Indonesia’s economy grew at 5.06 percent in January-March, down from 5.19 percent in the previous quarter. The divergence between developed and emerging markets was also visible in equity prices. Brazil’s Bovespa hit three-month lows while Germany’s Dax hit three-month highs and Italian shares hit 8-1/2-year highs. Additional reporting by Gayatri Suroyo in JAKARTA; Editing by

2018-05-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) is trying to seize PDVSA’s oil assets at the 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Isla refinery in Curacao, which would expand its control over the Venezuelan state-run company’s barrels for export, according to sources close to the matter. Under court orders to enforce a $2 billion arbitration award by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), the U.S. oil firm last week temporarily seized about 4 million barrels of crude that PDVSA had stored on the Dutch Caribbean island of St. Eustatius and took control of a terminal on Bonaire, prompting PDVSA to move several oil tankers away from the region. Conoco’s actions could affect PDVSA’s ability to export some 400,000 bpd shipped from the Caribbean, or about a third of its total exports, according to Reuters calculations based on the state firm’s internal reports.  The legal manoeuvres further imperil PDVSA’s declining oil revenue and Venezuela’s economy, which is in deep recession with shortages of medicine and food. OPEC-member Venezuela is almost completely dependent upon crude exports, which slid 29 percent to 1.19 million bpd in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters Trade Flows data. Its refineries ran at just 31 percent of capacity from January through March. Piling pressure on Venezuela, Canadian mining company Rusoro is seeking the attachment of assets belonging to Citgo as part of an arbitration dispute, according to a Monday filing in the Southern District of Texas. In 2016, Rusoro was awarded more than $1.2 billion (885.09 million pounds) in damages awarded by a World Bank tribunal that ruled that Venezuela had unlawfully seized the company’s gold mine, but Venezuela has yet to pay. Conoco’s writs of attachments, served through at least two court orders on facilities in Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao and St. Eustatius, are seen as a legal manoeuvre to temporarily retain assets — from stored oil, to cargoes and facilities — and could empower the U.S. company to sell them later. In Curacao, the court order originally was rejected because of an error in the name of the entities, a PDVSA source and an employee close to the refinery’s operations said.  But Conoco believes it can still take possession of the oil inventories and other assets, according to a person familiar with the matter. Conoco signalled it would move on PDVSA assets anywhere in the world to collect on the ICC ruling.  “PDVSA is a global company with global assets,” Conoco spokesman Daren Beaudo said in a statement. “We will pursue all available legal avenues.”  PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment. On Bonaire, a portion of the fuel stored at the terminal plans to be released for local use at a power station under a deal struck late on Sunday between acting Governor Curvin George, PDVSA’s Bonaire Petroleum Co and Conoco, according to Dutch officials. “Through a joint effort, we could avoid a power-down on the island,” said Karim Mostafi, a spokesman for the Dutch Infrastructure Ministry. The release will provide one to two weeks’ worth of supply for the island’s electric utility.  Talks are also under way for a longer-term solution, he said.  Bonaire held about 800,000 barrels of fuel oil, according to a source close to the operations. In Aruba, most oil inventories belong to PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum. Conoco was looking for up to $33 billion through two arbitration actions against Venezuela and PDVSA, the largest claims by any company. The ICC awarded it $2.04 billion out of the $22 billion originally sought in that court.  Several previous attempts by bondholders, creditors and foreign firms to receive compensation from Venezuela for pending debts or expropriated assets have failed amid payment delays, prolonged arbitration or ongoing lawsuits.  The threat of seizures prompted quick action by PDVSA. According to one letter seen by Reuters, the company sent urgent notices to its fleet calling the vessels back to Venezuela to avoid possible retention of the tankers or the cargoes. As of Monday, less than a dozen tankers were near Curacao and only one was close to Bonaire, most of them empty, according to Reuters vessel tracking data. At least nine tankers have been moved since Friday from those Caribbean islands to Venezuela or Cuba, the data showed. To compensate for the loss of Caribbean operations, PDVSA could widen shipping from its main crude port of Jose and smaller terminals along its western coast. But Jose is facing a growing bottleneck of vessels due to lack of inventories for exports, equipment malfunctions and shortage of staff, shippers said. Two dozen oil tankers - double the normal amount - were waiting on Monday to load crude at Jose for export, according to the Reuters data.

2018-05-08,"TOKYO, May 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices retreated from three-and-a-half-year highs on Tuesday as investors waited on an announcement by President Donald Trump on whether the United States will reimpose sanctions on Iran. Should Trump pull the United States out of a multi-nation agreement on Tehran’s nuclear programme, Iranian crude exports could be hit, adding to tightness in the oil market, which is coming back into balance after years of glut. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 63 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $70.10 a barrel by 0024 GMT. At one point they fell below $70, after settling above that level for the first time since November 2014 on Monday. Brent crude futures were down 53 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $75.64, having jumped 1.7 percent to settle at $76.17 a barrel in the previous session. Trump said on Monday a decision on whether to remain in the Iran nuclear deal or to impose sanctions would be announced at 2:00 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Tuesday, four days earlier than expected. Trump is likely to either announce he will not be renewing a waiver on sanctions, leading to a “significant reduction” in Iranian oil sales within six months, or will restate his opposition to the nuclear agreement, Barclays Research analysts said in a report. “Regardless, his foreign policy continues to ignite tensions in the main oil-exporting center and is, thus, price supportive,” they said. If Trump restores core U.S. sanctions, under U.S. law he must wait at least 180 days before imposing their furthest-reaching measure, which is to target banks of nations that fail to significantly cut their purchases of Iranian oil. Analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Iran’s exports could be cut by 200,000 to 300,000 bpd as a result. Iranian officials, however, said that the country’s oil industry would continue to develop even if the United States exits the accord.
