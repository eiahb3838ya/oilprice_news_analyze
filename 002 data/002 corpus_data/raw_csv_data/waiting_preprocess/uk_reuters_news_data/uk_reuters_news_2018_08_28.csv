2018-08-28,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina relaunched a one-year-old agreement between the government, companies and workers on Tuesday to drive competition and spur development in the Vaca Muerta shale play, the government said in a statement. The original agreement, signed just over a year ago, sought to boost production by incentivizing competition among oil and gas drillers in the region. The government is now looking to bring in other business sectors like construction and mid-stream  service providers. “We are not going to stop until we export $30 billion in gas and oil from Vaca Muerta,” President Mauricio Macri told employees of state-controlled energy company YPF during a meeting with them in the southwestern province of Nequen. Argentina is trying to double production in the region, aiming to pump 260 million cubic meters of gas daily within five years, the government said in the statement. Of that, 100 million cubic meters per day would be destined for international markets, according to the government’s plans. YPF presented its proposal to small and medium-sized businesses involved in the oil and gas supply chain earlier this year, in an effort to drive competition, the statement said. “We want to increase production by 100 to 130 fractures per month, which can be achieved by working with unions and supply companies,” YPF President Miguel Gutierrez said. YPF, with its partners, has invested $8.4 billion in the region. It is the leading investor in Vaca Muerta, one of the largest non-conventional oil and gas formations in the world.  In June, companies in Vaca Muerta increased oil production by 5 percent compared with the same month last year. Gas production increased 8.2 percent over the same period, according to data from the Energy Ministry.

2018-08-28,"* U.S.-Mexico deal punctures global trade war fears * World stocks index at more than 5-month high * U.S.-Canada talks and China leg of U.S. trade war still loom (Updates to U.S. stock market open; changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Aug 28 (Reuters) - A global stocks index advanced to more than five-month highs on Tuesday, lifted by investor optimism that a U.S.-Mexico deal will help avert a global trade war. Monday’s news of the U.S.-Mexico agreement on trade pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes to record highs, and indexes across Europe and Asia followed Wall Street’s lead, inching to multi-month highs. The dollar, which had been a haven as investors anticipated contentious trade disputes and U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hikes, slipped to a four-week low. Emerging market stocks hit their highest since Aug. 10. “Global trade tensions have undoubtedly been the most significant source of risk in 2018,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “The U.S.–Mexico deal seemed to boost confidence that the trade war is moving closer to an end, and the next question is ‘Who’s next to close a deal with Trump?’” he said. MSCI’s benchmark world share index followed Monday’s best performance in over four months with a 0.21 percent gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 44.39 points, or 0.17 percent, to 26,094.03, the S&P 500 gained 2.16 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,898.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.50 points, or 0.16 percent, to 8,030.39. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.8858 percent, from 2.85 percent late on Monday. Disputes on trade have weighed on investor sentiment for much of 2018, despite solid economic fundamentals and robust corporate earnings. Many remain cautious. Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said markets’ assumption that Canada will go along with the U.S.-Mexico deal is not “zero risk.” The three countries are currently part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and U.S.-Canada talks are due later on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars and demanded concessions on Canada’s dairy protections. “If Canada does not join, then getting the agreement of (U.S.) Congress (to the deal) will be trickier,” Donovan said. The toughest battle in the trade war, with China, still looms. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough, as another round of tariffs took effect. The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Monday that Chinese steel wheels exports were heavily subsidized and that it could impose duties on the product. Asian and other emerging markets are being supported for now by the greenback’s pullback from 14-month highs. The dollar index was down 0.2 percent, just off one-month lows. U.S. economic data could determine the dollar’s further moves. The latest estimates for second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product are expected on Wednesday. The dollar’s retreat has allowed currencies such as South Africa’s rand and the Australian dollar to rise further from multi-month troughs. The Mexican peso, however, lost 0.72 percent versus the U.S. dollar after hitting 2-1/2 week highs following the trade deal. The Turkish lira fell another 1.8 percent against the dollar , adding to Monday’s 1.9 percent fall as concerns have not abated about Turkey’s rift with Washington and its resistance to raising interest rates.

2018-08-28,"LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss court accepted a plea bargain on Tuesday from a former employee of energy trader Gunvor Group in relation to an investigation into corruption in Congo Republic and Ivory Coast, the former employee’s lawyer said. The court confirmed the decision.  The court’s approval opens the possibility for the former employee, known as Pascal C, to testify against others at Gunvor. Pascal C will not serve any prison sentence or pay a fine.  Prosecutors are pursuing parallel investigations related to Gunvor’s Congo dealings, including into the company as a whole for “possible organizational shortcomings”. The deal, called an “accelerated proceeding” under Swiss law, relates to a money-laundering investigation that began in 2011. The following year, Gunvor accused Pascal C of fraud and embezzlement relating to the firm’s Congo dealings, and fired him. As part of the deal, the former employee admitted paying bribes to officials in the two countries to secure oil deals but said his colleagues were aware of the transactions and recipients.  “Gunvor acknowledges the conviction of its former employee against whom it filed a criminal complaint in 2012, where it was seen that he unlawfully directed funds to himself and another individual,” a Gunvor spokesman said.  “Gunvor wholly rejects the possibility of a conscious and desired involvement of any other employee or executive.”  The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland declined to comment. Earlier this month, Gunvor called the procedure “one-sided” and said the firm had been unable to defend itself.

2018-08-28,"(Number of wells in paragraph 7 corrected to 100-120 from 150 after company official corrects original statement) STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Oil producer Equinor aims to boost the recovery rate from its Norwegian fields to well above the global average to extend production from the mature basin beyond 2030. Equinor announced plans on Tuesday to drill up to 3,000 wells offshore from its native Norway in coming decades - almost as many as it has drilled since its startup in 1972 - to mitigate declining output from older fields, and extend the production lifetime of more than 20 installations. The company said it remained on track for to keep profitable oil and gas production in Norway towards 2030, but needed new measures to tackle a decline after that, including a deliberate push to find more natural gas. “We aim to achieve an average recovery rate of 60 and 85 per cent respectively at our oil and gas fields. This is almost twice the average global oil recovery rate of 35 per cent,” Arne Sygve Nylund, Equinor’s head of development and production in Norway, said. Equinor’s current recovery rate for oil stands at 50 percent. The company did not provide a recovery rate for gas. Nylund didn’t say when the company aimed to achieve the target rates, but the plan to drill up to 3,000 production and exploration wells covers a period up to 2040. The plan meant that Equinor will I drill about 100-120 production wells per year to boost the output from the existing field, up from the previous plan of 80-100 wells indicated earlier this year, a spokesman for the company said. In addition, Equinor plans to drill between 20 and 30 exploration wells each year off Norway, including both its own and partner-operated wells, to search for new reserves. “I think we can keep that rate for at least another five years,” Dodson told Reuters. The Norwegian company, Europe’s second-largest gas supplier after Russia’s Gazprom, said it would prioritize natural gas in its exploration plans offshore Norway, aiming to add more volumes around the existing infrastructure, such as the Aasta Hansteen field in the Norwegian Sea, and elsewhere. “Natural gas is a commodity important to climate... We see more demand for gas, and we can play a bigger role in producing and delivering gas to the global markets,” Nylund told Reuters. “We also need to use the existing infrastructure in a timely manner, it will not last forever,” he added. While the company believes its Norwegian resource potential is as large today as it was a decade ago, each prospect is smaller, making it necessary to drill more and cheaper wells, exploration chief Tim Dodson told a news conference. The company is currently investing heavily to develop the $15 billion Johan Sverdrup oilfield, which will be completed in two stages between 2019 and 2022, as well as the Arctic Johan Castberg and an extension of the Troll gas field. “We need to start now. After 2022 there are currently few big projects remaining. The choices that we, the authorities, and the industry make today will be decisive,” Nylund said. “We have developed a strategy for more gas exploration. We will also test new ideas in some prospects every year. The likelihood of discovery in these wells will be lower than in other targets, but we see it as necessary to regularly test a few of what we call ‘game changing wells’,” he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Equinor announced plans to partly power two of its North Sea oilfields with floating wind turbines, which in turn would help the company cuts its carbon dioxide emissions.

2018-08-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Baked by a blazing summer and keen to reduce their use of plastic bottles, Londoners are welcoming a scheme to re-introduce drinking-water fountains across the British capital. Four have already been installed and one of them, off 1960s fashion hotspot Carnaby Street, has been used more than 10,000 times a month this summer, the office of London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Tuesday. Now 16 more are planned this year for locations such as Windrush Square, Brixton; Paddington recreation ground; Guy’s Hospital in Southwark and the Natural History Museum in Kensington. Public drinking fountains were common in London as long ago as the Victorian era but have long since made way for plastic bottles, with the average adult Londoner buying more than three a week, according to Khan’s office. “Water fountains are a simple but effective way to encourage Londoners and visitors to ditch plastic bottles and instead refill reusable ones,” said Khan in a statement. “Some of these are already attracting thousands of visitors a day and City Hall are working on plans to secure many more across London.” The Mayor’s office has worked with the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) #OneLess campaign to secure the locations of the fountains. ZSL assessed the site applications on accessibility, visibility and footfall to ensure water refills are available for as many people as possible. Heather Koldewey, #OneLess campaign Director and Head of Marine and Freshwater Conservation at ZSL, said there was big demand for the fountains. “We were taken aback by the number of applications we received ... There is definitely huge appetite in London to stop using single-use plastic and establish a new culture of refilling.” A full list of fountain locations can be found on the Mayor of London website here Reporting by Saeed Haque; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-fountains/londoners-welcome-re-introduction-of-public-drinking-water-fountains-idUKL8N1VJ4AN,28 Aug 2018,"Baked by a blazing summer and

2018-08-28,"OSLO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Norway’s transmission system operator Statnett may have to pay large electricity users to cut their energy consumption this winter if rainfall remains abnormally low, it said on Tuesday. Virtually all power generated in Norway comes from hydroelectrics. After a hot, dry summer, reserves in its hydropower reservoirs are 16 terawatt hours below average, or about 12 percent of the country’s annual consumption for 2017. Stable electricity supply is crucial for many of Norway’s power-intensive companies, such as fertiliser maker Yara , aluminium producer Norsk Hydro, and data centres, which could ultimately be affected. “The various tools Statnett can use include, among other things, so-called energy options for consumption, which means that larger power consumers enter into agreements to reduce consumption against payment when needed,” Statnett said. This arrangement could only be used in a highly strained power situation and requires government approval, it added. Norsk Hydro, the country’s largest power user, can reduce consumption for up to an hour without affecting output, but longer constraints could result in reduced aluminium production, Hydro spokesman Oeyvind Breivik said. “Reducing power for over an hour can mean production instability. We wouldn’t like to take out large chunks of the power supply unless it is necessary,” said Breivik, though he said metals delivery to customers would be unaffected. A spokeswoman for Yara said that while cutting power consumption would affect its Norwegian production, the firm would be able to maintain volumes for customers through its plants outside the country. Microsoft, which plans to build two data centres in Norway as part of an agreement to supply cloud services to Equinor, was not available for comment. “We realize that many are worried about the high power prices,” Statnett said. “If there is little rainfall in the period ahead, prices may also be high throughout the autumn and winter.” Imports from Denmark and Germany could also help mitigate the situation, it said.

2018-08-28,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Current U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, a long-time adviser at Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry said on Tuesday, adding Iran would be unable to close the straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab even partially. Speaking at an oil conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, Ibrahim al-Muhanna said Iran would be the first to lose out on a move to block those major shipping routes and that any such action would trigger further sanctions on Iran. “Current sanctions are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, as almost all experts agree. I mean, they will continue to export 1 million (barrels per day) or so. So closing that Strait of Hormuz will damage the Iranians as much as damaging others,” he said. Iran has said if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz. “The amount of oil going through the Strait of Hormuz is so large. There’s more than 18 million barrels a day, about two thirds of world maritime oil trade. Meaning, cutting oil from there will lead to an acute oil shortage and prices will skyrocket,” Muhanna said. “Is Iran able or willing to close completely, or even partially, the Strait of Hormuz or Bab Al-Mandab, or both? The answer is no, and a really big no.” U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 pact between Iran and major world powers under which sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear programme. The Trump administration then announced unilateral plans to restore sanctions against Tehran.

2018-08-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate their bullish positions in crude and fuels, amid negative sentiment towards petroleum, before prices rallied sharply in the second half of last week. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 49 million barrels in the week to Aug. 20. Fund managers have reduced their net long position in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 508 million barrels (36 percent), according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. Total long positions have been slashed by 494 million barrels, while short positions have increased by 14 million barrels, since April 17. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3) As a result, portfolio managers’ combined net long position in petroleum has been cut to just 903 million barrels, the lowest for almost a year. And the ratio of long to short positions has fallen from almost 14:1 to just over 8:1, leaving the market looking much less lopsided than before. The most recent week saw continued liquidation of net length in Brent (-12 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-16 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-5 million). As in previous weeks, most of the changes came from the long side of the market, with fund managers trimming old bullish long positions rather than adding new bearish short ones. But there was a notable increase of 15 million barrels in short WTI positions on NYMEX, the largest one-week rise for 10 months. Negative sentiment among fund managers up to and including Tuesday last week, the cut-off date for the commitments’ of traders reports, likely created the conditions for a strong bounce later in the week. But benchmark Brent prices have traded sideways in a range between $70 and $80 for the four months since April, after rallying strongly over the preceding nine months. Prices are caught in the cross-current between fears about a supply-crunch as a result of the re-imposition of Iran sanctions and a potential hit to demand as a result of a slowdown in global growth. Until one, or both, those sources of uncertainty are resolved, prices seem set to remain rangebound. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

2018-08-28,"(Adds Basin Pipeline restart) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Liz Hampton Aug 28 (Reuters) - A fire broke out on Tuesday morning at a Plains All American Pipeline crude storage tank east of Wichita Falls, Texas, the company said. The fire was limited to a single storage tank at the Wichita Falls Station, the company said, and none of its workers were missing. Plains did not say if there were injuries, but did say that first responders were on site. Plains did not specify whether the fire had affected any other operations. Wichita Falls is a crude injection point in north Texas along Plain’s Basin Pipeline, which runs from the Permian Basin that to the oil storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma. The Basin pipeline was shut briefly, according to market intelligence firm Genscape, though the cause was unclear. Flows on the pipeline resumed to a rate of nearly 410,000 barrels per day (bpd) after power consumption increased at about 1:00 p.m. ET, Genscape said in a notice. Pipeline flow averaged about 365,000 bpd this week thus far and the Basin pipeline has a capacity of 450,000 bpd, Genscape said. News of the pipeline closure contributed to weakness in West Texas Intermediate at Midland WTC-WTM crude differentials during the day, traders and brokers said. WTI Midland traded as much as $18 a barrel below U.S. crude futures early in the session, the biggest discount since late 2012. Prices recovered to last trade at a $16.75 a barrel discount, dealers said. On Monday, WTI at Midland traded near $15 a barrel under Cushing. “Plains really hasn’t said much to the shippers so unless it’s going to be shut for a while, I don’t think there’ll be much market impact,” said one trader who buys oil off the pipeline.

The pilot project in the centre of Thailand’s capital is among the world’s largest peer-to-peer renewable energy trading platforms using blockchain, according to the firms involved. The system has a total generating capacity of 635 KW that can be traded via Bangkok city’s electricity grid between a mall, a school, a dental hospital and an apartment complex. Commercial operations will begin next month, said David Martin, managing director of Power Ledger, an Australian firm that develops technology for the energy industry and is a partner in the project. “By enabling trade in renewable energy, the community meets its own energy demands, leading to lower bills for buyers, better prices for sellers, and a smaller carbon footprint for all,” he said. “It will encourage more consumers to make the switch to renewable energy, as the cost can be offset by selling excess energy to neighbours,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Neighbourhoods from New York to Melbourne are upending the way power is produced and sold, with solar panels, mini grids and smart meters that can measure when energy is consumed rather than overall consumption. The World Energy Council predicts that such decentralised energy will grow to about a fourth of the market in 2025 from 5 percent today. Helping it along is blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin currency, which offers a transparent way to handle complex transactions between users, producers, and even traders and utilities. Blockchain also saves individuals the drudgery of switching between sending power and receiving it, said Martin. For the pilot in Bangkok’s upmarket Sukhumvit neighbourhood, electricity generated by each of the four locations will be initially used within that building. Excess energy can be sold to the others through the trading system. If there is a surplus from all four, it will be sold to the local energy storage system, and to the grid in the future, said Gloyta Nathalang, a spokeswoman for Thai renewable energy firm BCPG, which installed the meters and solar panels. Thailand is Southeast Asia’s leading developer of renewable energy, and aims to have it account for 30 percent of final energy consumption by 2036. The energy ministry has encouraged community renewable energy projects to reduce fossil fuel usage, and the regulator is drafting new rules to permit the trade of energy. The Bangkok Metropolitan Electricity Authority forecasts “peer-to-peer energy trading to become mainstream for power generation in the long run,” a spokesman told reporters. BCPG, in partnership with the Thai real estate developer Sansiri, plans to roll out similar energy trading systems with solar panels and blockchain for a total capacity of 2 MW by 2021, said Gloyta. “There are opportunities everywhere - not just in cities, but also in islands and remote areas where electricity supply is a challenge,” she said.

2018-08-28,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) said on Tuesday it is considering whether to build a pioneering offshore wind farm with floating turbines to supply electricity to two North Sea oilfields as part of a strategy to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The project at the Gullfaks and Snorre oilfields would cost around 5 billion Norwegian crowns ($592 million) and could reduce Norway’s emissions of carbon dioxide by more than 200,000 tonnes per year, Equinor said. “This could be the first time an offshore wind farm is directly connected to oil and gas platforms,” state-controlled Equinor said in a statement. The two fields currently are powered by generators running on natural gas at the platforms. Norway’s greenhouse gas emissions have remained high despite pledges for deep cuts under international accords such as the Paris climate deal. Last year, Norway’s annual emissions were 2.4 percent above 1990 levels at 52.4 million tonnes. “To maintain profitable operations (offshore Norway) in the long term, it is essential that we do our utmost to further reduce the carbon footprint from our activities,” Executive Vice President Arne Sigve Nylund said. Formerly known as Statoil, Equinor earlier this year changed its name to underscore a push into renewable energy under Chief Executive Eldar Saetre, although oil and gas will remain the company’s dominant business. The company’s first floating offshore wind farm began operating off Scotland last year, supplying electricity to the onshore market. Equinor has also announced plans for bottom-fixed offshore wind projects in the United States, Poland and Britain. A final investment decision on the plan for Snorre and Gullfaks, known as the Hywind Tampen floating wind farm, will be made in 2019, Equinor said. The company will seek to reduce the cost from the preliminary estimate. Equinor said it hoped Norwegian government subsidies would cover half the capital expenditure for the project, where 11 turbines, each with a capacity of eight megawatts, would meet about 35 percent of the power demand from the two fields.   Electricity generation costs could be 40-50 percent less than the 200 euros ($229) a megawatt hour at the Scottish project. “This will help reduce Norway’s overall carbon emissions,” Marius Holm, head of environmental foundation Zero, told Reuters. “The move will also help industrialise offshore wind and bring costs down.” The Gullfaks field is owned by Equinor, OMV (OMVV.VI) and Norway’s state-owned Petoro, while Snorre is held by Equinor, Petoro, ExxonMobil (XOM.N), Idemitsu (5019.T), DEA and Point Resources.

2018-08-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s independent refiners have ramped up their foreign oil buying after returning from prolonged summer maintenance to gear up for rising winter fuel demand, a sign that the financial pain from taxes and higher crude prices have ebbed for now. The pick-up in imports by private refiners, often called “teapots”, has boosted the physical prices of Middle Eastern and Russian oil to their highest in months. Their return to the market also comes as margins have improved after their extended shutdowns helped drain a glut of diesel and gasoline, boosting domestic fuel prices. The independents imported 6 million tonnes, or 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in August, up 40 percent from July and 10 percent higher from the same period last year, Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts data showed. Their July purchases were the second-lowest on record for data going back to October 2016, as refiners shut or suspended operations due to a toxic mix of sinking diesel demand, higher crude prices LCOc1 CLc1 and new tax rules. The calculation does not include purchases from large private refiners Hengli Petrochemical (600346.SS) and Rongsheng Group. The teapots account for about one-fifth of the nearly 9 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil imported into China, the world’s biggest oil importer.  “Our bookings of heavy crude increased in August and September as we came back from a 20-day-long maintenance in July,” said a manager with a Dongying-based independent refiner who declined to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “Margins have been negative for a while, but we finally booked profit in August,” he said, adding that higher refined products prices encouraged more refineries to return from maintenance. Sustained buying from China’s independents will add to global demand at the same time there are looming supply disruptions expected from major producers such as Venezuela and Iran. The surge in demand should boost benchmark futures prices. It will also allay worries about weaker demand as China’s economic growth has stumbled.  “Crude demand in September will further pick up from August because independents are going to ramp up for winter production in the fourth quarter,” said Zhou Guoxia, an analyst with oil consultancy JLC, adding that the industry has been haunted by tight credit and more scrutiny on their tax practices. Spot premiums for Oman OMA-1Mdubsw-A and Russian ESPO Blend ESPO-DUB, the typical grades that teapots buy, rose to their highest in months this week, supported by the demand recovery from private refiners, several trade sources said. The utilisation rate of 44 Shandong-based refiners rose to 58 percent of their capacity in the second week of August, up from an average of 52.5 percent for July, calculations from JLC showed. The run rates were lower compared with state-owned refiners that were operating at 70 percent. Margins improved moderately as domestic product prices rose due to thinning fuel supplies.  But executives warned that profits for teapots are still razor thin and smaller operators are struggling with the lingering issues of more stringent tax collection and higher crude prices, potentially requiring some to close for good. Teapots also lose out on higher profits since they lack the retail networks of companies such as state-owned China Petroleum & Chemical Corp (600028.SS), known as Sinopec, and the higher premiums from retail fuel sales.  The refiners do not have government licenses to export fuels, meaning they also miss out on potentially lucrative overseas sales. Another manager with a Dongying-based refinery, which is preparing to return to full capacity, said business has gotten easier since early July when the bankruptcy of teapot Shandong Haiyou Petrochemical cast doubt on the financial health of the sector. “With demand for crude coming back, it is easier for independents to get financing and credit to buy crude oil,” he said. “Profit this year in general shrunk from a year ago,” the manager said. “Some small teapots with poor management skills and loan problems might die, but overall the bigger teapots are able to survive.”  Reporting by Meng Meng and Aizhu Chen in BEIJING and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Josephine Mason and Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-crude-teapots/after-summer-of-discontent-chinas-teapot-refineries-ramp-up-oil-imports-idUKL3N1VC3XJ,28 Aug 2018,"* Margins still razor thin amid tax scrutiny, higher crude

Investors expect Canada too will agree to the new terms to preserve a three-nation pact, while U.S. President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke by telephone and the two leaders “strongly supported ongoing discussions” on trade, according to the White House. European and Asian shares  followed Wall Street’s lead, inching to multi-month highs after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes surged to fresh records on Monday led by gains in technology stocks. The dollar slipped to a four-week low and implied volatility across currencies and equity markets also eased, as investors took on greater risk appetite. Emerging market stocks hit their highest since Aug. 9. “Global trade tensions have undoubtedly been the most significant source of risk in 2018,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “The U.S.–Mexico deal seemed to boost confidence that the trade war is moving closer to an end, and the next question is who’s next to close a deal with Trump?” he said. MSCI’s benchmark world share index followed on from Monday’s best performance in over four months, rising 0.15 percent, while MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.5 percent. A pan-European share index rose 0.3 percent for a third straight day of gains. Auto stocks continued to rally, adding 1.3 percent after enjoying their best day in a month on Monday - German carmakers rely on smooth trade between Mexico and the United States to sell Mexican-assembled vehicles into U.S. markets. However, some analysts were cautious about the rally. Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, noted markets were assuming already that Canada would join the new U.S.-Mexico deal, but said: “it is not a zero risk process”. “If Canada does not join, then getting the agreement of (U.S.) Congress will be trickier, as fast-track authorization probably will not hold,” he said. Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have been a drag on investor sentiment for much of the year despite solid economic fundamentals and two robust quarters of corporate earnings. And the toughest battle in the trade war - with China - still looms. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough, as another round of tariffs came into effect. The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Monday that Chinese steel wheels exports were heavily subsidised and that it could impose duties on the product. Chinese stocks  were steady to weaker, though Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 0.6 percent. JPMorgan analysts said the trade deal was not necessarily positive for the outcome of talks with China, though they said risks of a generalised global trade war had abated somewhat. “Despite this, Asia-Pacific equities including HK/China should benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar and risk-on moves,” they added. The dollar paused near one-month lows against a basket of currencies and the euro was near a one-month top at $1.1680. The greenback’s index has retreated from near 14-month highs and its losses accelerated last week after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell disappointed dollar bulls by signalling only a gradual pace of rate rises, U.S. economic data -  with consumer confidence figures due later in the day and the latest estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product expected on Wednesday - could determine the dollar’s further moves. But its pullback has offered some respite to battered emerging and commodity-reliant currencies. South Africa’s rand has pulled off two-year lows hit earlier this month <ZAR=D3 while the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid hedge for global growth, is well above recent 1-1/2 year troughs. There are exceptions, however. The Turkish lira fell another 1.5 percent against the dollar, adding to Monday’s 2 percent fall as concerns have not abated about Turkey’s rift with Washington and its monetary policies. Italian borrowing costs too rose to three-month highs after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the country’s public deficit could exceed the European Union’s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year. nL3N1VI1WC (Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Melbourne; Editing by Mark Potter)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-world-stocks-hit-6-month-high-as-nafta-deal-eases-trade-war-fears-idUKL8N1VJ1JM,28 Aug 2018,"World stocks rose to a six-month

Investors expect Canada would also agree to new terms to preserve a three-nation pact, ultimately dispelling the economic uncertainty prompted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to ditch the 1994 NAFTA accord. The improved trade outlook was also boosted by news that Washington was pressing the European Union to accelerate tariff talks. Spreadbetters pointed to a firm start for Europe, with FTSE futures 0.6 percent higher and the CAC and DAX indexes slightly firmer. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.4 percent for a second straight day of gains. Australian shares added 0.7 percent while Japan’s Nikkei pared early gains to end 0.1 percent higher. Chinese shares were in the red. Shanghai’s SSE Composite was off 0.2 percent and the blue-chip index down 0.3 percent as the Sino-U.S. trade dispute wears on. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with the activation of another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion of each country’s goods. Worryingly, consultancy KPMG has predicted a recession for the global economy were there to be an all-out tariff war. “Globally, the effects of a substantial number of other countries introducing protectionist measures such as a 15 percent tariff on imports would be very significant,” KPMG Australia Chief Economist Brendan Rynne said in a note on Tuesday. “The world economy would contract by more than 3 percent.” Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have been a drag on investor sentiment for much of the year despite solid economic fundamentals and two robust quarters of corporate earnings. Some analysts were cautious about Tuesday’s rally. “News of the U.S.-Mexico trade deal has fuelled risk appetite,” ANZ analysts said in a client note. “It is hard to extrapolate much out of it, as the United States continues to treat each country and deal on its own merit. We remain wary of the current rally in risk appetite, and see it as short-lived.” Investors will keep a close eye on U.S. economic data with consumer confidence figures due later in the day and the latest estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product expected on Wednesday. The dollar index paused near one-month lows against major currencies to stand at 94.83. Against the yen, the greenback held at 111.24. The euro was near a one-month top at $1.1677. The Australian dollar, which is often used as a liquid hedge for global growth, was a tad lower at $0.7331 but well above a 1-1/2 year trough of $0.7203 touched earlier this month. Oil prices gave up gains, with Brent down 9 cents at $76.12 a barrel and U.S. crude 11 cents weaker at $68.76. Gold was subdued with spot prices off a touch at 1,210.44 an ounce.

2018-08-28,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s refiners increased their output in July to close to 12 million barrels per day (bpd), but at the same time exports of refined fuels fell to the lowest in four months. These facts may seem contradictory, and while there are several issues than can help explain the dynamics, perhaps the most compelling is that China appears to be becoming more attuned to market forces for refined products in Asia. As is often the case with China’s intake and processing of crude oil and its exports of refined products, the data is incomplete, and in this case the main missing numbers are movements in inventories. Inventory data was last released in April, so it’s hard to know how much of the refinery throughput went into storage tanks, as opposed to being exported or consumed domestically. But what is known is that refinery runs totalled 11.95 million bpd in July, a gain of 11.6 percent from the same month in 2017. In the first seven months of the year China’s refineries processed 12.07 million bpd, an increase of 9.2 percent over the same period last year. However, exports of gasoline fell to 890,000 tonnes in July, equivalent to about 244,000 bpd, down from 334,000 bpd in June and 403,000 bpd in May. Diesel exports fell to 1.54 million tonnes, or about 372,000 bpd, down from 402,000 bpd in June and 484,000 bpd in May. In addition to the unknown flows into inventories, gasoline and diesel exports may have been affected by Chinese refiners getting close to exhausting quotas and cutting back on shipments. It is also possible that the smaller, independent refineries exported less because of reduced runs, as they battle higher crude oil prices and increased government scrutiny on taxes. Chinese domestic consumption may also have risen, especially in the agricultural sector given the summer peak demand season. All of these factors can help shed light on the drop-off in China’s exports of refined fuels, but perhaps the best explanation is the movement of prices around the time when July exports would have been arranged. The profit from making a barrel of gasoline in Singapore from Brent crude, the main regional benchmark, dropped to its low so far this year of $3.38 a barrel on July 4. It had been steadily declining since hitting a peak of $9.91 a barrel on May 22, meaning that at the time Chinese refiners would have been contemplating selling gasoline for exports, the incentive to do so was weakening. It’s a similar story for diesel, with the profit margin, or crack, for producing a barrel of 10 parts per million diesel from Dubai crude dropping to a low of $12.97 a barrel on June 27, down from $16.64 on May 18. The moves in pricing suggest that Chinese refiners may have become more price sensitive, and therefore less likely to export surplus refined fuels irrespective of the profit gained from doing so. What is also worth noting is that the cracks for both diesel and gasoline later strengthened, with diesel rising to $16.33 a barrel on Aug. 24, before slipping slightly to end at $16.06 on Monday. The gasoline crack jumped 240 percent from its July low to $11.55 a barrel on Aug. 15, although it subsequently eased to $8.21 on Monday. The recovery in the profit margins for refined fuels may have come too late to provide a significant boost to China’s exports in August. But September should reveal whether China’s refiners are indeed becoming more price-sensitive, or whether the other factors still play a bigger role. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Richard Pullin",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-crude-china/column-is-china-becoming-a-more-price-sensitive-exporter-of-refined-fuels-russell-idUKL3N1VJ2D8,28 Aug 2018,"China's refiners

Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.8858 percent, from 2.85 percent late on Monday. Disputes on trade have weighed on investor sentiment for much of 2018, despite solid economic fundamentals and robust corporate earnings. Many remain cautious. Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said markets’ assumption that Canada will go along with the U.S.-Mexico deal is not “zero risk.” The three countries are currently part of the North American Free Trade Agreement, and U.S.-Canada talks are due later on Tuesday. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars and demanded concessions on Canada’s dairy protections. “If Canada does not join, then getting the agreement of (U.S.) Congress (to the deal) will be trickier,” Donovan said. The toughest battle in the trade war, with China, still looms. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough, as another round of tariffs took effect. The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Monday that Chinese steel wheels exports were heavily subsidized and that it could impose duties on the product. Asian and other emerging markets are being supported for now by the greenback’s pullback from 14-month highs. The dollar index was down 0.2 percent, just off one-month lows. U.S. economic data could determine the dollar’s further moves. The latest estimates for second-quarter U.S. gross domestic product are expected on Wednesday. The dollar’s retreat has allowed currencies such as South Africa’s rand and the Australian dollar to rise further from multi-month troughs. The Mexican peso, however, lost 0.72 percent versus the U.S. dollar after hitting 2-1/2 week highs following the trade deal. The Turkish lira fell another 1.8 percent against the dollar , adding to Monday’s 1.9 percent fall as concerns have not abated about Turkey’s rift with Washington and its resistance to raising interest rates.

2018-08-28,"LONDON/ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss court accepted a plea bargain on Tuesday from a former employee of energy trader Gunvor Group in relation to an investigation into corruption in Congo Republic and Ivory Coast, the former employee’s lawyer said. The court confirmed the decision.  The court’s approval opens the possibility for the former employee, known as Pascal C, to testify against others at Gunvor. Pascal C will not serve any prison sentence or pay a fine.  Prosecutors are pursuing parallel investigations related to Gunvor’s Congo dealings, including into the company as a whole for “possible organizational shortcomings”. The deal, called an “accelerated proceeding” under Swiss law, relates to a money-laundering investigation that began in 2011. The following year, Gunvor accused Pascal C of fraud and embezzlement relating to the firm’s Congo dealings, and fired him. As part of the deal, the former employee admitted paying bribes to officials in the two countries to secure oil deals but said his colleagues were aware of the transactions and recipients.  “Gunvor acknowledges the conviction of its former employee against whom it filed a criminal complaint in 2012, where it was seen that he unlawfully directed funds to himself and another individual,” a Gunvor spokesman said.  “Gunvor wholly rejects the possibility of a conscious and desired involvement of any other employee or executive.”  The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland declined to comment. Earlier this month, Gunvor called the procedure “one-sided” and said the firm had been unable to defend itself.

2018-08-28,"(Number of wells in paragraph 7 corrected to 100-120 from 150 after company official corrects original statement) STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Oil producer Equinor aims to boost the recovery rate from its Norwegian fields to well above the global average to extend production from the mature basin beyond 2030. Equinor announced plans on Tuesday to drill up to 3,000 wells offshore from its native Norway in coming decades - almost as many as it has drilled since its startup in 1972 - to mitigate declining output from older fields, and extend the production lifetime of more than 20 installations. The company said it remained on track for to keep profitable oil and gas production in Norway towards 2030, but needed new measures to tackle a decline after that, including a deliberate push to find more natural gas. “We aim to achieve an average recovery rate of 60 and 85 per cent respectively at our oil and gas fields. This is almost twice the average global oil recovery rate of 35 per cent,” Arne Sygve Nylund, Equinor’s head of development and production in Norway, said. Equinor’s current recovery rate for oil stands at 50 percent. The company did not provide a recovery rate for gas. Nylund didn’t say when the company aimed to achieve the target rates, but the plan to drill up to 3,000 production and exploration wells covers a period up to 2040. The plan meant that Equinor will I drill about 100-120 production wells per year to boost the output from the existing field, up from the previous plan of 80-100 wells indicated earlier this year, a spokesman for the company said. In addition, Equinor plans to drill between 20 and 30 exploration wells each year off Norway, including both its own and partner-operated wells, to search for new reserves. “I think we can keep that rate for at least another five years,” Dodson told Reuters. The Norwegian company, Europe’s second-largest gas supplier after Russia’s Gazprom, said it would prioritize natural gas in its exploration plans offshore Norway, aiming to add more volumes around the existing infrastructure, such as the Aasta Hansteen field in the Norwegian Sea, and elsewhere. “Natural gas is a commodity important to climate... We see more demand for gas, and we can play a bigger role in producing and delivering gas to the global markets,” Nylund told Reuters. “We also need to use the existing infrastructure in a timely manner, it will not last forever,” he added. While the company believes its Norwegian resource potential is as large today as it was a decade ago, each prospect is smaller, making it necessary to drill more and cheaper wells, exploration chief Tim Dodson told a news conference. The company is currently investing heavily to develop the $15 billion Johan Sverdrup oilfield, which will be completed in two stages between 2019 and 2022, as well as the Arctic Johan Castberg and an extension of the Troll gas field. “We need to start now. After 2022 there are currently few big projects remaining. The choices that we, the authorities, and the industry make today will be decisive,” Nylund said. “We have developed a strategy for more gas exploration. We will also test new ideas in some prospects every year. The likelihood of discovery in these wells will be lower than in other targets, but we see it as necessary to regularly test a few of what we call ‘game changing wells’,” he added. Earlier on Tuesday, Equinor announced plans to partly power two of its North Sea oilfields with floating wind turbines, which in turn would help the company cuts its carbon dioxide emissions.

2018-08-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Baked by a blazing summer and keen to reduce their use of plastic bottles, Londoners are welcoming a scheme to re-introduce drinking-water fountains across the British capital. Four have already been installed and one of them, off 1960s fashion hotspot Carnaby Street, has been used more than 10,000 times a month this summer, the office of London Mayor Sadiq Khan said on Tuesday. Now 16 more are planned this year for locations such as Windrush Square, Brixton; Paddington recreation ground; Guy’s Hospital in Southwark and the Natural History Museum in Kensington. Public drinking fountains were common in London as long ago as the Victorian era but have long since made way for plastic bottles, with the average adult Londoner buying more than three a week, according to Khan’s office. “Water fountains are a simple but effective way to encourage Londoners and visitors to ditch plastic bottles and instead refill reusable ones,” said Khan in a statement. “Some of these are already attracting thousands of visitors a day and City Hall are working on plans to secure many more across London.” The Mayor’s office has worked with the Zoological Society of London’s (ZSL) #OneLess campaign to secure the locations of the fountains. ZSL assessed the site applications on accessibility, visibility and footfall to ensure water refills are available for as many people as possible. Heather Koldewey, #OneLess campaign Director and Head of Marine and Freshwater Conservation at ZSL, said there was big demand for the fountains. “We were taken aback by the number of applications we received ... There is definitely huge appetite in London to stop using single-use plastic and establish a new culture of refilling.” A full list of fountain locations can be found on the Mayor of London website here Reporting by Saeed Haque; editing by Stephen Addison",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-fountains/londoners-welcome-re-introduction-of-public-drinking-water-fountains-idUKL8N1VJ4AN,28 Aug 2018,"Baked by a blazing summer and

2018-08-28,"OSLO, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Norway’s transmission system operator Statnett may have to pay large electricity users to cut their energy consumption this winter if rainfall remains abnormally low, it said on Tuesday. Virtually all power generated in Norway comes from hydroelectrics. After a hot, dry summer, reserves in its hydropower reservoirs are 16 terawatt hours below average, or about 12 percent of the country’s annual consumption for 2017. Stable electricity supply is crucial for many of Norway’s power-intensive companies, such as fertiliser maker Yara , aluminium producer Norsk Hydro, and data centres, which could ultimately be affected. “The various tools Statnett can use include, among other things, so-called energy options for consumption, which means that larger power consumers enter into agreements to reduce consumption against payment when needed,” Statnett said. This arrangement could only be used in a highly strained power situation and requires government approval, it added. Norsk Hydro, the country’s largest power user, can reduce consumption for up to an hour without affecting output, but longer constraints could result in reduced aluminium production, Hydro spokesman Oeyvind Breivik said. “Reducing power for over an hour can mean production instability. We wouldn’t like to take out large chunks of the power supply unless it is necessary,” said Breivik, though he said metals delivery to customers would be unaffected. A spokeswoman for Yara said that while cutting power consumption would affect its Norwegian production, the firm would be able to maintain volumes for customers through its plants outside the country. Microsoft, which plans to build two data centres in Norway as part of an agreement to supply cloud services to Equinor, was not available for comment. “We realize that many are worried about the high power prices,” Statnett said. “If there is little rainfall in the period ahead, prices may also be high throughout the autumn and winter.” Imports from Denmark and Germany could also help mitigate the situation, it said.

2018-08-28,"STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - Current U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, a long-time adviser at Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry said on Tuesday, adding Iran would be unable to close the straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab even partially. Speaking at an oil conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, Ibrahim al-Muhanna said Iran would be the first to lose out on a move to block those major shipping routes and that any such action would trigger further sanctions on Iran. “Current sanctions are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, as almost all experts agree. I mean, they will continue to export 1 million (barrels per day) or so. So closing that Strait of Hormuz will damage the Iranians as much as damaging others,” he said. Iran has said if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz. “The amount of oil going through the Strait of Hormuz is so large. There’s more than 18 million barrels a day, about two thirds of world maritime oil trade. Meaning, cutting oil from there will lead to an acute oil shortage and prices will skyrocket,” Muhanna said. “Is Iran able or willing to close completely, or even partially, the Strait of Hormuz or Bab Al-Mandab, or both? The answer is no, and a really big no.” U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 pact between Iran and major world powers under which sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear programme. The Trump administration then announced unilateral plans to restore sanctions against Tehran.

2018-08-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate their bullish positions in crude and fuels, amid negative sentiment towards petroleum, before prices rallied sharply in the second half of last week. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 49 million barrels in the week to Aug. 20. Fund managers have reduced their net long position in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 508 million barrels (36 percent), according to an analysis of records published by regulators and exchanges. Total long positions have been slashed by 494 million barrels, while short positions have increased by 14 million barrels, since April 17. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2LyoJY3) As a result, portfolio managers’ combined net long position in petroleum has been cut to just 903 million barrels, the lowest for almost a year. And the ratio of long to short positions has fallen from almost 14:1 to just over 8:1, leaving the market looking much less lopsided than before. The most recent week saw continued liquidation of net length in Brent (-12 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-16 million), U.S. gasoline (-10 million), U.S. heating oil (-6 million) and European gasoil (-5 million). As in previous weeks, most of the changes came from the long side of the market, with fund managers trimming old bullish long positions rather than adding new bearish short ones. But there was a notable increase of 15 million barrels in short WTI positions on NYMEX, the largest one-week rise for 10 months. Negative sentiment among fund managers up to and including Tuesday last week, the cut-off date for the commitments’ of traders reports, likely created the conditions for a strong bounce later in the week. But benchmark Brent prices have traded sideways in a range between $70 and $80 for the four months since April, after rallying strongly over the preceding nine months. Prices are caught in the cross-current between fears about a supply-crunch as a result of the re-imposition of Iran sanctions and a potential hit to demand as a result of a slowdown in global growth. Until one, or both, those sources of uncertainty are resolved, prices seem set to remain rangebound. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.

2018-08-28,"* NAFTA deal punctures global trade war fears * World stocks hit 6-month high * Volatility slides as risk appetite picks up * Turkish lira, Italian bonds still under pressure * China leg of U.S. trade war still looms (Updates throughout) By Sujata Rao LONDON, Aug 28 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a six-month high on Tuesday, lifted by investor optimism that a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement will go some way to averting a global trade war. Some of the previous day’s buoyant mood was starting to ebb, however, on uncertainty over whether Canada would agree to the new terms of the three-nation pact. Pressure is heavy on Ottawa to join the agreement, with talks due for later on Tuesday Monday’s news of the U.S.-Mexico deal had pushed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes to fresh records, and on Tuesday, Europe and Asia  followed Wall Street’s lead, inching to multi-month highs. Wall Street was set to open slightly higher again, futures markets signalled , while the dollar slipped to a four-week low. Implied volatility across currencies and equity markets also eased, as investors took on greater risk. Emerging market stocks hit their highest since Aug. 9. “Global trade tensions have undoubtedly been the most significant source of risk in 2018,” said Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM. “The U.S.–Mexico deal seemed to boost confidence that the trade war is moving closer to an end, and the next question is who’s next to close a deal with Trump?” he said. MSCI’s benchmark world share index followed on from Monday’s best performance in over four months, rising 0.15 percent. A pan-European share index enjoyed a third straight day of gains, though it gave up some of its early gains. Auto stocks continued to rally, adding 1.3 percent after enjoying their best day in a month on Monday - German carmakers rely on smooth trade between Mexico and the United States to sell Mexican-assembled vehicles into U.S. markets. Disputes on trade have dragged on investor sentiment for much of 2018, despite solid economic fundamentals and robust corporate earnings. Many remain cautious. Paul Donovan, chief economist at UBS Global Wealth Management, said markets’ assumption of Canada  joining the new-look NAFTA was not “zero risk”. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened he still could put tariffs on Canadian-made cars and demanded concessions on Canada’s dairy protections. “If Canada does not join, then getting the agreement of (U.S.) Congress (to the deal) will be trickier,” Donovan said. And the toughest battle in the trade war - with China - still looms. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough, as another round of tariffs came into effect. The U.S. Commerce Department also said on Monday that Chinese steel wheels exports were heavily subsidised and that it could impose duties on the product. These issues kept Chinese shares trading near flat. An escalation in the U.S.-China spat would reverberate across Asia, “given the region’s intricate supply chains and that most of its economies still largely depend on exports”, Oxford Economics told clients. But Asian and other emerging markets are being supported for now by the dollar’s pullback from 14-month highs. The greenback was down 0.25 percent, just off one-month lows against a basket of currencies. Dollar losses accelerated last week after U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell signalled only a gradual pace of rate rises. U.S. economic data -  with latest estimates for second-quarter gross domestic product expected on Wednesday - could determine the dollar’s further moves. But its retreat has allowed currencies such as South Africa’s rand <ZAR=D3 and Australian dollar to rise off multi-month troughs, while the Mexican peso was at 2-1/2 week highs after surging more than one percent on Monday. There are exceptions, however. The Turkish lira fell another 1.8 percent against the dollar, adding to Monday’s 2 percent fall as concerns have not abated about Turkey’s rift with Washington and its monetary policies. Italian borrowing costs too rose to three-month highs after Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said the country’s public deficit could exceed the European Union’s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year. The British pound also slipped to languish near one-year lows to the euro as fears grew that the country would crash out of the EU without a trade agreement, a scenario many see as heralding economic disaster. nL3N1VI1WC (Reporting by Sujata Rao; Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Melbourne; Editing by Mark Potter and Alison Williams)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-world-stocks-at-6-month-high-as-nafta-deal-eases-trade-war-fears-idUKL8N1VJ3C2,28 Aug 2018,"* China leg of U.S. trade war still looms

2018-08-28,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot resigned on Tuesday in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals and nuclear energy policy, dealing a major blow to President Emmanuel Macron’s already tarnished green credentials. Hulot, a former TV presenter and green activist who consistently scored high in opinion polls, quit during a live radio interview following what he called an “accumulation of disappointments”. “I don’t want to lie to myself any more, or create the illusion that we’re facing up to these challenges,” Hulot said on France Inter. “I have therefore decided to leave the government.” Hulot was among Macron’s first ministerial appointments following his May 2017 election victory. His inclusion helped to sustain a green image France had earned 18 months earlier by brokering the Paris Agreement to combat global greenhouse emissions. But the centrist president has watered down a series of campaign pledges on the environment, including a commitment to cut the share of nuclear power in French electricity to 50 percent by 2025 and boost renewable energy. Those policy shifts have been a repeated source of frustration for Hulot. Since a post-election honeymoon period, they have been accompanied by a sharp slide in Macron’s ratings, which touched new lows after his bodyguard was filmed assaulting demonstrators last month. Hulot said he had not informed Macron before announcing his resignation. “This may not be the right protocol, but if I had warned them they might have talked me out of it yet again,” Hulot said. His cabinet portfolio also included energy. Government spokesman Benjamin Griveaux said the cabinet “regretted” his resignation, but also described it as “a blow from which we’ll recover”. “I don’t understand why he is stepping down when we had many successes in the first year that are to his credit,” Griveaux told BFM Television. “He didn’t win all his battles but that’s the way it goes for ministers.” Greenpeace France director Jean-Francois Julliard said that while Macron had “made some fine speeches” and stood up to U.S. President Donald Trump on climate change, he had “never turned these words to concrete action” at home. “There is still no energy transition policy in France,” Julliard said.    Shares in power utility EDF EDP.PA, which is on the hook for the cost of decommissioning older nuclear plants, surged 2.7 percent in early trading before settling back to 14.26 euros at 0901 GMT, still up 1 percent on Monday’s close. Hulot had also voiced disappointment after Macron wavered on a commitment to ban the weedkiller glyphosate, sold under Monsanto’s Roundup trademark, and failed to prevent Total’s (TOTF.PA) La Mede refinery producing biofuel from imported palm oil linked to deforestation. His announcement came a day after the government promised to relax hunting laws, in a move widely seen as an attempt to bolster Macron’s appeal in rural areas. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said he would discuss the “composition of the government” with Macron following Hulot’s departure, leaving open the possibility of other changes. Macron’s office sought to attribute the resignation to the “frustration, even exhaustion” of a ministerial novice suddenly confronted with the slow-moving machinery of government. “Political and administrative timeframes aren’t necessarily as one hopes, coming from activism,” an Elysee official said, insisting that Hulot’s deep commitment to environmentalism was evidenced by the government’s policy track record. In his radio interview, however, Hulot emphasized the inadequacy of “mini-steps” on climate change by France and other nations, voicing hope that his exit might “provoke deep introspection in our society about the reality of the world”. His doubts about remaining in government had grown over the summer as devastating droughts were met with a tepid political response, he said. Alain Juppe, a conservative former prime minister and presidential contender, said he was impressed by Hulot’s “high-mindedness and by the nobility of his act”. “Beyond the inevitable political buzz, I hope this decision encourages us all to think and to change,” he said on Twitter.

2018-08-28,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Investing $8 billion (£6.2 billion) in Brazil’s waning offshore Campos Basin could boost its oil production by 230,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2025, consultancy Wood Mackenzie said in a report on Tuesday.  Oil majors have already ploughed billions into Brazil, now Latin America’s top producer, to lock in stakes in its pre-salt offshore oil play, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor.  Meanwhile, oil and gas production in the Campos Basin, where activity began about forty years ago, has fallen by a third over the last seven years to 1.3 million boepd, raising the spectre of hefty outlays to close down operations. “Campos Basin is still a cash cow for Petrobras,” said Luiz Hayum who authored the report.  Although output is declining, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (PETR4.SA) - the world’s most indebted oil company - invests very little there, which means the basin is a healthy source of free cash flow, he said.  “This is not sustainable for a long time. Without receiving this additional investment, 32 platforms would cease production by 2025.”  Some $8 billion are needed to decommission those platforms and related infrastructure in the basin from 2018 to 2025, Wood Mackenzie forecasts.  But redirecting that money to boosting output instead could add 230,000 boepd to production by 2025, postpone 60 percent of the decommissioning costs until after 2030 and add $3 billion in royalty payments to the government, the consultancy said. Under a more optimistic scenario, where Brazil boosts its recovery factor in the basin to levels seen in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea, 5 billion barrels of additional oil could be recovered, it estimates.  Petrobras has been seeking outside investment to boost output from mature fields, as it focuses its own limited capital investment budget on its promising pre-salt holdings.  Last year, Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), formerly Statoil, paid up to $2.9 billion for a 25 percent stake in Petrobras’ Roncador, part of a bid to boost oil recovery in one of Brazil’s largest fields in the Campos basin.  Reuters reported in July that Petrobras entered exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oil clusters in Campos to a group backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, in a deal said to be worth some $1 billion.

2018-08-28,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 28 (Reuters) - China’s refiners increased their output in July to close to 12 million barrels per day (bpd), but at the same time exports of refined fuels fell to the lowest in four months. These facts may seem contradictory, and while there are several issues than can help explain the dynamics, perhaps the most compelling is that China appears to be becoming more attuned to market forces for refined products in Asia. As is often the case with China’s intake and processing of crude oil and its exports of refined products, the data is incomplete, and in this case the main missing numbers are movements in inventories. Inventory data was last released in April, so it’s hard to know how much of the refinery throughput went into storage tanks, as opposed to being exported or consumed domestically. But what is known is that refinery runs totalled 11.95 million bpd in July, a gain of 11.6 percent from the same month in 2017. In the first seven months of the year China’s refineries processed 12.07 million bpd, an increase of 9.2 percent over the same period last year. However, exports of gasoline fell to 890,000 tonnes in July, equivalent to about 244,000 bpd, down from 334,000 bpd in June and 403,000 bpd in May. Diesel exports fell to 1.54 million tonnes, or about 372,000 bpd, down from 402,000 bpd in June and 484,000 bpd in May. In addition to the unknown flows into inventories, gasoline and diesel exports may have been affected by Chinese refiners getting close to exhausting quotas and cutting back on shipments. It is also possible that the smaller, independent refineries exported less because of reduced runs, as they battle higher crude oil prices and increased government scrutiny on taxes. Chinese domestic consumption may also have risen, especially in the agricultural sector given the summer peak demand season. All of these factors can help shed light on the drop-off in China’s exports of refined fuels, but perhaps the best explanation is the movement of prices around the time when July exports would have been arranged. The profit from making a barrel of gasoline in Singapore from Brent crude GL92-SIN-CRK, the main regional benchmark, dropped to its low so far this year of $3.38 a barrel on July 4. It had been steadily declining since hitting a peak of $9.91 a barrel on May 22, meaning that at the time Chinese refiners would have been contemplating selling gasoline for exports, the incentive to do so was weakening. It’s a similar story for diesel, with the profit margin, or crack, for producing a barrel of 10 parts per million diesel from Dubai crude dropping to a low of $12.97 a barrel on June 27, down from $16.64 on May 18. The moves in pricing suggest that Chinese refiners may have become more price sensitive, and therefore less likely to export surplus refined fuels irrespective of the profit gained from doing so. What is also worth noting is that the cracks for both diesel and gasoline later strengthened, with diesel rising to $16.33 a barrel on Aug. 24, before slipping slightly to end at $16.06 on Monday. The gasoline crack jumped 240 percent from its July low to $11.55 a barrel on Aug. 15, although it subsequently eased to $8.21 on Monday. The recovery in the profit margins for refined fuels may have come too late to provide a significant boost to China’s exports in August. But September should reveal whether China’s refiners are indeed becoming more price-sensitive, or whether the other factors still play a bigger role.

2018-08-28,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Sizzling weather this summer will put pressure on almost 200 governments to reach a deal in Poland in December on the details of a global plan to limit climate change, the incoming president of the U.N. talks said. Environment ministers will meet in Katowice, the heart of Poland’s coal-producing region, Silesia, to agree rules for the 2015 Paris climate accord. That accord set a sweeping goal of ending the fossil fuel era this century, but the text was vague on details. “Paris is empty without Katowice,” Michal Kurtyka, a former deputy energy minister of Poland who will preside at the Dec. 3-14 talks, told Reuters.  Poland, which generates most of its electricity from coal, is hosting the annual U.N. climate talks for the third time. “The Paris agreement includes certain principles. However, the way they will be implemented will be described in the Katowice package. So the more detailed and concrete it is, the better,” Kurtyka said. Hot weather this summer that set off wildfires from California to Greece has made officials more determined to reach a detailed deal in Katowice, he said.  “For sure this is something that affected millions of people all over the world.(...) Societies in particular countries will act on politicians. I think that this will increase political determination for the solutions to be as concrete and as detailed as possible,” Kurtyka said.   Many issues remain to be discussed at an extra session in Bangkok next month, he said, where “a vision of the whole should be built”.  Some of the sticking points include the way the countries report on their emission reductions, adapting to climate change and financing tools, he said. Environmentalists have complained about foot-dragging by the countries involved. French Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot resigned on Tuesday in frustration over sluggish progress on climate goals.  Writing the “rule book” - formally known as “implementation guidelines” - is the biggest test of the international commitment to the Paris Agreement since U.S. President Donald Trump said in June last year that he would pull out. “If some countries, such as for example the U.S., conclude that they are not ready to follow the Paris agreement direction, then I’d assume that all other countries will seek to keep their presence so that they are part of the agreement,” Kurtyka said.  “I will strive for all parties to become signatories,  whereas the question I will ask at the end will be: Do I hear a voice of objection? I hope not”. The choice of Poland for the climate talks is itself a point of contention, because of its dependence on coal. In February, the European Union’s top court said the country had failed to uphold air-quality standards, one of several environmental conflicts between Poles and the EU. “The opinions that Poland is not a reliable climate talks host due to the significant share of coal in power production, are formulated from the EU perspective. The world is more diverse than that,” Kurtyka said. Kurtyka was appointed the climate talks president in April. He replaced the former Environment Minister Jan Szyszo, who had been initially named to preside at the conference in Katowice.  Szyszko had approved the increased logging in the ancient Bialowieza Forest back in 2016, another of Poland’s conflicts with the European Union.

2018-08-28,"CAMPOS LINDOS, Brazil (Reuters) - When farmer Julimar Pansera purchased land in Brazil’s interior seven years ago, it was blanketed in tiers of fruit trees, twisted shrubs and the occasional palm standing tall in a thicket of undergrowth. He mowed down most of that vegetation, set it ablaze and started planting soybeans. Over the past decade, he and others in the region have deforested an area larger than South Korea. Permissive land-use policies and cheap farm acreage here have helped catapult Brazil into an agricultural superpower, the world’s largest exporter of soy, beef and chicken and a major producer of pork and corn. This area has also lured farmers and ranchers away from the Amazon jungle, whose decline has spurred a global outcry to protect it. The tradeoff, environmentalists say, is that while Brazil has slowed destruction of the renowned rainforest from its worst levels, it has put another vital ecological zone at risk: a vast tropical savanna that is home to 5 percent of species on the planet. Known as the Cerrado, this habitat lost more than 105,000 square kilometers (40,541 square miles) of native cover since 2008, according to government figures. That’s 50 percent more than the deforestation seen during the same period in the Amazon, a biome more than three times larger. Accounting for relative size, the Cerrado is disappearing nearly four times faster than the rainforest. The largest savanna in South America, the Cerrado is a vital storehouse for carbon dioxide, the greenhouse gas whose rising emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation are warming the world’s atmosphere. Brazilian officials have cited protection of native vegetation as critical to meeting its obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change. But scientists warn the biome has reached a tipping point that could hamper Brazil’s efforts and worsen global warming. By focusing on one problem, Brazil essentially created another, said Ane Alencar, science director of the non-profit Amazon Environmental Research Institute, known as IPAM. “There’s a high risk for the climate associated with this expansion,” Alencar said. “Limiting and calling attention to deforestation in the Amazon, in a way it forced the agribusiness industry to expand in the Cerrado.” The toll can already be seen in the region’s water resources. Streams and springs are filling with silt and drying up as vegetation around them vanishes. That in turn is weakening the headwaters of vital rivers flowing to the rest of the country, scientists say. The imperiled waterways include the Sao Francisco, Brazil’s longest river outside the Amazon, where water levels are hitting never-before-seen lows in the dry season. “The removal of vegetation can lead a body of water to extinction,” said Liliana Pena Naval, an environmental engineering professor at the Federal University of Tocantins. Wildlife, too, is under threat, including rare hyacinth macaws, maned wolves and jaguars that call the shrinking savanna home. So are thousands of plants, fish, insects and other creatures found nowhere else on earth, many of which are only beginning to be studied. “I compare it to the burning of the ancient Library of Alexandria,” said Mercedes Bustamante, an ecologist at the University of Brasilia. “You lose the accumulated evolutionary record of thousands of years that never can be recovered.” Farmers see the Cerrado’s development as critical to global food security and their nation’s prosperity. Brazil’s agriculture sector grew a sizzling 13 percent in 2017, while the overall economy barely budged. The nation’s ability to keep producing new farmland cheaply has given it an edge over rivals and cemented its status as a vital supplier to the world’s tables. “Imagine, if not for Brazil’s production, how much more hunger would there be,” farmer Pansera said. Roughly the size of Mexico, straddling Brazil’s mid-section from its far western borders with Paraguay and stretching northeast towards the Atlantic coast, the Cerrado has seen about half of its native forests and grasslands converted to farms, pastures and urban areas over the past 50 years. Deforestation in the region has slowed from the early 2000s, when Brazil’s soy boom was gaining steam. Still, farmers continue to plow under vast stretches of the biome, propelled largely by Chinese demand for Brazilian meat and grain. The Asian nation is Brazil’s No. 1 buyer of soybeans to fatten its own hogs and chickens. China is also a major purchaser of Brazilian pork, beef and poultry to satisfy the tastes of its increasingly affluent consumers. Rising trade tensions between China and the United States have only deepened that connection. Brazil’s soybean exports by value to China are up 18 percent through the first seven months of the year as Chinese buyers have canceled tens of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts with U.S. suppliers. The trend bodes well for producers in the Cerrado’s frontier region known as Matopiba, shorthand for the northeastern Brazilian states of Maranhao, Tocantins, Piaui and Bahia. Land here is cheap. Virgin plots near Pansera in the state of Tocantins can be had for $248 an acre on average, according to agribusiness consultancy Informa Economics IEG FNP. That compares to an average of $3,080 per acre for already cleared farmland in the United States. Soy planting in Matopiba has more than doubled over the past decade. Pansera, 50, is part of a wave of industrious transplants from southern Brazil who are remaking the region. His formal education stopped at middle school, but he found land enough in the Cerrado to match his big ambitions. He now presides over nearly 19 square miles (49 square kilometers) of manicured soy fields and has about 20 full-time workers on his payroll. Pansera’s soybeans will bring in an estimated profit of nearly 5 million reais ($1.23 million) this year, most of which he plans to invest back into the farm. Government policies have intentionally driven industrial-scale farming here. Short on farmland to feed its growing population, Brazil in the 1970s looked to its vast savanna, a region early explorers had dubbed “cerrado,” or “closed,” because of its tangled woodlands. State agriculture scientists developed fertilizers and additives to fix the acidic, nutrient-poor earth and created soybean strains that could thrive in the tropics. Arable land exploded. Within a decade, Brazil transformed itself from a food importer to a net exporter. By the 1990s it was moving global commodities markets. “Agriculture in the Cerrado is what took Brazil to the next level,” Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi told Reuters. Known as Brazil’s “Soy King,” Maggi is a billionaire whose family runs one of the largest private soybean operations in the world, much of it in the Cerrado. Maggi said growers are respectful of legally allowed limits on deforestation. Their “rational” occupation of the Cerrado has helped Brazil’s economy, he said. Farmers have emerged as a powerful political force bent on keeping Brazil’s countryside open for business. Lawmakers in the country’s largely rural, pro-agriculture voting bloc, who comprise more than 40 percent of the nation’s congress, have led a rollback of environmental laws in recent years. Those efforts include a 2012 loosening of Brazil’s landmark Forest Code that sets requirements for preserving native vegetation. The change reduced potential penalties for farmers, ranchers and loggers charged with past illegal deforestation, and made it easier for landowners to clear more of their holdings. Annual deforestation in the Amazon last year was up 52 percent from a record low in 2012. Still, environmental protections there remain the most robust in Brazil. Rainforest farmers are required by law to preserve 80 percent of native vegetation on their plots. And global grain traders in 2006 voluntarily agreed to stop purchasing any soy harvested from newly deforested Amazon jungle areas. As part of its obligations under the Paris Agreement, the government pledged to eliminate illegal Amazon deforestation by 2030. Brazil has made no similar push to preserve the Cerrado, which has long been viewed as a resource to be developed. Cerrado farmers are required to preserve as little as 20 percent of the natural cover, and up to 35 percent in areas neighboring the Amazon. Those who don’t maximize use of their tracts risk having their land declared idle and subject to redistribution under a 1980 federal land-reform initiative aimed at assisting rural, low-income people, said Elvison Nunes Ramos, sustainability coordinator with the Ministry of Agriculture. “The message being sent to the farmer is that he should not preserve, he should deforest,” Nunes Ramos said of the policy. A spokesman for Incra, the government agency that verifies the use of the rural land, said its job is to ensure “the fulfillment of the social function of the property.” Environmentalists say the Cerrado’s wooded grasslands have failed to capture the public’s attention the way the Amazon’s lush jungles have. People view the Cerrado “just as bushes, twisted vegetation and shrubs,” lamented Alencar, the science director at IPAM. What many don’t see, she said, is the connection between the soybean-fed meat on their plates and the steady decline of one of the world’s great carbon sinks, a bulwark against global warming. Plants here send roots deep into the earth to survive seasonal drought and fires, creating a vast underground network that some have likened to an upside-down forest. Destruction of surface vegetation, and the resulting die-off of the life below, released 248 million tonnes of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere in 2016, according to estimates by the Climate Observatory, a Brazilian conservation group. That’s roughly two-and-a-half times the annual tailpipe emissions from all cars in Brazil. Watersheds are hurting, too. In Palmeirante, a rural municipality in the state of Tocantins, subsistence farmer Ronivon Matias de Andrade blames expanding mega-farms for damaging a community water source. Dressed in faded shorts and flip flops, he showed a visitor the remains of what until recently had been a shady woodland: uprooted trees and freshly exposed earth pocked with heavy-equipment tracks. Stripped of its vegetation, sandy topsoil is now filling a nearby creek and an adjoining freshwater pool where he and other rural families draw drinking water. He scooped up a murky handful in disgust. “How many are being finished off in this manner in this state?” 43-year-old Andrade said. Environmentalists say vanishing creeks like those in Palmeirante are threatening the nation’s water supply. Seemingly insignificant sources - tiny brooks, nameless rivulets - are vital building blocks supplying water to tributary streams that in turn feed some of Brazil’s largest rivers. Of a dozen major water systems in Brazil, eight are born in the Cerrado. They include the Sao Francisco, the country’s fourth-largest river, which was once famed for its paddle-wheeled riverboats known as gaiolas. Environmentalists say man-made diversions, including agriculture and hydroelectric dams, have helped alter water levels to a degree that long stretches of the river are now unnavigable during the dry season. Loss of native ground cover is also driving microclimate change in the region, they say. Reduced vegetation leads to higher ground temperatures and lower humidity, a recipe for less rainfall. A study conducted at the University of Brasilia links deforestation to an 8.4 percent drop in precipitation from 1977 to 2010 in the Cerrado. Cerrado wildlife is under pressure as habitat shrinks. More than 300 species that dwell here are considered threatened with extinction, according to the government. Among them are 44 rare types of “annual fish” unique to the Cerrado whose short lives begin with spring rains and end with the summer heat. Scientists suspect that increasing dry spells could be interrupting their delicate reproduction cycles. Other creatures, including rheas - giant ostrich-like birds – will soon join the endangered species list if nothing is done to reverse the slide, says Ricardo Machado, a zoology professor at the University of Brasilia. He said the birds’ numbers have plummeted due to loss of native ground cover critical to breeding and nesting. Machado worries that unique Cerrado plants, insects and other creatures may vanish before scientists have an opportunity to identify them, much less study them. “There is a universe to be discovered,” Machado said. “All attention is focused on the Amazon, no one speaks for the Cerrado.” That’s beginning to change. Dozens of groups, including Greenpeace, the World Wildlife Foundation and the Brazilian research group IPAM, last year began pushing for large multinationals to protect the biome. In a document known as the Cerrado Manifesto, they called for immediate action to stop deforestation in the region. More than 60 companies, including McDonalds, Unilever and Walmart, have signed on so far. The firms have agreed to support measures that would eliminate native vegetation loss in the Cerrado from their supply chains. But in contrast to the 2006 Amazon soy moratorium, the Cerrado Manifesto did not commit signatories to halt purchases of farm products from newly deforested areas. Walmart and Unilever said they are committed to achieving zero net deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, meaning any destruction in one region would be offset by recuperation of similar forest elsewhere. Walmart said all its beef suppliers in the Cerrado are monitored to ensure they don’t contribute to deforestation there. McDonalds didn’t respond to a request for comment. Separately, Netherlands-based Louis Dreyfus Company in June became the first major commodity trader to pledge to stop buying soy from newly deforested land specifically in the Cerrado. The company gave no timetable, but said it would work to establish a “realistic target date” to end deforestation in its Cerrado supply chain. Brazil’s former Minister of Environment Jose Sarney Filho, who recently left office to run for Senate, has proposed an international effort to compensate landowners who preserve natural habitat. He raised the issue at last November’s global climate summit in Germany, but the effort has yet to attract major backers. Farmer Pansera, meanwhile, sees big things ahead for his patch of the Cerrado. Supervising the harvest on his land earlier this year, he watched a pair of combines chew through rows of soybean plants. The giant machines stripped away the beans and spit them into empty grain trucks rolling just behind to catch the bounty. He said there is no future without growth, and the frontier region of Matopiba is just getting started. He plans to plant an additional 180 hectares of soy next year on newly cleared land. “There is still a large area to be opened,” Pansera said. “It will be one of the great centers of Brazilian agriculture.” Reporting by Jake Spring; Editing by Marla Dickerson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-deforestation/special-report-appetite-for-destruction-soy-boom-devours-brazils-tropical-savanna-idUKL4N1V30CX,28 Aug 2018,"When farmer

2018-08-28,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Iran’s crude oil and condensate exports in August are set to drop below 70 million barrels for the first time since April 2017, well ahead of the Nov. 4 start date for a second round of U.S. economic sanctions. The United States has asked buyers of Iranian oil to cut imports to zero starting in November to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East.  The total volume of crude and condensate, an ultra-light oil produced from natural gas fields, to load in Iran this month is estimated at 64 million barrels, or 2.06 million barrels per day (bpd), versus a peak of 92.8 million barrels, or 3.09 million bpd, in April, preliminary trade flows data on Thomson Reuters Eikon showed. The National Iranian Oil Co has slashed its crude prices to keep buyer interest amid the August export drop. It has set the official selling price (OSP) for Iranian Heavy crude for September loading at the biggest discount since 2004, according to Reuters and trade data. Iran is currently the third-largest producer among the members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and benchmark oil futures traded in London LCOc1 have surged to their highest since June in anticipation of the loss of Iranian supply.  GRAPHIC - Iran crude price vs Saudi Arabia oil: reut.rs/2PKB1jl GRAPHIC - Iran crude oil exports from Jan 2016 to August 2018: reut.rs/2PGtjqB Imports by its key customers have all dropped in August as some buyers, banks and insurance companies have already suspended dealings in Iranian oil. Loadings bound for top customer China are set to fall to 18.4 million barrels in August, from 24 million barrels in July which was its highest monthly volume this year, the data showed. China has switched to using Iranian tankers to deliver the country’s crude since July to side-step the sanctions and sustain Iranian oil imports until at least October. The volume of oil heading to India is 8.2 million barrels, down from more than 20 million barrels in each month since April. Exports to India could still rise as the destination for about 11 million barrels of Iranian oil loading this month are yet to be identified. Japan-bound loadings have been scaled back to 3.4 million barrels in August, down for a second straight month. Japanese refiners are expected to load their last Iranian oil by mid-September so they will arrive in Japan before November. Iran has not loaded any oil bound for South Korea since July. Cargoes loading for Europe have been falling from a peak of 22.2 million barrels in March down to about 12 million barrels in August, the data showed. European companies such as France’s Total (TOTF.PA) are walking away from Iran for fear of triggering U.S. sanctions although Iran’s president has urged the remaining signatories to its 2015 nuclear agreement to save the pact. The United States withdrew from the agreement in May and ordered the renewed sanctions, the first of which went into effect on Aug. 7.

2018-08-28,"STAVANGER, Norway, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Current U.S. sanctions on Iran are unlikely to stop Iranian oil exports completely, a long-time adviser at Saudi Arabia’s Energy Ministry said on Tuesday, adding Iran would be unable to close the straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab even partially. Speaking at an oil conference in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, Ibrahim al-Muhanna said Iran would be the first to lose out on a move to block those major shipping routes and that any such action would trigger further sanctions on Iran. Iran has said if it cannot sell its oil due to U.S. pressure, then no other regional country will be allowed to do so either, threatening to block the Strait of Hormuz. “The amount of oil going through the Strait of Hormuz is so large. There’s more than 18 million barrels a day, about two thirds of world maritime oil trade. Meaning, cutting oil from there will lead to an acute oil shortage and prices will skyrocket,” Muhanna said. “Is Iran able or willing to close completely, or even partially, the Strait of Hormuz or Bab Al-Mandab, or both? The answer is no, and a really big no ... Current sanctions are unlikely to stop Iranian exports completely.” U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 pact between Iran and major world powers under which sanctions were lifted in return for Tehran accepting curbs on its nuclear programme. The Trump administration then announced unilateral plans to restore sanctions against Tehran.

2018-08-28,"BANGKOK, Aug 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Residents in a Bangkok neighbourhood are trying out a renewable energy trading platform that allows them to buy and sell electricity between themselves, signalling the growing popularity of such systems as solar panels get cheaper. The pilot project in the centre of Thailand’s capital is among the world’s largest peer-to-peer renewable energy trading platforms using blockchain, according to the firms involved. The system has a total generating capacity of 635 KW that can be traded via Bangkok city’s electricity grid between a mall, a school, a dental hospital and an apartment complex. Commercial operations will begin next month, said David Martin, managing director of Power Ledger, an Australian firm that develops technology for the energy industry and is a partner in the project. “By enabling trade in renewable energy, the community meets its own energy demands, leading to lower bills for buyers, better prices for sellers, and a smaller carbon footprint for all,” he said. “It will encourage more consumers to make the switch to renewable energy, as the cost can be offset by selling excess energy to neighbours,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Neighbourhoods from New York to Melbourne are upending the way power is produced and sold, with solar panels, mini grids and smart meters that can measure when energy is consumed rather than overall consumption. The World Energy Council predicts that such decentralised energy will grow to about a fourth of the market in 2025 from 5 percent today. Helping it along is blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins bitcoin currency, which offers a transparent way to handle complex transactions between users, producers, and even traders and utilities. Blockchain also saves individuals the drudgery of switching between sending power and receiving it, said Martin. For the pilot in Bangkok’s upmarket Sukhumvit neighbourhood, electricity generated by each of the four locations will be initially used within that building. Excess energy can be sold to the others through the trading system. If there is a surplus from all four, it will be sold to the local energy storage system, and to the grid in the future, said Gloyta Nathalang, a spokeswoman for Thai renewable energy firm BCPG, which installed the meters and solar panels. Thailand is Southeast Asia’s leading developer of renewable energy, and aims to have it account for 30 percent of final energy consumption by 2036. The energy ministry has encouraged community renewable energy projects to reduce fossil fuel usage, and the regulator is drafting new rules to permit the trade of energy. The Bangkok Metropolitan Electricity Authority forecasts “peer-to-peer energy trading to become mainstream for power generation in the long run,” a spokesman told reporters. BCPG, in partnership with the Thai real estate developer Sansiri, plans to roll out similar energy trading systems with solar panels and blockchain for a total capacity of 2 MW by 2021, said Gloyta. “There are opportunities everywhere - not just in cities, but also in islands and remote areas where electricity supply is a challenge,” she said.

2018-08-28,"(Adds some dropped words in paragraph 10.) * MSCI ex-Japan gain 0.6 pct, Nikkei jumps 0.7 pct * U.S., Mexico reach NAFTA deal, turn up pressure on Canada * Analysts treating the risk rally with caution * Some major currencies rally against the dollar By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Asian shares advanced on Tuesday and the U.S. dollar hovered near one-month lows as a U.S.-Mexico deal to overhaul the North American Free Trade Agreement boosted risk appetite. Investors expect Canada too would agree to the new terms to preserve a three-nation pact, ultimately dispelling the economic uncertainty prompted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to ditch the 1994 NAFTA accord. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.6 percent for a second straight day of gains. Australian shares and Japan’s Nikkei both rose 0.7 percent. New York’s S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes hit record highs led by gains in technology stocks. The upbeat trade outlook was further boosted by news that Washington was pressuring the European Union to accelerate tariff talks. However, some analysts were cautious about the rally. “News of the U.S.-Mexico trade deal has fuelled risk appetite,” ANZ analysts said in a client note. “It is hard to extrapolate much out of it, as the United States continues to treat each country and deal on its own merit. We remain wary of the current rally in risk appetite, and see it as short-lived.” Disputes between the United States and its trading partners have been a drag on investor sentiment for much of the year despite solid economic fundamentals and two robust quarters of corporate earnings. JPMorgan analysts said the trade deal was not necessarily positive for the outcome of talks with China. “The NAFTA agreement is clearly a positive to the extent that it reduces the risk of a generalized global trade war,” they said. “Despite this, APAC equities including HK/China should benefit from the weaker U.S. dollar and risk-on moves.” Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 0.6 percent while Chinese stocks were more subdued. Shanghai’s SSE Composite index held steady and the blue-chip CSI300 index slipped 0.1 percent. The United States and China held two days of talks last week without a major breakthrough as their trade war escalated with the activation of another round of duelling tariffs on $16 billion of each country’s goods. Investors will also stay focused on U.S. economic data with consumer confidence figures due later in the day and the latest estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product expected on Wednesday. The dollar index paused near one-month lows against major currencies to stand at 94.84. Against the yen, the greenback held at 111.28. The euro was near a one-month top at $1.1680. The Australian dollar, which is often used as a liquid hedge for global growth, was a tad lower at $0.7331 but well above a 1-1/2 year trough of $0.7203 touched earlier this month. Oil prices were buoyant with Brent up 9 cents at $0.76.30 a barrel and U.S. crude 5 cents firmer at $68.92. Gold was subdued with spot prices at $1,208.23 an ounce, down 0.2 percent.

2018-08-28,"* OPEC still cutting back more output than it agreed to * IEA warns of further production falls in Venezuela * Venezuelan crude exports have halved to below 1 mln bpd * U.S. sanctions to target Iran’s oil sector from November (Adds weaker dollar, comment; updates prices) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday as risks of supply disruptions from places such as Venezuela, Africa and Iran triggered expectations of a tightening market. International Brent crude oil futures were at $76.37 per barrel at 0215 GMT, up 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $68.96 a barrel. Despite some concerns about an economic slowdown because of the U.S.-China trade conflict, crude supplies are relatively tight due to disruptions as well as voluntary restraints on output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The cartel’s monitoring committee found that oil producers participating in a supply-reduction agreement, which includes non-OPEC member Russia, cut output in July by 9 percent more than called for. The findings for last month compare with a compliance level of 120 percent for June and 147 percent for May, meaning participants have been steadily increasing production. OPEC and its allies agreed in late 2016 to cut output from 2017 by around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) versus October 2016 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Monday also warned of further supply disruptions, especially from Venezuela, where an economic crisis has cut deep into the OPEC-member’s oil output. Venezuelan crude oil exports have halved in the previous two years to just 1 million bpd by mid-2018, according to trade flow data. “We can expect a further fall,” the IEA’s Executive Director Fatih Birol told Reuters in Norway on Monday. Birol also warned that African OPEC-members Libya and Nigeria “seem both still fragile countries” despite some recent improvements. Birol said it was too early to gauge the impact of the U.S. sanctions that will target Iran from November. Beyond a relatively tight supply outlook, analysts said a fall in the dollar over the past two weeks was also supporting crude, as it makes oil purchases cheaper for countries using other currencies at home. “The weaker U.S.-dollar helped commodities in general,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at futures brokerage AxiTrader.

2018-08-28,"(Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Monday urged the remaining signatories to its 2015 nuclear agreement to act to save the pact, although France’s leader called again for broader talks on Tehran’s missile programme and its role in the Middle East region. In a phone call to French President Emmanuel Macron, Rouhani said Iran wanted the Europeans to give guarantees on banking channels and oil sales as well as in the field of insurance and transportation, according to the state-run Iranian news agency IRNA. “Iran has acted upon all its promises in the nuclear agreement and, with attention to the one-sided withdrawal of America ... expects the remaining partners to operate their programs more quickly and transparently,” Rouhani was quoted as saying. Rouhani was speaking in the light of U.S. sanctions reimposed by Washington after President Donald Trump in May pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. Macron reiterated France’s commitment to maintaining the accord, a remark aimed at soothing Tehran. But he repeated his earlier calls for broader discussions with all relevant parties that would include Iran’s nuclear programme after 2025, its ballistics programme and its influence in the wider Middle East region.  “We will do everything so that the talks help avoid a serious crisis in the months ahead,” Macron said in an annual speech to French ambassadors. Separately, the head of the navy of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, General Alireza Tangsiri, said on Monday that Iran had full control of the Gulf and the U.S. Navy did not belong there, according to the Tasnim news agency. Tehran has suggested it could take military action in the Gulf to block other countries’ oil exports in retaliation for U.S. sanctions intended to halt its sales of crude. Washington maintains a fleet in the Gulf that protects oil shipping routes. Tangsiri said Iran had full control of the Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz that leads into it. Closing the strait would be the most direct way of blocking shipping. “We can ensure the security of the Persian Gulf and there is no need for the presence of aliens like the U.S. and the countries whose home is not in here,” he said in the quote, which appeared in English translation on Tasnim. He added: “All the carriers and military and non-military ships will be controlled and there is full supervision over the Persian Gulf. Our presence in the region is physical and constant and night and day.” Later on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a Twitter post: “The Islamic Republic of Iran does not control the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is an international waterway. The United States will continue to work with our partners to ensure freedom of navigation and free flow of commerce in international waterways.” The head of the Revolutionary Guards, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, said on Monday that Iran’s enemies would not prevail in a conflict. “The enemies are strictly avoiding any conflict with Iran because they know that it will not be beneficial for them,” Jafari said, according to Tasnim.  As tension has escalated between Iran and the United States, senior U.S. officials have said they aim to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the most senior authority in the Islamic Republic, said last month that he supported the idea that if Iran is not allowed to export oil, then no country should export oil from the Gulf.

2018-08-28,"(Repeats item published on Monday with no changes to text) * Joint venture could be in Tianjin or Singapore -sources * JV could help China replace Iran, U.S. oil imports, if needed * Zhenhua already marketing SOMO crude since early 2018 By Chen Aizhu and Rania El Gamal BEIJING/DUBAI, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Iraq’s state oil marketer SOMO is close to a deal with China’s state-run Zhenhua Oil to boost the OPEC member’s crude oil sales to the world’s top oil importer, four sources with knowledge of the matter said. Iraq is the second-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The move will bolster Iraq’s position in Asia, the world’s biggest and fastest-growing oil-consuming region, which already takes 60 percent its oil exports at some 3.8 million barrels a day (bpd). “Zhenhua helped Iraq to penetrate the Chinese market and make more revenues for Iraq,” said a senior source familiar with the discussions on the deal, adding that a 50/50 proposed joint venture could be finalised in October or November. Another source said the deal was pending regulatory approvals, giving no further details. It is not clear where the JV would be located, but two of the sources familiar with the negotiations said the port city of Tianjin, near Beijing, was under discussion. Singapore is also among the options, they said. All four sources declined to be named as they were not authorized to discuss commercial matters with media. Zhenhua declined to comment. SOMO did not immediately respond to an email request for comment. China is under the pressure to cut oil purchases from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, as the United States re-imposes sanctions on Tehran and threatens to choke off the Islamic republic’s oil exports to zero. Amid the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing it is also unclear whether Chinese importers will be able to continue to import U.S. crude. The SOMO-Zhenhua deal would give China another crude supply option as the Iran and U.S. oil flows are threatened. Zhenhua’s relationship with SOMO goes back to former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein’s days, when China-based parent company defence conglomerate Norinco, was among the first Chinese entities active in Iraq’s oil and gas exploration. Last year, Zhenhua won a term contract to supply diesel fuel to SOMO for the first time, and it also recently entered a deal to develop Iraq’s East Baghdad oilfield. Zhenhua has been marketing Iraq’s main crude grade, Basra Light, for SOMO since the start of 2018 and has also sold some to Taiwan, said a separate Singapore-based trading source. Zhenhua, the smallest of China’s state-run oil and gas majors, has over the past three years expanded its foothold in oil sales to independent Chinese refiners, which were only allowed to start importing crude from 2015 and now make up some 20 percent of China’s total crude imports. Zhenhua’s crude sales to such independents, sometimes known as “teapots”, hit a record 6.5 million tonnes last year, or 131,000 bpd, equivalent to about 7 percent of overall teapot purchases, according to industry estimates. China’s state oil majors Sinopec, CNOOC and PetroChina are regular Iraqi oil customers under term supply deals with SOMO or oilfield service contracts.
