2018-08-06,"(Adds Dominion comment, background) By Scott DiSavino Aug 6 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday vacated permits by two federal agencies that allowed Dominion Energy Inc to build its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline, a decision the company does not expect to hold up its $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion project. In response to the court’s concerns about the environment, Dominion said it would work with the agencies to reinstate the permits for the 600-mile (966-km) pipe from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina. “We believe the court’s concerns can be promptly addressed ... without causing unnecessary delay,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email. In the meantime, Ruby said Dominion will continue work in West Virginia and North Carolina. The company has said it expects to finish the 1.5-billion cubic feet per day pipe by late 2019. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. The ruling was the latest victory for the Sierra Club and other opponents of gas pipelines in the 4th U.S. Court of Appeals. Last week, the court told EQT Corp to stop work on its Mountain Valley pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia after voiding two federal permits for that project. Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley are two of several pipelines under construction to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. In the Atlantic Coast case, the Sierra Club and others challenged decisions by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service. The Fish and Wildlife Service issued an Incidental Take Statement under the Endangered Species Act authorizing the company to build the pipeline in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species, including mussels, bumble bees, crustaceans and bats. The court wants Fish and Wildlife to put more limits on how the company deals with the animals in a 20-mile portion of the pipeline’s route in West Virginia and 80 miles in Virginia. Dominion said it will avoid those areas until the agency clarifies the limits, which the company expects shortly. The court wants the National Park Service to better explain why permitting a pipeline to cross under the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia is consistent with the conservation and preservation purpose, including scenic views, of a national highway. Dominion said it expects the Park Service to provide the information and promptly reissue the permit. Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Jonathan Oatis and

2018-08-06,"PARIS, Aug 6 (Reuters) - The French government has approved bids for 103 solar power projects with a total capacity of 720 megawatts, the energy minister said on Monday. The ground solar projects, which could provide power for around 100,000 homes annually, are part of the government’s plan announced in 2016 to add 3,000 MW of solar capacity to France’s energy mix by 2020. Energy Minister Nicolas Hulot said in a statement the average price proposed by winners in the tender process was 58.2 euros ($67.24) a megawatt hour (MWh), down 5 percent compared with the previous tender round in July last year. He added that two other tender rounds were expected with a capacity of 850 MW each. France is racing to increase its wind, solar and other low carbon power generation sources so as to reduce its dependence on nuclear power generation which currently accounts for over 75 percent of its electricity needs. $1 = 0.8656 euros

2018-08-06,"HOUSTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Shale oil producer Continental Resources Inc said on Monday that it formed a subsidiary to manage mineral royalties with Franco-Nevada Corp, part of Continental’s plan to diversify revenue sources. Mineral rights are often less-risky investments than drilling wells, which can carry large operational, labor and environmental concerns. Continental, controlled by billionaire wildcatter Harold Hamm, will as part of the deal receive $220 million from Franco-Nevada, which manages gold and commodity royalties around the globe. The companies will fund the subsidiary with $125 million each year for the next three years to buy mineral rights in the SCOOP and STACK oil plays of Oklahoma, near where Continental already has operating wells. Continental will only be required to fund 20 percent of that amount but will be entitled to between 25 percent to 50 percent of the subsidiary’s revenue, according to a press release. With mineral rights, investors typically agree to pay for a cost of a well’s development in exchange for a percentage of future revenues. By forming the subsidiary with Franco-Nevada, Continental is effectively gaining access to a less-risky revenue stream. The company will also have access to data from wells in which the subsidiary invests, a key source of market information. Continental plans to use proceeds from the subsidiary to cull its $6.16 billion debt load. The company is slated to post quarterly results on Tuesday. “We are pleased to announce yet another growth vehicle to Continental within our core business,” Hamm said in the press release.

2018-08-06,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin wants to be able to intervene in investments and takeovers if an investor outside the European Union acquires a shareholding of at least 15 percent in a German company, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. Berlin tightened controls on foreign investments last year after a series of high-profile takeovers by Chinese companies, making it possible for the government to intervene if a buyer amassed a shareholding of 25 percent. The Economy Ministry should be able to intervene if a non-EU investor “acquires a direct or indirect shareholding of at least 15 percent of voting rights in a German company,” Die Welt newspaper cited a draft law as saying. In Germany and other countries including the United States, France, Australia and Britain, there are concerns that China and other rivals are gaining access to key technologies via takeovers. The proposal to change the German Foreign Trade Ordinance is being coordinated with other ministries and a law that provides for more control could come into effect this year, Die Welt reported. “When it comes to defense-related companies, critical infrastructure or certain areas of other civil security-related technologies such as IT security, we want to take a closer look in future,” it quoted German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier as saying. “Until now we’ve only been able to make checks when at least 25 percent of a company’s shares have been acquired. Now we want to lower this threshold so we can review more acquisitions in sensitive economic sectors,” he added. Altmaier said Germany still wanted companies to invest in Germany but added attentiveness where such investment affects national security interests was part of the social market economy. Last week the German government signaled it was prepared to use a new power to veto foreign takeovers of German companies in the case of a Chinese bid for toolmaker Leifeld. That came after Leifeld’s majority owner Georg Koffler said China’s Yantai Taihai had dropped its attempt to buy the company ahead of an expected veto by the German government. Last month, a German state bank bought a stake in high-voltage grid operator 50Hertz to prevent China’s state grid acquiring the shareholding and promised to consider ways of better protecting companies from foreign acquisition. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service has also said that Chinese state actors seeking trade secrets could be behind bids that nominally came from private firms, highlighting a seeming correlation between a decline in hacking attempts originating from China with an increase in bids.

2018-08-06,"ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo sacked Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko on Monday, a statement from the presidency said, giving no official reason. Press reports said Agyarko was removed because Akufo-Addo was unhappy with his handling of an agreement to extend an existing five-year deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy to operate a 300MW emergency power plant.  The deal has been controversial in Ghana, with critics balking at a price tag of more than half a billion dollars. Akufo-Addo asked Agyarko to hand over his office to the minister of Lands and Natural Resources, John Peter Amew, until a new appointment is made, the statement said. The West African country became an energy producer in late 2010, and produces around 180,000 barrels per day mainly from three main fields, which also produce most of Ghana’s gas for power generation. But intermittent power cuts have been a headache for the government, as demand consistently surges ahead of supply.

2018-08-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets lifted on Monday after strong corporate earnings helped Wall Street close higher, but a tariff dispute between the United States and China limited gains in equities while boosting the dollar and helping keep Treasury yields lower. Sterling GBP= dropped to an 11-month low after the British trade minister warned that the nation was headed for a no-deal Brexit, stoking investor fears that Britain could soon leave the European Union without securing a trade agreement. U.S. Treasury yields dipped, with the 10-year yield holding below 3 percent on moderate buying, on trade concerns and in advance of this week’s August refunding, where the government will sell $78 billion in coupon-bearing securities. “It’s the trade tension between U.S. and China that’s caused a pickup in bids for Treasuries,” said James Barnes, director of fixed income at Bryn Mawr Trust in Devon, Pennsylvania. After opening lower, all three major U.S. indexes closed higher. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 39.60 points, or 0.16 percent, to 25,502.18, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 10.1 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,850.40 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 47.66 points, or 0.61 percent, to 7,859.68. [nL1N1UX19K] The prolonged trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rattled financial markets across the globe. Kristina Hooper, global market strategist at Invesco in New York, said there were some signs China is “hunkering down and getting ready for a significant trade war” and that the impact could be more far-reaching than previously assumed. Chinese state media attacked President Donald Trump’s trade policies on Monday, calling the U.S. plan “extortion,” in a bid to reassure investors as growth concerns battered China’s financial markets. The media campaign comes days after China proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports in retaliation for the Trump administration’s plans to impose 25-percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. Chinese stocks .SSEC fell nearly 1.3 percent on Monday. Still, U.S. equities have been able to offset some of the fallout of the trade spat with a strong earnings season to date.  Of the more than 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 78.6 percent have topped earnings estimates, well above the average of 72 percent for the past four quarters. Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKb.N), which rose 2.9 percent after the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate reported a 67 percent surge in quarterly operating profit on Saturday, helped bump up the S&P. European shares followed their Asian counterparts lower, hurt by weak European bank earnings and trade fears, but a falling euro boosted exporters and helped halt the slide. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.15 percent and MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS edged up 0.06 percent. Worries about trade were evident in currency markets. The dollar index .DXY, which benefits as investors rush to safety, rose on Monday, building on two consecutive weeks of gains as investors bet that trade war rhetoric and a strong U.S. economy would continue to boost the greenback. Against a broad basket of currencies, the dollar was last up 0.25 percent to 95.378, within striking distance of a more than one-year peak of 95.652 reached on July 19. Sterling fell to $1.2920, its lowest since September 2017, before settling down half a percent on the day GBP=D3. It slumped 0.4 percent against the euro to 89.33 pence EURGBP= and was the biggest loser among major currencies against a broadly strong greenback.

2018-08-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures gained on Monday after OPEC sources said Saudi crude production unexpectedly fell in July, raising concerns about global oil supplies as the United States prepares to reinstate sanctions against major exporter Iran. Brent crude futures rose 54 cents to settle at $73.75 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 52 cents to settle at $69.01 a barrel. Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two sources at the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from June. That came despite a pledge by the Saudis and top producer Russia in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia promising a “measurable” supply boost. “Prices had dropped recently assuming that Saudi was going to continue to produce,” said Stewart Glickman, an energy equity analyst at CFRA Research in New York. “If the argument now is that maybe they can’t produce as much as everyone was hoping for, that puts some upward pressure on prices.” Brent prices fell 6.5 percent in July, their steepest monthly drop since July 2016. U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note that “the Saudi and Russian production surges appear to be more limited” than expected, adding that the imminent reinstatement of U.S. sanctions against Iran also fed bullish sentiment. Washington is due to reinstate some sanctions against Iran that it suspended after a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran that sought to curb Iran’s nuclear program. Some of the sanctions resume on Tuesday. The United States also plans to re-introduce sanctions on Iranian oil in November, which could dent the OPEC member’s output. Renewed sanctions are part of the Trump administration’s strategy to deny resources to the Iranian leadership. Washington wants as many countries as possible to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero, a senior U.S. administration official said in a telephone press briefing. But a senior official at Iran’s economy ministry said Tehran did not think the economic impact of the sanctions would be massive. “Many countries, including Europeans, disagree with the U.S. sanctions and are willing to work with Iran,” said the official, who asked not to be named. Most Iranian crude exports go to China and India, but roughly 20 percent go to Europe, where refiners have already cut their purchases.  Meanwhile, U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months.

2018-08-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world is at risk of entering “hothouse” conditions where global average temperatures will be 4-5 degrees Celsius higher even if emissions reduction targets under a global climate deal are met, scientists said in a study published on Monday. The report comes amid a heatwave that has pushed temperatures above 40C (104 Fahrenheit) in Europe this summer, causing drought and wildfires, including blazes in Greece in July that killed 91 people. Around 200 countries agreed in 2015 to limit temperature rise to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial levels, a threshold believed to be a tipping point for the climate. However, it is not clear whether the world’s climate can be safely “parked” near 2C above pre-industrial levels or whether this might trigger other processes which drive further warming even if the world stops emitting greenhouse gases, the research said. Currently, global average temperatures are just over 1C above the pre-industrial period and rising at 0.17C each decade. Scientists from the Stockholm Resilience Center, the University of Copenhagen, Australian National University and the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research said it is likely that if a critical threshold is crossed, several tipping points will lead to abrupt change. Such processes include permafrost thaw; the loss of methane hydrates from the ocean floor; weaker land and ocean carbon sinks; the loss of Arctic summer sea ice and the reduction of Antarctic sea ice and polar ice sheets. “These tipping elements can potentially act like a row of dominoes. Once one is pushed over, it pushes Earth toward another,” said Johan Rockström, co-author of the report published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and executive director of the Stockholm Resilience Centre. “It may be very difficult or impossible to stop the whole row of dominoes from tumbling over. Places on Earth will become uninhabitable if ‘Hothouse Earth’ becomes the reality,” he said. Maximizing the chances of avoiding such a “hothouse” state requires more than just reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the report said. For example, improved forest, agricultural and soil management; biodiversity conservation and technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it underground are needed. Commenting on the research, some experts said uncontrolled warming is still uncertain but not implausible. “In the context of the summer of 2018, this is definitely not a case of crying wolf, raising a false alarm: the wolves are now in sight,” said Phil Williamson, climate researcher at the University of East Anglia.

2018-08-06,"(Adds details, background) By Parisa Hafezi ANKARA, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed a U.S. call for talks on Monday, hours before Washington was due to impose new sanctions in line with President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of a 2015 agreement over Iran’s nuclear programme. Washington has said the only way Iran could avert the sanctions would be to agree to new negotiations to abandon its missile and nuclear programmes. In a televised address, Rouhani said there could be no talks as long as Washington was reneging on the deal. “If you stab someone with a knife and then you say you want talks, then the first thing you have to do is remove the knife,” Rouhani said. “We are always in favour of diplomacy and talks ... But talks need honesty,” Rouhani said. “Trump’s call for direct talks is only for domestic consumption in America ahead of elections ... and to create chaos in Iran.” European allies tried and failed to persuade Trump not to walk out of the 2015 agreement, under which Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. Rouhani said Washington would come to rue a move that had been rejected by other countries. “America will regret imposing sanctions on Iran ... They’re already isolated in the world. They are imposing sanctions on Iranian children, patients and the nation,” he said. The prospect of sanctions has already hurt Iran’s economy, with the rial currency falling this year and the government cracking down on protests. Rouhani called on Iranians to unite in the face of hardship. “There will be pressure because of sanctions but we will overcome this with unity,” he said. The Trump administration argues that the curbs did not go far enough and it wants to force Iran back to the negotiating table. Iran says that by abandoning the agreement Washington has shown it cannot negotiate in good faith. Last month, Trump said that he would be willing to meet Rouhani without preconditions to discuss how to improve relations. Senior Iranian officials and military commanders have rejected Trump’s offer of talks as worthless and “a dream”, saying his words contradicted his action of reimposing sanctions.

Sterling dropped to an 11-month low after the British trade minister warned that the nation was headed for a no-deal Brexit, stoking investor fears that Britain could soon leave the European Union without securing a trade agreement. U.S. Treasury yields dipped, with the 10-year yield holding below 3 percent on moderate buying, on trade concerns and in advance of this week’s August refunding, where the government will sell $78 billion in coupon-bearing securities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 4.64 points, or 0.02 percent, to 25,457.94, the S&P 500 gained 5.06 points, or 0.18 percent, to 2,845.41 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.98 points, or 0.26 percent, to 7,831.99. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.04 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.20 percent. The prolonged trade dispute between Washington and China has rattled financial markets across the globe. “For months now, investors have been guessing about what’s going to happen and there is no precedent to go by,” said Craig Callahan, president at ICON Funds in Denver. “It’s unsettling for the markets.” Chinese state media attacked President Donald Trump’s trade policies on Monday, calling the U.S. plan ineffective “extortion,” in a bid to reassure investors as growth concerns battered China’s financial markets. The media campaign comes days after China proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports in retaliation to the Trump administration’s plans to impose 25 percent tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports. Chinese stocks slumped nearly 1.3 percent on Monday. Still, U.S. equities have been able to offset some of the fallout of the trade spat with a strong earnings season to date. Of the more than 400 S&P 500 companies that have reported so far, 78.6 percent have topped earnings estimates. That is well above the average of 72 percent for the past four quarters. Berkshire Hathaway Inc rose 3.6 percent after the Warren Buffett-led conglomerate reported a 67 percent surge in quarterly operating profit on Saturday. European shares followed their Asian counterparts lower - hurt by weak European bank earnings and trade fears - but a falling euro boosted exporters and helped halt the slide. The pan-European share indexes  were down 0.14 percent and 0.07 percent respectively. Worries about trade were evident in currency markets. The dollar index, which benefits as investors rush to safety, rose on Monday, building on two consecutive weeks of gains as investors bet that trade war rhetoric and a strong U.S. economy would continue to boost the greenback. Against a broad basket of currencies, the dollar was last up 0.24 percent to 95.369 and was within striking distance of more-than-one-year peak of 95.652 reached on July 19. The greenback was also boosted by disappointing German data and concerns about Britain’s plan to leave the euro zone. The euro fell to a five-week low of $1.1527 as German industrial orders fell more than expected in June, posting their steepest monthly drop in nearly a year and a half. Sterling fell to $1.2920 - its lowest since September 2017 - before settling down half a percent on the day. It slumped 0.4 percent against the euro to 89.33 pence and was the biggest loser among major currencies against a broadly strong greenback. Oil prices gained, helped by an unexpected decline in Saudi crude production. U.S. crude rose 1.75 percent to $69.69 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.05, up 1.15 percent on the day.

2018-08-06,"(Repeats story from Aug. 3 for wider readership with no change to text) By Rajendra Jadhav and Emily Chow MUMBAI/KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Edible oil traders are sourcing exports of palm oil and other cooking oils to India from neighbouring countries, designating the supplies as duty-free under a regional free-trade pact and circumventing India’s import tax hike on the oils. India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among the signatories of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) that created a free-trade zone in the South Asian region. The rising flow of duty-free edible oils is disrupting trade in India, the world’s biggest importer of the oils, and is undermining efforts to raise local oilseed prices, the reason for imposing the taxes. Two palm oil traders confirmed that they have sold palm olein from Bangladesh to India as a duty-free product under the SAFTA. Another Malaysia-based palm trader said shipments of palm-based speciality products like cocoa butter substitute and palm-based ghee from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to India have increased. “Earlier volumes were less but after the recent duty increase, volumes too have increased,” the trader said. “It’s surprising to see now that bulk volumes are coming in,” he said, referring to Indian imports from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. All three traders declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. India raised its import tax on refined palm oil in March to 54 percent to support local farmers. In June, taxes on crude and refined soyoil, sunflower oil and canola oil were raised to 45 percent. Exports of palm oil to Bangladesh from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer after Indonesia, climbed from 3,500 tonnes in May to 36,995 tonnes during July 1 to 25, according to data from surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance. The Malaysian-based trader also estimated that Indonesia’s palm oil exports to Bangladesh in July increased by one-third. Traders had been bringing in edible oils from Bangladesh into neighbouring northeastern India, but now vessels have been booked for western ports, where large refineries are located, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer. Bangladesh is forecast to fulfil 91 percent of its edible oil consumption, including soybean oil and palm oil, during the 2018/19 crop year through imports, Reuters calculated using data from a U.S. Department of Agriculture report, which notes “there is no domestic palm oil production industry in the country.” India’s Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA), an edible oil trade group, and the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) have requested the federal government halt the duty-free imports. The gap between the local soyoil price and duty-free soyoil price is as high as 11,000 rupees ($160.80) per tonne, said Davish Jain, the SOPA chairman. “Imports of large quantities of edible oil at zero duty will totally negate the advantage to the farmers and also affect the industry adversely,” Jain said. The Executive Director of the SEA, B.V. Mehta, noted that a trader imported 10,000 tonnes of refined soybean oil from Bangladesh on the tanker Bertina. There have been at least four ships that potentially carried palm oil from ports in Indonesia and Malaysia to Bangladesh in the past 14 days, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon.

2018-08-06,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: U.S.-China trade balance: tmsnrt.rs/2M0lXyW By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 6 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump claims that his tariffs on trade are “working big time”, but this ignores signs that the best hope the United States had for boosting exports to China is being crushed as Beijing clamps down on energy imports. One of Trump’s stated aims in launching tariffs against Chinese imports was to lower the trade deficit between the United States and China, which is in the region of $375 billion a year. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of annual trade with China, with $16 billion more due to be implemented in coming days. China has matched the $34 billion and proposed charges on $60 billion more. In a potentially massive escalation, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on over $500 billion of Chinese goods - virtually all of China’s annual exports to the United States. “Tariffs are working big time,” Trump said in a tweet on Sunday. “Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come, tax them.” The latest Chinese response included proposed tariffs on liquefied natural gas (LNG). The fuel now joins crude oil, certain refined products and coal on the list of U.S. imports that may be slapped with duties of up to 25 percent. In some ways, the addition of LNG to the list is symbolic. It’s already clear that Chinese companies have dramatically scaled back their purchases of U.S. energy products. China imported about 313,000 barrels per day of U.S. crude in the first six months of 2018, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. At about $70 a barrel, this was worth just below $4 billion, giving a potential annual trade of around $8 billion. That may sound like small change in the overall context of U.S. trade with China. But crude oil represented one of the few areas where China could have realistically increased its purchases from the United States. China was also the biggest market for U.S. crude producers, representing about 16 percent of total exports, while for China, U.S. imports were a measly 3.5 percent of the total. It’s likely that U.S. crude exporters will be able to find other buyers, but they may have to offer discounts or other incentives to build market share. While U.S. crude exports to China appear to have held up in August, with about 342,000 bpd expected to arrive, they seem set for a slump in September. So far, about 203,000 bpd have been booked for arrival next month, according to vessel-tracking data, and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing, given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the Gulf of Mexico to China’s east coast. Unipec, the trading arm of China’s largest refiner Sinopec, has suspended crude imports from the United States, Reuters reported on Aug. 3, citing three sources familiar with the situation. It is not clear how long the temporary halt will last, but one of the sources said Unipec has no new bookings of U.S. crude until at least October. LNG was another product where the United States had real potential to boost exports to China, something Trump touted before launching his trade war. China has overtaken South Korea to become the world’s number two importer of the super-chilled fuel behind Japan. Rapid growth is likely to continue as Beijing continues to implement anti-pollution measures largely aimed at reducing the burning of coal. China’s imports of U.S. LNG were about 1.9 million tonnes in the first seven months of year, according to vessel-tracking data, representing just 6.9 percent of total purchases of 27.6 million tonnes. August’s imports are likely to be around 150,000 tonnes, with two vessels heading from the United States to China, roughly matching the two cargoes offloaded in both June and May, but well below this year’s peak of seven, in January. No cargoes at all have yet been booked for September, raising the possibility that China’s imports of U.S. LNG will drop to zero, even though any tariff action still has to be implemented. Similar to crude oil and LNG, coal was another area where Trump could have made a difference to U.S. exports to China. China isn’t a major buyer of U.S. coal, importing mainly high-grade coking coal used in steel-making. However, with the price of Australian thermal coal reaching 6-1/2 year highs, above $120 a tonne, U.S. exports of this type of fuel used in power stations would have been competitive. Instead, U.S. coal exports to China appear to be trending lower, with about 336,000 tonnes booked for arrival on four vessels in August - down from the peak this year of 505,300 tonnes on seven ships in April, and also below the average of 365,000 tonnes for the first seven months of the year. As yet, no cargoes for September delivery have been booked, although this may change since some coal is exported from Long Beach in California, meaning it has a shorter journey time of around three weeks to reach China. Overall, what the vessel-tracking data is showing is that Chinese imports of U.S. energy are heading lower, even ahead of potential tariffs.

Chinese state media launched an unusually personal attack against U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies on Monday, saying his trade “extortion” would not work. The reports sought to reassure investors about Chinese economic strength as the dispute continues to rattle financial markets and raises worries about the impact on the real economy. European shares initially followed their Asian counterparts down - pushed lower by weak European bank earnings and trade war fears - but a bounce in oil prices, a weaker euro and reports U.S. Senator Rand Paul had invited Russian senators to Washington for talks reversed the slide. The pan-European share index rose 0.22 percent while Germany’s DAX gained 0.64 percent and France’s CAC 40 0.23 percent. The autos sector, which has been a proxy for investors’ worries over higher tariffs, led the gains. The rise in German shares came despite the biggest plunge in German industrial orders in nearly 18 months. European companies including Glencore, Lufthansa, UniCredit, Adidas and Commerzbank report this week. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, edged down 0.08 percent, with more than 1 percent drops in the main Chinese indexes. Despite the better mood in European trading hours, the trade conflict between the U.S. and China remains a live and dominant theme for markets. “In his latest Twitter tirades and his latest appearances in front of his supporters the U.S. president has indicated something akin to a ‘strategy’ behind his trade war policy,” Commerzbank said. “The trade war will remain in place regardless of how much the Chinese cave in.” China proposed tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday and a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks to resolve the row. Trump has said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is “working far better than anyone ever anticipated”, citing losses in China’s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could “go up dramatically” once trade deals were renegotiated. Worries about trade were evident in currency markets, with the dollar edging towards a one-year high. The dollar index, which benefits as investors rush to safety, rose 0.3 percent to 95.425, a 2-1/2 week high. The People’s Bank of China’s intervention last week to impose a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward contracts had the desired impact of halting the slide in the yuan - in offshore markets, it fell 0.1 percent to 6.8574 , well away from the 6.91 weak point plumbed last week. The yuan has been one of the main casualties from the trade conflict, with investors speculating that the PBOC was happy for the renminbi to weaken to counter the impact of tariffs. Traders saw Friday’s move as an attempt by Chinese authorities to show they wanted stability, or possibly conciliation. Others said the intervention would not prevent further yuan weakness with Washington and Beijing still at loggerheads. U.S. jobs data on Friday, while weaker than expected, underlined that the world’s largest economy is growing robustly, supporting the synchronized global growth that had underpinned investor sentiment before the eruption of the trade dispute. Markets are increasingly nervous about whether U.S. growth may have peaked, with trade concerns exacerbating those fears. The euro slipped 0.3 percent to $1.1530, a five-week low, while the stronger dollar sent the Swiss franc down half a percent. “The trade war concerns are supporting the dollar and there is a bit of a risk-off tone in the markets,” said Manuel Oliveri, a currency strategist at Credit Agricole. The British pound hit 11-month lows after the UK trade minister warned Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. Oil prices were helped by an unexpected decline in Saudi crude production. Brent crude futures rose more than 1 percent to $74.01, while U.S. crude oil futures gained 1.45 percent to $69.48 a barrel. Gold weakened on the back of a firmer dollar and was last down 0.3 percent at $1,209.75.

2018-08-06,"ANKARA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his allies in the Middle East have become isolated by their hostile policies towards Tehran, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Monday, state TV reported. “Today, Trump, (Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad) Bin Salman and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu have become the symbol of mistrust in the world,” Zarif was quoted as saying. “Their oppressive policies and violent measures have made them isolated... The world has distanced itself from their hostile policies against Iran.” A first round of U.S. sanctions against Iran, lifted under the 2015 international deal over its nuclear programme, are due to be reinstated on Tuesday. They will cover Iran’s purchases of dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its automotive sector. Under the deal between Tehran and world powers, most international sanctions imposed on Iran were lifted in 2016 in return for Tehran curbing its nuclear programme.  Saying the deal had failed to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme, its nuclear activities beyond 2025 and its role in regional wars, Trump withdrew from it in May in a move that Israel - which Iran refuses to recognise - and Saudi Arabia welcomed. Israel supported the imminent resumption of U.S. sanctions. They “will compel the Iranians to decide between meeting the demands of the United States ... or risking the regime’s collapse and fall. The first option is good, the second excellent,” Israeli Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said on Twitter. Shi’ite Iran has also been at loggerheads for decades with Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia, fighting a long-running proxy war in the Middle East and beyond that has influenced conflicts in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. “These three countries want to create psychological tension against Iran ... We will overcome this period of hardship,” Zarif said.    Despite efforts by Russia, China and Europe to salvage the deal, the Trump administration is pushing countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November, when the United States reimposes sanctions Iran’s oil and shipping industries.  Fear of sanctions and economic hardship have led to sporadic protests in several cities in Iran in the past days, with ordinary Iranians chanting slogans against Iranian leaders.

2018-08-06,"BADSWAT, Pakistan, Aug 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When a glacial lake burst in Pakistan’s northern Gilgit-Baltistan province in July, Sher Baz watched helplessly as the waters swept away his family home. Residents of Badswat village, which lies in Ishkoman valley at the foot of the Hindu Kush mountain range’s snow-capped peaks, were at the mercy of the flash flood that carried off homes, roads and bridges, as well as crops and forest. “Thank God we are alive, but everything we owned was washed away by the floods when the glacial lake burst,” said Baz, a 30-year old father of four. Although there are several glaciers near Badswat village, residents said this was the first glacial outburst in living memory. The authorities said the timely evacuation of villagers meant nobody had died. Baz said the event had left him feeling stranded. “Surrounded by mountains and muddy water, it seems we are living between life and death,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Pakistan has more glaciers than any other country outside the polar region – more than 7,200 in the Karakoram, Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). They feed the Indus River system, the country’s water lifeline. But data gathered over the last 50 years shows that all but about 120 of the glaciers exhibit signs of melting, due to rising temperatures, meteorological officials said. As the glaciers retreat, they leave behind lakes supported by ice dams or accumulations of rock and soil. Inherently unstable, these dams often burst, sending huge volumes of water rushing into the villages below them. “With glaciers melting faster than before, we feel more vulnerable and it seems like we are under constant threat of a natural disaster,” said another villager Shakoor Baig. While he is used to coping with floods, the 45-year-old farmer said he had not seen anything on this scale. Baig, who lost his home, crops and fields, joined nearly 1,000 residents in Badswat village who were evacuated to higher ground, where some are living in temporary shelters. Trapped between mountains, receding waters and damaged roads, providing residents with enough food and tents has been difficult, said local relief group the Aga Khan Agency for Habitat, which worked with the Pakistani army to air-drop aid. Such events are just the start, said glacier expert and PMD head Ghulam Rasul. “The disasters caused by glacier outbursts in these areas will not stop here. They will continue in the future because there are so many glaciers at risk of bursting,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Years of deforestation, combined with climate change, have led to a spike in temperatures in the region, which has caused glaciers to melt, Rasul said. Over the past 80 years, he said, the average temperature in Gilgit-Baltistan has increased by 1.4 degree Celsius (2.5F) compared to a rise of 0.6 degree Celsius (1F) in the lower-lying regions of Sindh, Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. Poor government management of forests and increased demand for timber have seen trees cut down, he said - even though conserving forests is essential in order to absorb carbon emissions and fight climate change. “Global warming has direct implications on mountainous areas in northern Pakistan because of forest loss. Deforestation happened due to the negligence of authorities since people would cut trees for construction and fuel,” Rasul said. “The essential thing to do is to grow more forests to mitigate the effects of global warming on glaciers in future.” Local authorities said rejuvenating the forest is a priority, but replenishing the area would take time. “The provincial government has already launched a campaign to grow the forest, among other solutions, to offset the rapid increase in temperatures in these mountains,” local government spokesman, Faizullah Faraq, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. With help from the U.N. International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), Faraq said, the authorities were also developing infrastructure in nearby areas in case residents of vulnerable villages were forced to relocate. “This is a big challenge and not a matter to resolve overnight, but we are moving in that direction,” he said. Rasul said the PMD had installed early warning systems in three areas to notify vulnerable communities of any glacial threats, adding that more were needed so to provide sufficient advance warning ahead of the next event. And, he said, the PMD recommends that communities be better trained in coping with emergency situations. Meantime all that villager Baz can do, he said, was pray that his family would survive another day. ""I worry about the future and how to feed my family, since I lost my land and my job ended too. I pray that God will save us from more natural disasters,"" he said. (Reporting by Peer Muhammad. Editing by Lin Taylor and Robert Carmichael.

2018-08-06,"* Chinese state media lambastes Trump trade policies * European shares mostly lower; follow Asian weakness * Yuan stable after PBOC move last week * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - European shares struggled on Monday as fears of the escalating U.S.-China trade conflict outweighed the boost to sentiment from Chinese authorities’ intervention last week to shore up its currency. Disappointing corporate earnings in the European banking sector added to the cautious start to the week’s trading. Chinese state media launched an unusually personal attack against U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade policies on Monday, saying Trump’s trade “extortion” would not work. It also sought to reassure investors about Chinese economic strength as the months-long dispute rattles financial markets and raises deepening worries about the impact on the real economy. After an initial rise, Asian shares earlier succumbed to selling pressure, with Chinese shares sliding into negative territory. European shares were also mixed. The pan-European share index dropped 0.06 percent while Germany’s DAX fell 0.34 percent and France’s CAC 40 was virtually flat, down 0.02 percent. The biggest plunge in German industrial orders in nearly 18-months added to pressure on German stocks. The weakness in European shares followed a more than 1 percent drop in the Chinese blue-chip index and Shanghai’s SSE Composite. Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s Kospi index also dropped. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries edged down 0.08 percent. “In his latest Twitter tirades and his latest appearances in front of his supporters the U.S. president has indicated something akin to a “strategy” behind his trade war policy,” Commerzbank said. “The trade war will remain in place regardless of how much the Chinese cave in.” The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. At the same time, Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is “working far better than anyone ever anticipated”, citing losses in China’s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could “go up dramatically” once trade deals were renegotiated. The People’s Bank of China’s intervention last week to impose a reserve requirement on foreign exchange forward contracts had the desired impact of halting the slide in the yuan. In offshore markets, the Chinese currency fell 0.1 percent against the dollar to 6.8562 on Monday, but was well away from the 6.91 weak point the yuan had plumbed last week. The yuan has been one of the main casualties from the trade conflict, with many investors speculating that the PBOC was happy for the renminbi to weaken to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs. Traders saw the PBOC effort as an attempt by Chinese authorities to show they wanted stability, and some interpreted it as a conciliatory move to nudge the Americans towards the negotiating table. Other said the intervention would not stop further yuan weakness with Washington and Beijing at loggerheads over tariffs. The dollar index, which has benefited as investors rush to safety, rose 0.2 percent to 95.291, close to a 2-1/2 week high. U.S. jobs data on Friday, although weaker than expected, underlined that the world’s largest economy is growing robustly, supporting synchronized global growth that had underpinned sentiment towards risk assets before the eruption of the trade dispute. Markets are increasingly nervous about whether U.S. growth may have peaked. “Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth,” said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia. The euro inched down to $1.155. The British pound slid towards a fresh 10-month low after the UK trade minister warned Britain was headed for a no-deal Brexit. Gold hovered near 17-month lows and was last at $1,211.89. GOL/ Brent crude futures rose 0.5 percent to $73.55, while U.S. crude oil futures added 0.7 percent to $68.94 a barrel.

Spreadbetters pointed to a tentative start for European shares with futures for London’s FTSE up 0.07 percent. E-Minis for the S&P 500 were up 0.08 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.3 percent, after having risen about 1 percent earlier in the day.

At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is “working far better than anyone ever anticipated”, citing losses in China’s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could “go up dramatically” once trade deals were renegotiated. “The drip feed of escalating tariff threats from Trump and counter threats from China continues,” said Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital. “With a 25 percent tariff on...(some) Chinese imports likely to commence soon, Trump is clearly ramping up the pressure on China but China is digging in,” Oliver added. “A tariff of this magnitude will start to have a significant economic impact on China’s growth, potentially knocking up to 0.5 percent off growth, and probably also on the U.S.” At the same time, China is stepping up measures to support its currency, which has been hit by the worsening trade skirmish. Late on Friday, the People’s Bank of China raised the reserve requirement on some foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency and helping pull the yuan away from 14-month lows. The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7386. “Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.” Wall Street indices gained on Friday, helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. While the risk of a trade war was the main worry for investors, other factors were weighing on sentiment too. “Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth,” said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia.

Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound hovered near 11-day lows at $1.287 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an “uncomfortably high” risk of a “no deal” Brexit.

2018-08-06,"BERLIN (Reuters) - For decades, the Friendship pipeline has delivered oil from Russia to Europe, heating German homes even in the darkest days of the Cold War. But a new pipeline that will carry gas direct from Russia under the Baltic Sea to Germany is doing rather less for friendship, driving a wedge between Germany and its allies and giving Chancellor Angela Merkel a headache. For U.S. President Donald Trump, Nord Stream 2 is a “horrific” pipeline that will increase Germany’s dependence on Russian energy. Ukraine, fighting Russian-backed separatists, fears the new pipeline will allow Moscow to cut it out of the lucrative and strategically crucial gas transit business. It comes at an awkward time for Merkel. With the fraying of the transatlantic alliance and an assertive Russia and China, she has acknowledged that Germany must take more of a political leadership role in Europe. “The global order is under pressure,” Merkel said last month. “That’s a challenge for us ... Germany’s responsibility is growing; Germany has more work to do.” In April she accepted for the first time that there were “political considerations” to Nord Stream 2, a project she had until then described as a commercial venture. Most European countries want Germany to do more to project European influence and protect eastern neighbors that are nervous of Russian encroachment. But letting Russia sell gas to Germany while avoiding Ukraine does the opposite, depriving Kiev of transit revenues and making it, Poland and the Baltic states more vulnerable to cuts in gas supplies. “The price would be an even greater loss of trust from the Baltics, Poland and Ukraine,” said Roderich Kiesewetter, a Merkel ally on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. “We Germans always say that holding the West together is our ‘center of gravity’, but the Russian approach has succeeded in dragging Germany, at least in terms of energy policy, out of this western solidarity.” Many analysts say the business case for Nord Stream 2 is thin. Another pipeline already links Russia and Germany under the Baltic. Nord Stream 2 will double capacity but future demand is uncertain. On the flip side, German industry likes anything that will provide energy more cheaply. Merkel’s Social Democrat coalition partners, the leading voices in Germany calling for a conciliatory approach towards Russia, are also in favor. The issue has divided Berlin’s political class. The parties agreed in their coalition talks earlier this year to make a commitment to the pipeline, but did not put it in writing. According to Margarita Assenova, an analyst at the Centre for European Policy Analysis who is critical of Nord Stream 2, Russia can double gas exports to Europe via existing Ukrainian pipelines without building the new conduit. But despite opposition from European partners, from Washington and from within Merkel’s party, Nord Stream 2 continues. Germany’s diplomatic ambitions are being thwarted by the project’s brutal business logic.     On the other hand, it has the strong backing of Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy giant which owns Nord Stream 2 AG, the project company. Its boss Matthias Warnig, once an East German spy tasked with reporting on West German business, is seen as one of Berlin’s most formidable lobbyists. The pipeline is one of a network of Kremlin-sponsored projects seemingly designed to circumvent Ukraine, the largest and most troublesome of the countries once ruled from Moscow. They include Turk Stream, which crosses the Black Sea to bypass Ukraine to the south. Lawmakers say Warnig has responded to their skeptical queries about the project by promising to take their concerns direct to Russian President Vladimir Putin, adding to the sense that the pipeline serves the Kremlin’s strategic interests. But, for Gazprom, it makes sense: transit across a country with which Russia is in an undeclared war is risky and increasingly unreliable as Ukraine’s Soviet-era pipelines grow older. Germany and the European Union are attempting to broker an agreement between Moscow and Kiev to keep the gas flowing across Ukraine when the current transit contract ends in 2019. Critics say this means European consumers will pay a subsidy to help keep Ukraine afloat. In the SPD, sympathy for Nord Stream 2 runs deep. Gerhard Schroeder, the party’s last chancellor, was appointed to senior positions at Russian energy companies after leaving office and regards Putin as a close friend. For many of Schroeder’s generation, cooperation with Russia is in the tradition of the “Ostpolitik” of their hero, 1970s Chancellor Willy Brandt, who defied a skeptical Washington to reach out to the Soviet Bloc, now seen as a prelude towards ending the Cold War. But a younger generation in the party, often critical of Schroeder’s links to the Kremlin, is more cautious. Germany is bound to Russia by decades of cooperation on energy supply, but it has to offer something to its western allies too, officials say. That cooperation goes a long way: last week, Merkel hosted Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin. He was accompanied by Russian general staff chief Valery Gerasimov, who has been banned from the EU since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Keeping lines open to the Kremlin is popular in Germany, where polls show people are better-disposed towards Russia than in almost any country. Increasingly, though, officials wonder if Germany is not paying too high a price in lost face.

2018-08-06,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump claims that his tariffs on trade are “working big time”, but this ignores signs that the best hope the United States had for boosting exports to China is being crushed as Beijing clamps down on energy imports. One of Trump’s stated aims in launching tariffs against Chinese imports was to lower the trade deficit between the United States and China, which is in the region of $375 billion a year. The Trump administration has imposed tariffs on $34 billion of annual trade with China, with $16 billion more due to be implemented in coming days. China has matched the $34 billion and proposed charges on $60 billion more. In a potentially massive escalation, Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on over $500 billion of Chinese goods - virtually all of China’s annual exports to the United States. (Graphic: U.S.-China trade balance: tmsnrt.rs/2M0lXyW) “Tariffs are working big time,” Trump said in a tweet on Sunday. “Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come, tax them.” The latest Chinese response included proposed tariffs on liquefied natural gas (LNG). The fuel now joins crude oil, certain refined products and coal on the list of U.S. imports that may be slapped with duties of up to 25 percent. In some ways, the addition of LNG to the list is symbolic. It’s already clear that Chinese companies have dramatically scaled back their purchases of U.S. energy products. China imported about 313,000 barrels per day of U.S. crude in the first six months of 2018, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. At about $70 a barrel, this was worth just below $4 billion, giving a potential annual trade of around $8 billion. That may sound like small change in the overall context of U.S. trade with China. But crude oil represented one of the few areas where China could have realistically increased its purchases from the United States. China was also the biggest market for U.S. crude producers, representing about 16 percent of total exports, while for China, U.S. imports were a measly 3.5 percent of the total. It’s likely that U.S. crude exporters will be able to find other buyers, but they may have to offer discounts or other incentives to build market share. While U.S. crude exports to China appear to have held up in August, with about 342,000 bpd expected to arrive, they seem set for a slump in September. So far, about 203,000 bpd have been booked for arrival next month, according to vessel-tracking data, and the window for more cargoes to be added is closing, given it takes at least three weeks for a tanker to make the journey from the Gulf of Mexico to China’s east coast. Unipec, the trading arm of China’s largest refiner Sinopec, has suspended crude imports from the United States, Reuters reported on Aug. 3, citing three sources familiar with the situation.  It is not clear how long the temporary halt will last, but one of the sources said Unipec has no new bookings of U.S. crude until at least October. LNG was another product where the United States had real potential to boost exports to China, something Trump touted before launching his trade war. China has overtaken South Korea to become the world’s number two importer of the super-chilled fuel behind Japan. Rapid growth is likely to continue as Beijing continues to implement anti-pollution measures largely aimed at reducing the burning of coal. China’s imports of U.S. LNG were about 1.9 million tonnes in the first seven months of year, according to vessel-tracking data, representing just 6.9 percent of total purchases of 27.6 million tonnes. August’s imports are likely to be around 150,000 tonnes, with two vessels heading from the United States to China, roughly matching the two cargoes offloaded in both June and May, but well below this year’s peak of seven, in January. No cargoes at all have yet been booked for September, raising the possibility that China’s imports of U.S. LNG will drop to zero, even though any tariff action still has to be implemented. Similar to crude oil and LNG, coal was another area where Trump could have made a difference to U.S. exports to China. China isn’t a major buyer of U.S. coal, importing mainly high-grade coking coal used in steel-making. However, with the price of Australian thermal coal reaching 6-1/2 year highs, above $120 a tonne, U.S. exports of this type of fuel used in power stations would have been competitive. Instead, U.S. coal exports to China appear to be trending lower, with about 336,000 tonnes booked for arrival on four vessels in August - down from the peak this year of 505,300 tonnes on seven ships in April, and also below the average of 365,000 tonnes for the first seven months of the year. As yet, no cargoes for September delivery have been booked, although this may change since some coal is exported from Long Beach in California, meaning it has a shorter journey time of around three weeks to reach China. Overall, what the vessel-tracking data is showing is that Chinese imports of U.S. energy are heading lower, even ahead of potential tariffs.

2018-08-06,"GYANJA, Azerbaijan (Reuters) - An assassination attempt and protest in Azerbaijan’s second city have sent a warning to the ruling elite that discontent is simmering in the tightly controlled, oil-producing state. Police have arrested a local man over the attack in which Elmar Veliyev, mayor of the northwestern city of Gyanja, was shot and wounded in front of his office on July 3.  Interior Ministry officials say the suspect, Yunis Safarov, has ties to a militant group that wants to establish Islamist rule in Azerbaijan, a secular state where most people are Shi’ite Muslims, and that he trained with militants in Syria. They have cited no sources for the information. But some Gyanja residents challenge the ministry’s version of events. They suggest Safarov was motivated by revenge for what they see as Veliyev’s mistreatment of Gyanja residents and disrespect for their religious views. In a rare outbreak of violence against officialdom in the South Caucasus nation, two police officers were stabbed to death in clashes when a protest over Safarov’s arrest and unofficial reports that he was beaten in custody turned violent on July 10. A third, Samir Bayramov, was wounded. Azerbaijan, a majority Muslim country of about 10 million, has grown wealthy from oil and natural gas since it declared  independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Protests are rare and are put down quickly. But while money has flowed into sprucing up Baku, opponents of President Ilham Aliyev say few have seen major benefits from the oil wealth, especially people outside the capital, and accuse his government of suppressing human rights and stifling democracy. Drawing parallels with Aliyev, they accuse Veliyev, 57, of treating Gyanja like a personal fief, showing no regard for the city’s poor and being high-handed with anyone who stands in his way.  “Veliyev has been behaving exactly the same way as Aliyev does,” Jakhangir Amirkhanly, a 74-year-old member of the opposition Musavat Party, told Reuters in Gyanja. The unrest was brief and there is no sign of it spreading. Aliyev, who succeeded his father Heydar Aliyev as president in 2003, brooks little dissent and the opposition is weak.   The municipal authorities in Gyanja said in an emailed response to Reuters’ questions that criticism of Veliyev was “groundless and biased.” But the events in the city show that, with the economy heavily dependent on the energy sector and the wealth gap now huge, Azerbaijan’s leaders could face a growing challenge to retain power in the long term if oil prices fall.  Deeply entrenched elites and long-term rulers in other countries in the region are watching closely — Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan all have economies that are reliant on energy and leaders who are nervous about any signs of unrest. Europe is also watching. Because of its energy reserves and strategic location along the Caspian Sea, Azerbaijan is seen by Europe as an important alternative to Russian energy supplies, and BP is a major investor in the country. Aliyev has shown his concern by taking charge of the investigation into the events in Gyanja, which he has described as acts of terrorism and crimes against Azeri statehood aimed at intimidating society.  The authorities also showed their nervousness by trying to stop news of the protest spreading, city residents said. For two days afterwards, mobile telephone data services were turned off in Gyanja, making it hard to access social media, they said.       Some had used Facebook to circulate information about the events and the prosecutor’s office has opened criminal cases against the editors of four independent Azeri websites that re-posted their entries.  Gyanja, a city of 330,000, has been administered for seven years by Veliyev, a member of the ruling party who was appointed by Aliyev. Police say four people accused of links to radical religious organisations were killed in sting operations after the assassination attempt and protest. In addition, 61 have been arrested and charged, and 13 others are wanted by police. But of 11 Gyanja residents who agreed to speak to Reuters about the events, eight doubted the assassination attempt had any link to militant Islamists and said they believed Veliyev, who is a Muslim, was attacked because he was unpopular. None wanted to be identified for fear of reprisals except Amirkhanly, though Azeri officials deny Western charges of repressing and intimidating opponents. “We were shocked that someone dared to take a gun and shoot  the mayor,” a pensioner said in a Gyanja park, lowering her voice and looking round to make sure no one was eavesdropping. “But honestly, no one was particularly worried because Veliyev did a lot of bad things in our city ... The rich became richer and the poor became beggars,” she said.  The city administration in Gyanja defended Veliyev’s record in office in response to Reuters’ questions. “The attack ... is just a terrorist act. It’s not connected to any particular motives, revenge or response to the supposed ‘social tyranny’ by Veliyev,” it said. “Large-scale construction work has been carried out in the city. The authorities have had meetings with city residents, listened to their complaints and dealt with them effectively.” Pot-holed roads and some old buildings have been repaired in Gyanja, shopping malls have been built and a four-star Ramada Plaza hotel has been erected. The city centre is dominated by a vast park named after Heydar Aliyev, who was president from 1993 until 2003. But Amirkhanly said: “Unemployment is very high and the majority of young residents of Gyanja emigrate to Russia or Turkey.”  An 84-year-old pensioner who declined to be named said he had been tricked by the city authorities into leaving his flat in a run-down building while it was repaired. The authorities reneged on a promise to pay for his and others’ temporary accommodation and are now trying to persuade them to cede ownership of the flats to a construction firm that wants to demolish them and build on the site, he said. The pensioner said he had managed to meet Veliyev to petition him over the property, but the mayor “was very rude”. The mayor’s office did not respond directly to the pensioner’s remarks but said it had “no evidence of Elmar Veliyev having an unlawful attitude towards citizens”. Aliyev’s supporters say he has brought stability to Azerbaijan, modernised the country and forged closer ties with Europe since succeeding his father in 2003.  He won a fourth successive term in April with more than 85 percent of votes but the election was boycotted by the main opposition and its legitimacy was questioned by independent observers. Signs of public anger have flared in recent years. Protests in Baku in 2011, by crowds demanding Aliyev and his government quit, ended after a security crackdown and mass arrests.  In 2016, protests broke out in at least three cities — Quba, Siyazan and Shabran — over rising bread prices and a sharp devaluation of the manat currency as oil prices fell. Police responded with widespread arrests, residents said.  The unrest in Gyanja has also been contained. “There is no organised opposition political force in the country that can compete with the ruling elite,” said Ilgar Velizade, an independent political analyst. “But the authorities should draw some lessons from the recent events and reconsider their personnel policies, pay more attention to social problems and communicate more with people.” A $38-billion sovereign wealth fund has been set up to ease  the pain of any economic downturn. Foreign donors have also urged Baku to diversify the economy to make it less dependent on oil and gas, which make up about 75 percent of state revenues. There is little sign of it doing so, with the government expecting 2 percent growth this year after only 0.1 percent in  2017 and a 3.8 percent contraction in 2016.  The status quo may suit the West as stability helps it “implement global energy projects in the region,” Velizade said. The European Union’s efforts to reduce reliance on Russian gas depend partly on developing the so-called Southern Gas Corridor, which is expected by 2020 to bring about 16 billion cubic metres of gas a year to Europe via Georgia and Turkey from Azerbaijan’s Shah Deniz field.

2018-08-06,"* MSCI ex-Japan rises for a second straight day, Nikkei up 0.4 pct * PBOC move helps support Chinese assets, Australian dollar * Investors still jittery over Sino-U.S. trade spat * Gold off 17-month lows on weaker U.S. dollar By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Stocks across Asia advanced on Monday as China’s efforts to stop sharp declines in its currency and capital flight supported wider sentiment in the region, although the escalating Sino-U.S. trade conflict has capped gains. Late on Friday, the People’s Bank of China raised the reserve requirement on some foreign exchange forward positions, making it more expensive to bet against the Chinese currency and helping pull the yuan away from 14-month lows. The move boosted the Australian dollar, which is often played as a liquid proxy for the yuan. The Aussie came off two-week lows to climb as high as $0.7412 after the announcement, and was last at $0.7403. “Leaning against bearish CNY sentiment is important because a rapidly weakening currency risks triggering residential outflows and destabilising domestic asset prices,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. “Our economists think that PBOC likely will take further action if CNY depreciation continues or capital outflow pressure increases.” On Monday, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan leapt 0.9 percent - the biggest jump in a month and its second straight session of gains. Japan’s Nikkei edged up 0.4 percent, while Australian shares added 0.75 percent. Chinese shares were positive too, with the blue-chip share index up 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index gained 1.3 percent. On Friday, the Dow climbed 0.54 percent, the S&P 500 gained 0.46 percent and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12 percent. They were helped by strong corporate earnings, although gains were capped by worries over the escalating trade tensions. The trade dispute remains a live issue for markets with China proposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of U.S. goods on Friday, while a senior Chinese diplomat cast doubt on prospects of talks with Washington to resolve the bitter trade conflict. That was followed by a report in China’s state media saying Friday’s retaliatory tariffs were “rational” while accusing the United States of blackmail. At the same time, U.S. President Donald Trump said his strategy of placing steep tariffs on Chinese imports is “working far better than anyone ever anticipated”, citing losses in China’s stock market. He predicted the U.S. market could “go up dramatically” once trade deals were renegotiated. According to Bespoke Investment Group, mentions of tariffs in S&P 500 company earnings reports for the second quarter have more than doubled from the first quarter of this year. Other factors too are weighing over investor sentiment. “While the possibility of a trade war is still top of mind for investors, it isn’t the only cause for concern,” said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia. “Investors are also closely watching the rising value of the U.S. dollar, slowing global economic growth and the risk of the Federal Reserve tightening short-term interest rates too quickly and dampening domestic economic growth.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has risen 3.4 percent so far this year with strong rallies since April when Trump first announced the tariffs. The index was last up 0.1 percent at 95.26. Traders see further upside in the dollar as they maintained a significantly large long position on the currency, while net short bets on the Aussie were their largest since November 2015. The British pound held at $1.30 after falling to an 11-day low of $1.2975 following remarks by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney that Britain faced an “uncomfortably high” risk of a “no deal” Brexit. The euro inched down to more than 5-week lows of $1.1573. Gold bounced from near 17-month lows after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data, and was last up 0.3 percent at $1,216.45. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures rose 41 cents to $73.62, while U.S. crude oil futures added 34 cents to $68.82 a barrel. Reporting by Swati Pandey

2018-08-06,"ABOARD A U.S. GOVERNMENT AIRCRAFT (Reuters) - The United States intends to fully enforce sanctions due to be reimposed against Iran early this week on orders from U.S. President Donald Trump, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday. Washington’s so-called “snapback” sanctions are due to be reinstated against Tehran at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Tuesday, a U.S. Treasury official said, speaking on condition anonymity. Pompeo, speaking with reporters returning with him from an Asian trip, said the White House would detail implementation of the measures on Monday morning. “It’s an important part of our efforts to push back against Iranian malign activity,” he said. “The United States is going to enforce these sanctions.” Despite opposition from European allies, Trump in May pulled the United States out of a 2015 deal between world powers and Tehran under which international sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. Trump had denounced the deal reached under his White House predecessor, Barack Obama, as one-sided in Iran’s favour. Starting this week, Washington will reimpose sanctions on Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. The United States has told other countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil starting in early November or face U.S. financial measures. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said last week that Trump’s repudiation of the deal was illegal and Iran would not yield to Washington’s renewed campaign to strangle Iran’s vital oil exports. Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday, in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency, which has lost half its value since April due to fears about the return of U.S. sanctions. Referring to recent sporadic protests in Iranian cities, Pompeo said: “The Iranian people are not happy - not with the Americans but with their own leadership. They’re unhappy with the failure of their own leadership to deliver the economic promises that their leadership promised them.”  Pompeo said the United States wants “the Iranian people to have a strong voice of who their leadership will be,” although he stopped short of calling for regime change in Tehran. He later said in a message on Twitter that the United States was “deeply concerned about reports of Iranian regime’s violence against unarmed citizens” and urged respect for human rights. Protests broke out on Sunday for a sixth night in Iranian cities, including Kazeroon in the south, according to social media. Authorities reported the first fatality among protesters, with the shooting of a man in Karaj, west of Tehran. But they denied security forces were involved, Iranian news agencies reported The protests have often begun with slogans against the high cost of living and alleged financial corruption but quickly turned into anti-government rallies. Pompeo said it would require “enormous change” by Iran to get out from under renewed U.S. sanctions. “They have got to behave like a normal country,” he said, describing Iranian leaders as “bad actors.” He alluded to Trump’s suggestion last week of the potential for future negotiations with Tehran, a notion that senior Iranian officials quickly rejected. “We are happy to talk if there’s an arrangement that is appropriate, that could lead to a good outcome,” he said. “Perhaps that will be the path the Iranians choose to move down with. There’s no evidence to date of their desire to change to change their behaviour.” Reporting By David Brunnstrom; additional reporting by Lesley Wrougton in Washington; Writing by Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Bill Trott",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-sanctions/update-1-white-house-to-detail-implementation-of-new-iran-sanctions-monday-pompeo-idUKL1N1UX003,06 Aug 2018,"The

2018-08-06,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran will ease foreign exchange rules, state TV reported on Sunday, in a bid to halt a collapse of the rial currency that has lost half its value since April due to fears about U.S. sanctions likely to be imposed this week. President Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of an agreement to lift sanctions in return for Iran curbing its nuclear program caused a run on the rial as companies and savers bought hard currency to protect themselves from the looming economic sanctions. The plunge in the currency and soaring inflation have sparked sporadic demonstrations against profiteering and corruption, with many protesters chanting anti-government slogans. The central bank has blamed “enemies” for the fall of the currency, and the judiciary said 29 people had been arrested on charges that carry the death penalty. On Sunday the judiciary said it had arrested a further seven people, including a former deputy central bank governor and five foreign exchange dealers. A state body led by President Hassan Rouhani and including the heads of the judiciary and parliament on Sunday partially lifted a ban on the sale of foreign currency at floating rates, allowing exchange bureaux to sell at unofficial market rates for purposes such as overseas travel.  That reverses the decision in April to ban trading currency outside the rate of about 42,000 rials to the dollar  Ahead of the announcement of the new measures, the rial gained slightly on the unofficial market, trading at 98,500 to the dollar, compared with 103,000 on Saturday, according to foreign exchange website Boncast.com. Central bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said the plan reflected Iran’s self-confidence in the face of the looming U.S. sanctions. “This shows our power. The same day you (Americans) impose sanctions we open our economy. We have no problems, so why should our people worry?,” Hemmati said in a live televised interview.  In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the White House would make an announcement on Monday detailing the reimposition of sanctions on Iran that Trump has ordered for this week. Hemmati said the central bank would allow a “managed float” of the rial’s exchange rate and try to avoid using up its reserves to support the currency. “The central bank will try not to interfere in setting the price of hard currencies, which will be determined by supply and demand, however, the bank’s supervision will prevent unbridled (market swings) and the creation of a black market,” Hemmati said. To encourage Iranians to return their hard cash to the economy, the plan allows the central bank to set up dollar savings accounts for ordinary people, state television said. Non-oil exporters will be allowed to sell hard currency to importers, and there will be no limit on bringing currency or gold into the country. It was not immediately clear whether the plan would create enough hard currency inflows to ease the demand for dollars and help end a panic-buying of hard currencies by many Iranians. Protests broke out on Sunday for a sixth night in cities including Kazeroon in the south, according to social media. Authorities reported the first fatality among protesters, with the shooting of a man in Karaj, west of Tehran. But they denied security forces were involved, Iranian news agencies reported.  Hard currency will be made available at a subsidized rate for purchases of basic goods and medicine, state television quoted a government statement about the plan as saying. In July, Iran opened a secondary foreign-exchange market for importers of non-essential goods that are not eligible to receive the preferential rate from the central bank. Starting this week, Washington will re-impose sanctions on Iran’s purchases of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals, and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software. The United States has told third countries they must halt imports of Iranian oil from early November or face U.S. financial measures.

2018-08-06,"SINGAPORE, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday as Saudi crude production took a surprising dip in July and American shale drilling seemed to plateau. Markets also anticipated an announcement from Washington due later on Monday detailing renewed U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran. Spot Brent crude oil futures were trading at $73.26 per barrel at 0101 GMT on Monday, up 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $68.61 barrel. U.S. energy companies last week cut oil rigs for a second time in the past three weeks as the rate of growth has slowed over the past couple of months. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Aug. 3, bringing the total count down to 859, Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. Many U.S. shale oil drillers posted disappointing quarterly results in recent weeks, hit by rising operating costs, hedging losses and a fall in crude prices away from 2018 highs reached between May and July. Outside the United States, top crude exporter Saudi Arabia pumped around 10.29 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July, two OPEC sources said on Friday, down about 200,000 bpd from a month earlier. That drop came despite a pledge by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader, in June to raise output from July, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost. Still, with Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia now all producing 10 million to 11 million bpd of crude, just three countries now meet around a third of global oil demand. Reuters technical commodity analyst Wang Tao said Brent “may test a support at $72.09 per barrel”, a break below which could cause further drops.

2018-08-06,"(Repeats story from Aug. 3 for wider readership with no change to text) By Rajendra Jadhav and Emily Chow MUMBAI/KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 3 (Reuters) - Edible oil traders are sourcing exports of palm oil and other cooking oils to India from neighbouring countries, designating the supplies as duty-free under a regional free-trade pact and circumventing India’s import tax hike on the oils. India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among the signatories of the South Asian Free Trade Agreement (SAFTA) that created a free-trade zone in the South Asian region. The rising flow of duty-free edible oils is disrupting trade in India, the world’s biggest importer of the oils, and is undermining efforts to raise local oilseed prices, the reason for imposing the taxes. Two palm oil traders confirmed that they have sold palm olein from Bangladesh to India as a duty-free product under the SAFTA. Another Malaysia-based palm trader said shipments of palm-based speciality products like cocoa butter substitute and palm-based ghee from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka to India have increased. “Earlier volumes were less but after the recent duty increase, volumes too have increased,” the trader said. “It’s surprising to see now that bulk volumes are coming in,” he said, referring to Indian imports from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. All three traders declined to be identified as they were not authorized to speak to the media. India raised its import tax on refined palm oil in March to 54 percent to support local farmers. In June, taxes on crude and refined soyoil, sunflower oil and canola oil were raised to 45 percent. Exports of palm oil to Bangladesh from Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer after Indonesia, climbed from 3,500 tonnes in May to 36,995 tonnes during July 1 to 25, according to data from surveyor Societe Generale de Surveillance. The Malaysian-based trader also estimated that Indonesia’s palm oil exports to Bangladesh in July increased by one-third. Traders had been bringing in edible oils from Bangladesh into neighbouring northeastern India, but now vessels have been booked for western ports, where large refineries are located, said Sandeep Bajoria, chief executive of the Sunvin Group, a Mumbai-based vegetable oil importer. Bangladesh is forecast to fulfil 91 percent of its edible oil consumption, including soybean oil and palm oil, during the 2018/19 crop year through imports, Reuters calculated using data from a U.S. Department of Agriculture report, which notes “there is no domestic palm oil production industry in the country.” India’s Solvent Extractors’ Association (SEA), an edible oil trade group, and the Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) have requested the federal government halt the duty-free imports. The gap between the local soyoil price and duty-free soyoil price is as high as 11,000 rupees ($160.80) per tonne, said Davish Jain, the SOPA chairman. “Imports of large quantities of edible oil at zero duty will totally negate the advantage to the farmers and also affect the industry adversely,” Jain said. The Executive Director of the SEA, B.V. Mehta, noted that a trader imported 10,000 tonnes of refined soybean oil from Bangladesh on the tanker Bertina. There have been at least four ships that potentially carried palm oil from ports in Indonesia and Malaysia to Bangladesh in the past 14 days, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon.
