2018-06-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jet fuel prices are at six-year highs, and part of the reason is linked to record U.S. shale crude production and the unique properties refiners contend with when they refine that oil. The United States produced about 4.7 million barrels per day of crude from shale formations in 2017. U.S. refiners have been using more of that abundant oil to manufacture diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.  Shale crude is younger than some other types of crude, so it differs somewhat from oil from other formations. The oil is a bit “waxier,” like wax applied to skis, said John Jechura, a professor of practice in chemical engineering at Colorado School of Mines. Refiners have found that when making diesel, their second-most common product after gasoline, they need to take measures to offset that waxiness to make the fuel usable for truck and car engines.  One option is to add kerosene and other components commonly found in jet fuel, market sources told Reuters. However, that reduces the available pool of jet fuel at a time when strong economic growth has boosted air travel. Even though the shale boom has provided U.S. refineries with more domestic oil, its properties have introduced challenges. Not all refiners can make jet fuel, and those that do must carefully allocate resources between jet fuel and its close chemical cousin, diesel, which is also in high demand.  “Some jet fuel has been diverted to the diesel pool because diesel demand is quite strong this year in the U.S., particularly on the East Coast,” said Amrit Naresh, global distillate analyst at ESAI Energy. Prices for jet fuel began to rise substantially in April. On April 20, jet fuel hit 4.50 cents per gallon above the ultra-low sulphur diesel futures HOc1 benchmark on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was the highest since December 2014, excluding a post-Hurricane Harvey spike last year.  Jet fuel last traded at 0.75 cent a gallon above futures, traders said. Prices have not been this high in June since 2012. With diesel futures at about $2.15 a gallon, that puts jet fuel at $2.16 a gallon. This summer, U.S. airlines expect 3.7 percent more passengers than they carried last summer, according to the industry group Airlines for America.  Still, high fuel costs are squeezing airline profits. The International Air Transport Association on Monday forecast airlines’ combined profits would be 12 percent lower than it had expected in December, largely because of costlier fuel. U.S. production of kerosene-type jet fuel totalled nearly 1.78 million barrels per day in March 2018, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed. Imports of jet fuel declined in the first quarter, adding to the squeeze. Unplanned shutdowns at East Coast refineries also helped push jet fuel prices higher this year, said Sandeep Sayal, vice president in the refining and marketing group at IHS Markit. Jet supplies have also come under pressure as some refiners have found it more profitable to make diesel as regulatory costs associated with that fuel have fallen, said Neil Earnest, president at consulting firm Muse, Stancil & Co in Dallas.  (For a graphic on jet fuel price differentials, see: tmsnrt.rs/2JcRfSI) Refineries have other options to reduce waxiness, Earnest said. They can use more specialty additives that cut wax, or drop sludgier parts of diesel into other refining units to produce gasoline and other fuels.  But Jechura said shale crudes tend to have waxy components distributed more evenly through the oil, making it more difficult to just reroute heavy components.

2018-06-07,"* Euro jumps as investors bet on ECB stimulus wind-down * U.S. Treasury prices extend gains * U.S. stocks mixed (Updates with oil price settlements) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a three-week peak on Thursday as expectations mounted that the European Central Bank will signal an early wind-down of economic stimulus, while oil prices jumped on concern about a drop in Venezuela exports. U.S. Treasury prices extended gains as worries about global trade and losses in emerging markets sparked a fresh wave of safe-haven demand for U.S. government debt. The ECB, at its policy meeting next week, will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, its chief economist, Peter Praet, a close ally of ECB President Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday. Other ECB officials echoed Praet’s sentiment. The comments drove the euro as high as $1.1840, the highest level since May 17. The European single currency has risen for four straight sessions. Since hitting a 10-month low last week, it has gained nearly 3 percent. The euro was last up 0.22 percent to $1.1799. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.24 percent. “Any signal next week that the bank plans to go ahead with winding down its asset purchases in the fall could add to the euro’s broadly improved tone,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Oil prices received a boost from worries over a steep drop in exports from crisis-plagued Venezuela, which faces the threat of U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude rose $1.22 to settle at $65.95 a barrel, while Brent gained $1.96 to settle at $77.32. The higher prices helped energy shares on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 energy index last up 1.7 percent, making it the biggest percentage gainer among sectors. U.S. stock indexes were mixed, as a rally in tech stocks ended and set up the Nasdaq for its first loss in five days, while a 4.4 percent jump in McDonald’s shares following news of potential layoffs boosted the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 87.19 points, or 0.35 percent, to 25,233.58, the S&P 500 lost 2.83 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,769.52, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 54.46 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,634.78. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.19 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.03 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.30 percent. Investors were focused on the upcoming G7 summit of seven major economies, amid a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Donald Trump and the group’s remaining six members after Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week. The summit takes place on Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec. The global trade worries boosted Treasury prices. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 15/32 in price to yield 2.9204 percent, from 2.975 percent late on Wednesday. In the metals markets, copper hit a 4-1/2-year high, lifted by concerns over the potential that wage negotiations at the world’s biggest copper mine could disrupt supply. Copper rose 0.37 percent to $7,247.00 a tonne. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type code LIVE/ into a news window***** Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard

2018-06-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global benchmark Brent crude surged nearly $2 a barrel on Thursday, lifted by concern about a steep drop in exports from Venezuela and worries OPEC may not raise production at its meeting this month. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up $1.96 a barrel, or 2.6 percent at $77.32. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 rose $1.22, or 1.88 percent to $65.95 a barrel.  Surging U.S. production has capped gains in WTI prices, widening the grade’s discount to Brent to more than $11 a barrel CL-LCO1=R.  Crude prices got an early lift on concerns about exports from Venezuela. Gains grew when Algeria’s oil minister indicated OPEC would focus on balancing the market rather than on rolling back production caps. “They’re all seeming to push back on the Saudis’ push to raise production,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “With this more than 10 percent (price) fall, they may reconsider things as we come closer to the meeting.” OPEC member Venezuela, threatened with U.S. sanctions in the midst of an economic crisis, is nearly a month behind delivering crude to customers from its main export terminals, according to shipping data. Angola has also seen output decline rapidly from its aging fields. In Venezuela, chronic delays and production declines could soon breach state-run PDVSA’s supply contracts. Tankers waiting to load more than 24 million barrels of crude, almost as much as PDVSA shipped in April, are sitting off the main oil port, according to shipping data. Noting Venezuela's troubles and OPEC's pending decision on supply, London Capital Group head of research Jasper Lawler said ""oil traders could be in for an increased bout of volatility.""(GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production and inventories: reut.rs/2JuOIma) The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producers including Russia have cut output since 2017 to reduce a global crude glut. The group meets in Vienna on June 22 to discuss its supply policy.  Algerian Energy Minister Mustapha Guitouni said on state radio: ""What matters to us is that there is a balance between supply and demand to ensure the stability of the oil markets.""(GRAPHIC: Top oil producers: reut.rs/2M7nuR1) OPEC-member Iraq said on Wednesday a production increase was not on the table.

Christophe Gerondeau, country chairman for Total in the United States, described the plans at the ground-breaking ceremony for a new 1 million ton per year ethane cracker. The cracker is being built at Total’s 225,500 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and alongside a joint-venture steam cracker owned by Total and BASF, the company said. The new ethane cracker will cost $1.7 billion by the time it begins production in 2020. The ethane cracker will produce ethylene from U.S. feedstock and send it to the 400,000 ton per year polyethylene plant in Bayport, Texas. Total wants to add a further 625,000 tons per year in capacity to the Bayport plant, Gerondeau said. “We are in the final approval process of that expansion,” he said. Total does not plan to add crude oil refining capacity at the Port Arthur refinery, focusing instead on petrochemical expansion, said Bernard Pinatel, president of refining and chemicals for Total. “We love the U.S. for expansion in petrochemicals,” Pinatel said. “It’s a country in which we’d like to further expand.” Tariffs proposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on steel imports are not expected to impact construction of the ethane cracker, Port Arthur refinery General Manager Bryan Canfield said. “We don’t feel we’re very exposed,” Canfield said.

2018-06-07,"ANKARA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Turkey has temporarily stopped filling a huge dam on the Tigris River after complaints from neighbouring Iraq, which is suffering water shortages, officials said on Thursday. Turkey’s ambassador to Baghdad and Iraq’s water minister also said that the two countries had agreed that when Ankara resumes filling the Ilisu dam in July it will still allow sufficient water to flow into Iraq. The dam, more than 20 years in the making, will generate electricity for a large area of southeast Turkey. But it has been heavily criticised over its impact on the environment and on the tens of thousands of villagers who will be displaced. Its waters will also submerge a 12,000-year-old town. Turkey started filling the Ilisu dam last week, prompting deep concern over water shortages in Iraq. Ankara had already delayed the planned start by three months at the request of its southern neighbour. Turkey’s ambassador to Iraq, Fatih Yildiz, said on Twitter that Turkey stopped filling the dam on President Tayyip Erdogan’s orders to address Iraq’s worries. “As of this moment, Tigris waters are being transferred to Iraq without touching a drop of it in Ilisu,” Yildiz said.    “With the second decision to postpone, we have shown once again that we can put our neighbour’s needs ahead of our own.” The filling will resume on July 1, he said, adding that water will still flow into Iraq in accordance with agreements between the two countries. Iraq’s Minister of Water Resources Hassan al-Janabi said Iraq had asked for the postponement and that the two countries had agreed on a way to fill it while still allowing adequate water supplies to Iraq.  “We asked them to postpone until the end of June. Turkey agreed and we were very happy,” he told a news conference in Baghdad. “The way the dam gets filled is very important...and we found a filling method that guarantees Iraq’s interests.” Around 70 percent of Iraq’s water resources flow from neighbouring countries, especially in the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers which run through Turkey. The dam, which first got Turkish government approval in 1997, is a key part of Turkey’s Southeastern Anatolia Project, designed to improve its poorest and least developed region. But Western export credit insurers quit the project saying it did not meet international standards on the environment and preservation of cultural heritage. The government later secured credit from three local banks to continue construction. Erdogan said in an election rally two weeks ago that the 9 billion lira (1.49 billion pounds) dam, which he described as a “truly gigantic project” would start generating electricity next year. Once it is filled, Ilisu will completely or partially flood 199 villages and the 12,000 year-old town of Hasankeyf, which is home to 78,000 people, according a report from a campaign group, The Initiative to Keep Hasankeyf Alive. Hasankeyf was used by the Romans as a fortress to ward off Persians. The town was later destroyed by Mongols and rebuilt in the 11th century by Seljuk Turks. Some of the ancient structures have been moved to a nearby area.

2018-06-07,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia should hold an early parliamentary election within a year, its newly elected Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Thursday. Opposition leader Pashinyan was elected prime minister by Armenia’s parliament on May 8, capping a peaceful revolution driven by weeks of mass protests against corruption and cronyism. After taking power, Pashinyan appointed his allies and supporters as new ministers and submitted a new government programme, which was approved by the parliament on Thursday. Pashinyan said the composition of political forces in the parliament did not reflect the country’s political reality. A year would give enough time to ensure that the electoral system was fair before holding a new parliamentary election. “Holding a parliamentary election within a year will allow us to improve the electoral system and will give political parties an opportunity to ... prepare for the election,” Pashinyan told parliament. Fighting corruption would be one of the priorities of his cabinet, he said. “I’d like to be very honest and say that ... I won’t be involved in any corrupt deals, will not have any unofficial income, property or shares and will be demanding the same from each government member and each official,” Pashinyan said.

2018-06-07,"JUBA, June 7 (Reuters) - South Sudan said on Thursday it had agreed with its northern neighbour Sudan to repair oil infrastructure facilities destroyed by conflict within three months to boost production in Africa’s youngest country. Michael Makuei Lueth, South Sudan’s information minister, told Reuters officials agreed with their visiting Sudanese counterparts to “evaluate and assess the damage” to South Sudan’s oilfields in the Heglig area in the country’s north. “There is an agreement between the two oil ministries of the two countries. They agreed to cooperate and work together in order to repair (the damage),” he said. South Sudan depends virtually entirely on oil sales for its revenue but production has declined since war broke out in the country in 2013. The oil is shipped to international markets via a pipeline through Sudan. Fighting was triggered by a political disagreement between President Salva Kiir and his former deputy Riek Machar and a regionally brokered peace pact failed to end the war after violations by both parties. Officials from the two countries “agreed that within the period of three months they will repair all the oil blocks and resume oil production in the region,” he said referring to the infrastructure in the oil blocks. The war has uprooted a quarter of South Sudan’s population of 12 million, ruined the country’s agriculture and battered the economy. A joint force would also be established by both countries to protect the oilfields from attacks by both rebels forces in South Sudan and Sudan.

2018-06-07,"MONTREAL/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - In a battle to unclog rail bottlenecks that left Canadian commodities trapped in landlocked western provinces this winter, the country’s largest railways are offering C$15,000 ($11,566.93) signing bonuses for experienced workers who can hit the rails right away and get trains moving. North America’s transportation sector is struggling to hire staff amid rising demand from shippers and low unemployment, with some large U.S. railroads offering bonuses as high as $20,000 for experienced train crews in certain states. The bonuses are a “new approach” for Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO), which is also bringing back recent retirees and has launched a new two-year management trainee program to deepen its pipeline of future managers, said spokesman Patrick Waldron. Harsh weather and insufficient capacity snarled service this winter, leaving grain and other commodities stranded in Canada’s landlocked prairies. “The strengthening economy across the board makes the overall job market more competitive,” Waldron said. Montreal-based CN initiated the bonuses last year, which its smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) then matched, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  Waldron would not say how many CN workers were hired through the bonuses which has not been previously reported. CP declined to comment specifically on the bonuses. CN is rolling out its largest expansion in decades, including a roughly 20 percent boost to its workforce over two years by the end of 2018.  CP, which said on Thursday it would invest C$500 million  ($385.6 million) on grain transport cars, plans to hire 700 workers, although a spokesman did not specify a time period. Calgary-based CP offered its engineers and conductors a 9 percent salary hike over four years as part of a tentative agreement reached last week. Experienced conductors earn over C$100,000 ($77,113), although salaries vary widely. Since new recruits need up to six months of training before hitting the rails, attracting experienced conductors who can work immediately is worth the bonuses’ expense, said Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman, noting it amounts to less than 1 percent of labor costs.      “The idea is to get them out there and get the trains rolling,” he said. But both railways could face stiff competition from the oil and gas sector, as rebounding oil prices push energy patch salaries back up to the six-figure mark, making those jobs far more attractive for workers, said recruiters. Railways hire from the same labor pool as many oil and gas firms.  The global oil benchmark Brent LCOc1 charged past $80 a barrel last month for the first time since 2014, cheering executives in Canada’s energy capital of Calgary, Alberta, where a shift is underway from survival mode to cautious expansion. Oil and gas sector job postings have jumped 159 percent so far this year, compared with 2017, said Matt Munro, Canada manager for UK-based recruiter Petroplan. Pay too is rising, with the average weekly salary for a Canadian oil and gas extraction employee in the first quarter rising 7.1 percent year-on-year to C$2,878.82 ($2,219.94), Statistics Canada data shows. Railway employee salaries, by comparison, averaged C$1,337.98 in the first three months of the year. Click here for a graphic on salaries: tmsnrt.rs/2s2YAKa While not everyone that exited the notoriously cyclical energy sector in the last downturn is ready to run back, “compensation will always play a significant factor in attracting and retaining top talent,” said Kati Greenall, Canada Regional Director at Houston-based recruitment firm Airswift.  Indeed, some newly recruited railway workers are already ready to jump ship.    “I would go back to the energy sector tomorrow if the opportunity came along,” one recent CP recruit told Reuters.

2018-06-07,"(Adds comment from Petrobras CEO, details of signing bonuses) By Alexandra Alper and Marta Nogueira RIO DE JANEIRO, June 7 (Reuters) - Norway’s Equinor ASA led oil majors grabbing pre-salt blocks in Brazil on Thursday, snapping up stakes in some of the world’s most alluring offshore geology despite fresh concerns about political meddling in the country’s energy sector. A consortium of Equinor, Exxon Mobil Corp and Petroleos de Portugal made Thursday’s most aggressive play, offering more than three times the minimum bid for the Uirapuru block in the Santos Basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. That meant partnering with Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, which joined all three winning consortia in the round. Brazil’s cash-strapped government collected 3.15 billion reais ($800 million) in fixed signing bonuses at the auction. The world’s leading oil producers have been spending top dollar to lock up access to Brazil’s coveted offshore, seeking to replenish depleted reserves as oil prices rise. Billions of barrels of oil are in the Brazilian pre-salt, beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. Unexpected changes to diesel pricing in Brazil last month raised questions about renewed political interference at Petrobras and triggered the surprise exit of Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente, who had turned the company around. Yet Thursday’s auction, including winning bids from Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, underscored enduring appetite for Brazil’s offshore despite any meddling in Petrobras’ downstream business. “We didn’t really make a connection with the fuel prices and the bidding rounds. It is quite an independent process,” said Anders Opedal, country manager for Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil last month. Ivan Monteiro, speaking as Petrobras CEO for the first time since being appointed on Friday, said the company would keep seeking to boost its exploration portfolio. Petrobras, Equinor, Exxon and Petroleos de Portugal won the Uirapuru block by offering the government 75.49 percent of oil after covering costs - well above the 22.18 percent minimum bid. The Uirapuru block is near the North Carcara area, which the same consortium clinched in an October round. Opedal said it was too soon to say if the blocks would be developed jointly. Equinor also won rights to develop the Dois Irmaos block of the Campos Basin, along with BP and Petrobras. Exxon, one of the few oil majors without stakes in Brazil’s world class pre-salt geology until late last year, has stakes in 25 Brazilian blocks after Thursday’s win. $1 = 3.9323 reais

2018-06-07,"* Euro jumps as investors bet on ECB stimulus wind-down * U.S. Treasury yields slip * S&P 500 index little changed in midday U.S. trading (Updates with U.S. markets, changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, June 7 (Reuters) - The euro climbed to a 3-week peak on Thursday as expectations mounted that the European Central Bank will signal an early wind-down of stimulus, while oil prices jumped on concern about a drop in Venezuela exports. The ECB, at its policy meeting next week, will debate whether to end bond purchases later this year, its chief economist, Peter Praet, a close ally of President Mario Draghi, said on Wednesday. Other ECB officials echoed Praet’s sentiment. The comments drove the euro to $1.1840, the highest since May 17. The single European currency has risen for four straight sessions. Since hitting a 10-month low last week, it has gained nearly 3 percent. The euro was up 0.42 percent to $1.1823. The dollar index, tracking the unit against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.34 percent. “Any signal next week that the bank plans to go ahead with winding down its asset purchases in the fall could add to the euro’s broadly improved tone,” said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst, at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Oil prices received a boost from worries over a steep drop in exports from Venezuela, which faces the threat of U.S. sanctions and is in the midst of an economic crisis. U.S. crude rose 1.62 percent to $65.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.79, up 1.9 percent. That helped energy shares on Wall Street, with the S&P 500 energy index last up 1.7 percent and the biggest percentage gainer among sectors. U.S. stock indexes were mixed, as a rally in tech stocks ended and set up the Nasdaq for its first loss in five days, while a jump in McDonald’s shares boosted the Dow. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.14 points, or 0.52 percent, to 25,277.53, the S&P 500 lost 0.46 points, or 0.02 percent, to 2,771.89 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 47.46 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,641.78. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.13 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe edged up 0.07 percent. Investors were focused on an upcoming G7 summit of seven major economies, amid a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Donald Trump and the group’s remaining six members. Trump stuck to his tough trade stance against top allies at the G7 summit, which takes place on Friday and Saturday in Charlevoix, Quebec, after imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week. Most U.S. Treasury yields fell, with 10-year yields holding below 3 percent, amid the trade tension between United States and its major trade partners. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.9681 percent, from 2.975 percent late on Wednesday. In the metals markets, copper hit a 4-1/2 year high, lifted by concerns over the potential for wage negotiations at the world’s biggest copper mine to disrupt supply. Copper rose 1.37 percent to $7,319.00 a tonne. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type code LIVE/ into a news window***** Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Richard

2018-06-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Belgium’s KBC (KBC.BR) will limit Iran-related transactions to only humanitarian trade after the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Tehran, the financial group said, becoming the latest company to scale back activities.   U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal with Iran - known as the JCPOA - on May 8 and said he would reimpose sanctions within 180 days, prompting several European companies to announce they would end business with Tehran before the Nov. 4 deadline. Since then, banks, insurers, shipping companies and European oil refiners have been gradually severing ties with Iran, complicating the efforts of European and other countries to keep the nuclear deal alive. “Immediately upon the exit by the USA of the JCPOA, KBC Group decided to restrict its policy on Iran to humanitarian goods as defined by OFAC,” the company said in an emailed statement to Reuters, referring to the U.S. Treasury’s sanctions enforcement arm. “This policy allows also such humanitarian transactions for KBC’s own customers beyond the 4th of November 2018 as long as it complies with OFAC programs.” KBC said pending transactions for goods other than humanitarian trade would be wound down within the allowed period.  “KBC never financed any deal with Iran but only processed the settlement of transactions of its customers, taking into account all applicable EU and OFAC sanctions and several other specific conditions,” it said.   International sanctions were lifted in 2016 as part of an agreement to limit Iran’s nuclear activity. The easing of measures included the removal of some sanctions by the United States such as on Iran’s financial sector.     KBC, which is an integrated bank-insurance group, said it previously decided in 2016 to support well established customers in home markets in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary “in their genuine trade with Iran, always respecting all EU and U.S. regulations”.   “Such support is/was restricted to non-U.S. dollar trade only and always subject to an in-depth screening of each transaction and all parties concerned.”   Kenni Leth, group press officer with Denmark’s largest lender Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO), said earlier this year the bank had decided to phase out and exit all activities to and from Iran and suspend existing relations with Iran that allowed it to support certain customers in doing business there. “During recent months the operational and reputational risks associated with doing business in Iran have increased,” Leth said.  Last week, Swiss lender Banque de Commerce et de Placements (BCP) told Reuters it had suspended new transactions with Iran and was winding down Iran-related activities, which finance sources said was a blow for Tehran.  Germany’s No.2 lender DZ Bank said last month it would halt financial transactions with Iran in July. Sanctions specialists say humanitarian business with Iran, which includes the food and medicine trade, was never barred before 2016, but the complexities involved made such activity slow paced due to concerns over dealing with sanctioned entities, together with a ban on U.S. dollar dealings.

2018-06-07," (In this June 6 story corrects name of agency in second paragraph to Bureau of Reclamation instead of Bureau of Land Reclamation) By Valerie Volcovici and Scott DiSavino (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department may use executive powers to prevent a large coal-fired power plant from shutting down next year in Arizona, the latest attempt by the Trump administration to throw a lifeline to at-risk coal and nuclear plants. The head of Interior’s Bureau of Reclamation said on Friday that a 1968 law gives Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke power to require an Arizona water project to buy energy from the Navajo Generating Station, or NGS, a 2,250-MW coal-fired power plant that is scheduled to close in 2019. Such a move could delay the plant’s closure. The proposal fits neatly with a broader effort by the administration of President Donald Trump to keep aging coal and nuclear plants from retirement, arguing their closure would constitute a threat to national energy security. Hundreds of coal-fired power plants have shut in recent years, along with several nuclear plants, under pressure from cheaper alternatives like natural gas and advances in wind and solar energy. Assistant Secretary for Water and Science Timothy Petty wrote a letter, dated June 1, to the board of directors of the Central Arizona Project, or CAP, saying the 1968 Colorado River Basin Project Act gives the secretary “governing authority” to decide the generation source for the project. “With the 1968 Act in mind, the Department expects to consider several options going forward, including the feasibility of continued use of NGS-provided power,” the letter, reviewed by Reuters, said.  A spokesman for the Bureau of Reclamation, Dan DuBray, said no final decisions had been made. The CAP board is due to meet on Thursday to discuss future options for sourcing cheaper power to run the project.  DeEtte Person, spokeswoman for CAP, said the board was focused on seeking the most competitively priced power and that “it’s not our understanding that we are obligated in that way to buy power from NGS.”  “If a new NGS ownership group materializes and can provide competitively priced power, CAP remains open to considering that alternative,” she said in an email.  The NGS and a coal mine that supplies it are both on Native American reservation land and employ as many as 750 people, mostly members of the Navajo and Hopi tribes. The plant was uncompetitive because of competition from cheaper natural gas-fired facilities and will shut at the end of next year unless it finds new buyers. The Hopi tribe, the coal miners union and coal mining company Peabody Energy Corp last month sued CAP - the biggest energy user in the area - to force it to keep buying power from the NGS. Zinke has said in previous statements that he will work with all parties - including any future owner - to keep the plant open to support “good paying tribal jobs.” Reporting by Valerie Volcovici in Washington and Scott DiSavino in New York; Editing by Peter Cooney and Jonathan Oatis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-coal/corrected-u-s-interior-dept-weighs-plan-to-save-navajo-coal-plant-from-closing-idUKL2N1T81OM,07 Jun 2018,"The U.S. Interior Department may use

2018-06-07,"MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada’s Quebec province said on Thursday it has halted approvals for new digital currency mining projects to give it time to consider restrictions on their operations and raising the rates they pay for power.  The provincial government announced the move as state-owned power generator Hydro Quebec QBEC.UL said it has asked the province to limit total power available to all digital currency miners to a block of 500 megawatts. That is about enough energy to run a single aluminum smelting plant, or a fraction of the 17,000 megawatts in capacity requested so far by miners looking to operate in Quebec. The firm also said it asked the province’s energy board to determine quickly how much it should charge digital currency miners to help maximize the energy producer’s revenue.  Quebec’s energy ministry said it ordered Hydro Quebec to hold off on connecting new digital currency mining operations until regulators set new roles for the industry.  Quebec is seeking to restrict the industry amid a surge in applications from companies in China and other countries looking to take advantage of the region’s low power rates and the country’s political stability.  The province will establish rules that enable it to welcome “the best among the companies” from the cryptocurrency sector, Quebec Energy Minister Pierre Moreau said in a statement. Hydro-Québec Distribution President Eric Filion said in a statement that new rules are required to ensure that the digital mining industry helps expand the province’s economy and does not result in higher power rates for its residents. Cryptocurrency operations “mine” or create digital coins by solving complex mathematical puzzles, a process that requires large amounts of energy to run lightening-fast microprocessors and air-conditioning systems to cool computers.     Regulators in China, Israel, South Korea and other countries  have said they are concerned about the growth in use of cryptocurrencies, which are not backed by any central bank because of their volatility.

2018-06-07,"OSLO (Reuters) - High costs of extracting greenhouse gases from thin air could tumble with new technologies that can help to combat climate change, scientists said on Thursday. Carbon Engineering, a Canadian-based clean energy company, outlined the design of a large industrial plant that it said could capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere at a cost of between $94 and $232 a tonne. That is well below past estimates of about $600 a tonne by the American Physical Society, said David Keith, a Harvard University physics professor and the founder of Carbon Engineering who led the research. “I hope to show that this as a viable energy industrial technology, not something that is a magic bullet ... but something that is completely doable,” he told Reuters of the peer-reviewed study published in the journal Joule. Carbon Engineering, which has about 40 employees and produces about a tonne of carbon dioxide a day from an experimental plant. The technology makes synthetic fuels using only air, water and renewable power.  Keith said an industrial-scale plant could make fuel at a dollar a litre. That would be competitive in California, where low carbon fuel standards to cut pollution from cars and trucks mean high prices. He said some investors were interested. An industrial plant, costing hundreds of millions of dollars, could capture a million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year, equivalent to emissions by 250,000 cars. Other experts welcomed the study as a step to clear up huge uncertainties about the costs of “direct air capture”. U.N. reports indicate that governments may have to deploy such novel technologies this century to remove carbon from nature and bury it to limit global warming under the 2015 Paris climate agreement. “Direct air capture is a politically promising route for carbon dioxide removal,” said Oliver Geden, of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. And an air capture plant could be built almost anywhere. It would not threaten farmland, unlike options of planting vast forests which soak up carbon dioxide, he said. Climeworks, a Swiss company and Carbon Engineering’s main rival, also told Reuters it was hoping to cut its production price to $100 a tonne in the next 5-10 years, from about $600 now. It sells carbon dioxide to greenhouses as an airborne fertiliser to grow tomatoes or cucumbers. Jan Wurzbacher, a founder of Climeworks, said more and more governments are likely to jack up penalties on carbon emissions to limit floods, storms and rising seas in coming years, making the technology more viable. The World Bank says Sweden has the highest carbon taxes, currently 1,150 Swedish crowns ($133) a tonne.

2018-06-07,"(Adds further details from annual report, telecom background) By Promit Mukherjee and Sankalp Phartiyal MUMBAI, June 7 (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries Ltd aims to make its consumer businesses as big as its core energy operations, chairman Mukesh Ambani said in its annual report, as he seeks to reshape the industrial powerhouse. The company, primarily an oil and gas refining, marketing and petrochemicals conglomerate, counts telecoms, retail and media and entertainment as part of its consumer businesses that together contribute barely a tenth of total operating profit. However, buoyed by the success of Reliance’s fledgling telecoms start-up Jio, which turned a profit within a year of operation, Ambani is hoping to see rapid growth from the consumer divisions in future. “Our aim is to have the consumer businesses contribute on par with the energy and materials business over the next decade,” Ambani said in a letter to shareholders in the annual report. “The year saw our consumer businesses attain a threshold, wherefrom they will start contributing meaningfully to consolidated profits,” he said. In May, Reliance announced that Jio posted its second straight quarterly net profit since its launch in September 2016 as its cut-price plans continued to attract subscribers. With more than 186 million subscribers, Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, or Jio as it is commonly called, is the fourth biggest telecoms carrier in India and boasts of having added more customers in the 2017 fiscal year than its rivals combined. Jio triggered a price war among operators as they moved to compete with Jio’s low-cost data plans, driving down margins and spurring consolidation in India’s telecom industry. It plans to cover 99 percent of the country with its network by the end of the year, giving it reach to households and enterprises, Jio’s head of strategy Anshuman Thakur said in May. Ambani, India’s richest man, spearheaded the company’s consumer-led diversification a decade ago with its entry into organised retail. While that business turned an operating profit within six years, its contribution to overall profit remains minimal. The retail business accounted for 4 percent of the company’s consolidated net profit in the 2017-2018 fiscal year. Reliance runs the world’s largest single-location crude oil refinery and petrochemical complex, in western India. That contributes 90 percent of the company’s overall profit and revenue.

2018-06-07,"(Recasts and edits to highlight main themes) MOSCOW, June 7 (Reuters) - The following are highlights from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual phone-in on Thursday: “The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctions… They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.” “When in 2007 I spoke in Munich...I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that’s exactly what’s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.” “It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.” “The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.” “The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.” ON POSSIBILITY OF MILITARY FLARE-UP IN EASTERN UKRAINE “I hope that things will not come to provocations (during the soccer World Cup). If this happens I think it would have very serious consequences for the Ukrainian government in general.” ON PRESSURE ON RUSSIAN BUSINESSMEN IN BRITAIN AND ELSEWHERE “With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia.” “Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those who are doing this in the West.” “In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.” “Some say we need to help (billionaire Roman) Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation… I wouldn’t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.” “Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.” “Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn’t even a need for them anymore.” “Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia’s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia’s interest for them to do so.” “As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name – I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.” “Obviously, I’m always thinking about it. A successor, in the ordinary sense of the word – no, the Russian people, the voters will decide who that will be. But of course I think that we should raise a new, young generation of leaders, responsible people who will be able to take on the responsibility of Russia.” “With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale.” “I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.” “I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in this… and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.” “Overall, we are moving in the right direction. We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.” “Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.” “Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 trillion roubles (Putin said billion, but meant trillion), but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.” “Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that’s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.” “Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.” “What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.” “By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilise the situation on the market.” Putin said he would support a proposal to raise export tariffs on motor fuel, equalising them with tariffs on oil exports. “This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.” “It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken.” “It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence.” ON RESTRICTING RUSSIAN INTERNET ACCESS “We are not going to close anything... I also worked in the security services and know it is easiest to ban, and harder to find civilised solutions. Therefore, I’m going to urge all my colleagues to take this route, the route of security and law enforcement agencies using modern methods to combat offences, including terrorism, without restricting freedoms including on the Internet.” “Recently one of Germany’s famous and popular publications wrote that President Trump is pushing Europe towards Putin. If we take this together with an earlier joke, that Russia influenced elections in the United States, then this all taken together starts sounding pretty funny. We apparently influenced the election of the U.S. President, and then he gifted us Europe. Total nonsense. There’s no way to describe this other than as a joke.” “Nationalising the whole oil sector would be a difficult and highly dangerous process, which could have negative consequences not only for the sector but for the whole economy.” “... This phenomenon has its place in the world, and it’s developing. We need to monitor and analyse what’s going on thoroughly. And at some stage we will need to look at how we can take part in this process, how we can use it to avoid all sorts of restrictions in the sphere of international financial activity, among other things.” (Reporting by Moscow Newsroom Writing by Polina Ivanova Editing by Andrew Osborn)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-putin-highlights/highlights-key-quotes-from-russian-president-putins-annual-phone-in-idUKL5N1T928G,07 Jun 2018,"The following are highlights from

2018-06-07,"DUBAI/WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - A day before U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, one of his senior officials phoned Saudi Arabia to ask the world’s largest oil exporter to help keep prices stable if the decision disrupted supply. Riyadh, Tehran’s arch rival, has long been a close Washington ally, but direct pressure on a member of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) over oil policies is rare. Washington last pressed Saudi Arabia to increase output in 2012. Riyadh has said that even though prices have spiked to over $80 per barrel, the highest since 2014, the market has yet to recover from a long slump. Until the phone call, Saudi officials had been saying it was too early to raise output. Riyadh took this line partly because higher crude prices could help the stock market float of a stake in state oil giant Saudi Aramco expected to take place in 2019, Saudi industry sources had told Reuters.  So there was shock among some of Saudi Arabia’s fellow OPEC members when it issued a supportive statement hours after Washington imposed new sanctions on Tehran. It said it was ready to raise output to offset any supply shortage.  Three sources familiar with the matter said a senior U.S. administration official had called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman before Trump’s announcement to make sure Washington could count on Riyadh, the de facto OPEC leader. One of the sources said the call took place on May 7. The other two did not specify a date for the call.  Washington was worried that the sanctions would curb deliveries from Iran and push oil prices up, the sources said. A White House spokesperson declined to comment on whether a call took place.  A senior Saudi official did not confirm the call but said: “We were made aware of the decision on the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) before the announcement...We always have conversations with the U.S. about the stability of the oil market.” The Saudi statement in May threatened to undermine a deal between OPEC and its allies led by Russia to curb output by about 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), starting from January 2017, to reduce a supply glut and boost prices. The deal is due to expire at the end of 2018. OPEC will meet on June 22 and needs a consensus of all members to officially change its output policy. Iran’s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, said last week he did not agree on the potential need to increase global oil supplies.    An OPEC source familiar with Saudi thinking said that Riyadh and Washington had discussed their oil policies before the U.S. announcement on Iran.    “You need to work with your partners in dealing with any potential effect on supply,” that OPEC source said. The sudden shift in Riyadh’s public position came as a surprise to its Gulf allies, who coordinate OPEC policies closely.  Some Gulf countries were “upset that there was no prior consultation with them”, a separate source said. They felt Riyadh had come under pressure from Washington and they had not been consulted before public comments by Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih. Falih travelled to Russia’s economic forum in St Petersburg last month and said the kingdom was prepared to gradually ease oil output curbs to calm consumers’ worries.   The shift has also irked some producers outside the Gulf.  “Some people felt they were not properly consulted before  the comments in St. Petersburg,” a second OPEC source said. Since the original international sanctions were lifted in January 2016, Iran has struggled to raise production above 4 million barrels per day. This is due to a lack of new projects. Iran would benefit less than Saudi Arabia from an increase in supplies if it cannot raise output, as well as receive a lower price for existing production. A third OPEC source said it would be against the OPEC charter to raise output just because Washington had requested it. “For some OPEC members, this is too much,” the source said. U.S. reliance on Saudi crude imports has decreased in recent years, in part as domestic shale output has risen, but Saudi Arabia remains an important source of U.S. supply. The U.S. imported 748,000 bpd from Saudi Arabia in March 2018, having reached a post-1970s peak of more than 2 million bpd during 2003, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Reuters reported in late May that OPEC and its allies could raise production by about 1 million bpd from July to address any potential oil shortages. The sources say Riyadh’s shift in stance was prompted by pressure by Washington and other consuming countries but does not reflect concern in Saudi Arabia that there is a supply deficit.  In late April, Trump in a tweet criticized OPEC for high oil prices. India and China also raised concerns about high oil prices in separate calls with Falih. “The thinking before was to continue with the OPEC deal until the end of the year,” a fourth OPEC source said. “But then Trump and the Iran nuclear deal happened and consuming nations started to complain. Consumers are very important for us.” Additional reporting by Timothy Gardner in Washington and Steve Holland; Editing by Dmitry Zhdannikov and Anna Willard",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-usa/exclusive-trump-requested-saudi-oil-support-before-iran-nuclear-decision-sources-idUKL5N1T721E,07 Jun 2018,"* Saudi Arabia had been saying there was no need to raise

2018-06-07,"ALMHULT, Sweden (Reuters) - IKEA, the world’s biggest furniture retailer, plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by 2030, in the latest commitment by a global store group to reducing its impact on the environment.  Inter IKEA, the owner of the brand best known for its low-cost flat-pack furniture, said on Thursday it aimed to reduce the climate impact of each of its products by more than two thirds by the end of next decade.  Currently, 60 percent of the IKEA range is based on renewable materials, while nearly 10 percent contain recycled materials, an Inter IKEA spokeswoman said.  “Through our size and reach we have the opportunity to inspire and enable more than one billion people to live better lives, within the limits of the planet,” Inter IKEA CEO Torbjorn said in a statement to accompany the company’s 2030 sustainability strategy document. “We are committed to taking the lead, working together with everyone – from raw material suppliers all the way to our customers and partners.”  Inter IKEA joins a growing list of global companies striving to make their operations more environmentally sustainable, although there are question marks over whether enough are taking action and whether they should be doing more.  The world’s 250 biggest listed companies account for a third of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions, but few have concrete goals to limit rising temperatures, a Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk white paper concluded in October. Raw materials account for most of IKEA’s greenhouse gas emissions and, along with extending the potential lifespan of its products, is where IKEA sees the biggest opportunities for reducing its impact on the environment.  Along with phasing out non-recycled plastic, the company will implement changes ranging from greener glue in particleboard and more vegetarian food in its restaurants to a new candle recipe, Loof told Reuters.  Inter IKEA’s plan is the first to target all IKEA stores - the bulk of which are run by IKEA Group, but some of which are run by other franchisees - as well as the supply chain.  In total, there are 418 IKEA stores across 49 markets. Retail sales in the year through August 2017 were a combined 38.3 billion euros ($45.3 billion). Inter IKEA set a so-called science-based target for IKEA Group to cut the climate impact of stores and other operations by 80 percent in absolute terms by 2030 compared with 2016.  Global brands including H&M, Coca-Cola and Sony have also committed to science-based targets, which aim to help limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius - the goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement. The Science Based Targets Initiative is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the United Nations Global Compact.  Inter IKEA also said it would remove all single-use plastic products from its range and in-store restaurants by 2020, and that IKEA Group would roll out the sale of home solar solutions to 29 markets by 2025.

2018-06-07,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has stopped unpopular tax increases and reforms to assert his authority and counter doubts about his health, amid mounting speculation that he will seek a fifth term, analysts said. There has been uncertainty over the direction of Algeria, an OPEC producer and key gas supplier to Europe, as Bouteflika — in office since 1999 — has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. The opposition and some intellectuals have urged the wheelchair-bound 81-year-old not to run again in next year’s polls due to health concerns. Imposing his authority, Bouteflika late on Tuesday vetoed down a plan by Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia to drastically increase duties for passport and other documents to cope with a halving in vital gas and oil revenues between 2014 and 2017. He had already stopped another proposal to open up farming to foreign investors to diversify the economy and seek new revenues. With oil prices having recovered, Bouteflika stopped the plans while announcing social and infrastructure spending worth 500 billion dinars (£3.2 billion) to boost his credentials ahead of a possible new candidature, analysts said. “He (Bouteflika) wants to show that he is the country’s ruler,” said a local analyst asking not to be named due to sensitivity of issue. His move came just a week after a group of intellectuals and opposition figures urged Bouteflika not to seek a fifth term. “Your advanced age and your dramatic state of health command you to not take care of the duties of the state any more,” they wrote in an open letter. “There is no doubt that another mandate would be an ordeal for you and for the country,” the letter said, talking tough in a country where open dissent has been rare since a civil war with Islamists in the 1990s killed some 200,000. Bouteflika has yet to say whether he will run again but the ruling FLN party has urged him to do so. If he does, that would mean short-term stability for the elites of FLN, army and business tycoons to postpone a potentially controversial succession. But it would move Algeria, where about half the population is under 25, away from reforms to protect it against future energy price volatility — oil and gas revenues make up 95 percent of foreign exchange revenues. Ouyahia had launched some steps which proved unpopular in a country where many harbour suspicions towards foreigners, a legacy of the trauma of the 1954-1962 independence war with France. For the elites political stability for now is key, analysts said. While another term for Bouteflika could be a source of dismay for young Algerians worried about joblessness and austerity, it would give a ruling caste of FLN officials, generals and businessmen time to set up a smooth succession. Ouyahia, dubbed by some in the FLN as a “dirty mission man” in reference to some unpopular decisions, has said he would not run against Bouteflika. But by stopping his reforms and making him look weak, Bouteflika has sidelined him just in case should he have higher ambitions at some later point. “Bouteflika is demonstrating that he is a man of the people and trying to portray Ouyahia as motivated only by unsympathetic fiscal calculations,” said Geoff Porter at NARCO consultancy.

2018-06-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is seeking buyers for its stake in a large undeveloped gas field off Tanzania, according to three banking and industry sources, as the company focuses on the development of an even bigger project in neighbouring Mozambique. The planned sale is an example of Chief Executive Darren Woods’ strategy of freeing up cash and narrowing the American firm’s focus on a number of giant projects around the world deemed to have the best prospects, including in Mozambique, Guyana and U.S. shale.  Woods, who became CEO in January 2017 after predecessor Rex Tillerson retired and became U.S. secretary of state, has come under heavy pressure from investors over the past year to turn around the world’s largest publicly-traded oil and gas company as its output and earnings sagged. Exxon holds a 35 percent stake in Tanzania’s deepwater Block 2 field that was discovered earlier this decade. It holds an estimated 23 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to the website of Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL), which operates the block and holds a 65 percent stake. The prospect has faced repeated delays in recent years due mainly to a lack of infrastructure and regulation for the country’s nascent oil and gas sector, complicating any sale. The sources said the value of the asset was unclear due to early stage of development and uncertain future. Exxon declined to comment. A spokesman for Equinor declined to comment on the sale process. He said the company had not changed its plans in Tanzania. Tanzania has moved down the priority list for Exxon after it acquired a 25 percent stake in the gas-rich Area 4 development offshore Mozambique $2.8 billion from Eni (ENI.MI) last year. Area 4, holding an estimated 85 trillion cubic feet of gas, is one of the world’s largest gas discoveries in recent years, and far bigger than the Tanzanian field. The project is also far more advanced - it is already under development and expected to start production in 2022. Houston-based Exxon has also taken charge of the development of the liquefied natural gas plant at the site.

2018-06-07,"OSLO, June 7 (Reuters) - Finland will reduce the tariff it charges on electricity imports from Russia, making it cheaper for energy traders to sell more Russian power and boost the Nordic country’s security of supply, its grid chief told Reuters. The move conflicts with European Union efforts to encourage EU members to reduce dependency on Russian energy supplies. Imports from Russia, as well as Sweden, are indispensable for Finland to meet its growing domestic electricity needs and to cover its power production deficit, but tariffs, transmission fees and capacity payments kept Russian flows low last winter. Fingrid, the country’s state-owned grid, will cut Russian tariff levels from July 1 onwards. The coefficient, a tariff adjustment rate, will be slashed to 0.2 for importing power in off-peak hours and scrapped altogether for peak hours. “Reducing the trading tariffs will, in principle, make it less costly for traders to import Russian power, it is good for Finland’s security of supply,” Fingrid’s chief executive Jukka Ruusunen said. In the Finnish-Russian power trade, Finland’s imports far exceed its exports, but high transmission fees and capacity payments for Russian-produced electricity at times make it unprofitable to send, even at seasonal peak prices. High transmission fees that vary depending on Finland’s and Russia’s price differences, remain a discouraging factor for traders and were the main cause for last winter’s low imports, but cutting the coefficient to zero could push them up. “The transmission fees are dynamic, in peak demand, even when prices are really high they also grow. That is why we had so low Russian imports last winter. But lower tariffs will make imports just a bit less costly,” Ruusunen said. Reliability of power supply is particularly crucial to Finland as its industrial sector, including pulp and paper makers such as UPM and Stora Enso, but also for energy-intensive data centres that it wants built. Finland, which imports up to a fifth of its electricity needs at times of peak winter demand, saw industrial energy needs grow by 1.7 percent last year, while net power imports hit a record high. Net imports of electricity to Finland amounted to 20.4 terawatt hours TWh, which corresponded to 24 per cent of its total electricity consumption. About 5.8 TWh were imported from Russia.

2018-06-07,"(Adds quotes) MOSCOW, June 7 (Reuters) - The following are highlights from Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annual phone-in on Thursday: “Maybe it was wrong, back in the day, and we shouldn’t have created new billionaires, maybe there wasn’t enough to justify doing so. But what’s done is done. Whatever we could return at the last minute, we did. I am referring for example to the creation, in essence, of a controlling stake, under the government’s control, in Gazprom, and the creation of such a controlling stake in leading oil company Rosneft.” “Nationalising the whole oil sector would be a difficult and highly dangerous process, which could have negative consequences not only for the sector but for the whole economy.” “We must make sure that no matter who these businesses belong to, they work within the boundaries of the law, that they invest in resource extraction and processing on the territory of this country, that they fulfil their duties before the budget in full, and make their businesses effective businesses which can compete on global markets. And, in reality, our oil companies are achieving this.” “There are weapons being developed, which I have already mentioned: two pieces of hardware with nuclear-powered engines, a global-range missile and an unmanned underwater vessel. In both cases we have completed the main development phase, in particular everything to do with testing the nuclear-powered engine…” “But this is not all we plan to produce and put into service. It’s too early to talk about it but we will do so soon.” “Firstly, the use of our armed forces in the battlefield is a unique experience, a unique tool by which to improve our armed forces. No amount of military exercise could compare with the use of force in combat conditions.” “Yes, we know that the use of force in battlefield conditions is also associated with loss of life… But this was an important, a noble mission, aimed at protecting the interests of the Russian Federation and its citizens.” “Let me remind you that thousands of militants left Russia and the countries of Central Asia – with whom we do not have hard borders – and gathered on Syrian soil. It was better to deal with them there, to get to work there, so to speak, and liquidate them there, than let them come back here, weapons in hand.” “Major military operations, particularly involving Russian armed forces, have ended. There isn’t even a need for them anymore.” “Our soldiers are there (in Syria) in order to secure Russia’s interests in this critically important part of the world, which is so near to us. And they will stay there, for as long as it is in Russia’s interest for them to do so.” “As yet we do not plan to withdraw these forces. But I direct your attention to the fact that I did not call these bases by any other name – I called them bases. We are not building long-term military structures there and if we need to, we could withdraw our military personnel very quickly, without incurring any financial losses.” “Russia, by definition, cannot have its own crypto currency just as no other country can have its own crypto currency, because when we talk about crypto currencies, we refer to something that goes beyond national boundaries.” “Secondly, so-called (crypto currency) mining is not subject to regulations here and we, by and large, treat it with a lot of caution. In most countries crypto currencies are not used as a means of payment.” “The Russian central bank believes that crypto currencies can’t be a method of payment or exchange, or be used for savings. And they, these crypto currencies, they are not backed by anything.” “However, this phenomenon has its place in the world, and it’s developing. We need to monitor and analyse what’s going on thoroughly. And at some stage we will need to look at how we can take part in this process, how we can use it to avoid all sorts of restrictions in the sphere of international financial activity, among other things.” “Many countries are turning to the development of ecologically friendly forms of transport, including electric vehicles, as an answer to questions about ecological conditions. This has some specific characteristics here. In order to produce electrical energy to charge electric vehicles, it is necessary to use some sort of other source of energy.” “We have to shift to gas-fuelled vehicles and stimulate progress in this direction. Questions arise about how to organise petrol stations. Gazprom is working on this.” “Overall, we are moving in the right direction. What is the basis for saying this? We have started on the trajectory towards robust economic growth in Russia. Yes, this growth is humble, small, but it is also not a fall. Growth was at 1.5 percent last year.” “Not everyone feels this personally but overall, this is an objective statistic. That’s how it is, it is the truth. Export in technical equipment is growing, which shows that some structural changes are going on in the economy. Export of agricultural produce, at 20 billion last year, was higher than defence exports, which were at 15 billion.” “Based on our preliminary calculations, we may in the next six years spend 17 trillion roubles (Putin said billion, but meant trillion), but to achieve the goals that we have discussed, we will need an additional 8 trillion roubles. And it is clear where we are going to find them.” “Firstly, it is through the growth of the economy itself, that’s the main source of additional resources. It is also the more effective use of existing resources, adjustment in some senses of our macro-economic plans and of course adjustments to our tax policy.” “Stability of tax policy must be absolutely guaranteed for the next six years.” “Many suggest changing the personal income tax. We thought about this for a long time. At first glance, progressive personal income tax seems and looks to be fairer… But reality is more complicated than theories and formulas.” “We had such a tax – a tax on revenue. This is a serious strain on the economy overall and in the end on citizens, because it inevitably leads to a rise in inflation. All this convinced us that introducing this was also not expedient.” “The thing is, the development plan which we have been discussing in recent years, it was being prepared by the previous government during at least the past one and a half years. I know full well that if we were to replace the entire government 100 percent, and bring in totally new people… we would have lost at least two years, and we do not have those two years.” “But it was also necessary to keep those, who made the decisions for our country’s progress. And to personalize responsibility for what has been done so far and for what is coming up soon.” “I think that we have an optimal make up of government for today.” “What is going on right now, it is unacceptable, it is wrong. However, it must be admitted that it is the result of inaccurate regulation, that was brought in recently in the sphere of energy, in energy resources.” “By the autumn of this year, additional measures should be introduced which will stabilize the situation on the market. I am basing this on the fact that the government will be monitoring this carefully.” “Agreements have been reached at the government level with all companies to increase the production of oil products and on deliveries to the domestic market to not permit a deficit.” “Additionally, we have worked out a series of measures aimed at stabilization. I am referring to the possibility of introducing export tariffs by the Russian government on deliveries of oil products for export. A law has been prepared on this and we will be ready to present it to parliament in the near future, and will ask parliament to support it.” “We are introducing the possibility for government to raise export tariffs on motor fuel and to make it equal to tariffs on oil exports. We really hope we will now have to put it to use.” Putin response: “I will support this.” “With regards to the infrastructure, these 11 stadiums. Of course, we spent a lot of money on this and it is imperative that all of this infrastructure, I completely agree, it must work and above all work towards the development of sport on a large scale, including children’s sport.” “I would like right now to address my colleagues in the regions, to ask them to not allow, under any circumstances, for flea markets and the like to appear at these stadiums, as appeared in other sport-related buildings in Moscow during the middle of the 1990s.” “I think our Russian Football Union must play an active part in this… and develop a new generation of sportsmen and soccer players.” “Even though our national team has not demonstrated strong results recently, but the number of fans of this beautiful sport here is massive, it’s in the millions. We will rely on the fact that our soccer team will score a big win, so to speak, and will show its best qualities.” “This is a method by which to restrain Russia, the notorious sanctions, because endless accusations lay the groundwork for introducing restraining measures.” “It is because Russia is seen as a threat, because Russia is seen as becoming a competitor. I believe this approach is mistaken. Instead of restraining whoever it would be better to establish constructive cooperation, and then the overall effect on the global economy would be positive.” “It is clear to us that we have to defend our interests, and to do so consistently, not boorishly or rudely, in both the sphere of the economy and of defence. We have done so and we will continue to do so, but we always look for compromises, we aspire towards those compromises. The pressure will end when our partners will be persuaded that the methods they are using are ineffective, counterproductive and harmful to all.” “The understanding that a third world war could be the end of civilisation should restrain us from taking extreme steps on the international arena that are highly dangerous for modern civilisation.” “The threat of mutual destruction has always restrained participants of the international arena, prevented leading military powers from making hasty moves, and compelled participants to respect each other. U.S. withdrawal from treaties on anti-ballistic missiles is an attempt to put an end to strategic parity, but we will respond to this.” “We believe that the unilateral introduction of all kinds of sanctions does not resolve problems, it only worsens them.” “When it comes to the position of our compatriots in the countries of the Baltic, we are constantly talking about this, bringing it to the attention of the governments of the Baltic states, including Latvia… The measures that we take to protect the interests of our compatriots must be such that they do not actually worsen their situation.” “This is an important part of the negotiation process with the leaders of France, Germany, also with our Austrian friends, where I was visiting just now, and with the representatives of many other European countries, let alone Asia. They don’t just say this privately now, they are talking about this publicly.” “It appears, our partners thought that this would never affect them, this counterproductive politics of restrictions and sanctions. But now we are seeing that this is happening.” “The introduction, for example, of restrictive tariffs on steel, on aluminium, not only for Europe but also for Canada and Mexico, in essence these are also sanctions… They are related to the pragmatic national interests of the United States.” “We need to work out united and consistently understandable and concrete rules on how to behave in the realm of security and in the realm of economic interaction.” “When in 2007 I spoke in Munich, a speech that is frequently quoted nowadays… I spoke about the fact that the United States is widening the jurisdiction of its laws beyond its national borders, and that this is unacceptable. And that’s exactly what’s happening now, also to our European and other partners. Why is this happening? No one wanted to listen and no one did anything to stop this from developing.” “If as Britain insists a military chemical agent was used against these people, they would have died within second or minutes, on the spot. Thank God, this did not happen. Clearly we are dealing with something other than a military agent.” “We would like to be given access to our citizens, to Yulia, and we would like to have the opportunity to take part fully in the investigation.” “With regards to big business, I spoke about this a few years ago at one of the public meetings with our business leaders. It sounded a bit rude: I warned them that this situation, which we see today, could develop. I warned them about this and recommended at the time that our business keeps its capital in Russia, in the motherland. To keep capital in the place where it was earned and to use it to develop the Russian economy.” “Who is going to help them abroad? They are just persecuted there. Conditions are created making their work impossible. This is a big mistake by those, who are doing this in the West. All these restrictions, all this persecution of our businesses, their difficulties with dollar transactions, it damages the trust businesses from our country and others have in the economic policies of leading global economies… When the United States limits dollar transactions, this damages trust in the dollar.” “In essence, they are sawing the branch on which they are sitting. This is counterproductive and damaging for those involved and for the global economy.” “Some say we need to help Abramovich and other Russian businessmen who have ended up in a difficult situation… I wouldn’t want to speak right now about those people who have broken various laws. I am speaking about people who acquired their capital through legal means. The former and the latter are better off being in Russia.” “I hope that things will not come to provocations [during the soccer World Cup]. If this happens I think it would have very serious consequences for the Ukrainian government in general.” “We are not going to close anything, I also know perfectly well about the situation around Telegram.” “I am also… concerned. And do you know what about? About people’s safety.” “At the same time, I also worked in the security services and know it is easiest to ban, and harder to find civilised solutions. Therefore, I’m going to urge all my colleagues to take this route, the route of security and law enforcement agencies using modern methods to combat offences, including terrorism, without restricting freedoms including on the Internet.” “We need to take many steps forward, including in the quality of our satellites, in the quality of our equipment, and we must return and maintain our competence in launches, there’s a lot of competition in this.” “Overall and in general, we have big and very ambitious plans for the development of our space program. I assure you were will continue down this path. It is no accident that we spent a lot on building a new space base in the east of our country.” ON EX-SPORTS MINISTER, CURRENT DEPUTY PM VITALY MUTKO “His English obviously needs perfecting but his work as sport minister, and then deputy prime minister… A lot has been done in this area. It is enough to look at how much has been done for sports and physical culture. We should look at the facts, not the emotional aspects of his work.” “The Sochi Olympic sites… Mutko was involved in this. The World Cup stadiums, this was largely done by Mutko. I understand everything, but I do not make emotional judgements, my judgements are based on the facts.” “There is one other point: we know how he was attacked in connection with the doping scandal, and so on, and so on. In these circumstances it’s just impossible to send him into retirement. I repeat: he has a lot of potential. Let him work.” “Recently one of Germany’s famous and popular publications wrote that President Trump is pushing Europe towards Putin. If we take this together with an earlier joke, that Russia influenced elections in the United States, then this all taken together starts sounding pretty funny. We apparently influenced the election of the U.S. President, and then he gifted us Europe. Total nonsense. There’s no way to describe this other than as a joke.” “As to the retirement age, I have always treated and treat it today extremely carefully and delicately.” “One of the key tasks which I have set for the government is to increase the incomes of pensioners and increase them considerably.” (Reporting by Moscow Newsroom; writing by Polina Ivanova)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-putin-highlights/highlights-key-quotes-from-russian-president-putins-annual-phone-in-idUKL5N1T9458,07 Jun 2018,"The following are highlights from

2018-06-07,"(Adds quotes, details) JOHANNESBURG, June 7 (Reuters) - South African state power utility Eskom plans to sell foreign debt in around two months following an improvement in investor sentiment, its chief executive said on Thursday. CEO Phakamani Hadebe, who was appointed permanently to the position in May, said that whereas investors and banks were not willing to lend to Eskom last year, they were now approaching their credit committees to seek approval for lending. The struggling power firm is emerging from corporate scandals and governance issues as well as a string of interim CEO appointments stretching back to 2016. “We are seeing an increase in appetite from investors. From July last year to January we couldn’t even sell 1 billion rand ($78 million) of debt, but the situation has changed dramatically,” Hadebe said at a briefing on Eskom’s operations. “We plan a foreign issuance in around two months’ time.” He said between 15 billion rand and 20 billion rand ($1.6 billion) of foreign borrowing is expected this financial year. Eskom would reduce capital expenditure at the firm to 45 billion rand from 55 billion rand in the current financial year, he said. Hadebe has been leading efforts to stabilise Eskom, a company at the heart of corruption scandals surrounding ousted president Jacob Zuma, as interim CEO since January after an intervention by then-Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa.

2018-06-07,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China, India coal imports vs price: reut.rs/2M4dGak By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 7 (Reuters) - Coal prices in Asia are being driven to multi-year highs by a rare combination of simultaneous demand growth in the region’s top four importers. Depending on the price used, thermal coal is either close to a two-year high or near the strongest in six years as China, India, Japan and South Korea imported more of the polluting fuel in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in 2017. The Australian thermal coal benchmark, the weekly Newcastle Index, ended last week at $108.89 a tonne, not far from the $110.60 hit in late February, which was the highest price since March 2012. The daily spot price for Newcastle cargoes hit $114.50 a tonne on Monday, the highest since reaching $114.75 in November 2016, which in turn was the best since March 2012. Lower grade thermal coal from Indonesia has also been performing strongly, with 4,200 kilocalorie per kilogram coal assessed by Argus Media ending last week at $46.82 a tonne, up 14 percent since the year low in mid-April. It’s still below the peak this year of $51.04 a tonne from late February, which was the highest price since October 2011. No matter which way the numbers are sliced and diced, the message is the same, namely that coal prices are performing strongly despite the fuel becoming increasingly unpopular in many countries because of its contribution to air pollution and climate change. It’s also unusual for the top four Asian importers to be demanding more seaborne coal at the same time, as is currently the case. China imported 104.5 million tonnes of coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This was up 10.2 percent, or 10.7 million tonnes, from the same period in 2017, according to the data. India, the second-biggest coal importer after China, brought in 77.4 million tonnes in the January-May period, up 3.3 percent, or 2.5 million tonnes, from the first five months of last year. Third-ranked Japan imported 74.1 million tonnes, up 2.4 million tonnes, while the region’s number four importer, South Korea, brought in 51.7 million, a small gain of 500,000 tonnes. Put together, these four countries imported 16.1 million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year. This has had the effect of tightening the market, given the lack of new supplies to meet the demand. In fact, exports from the top three shippers to Asia have been remarkably flat in the January-May period, according to the vessel-tracking data. Australia shipped 161.8 million tonnes in the first five months, up slightly from the 160.6 million in the same period in 2017. Indonesia managed 167.7 million tonnes, up from 161.2 million, while South Africa was steady at 33.6 million. This means that the increase in import demand isn’t really being met by the traditional export powerhouses, allowing countries such as the United States and Russia to plug the gap. The United States shipped 41.7 million tonnes of coal in the first five months of 2018, with 14.7 million tonnes heading to Asia. This is up 14.9 percent from the 36.3 million tonnes it shipped in the same period in 2017, of which 12.1 million went to Asia. It’s a similar story for Russia, with total shipments up 9.8 percent, or 7.1 million tonnes, to 79.8 million tonnes, of which 33.2 million tonnes went to Asia, a gain of 11.8 percent. What the numbers show is that even though prices are high, and rising, the traditional major exporters are struggling to boost shipments. In Australia this is most likely because of an inability to boost production quickly enough, in Indonesia it’s largely because the government is mandating that more coal be supplied to the domestic market, and in South Africa there are infrastructure constraints, mainly on the rail system. The numbers also show that currently the price of coal is high enough to make U.S. cargoes competitive in Asia, despite the greater cost of freight. The bulk of U.S. coal exported to Asia is coking coal used to make steel, but with the thermal price above $100 a tonne, it’s likely that more of the power-station fuel will head east, especially to buyers in South Asia.

The selloff in safe-haven Bunds and U.S. Treasuries drove money into riskier assets, especially financial stocks, despite investor anxiety over how a G7 leaders summit that kicks off on Friday will pan out in view of divisions over global trade. Bank stocks, which tend to gain from higher bond yields, drove European shares up. The pan-European banks index jumped 0.5 percent, supporting the STOXX 600. Banks remain the worst-performing sector in Europe year-to-date, however, having been dented by political risk in Italy. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.2 percent to its highest since May 14. Wall Street was also set for a positive open with Dow Jones and S&P 500 index futures up 0.1 to 0.2 percent. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, however, was set for a dip from its record high. In Europe the single currency hit its highest level since May 15 at $1.1838, and traded up 0.4 percent at $1.1815 in its fourth straight session of gains. It helped drive the dollar index down 0.4 percent to 93.295. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield rose in step with the euro, breaching 0.50 percent for the first time in two weeks on signs that the European Central Bank could soon call an end to its stimulus programme. The selloff in German Bunds spread across the Atlantic as the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield hit a 2-1/2 week high of 2.9940 percent, edging closer to the 3 percent level it breached a month ago. The ECB’s Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made the bank increasingly confident inflation was on its way back to target, raising chances it may reveal more about the end of the bond-buying programme at next week’s meeting. Praet’s comments took the market by surprise, given a recent slowdown in the euro zone economy. Data on Thursday showed German industrial orders plunged unexpectedly in April, a fourth consecutive monthly drop. “It’s a complex backdrop where ultimately the economy is not doing badly, but the economic surprises in Europe have not been to the upside,” said Antoine Lesne, head of EMEA strategy and research at State Street’s SPDR ETF. “Bad momentum has eased the overall backdrop the ECB is navigating - but if you’re looking at the broader macro picture it is still positive for risk assets.” Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Praet’s speech showed the central bank was willing to look through the recent soft patch in euro zone data. The risk-on moves across markets coincided with a calendar of potentially destabilising political events. The run-up to the G7 summit has been dominated by a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Trump and the club’s remaining six members. But gauges of investor anxiety, including stock volatility, showed little sign of strain, flummoxing some investors. The VIX, which measures volatility on the S&P 500, was last trading at 11.79. It has fallen from more than 50 to less than 12 in just 83 days - a record decline, traders said. “I am amazed to see everyone so bullish,” said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at Societe Generale. “Everyone assumes that ...central banks will be behind the curve by default, but it’s not that obvious.” Commodities continued to climb thanks to a still strong global economy and tight supply. Copper hit its highest level this year at $7,295 per tonne, driven up as much as 0.8 percent by supply concerns over disruption at the Escondida mine in Chile. It was on track for its sixth straight day of gains, its longest run since December. Oil prices also rose as plunging exports from OPEC member Venezuela crimped supply in the market. Brent crude futures traded up 1.4 percent at $76.46 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude up 1 percent at $65.39. Gold prices edged higher, with spot gold trading at $1,298.75 per ounce, up 0.2 percent. In emerging markets, stocks climbed 0.4 percent to a three-week high, supported by the weaker dollar. UBS analysts declared “buying time” for emerging stocks, upgrading Mexico, Poland and Colombia, while downgrading Brazil. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type code LIVE/ into a news window***** Reporting by Helen Reid, editing by John Stonestreet and

2018-06-07,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria should resume its efforts to build the Belene nuclear power plant, the parliament decided on Thursday, ordering the energy minister to initiate talks with potential investors. Last month, the government asked parliament to lift a ban on developing the 2,000 megawatt (MW) project, estimated to cost 10 billion euros (£8.9 billion), that was cancelled six years ago. The MPs said Energy Minister Temenuzhka Petkova had until the end of October to present a proposal for choosing a strategic investor and on structuring and financing the project. “We have the desire, intention and political will to seek a solution to the issue, related to the Belene nuclear power plant,” Petkova told parliament. Chinese state nuclear company CNNC and Russia’s Rosatom have said they are interested in the project. Petkova has also invited France’s Framatome, majority controlled by EDF, to take part. The Balkan country cancelled the project on the Danube River in 2012, after failing to find investors and facing pressure from Washington and Brussels to limit its energy dependence on Russia, which was under contract to build the nuclear plant. Sofia had to pay more than 620 million euros to Russia’s Rosatom for scrapping the project, but also received nuclear parts for two 1,000 megawatt reactors. As a result, the country has to decide what to do with the equipment. Bulgaria says it has spent 3 billion levs ($1.8 billion) on Belene, which has a licensed site and equipment. The government has said it does not want to commit more public funds, extend state guarantees for any loan or sign any long-term electricity supply deals for the plant. Xie Jiajie, a senior official at CNNC, said at an energy conference in the Black Sea city of Varna on Wednesday that all nuclear projects had some form of state guarantees and talks had yet to be held with the Bulgarian government. Vadim Titov, director of Rosatom Central Europe, told the same forum that the Russian company was ready to start talks with the Bulgarian authorities on reviving the project. Stanislav Georgiev, a representative of Framatome for Bulgaria, said the French firm was interested in building Belene if the project was restarted, but did not want to be an investor. The Black Sea state already has two 1,000 megawatt Soviet-made nuclear reactors at its Kozloduy plant, also on the Danube River, which provide about 30 percent of the nation’s power. Dozens of Bulgarians protested outside parliament on Thursday against the government’s plans for Belene, saying the project’s benefits were not enough to justify the investment and said it had been a source of corrupt practices for decades.

2018-06-07,"LONDON, June 7 (Reuters) - The value of OPEC members’ petroleum exports rose 28 percent in 2017, according to its annual statistical report, illustrating that its return to managing the oil market by cutting supplies boosted producers’ income. Exports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries rose in value to $578.30 billion last year from $451.80 billion in 2016, according to OPEC’s Annual Statistical Bulletin 2018 issued on Thursday. The increase came in response to higher oil prices following OPEC’s decision to manage supply after maximising output in favour of defending market share between 2014 and 2016 during which the value of oil exports fell. OPEC is reducing output by about 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) as part of a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to get rid of excess supply. The deal began in January 2017 and runs until the end of 2018. The petroleum export data includes some refined fuel and light oil condensate as well as crude oil.

2018-06-07,"ALMHULT, Sweden, June 7 (Reuters) - IKEA, the world’s biggest furniture retailer, plans to use only renewable and recycled materials in its products by 2030, in the latest commitment by a global store group to reducing its impact on the environment. Inter IKEA, the owner of the brand best known for its low-cost flat-pack furniture, said on Thursday it aimed to reduce the climate impact of each of its products by more than two thirds by the end of next decade. Currently, 60 percent of the IKEA range is based on renewable materials, while nearly 10 percent contain recycled materials, an Inter IKEA spokeswoman said. “Through our size and reach we have the opportunity to inspire and enable more than one billion people to live better lives, within the limits of the planet,” Inter IKEA CEO Torbjorn Loof said in a statement to accompany the group’s 2030 sustainability strategy document. “We are committed to taking the lead, working together with everyone – from raw material suppliers all the way to our customers and partners.” Inter IKEA joins a growing list of global companies striving to make their operations more environmentally sustainable, although there are question marks over whether enough are taking action and whether they should be doing more. The world’s 250 biggest listed companies account for a third of all man-made greenhouse gas emissions, but few have concrete goals to limit rising temperatures, a Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk white paper concluded in October. Inter IKEA’s plan is the first to target all IKEA stores - the bulk of which are run by IKEA Group, but some of which are run by other franchisees - as well as the supply chain. In total, there are 418 IKEA stores across 49 markets. Retail sales in the year through August 2017 were a combined 38.3 billion euros ($45.3 billion). Inter IKEA set a so-called science-based target to cut the climate impact of stores and other operations by 80 percent in absolute terms by 2030 compared with 2016. Global brands including H&M, Coca-Cola and Sony have also committed to science-based targets, which aim to help limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius - the goal set in the 2015 Paris agreement. The Science Based Targets Initiative is a collaboration between the Carbon Disclosure Project, the World Resources Institute, the World Wide Fund for Nature, and the United Nations Global Compact. Inter IKEA also said it would remove all single-use plastic products from its range and in-store restaurants by 2020, and that IKEA Group would roll out the sale of home solar solutions to 29 markets by 2025. $1 = 0.8462 euros

2018-06-07,"TORONTO, June 7 (Reuters) - Voters in Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will elect their next provincial leader on Thursday. The following are some promises from the three major parties’ platforms: In a pre-election budget, the centrist Liberal party promised free child care for preschoolers beginning in September 2020 and a partial drug and dental plan for people without coverage through work. The party has pledged better regional transit, lower transit fares and C$11 billion ($8.5 billion) for high-speed rail from Toronto to the smaller city of London, Ontario. The province has said it expects to run deficits for six years, including a C$6.7 billion deficit in fiscal 2018-2019, because of new programs, after a modest surplus in 2017-2018. The left-leaning New Democrats have promised new province-wide drug and dental plans, public child care for C$12 per day, and public ownership for the Hydro One power utility. Andrea Horwath’s party has promised C$16 billion over 10 years to repair public schools, and government grants instead of loans for post-secondary students. The platform has promised to set and meet greenhouse gas reduction targets and continue cap-and-trade, using 25 percent of revenues to support lower-income, rural or northern households as well as “trade-exposed industries.” Doug Ford’s campaign has not released a fully budgeted platform, but the right-leaning party has promised to lower the corporate tax rate to 10.5 percent from 11.5 percent and scrap the province’s carbon cap-and-trade system. Ford has promised to cut spending by at least C$6 billion a year by finding more efficient ways of operating, but he has said he would be unable to balance Ontario’s budget in his first year. He has promised C$5 billion in new funding for Toronto subways and better regional transit service.

2018-06-07,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Nichola Groom June 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters. That’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports. The tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors. Solar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal. The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables. GTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies. Officials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment. Companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations. “There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner. The 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent. Leading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said. That amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline. Developer Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy. “Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said. Neither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later. Both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests. Other companies are having similar problems. Scott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff. Pine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said. The company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff. “It was just not feasible,” Hanes said. For some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. South Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said. Other developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020. Some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January. The company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West. Intersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels. The 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said. Trump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices. Panel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar , for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation. SunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many. But SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs. Jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said. Heliene - a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year - said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota. “The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.” Reporting by Nichola Groom

It helped drive the dollar index down 0.4 percent to 93.295. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond rose in step with the euro, breaching 0.50 percent for the first time in two weeks on signs that the European Central Bank could soon call an end to its stimulus programme. The selloff in German Bunds spread across the Atlantic as the U.S. benchmark 10-year yield hit a 2-1/2 week high of 2.9940 percent, edging closer to the 3 percent level it breached a month ago. The ECB’s Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made it increasingly confident inflation was on its way back to target, raising chances it may reveal more about the end of the bond-buying programme at its meeting next week. Praet’s comments took the market by surprise, given a recent slowdown in the euro zone economy. Data on Thursday showed German industrial orders plunged unexpectedly in April, a fourth consecutive monthly drop. “It’s a complex backdrop where ultimately the economy is not doing badly, but the economic surprises in Europe have not been to the upside,” said Antoine Lesne, head of EMEA strategy and research at State Street’s SPDR ETF. “Bad momentum has eased the overall backdrop the ECB is navigating - but if you’re looking at the broader macro picture it is still positive for risk assets.” Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Praet’s speech showed the central bank was willing to look through the recent soft patch in data. The risk-on moves across markets coincided with a calendar of potentially destabilising political events. The run-up to the G7 summit has been dominated by a widening divide over trade between U.S. President Trump and the club’s remaining six members. But gauges of investor anxiety, including stock volatility, showed little sign of strain, flummoxing some investors. The VIX, which measures volatility on the S&P 500, was last trading at 11.79. It has fallen from more than 50 to less than 12 in just 83 days - a record decline, traders said. “I am amazed to see everyone so bullish,” said Charles de Boissezon, deputy head of global asset allocation and equity strategy at Societe Generale. “Everyone assumes that ...central banks will be behind the curve by default, but it’s not that obvious.” Commodities continued to climb thanks to a still strong global economy and tight supply. Copper hit its highest level this year at $7,295 per tonne, driven up 0.8 percent by supply concerns over disruption at the Escondida mine in Chile. It was on track for its sixth straight day of gains, its longest run since December. Oil prices also rose as plunging exports from OPEC member Venezuela crimped supply in the market. Brent crude futures traded up 0.8 percent at $75.93 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude up 0.6 percent at $65.13. Gold prices edged higher, with spot gold trading at $1,298.75 per ounce, up 0.2 percent. In emerging markets, stocks climbed 0.4 percent to a three-week high, supported by the weaker dollar. UBS analysts declared “buying time” for emerging stocks, upgrading Mexico, Poland and Colombia while downgrading Brazil. *****For Reuters Live Markets blog on European and UK stock markets, type code LIVE/ into a news window***** Reporting by Helen Reid, editing by John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-euro-bond-yields-extend-gains-on-ecb-while-risk-appetite-grows-idUKL5N1T92T6,07 Jun 2018,"World stocks hit a three-week

2018-06-07,"(Adds more detail on government plans) AMSTERDAM, June 7 (Reuters) - Production at the Groningen natural gas field could be reduced to less than 12 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year by October 2020, faster than planned, the Dutch economic affairs minister said in a letter to parliament on Thursday. Output was projected to drop to below 12 bcm from its current cap of 21.6 bcm per year within four to five years under plans announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte in March aimed at ending production at Groningen by 2030 due to the damaging earthquakes it causes. But that goal is likely to be reached earlier, minister Eric Wiebes wrote, as measures to reduce demand for Groningen gas have made promising progress in recent months. Extra capacity to convert high-caloric imported gas to the low-caloric gas needed for the Dutch network and switching large industrial users off Groningen gas could cut production to less than 12 bcm by 2021, Wiebes said. Reductions in German demand and purchases of nitrogen to mix with imported gas could even see that target reached a year earlier. These measures combined could allow for a fall in Groningen production to less than 4 bcm by 2022 in an average year, or 7.5 bcm in a cold year, Wiebes said. He will present a draft plan for setting Groningen’s production cap for the year beginning in October by the end of August, he said. That plan will be based largely on the projections made in March, the minister wrote, as the extra reductions identified are mostly expected in the year starting October 2019.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.5 percent to extend its gains, hitting a 2-1/2-month high for a second straight day. Japan’s Nikkei average rose 0.9 percent. Notable gainers included technology-heavy Taiwanese stocks, with Taiwan’s main index nearing the 27-year high of 11,270 hit on January 23. The index has rallied 4.25 percent since last Wednesday, boosted by the rally in tech stocks and the Nasdaq. India’s broader NSE index rose to a three-week high, with private-sector lenders leading gains, a day after the central bank raised its policy rate for the first time in more than four years. Spreadbetters expected the firmer tone in equities to carry over into Europe, forecasting a higher open for Britain’s FTSE , Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC. “Quite clearly, it was the euro’s day,” said Marshall Gittler, chief strategist at ACLS Global. “Aside from the euro, the main theme in the market was back to risk-on.” The euro held near a two-week high while the yield on Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond hit its own two-week high of 0.486 percent on growing conviction the European Central Bank would announce as early as next week its intention to end a drawn-out stimulus programme by year-end. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a fresh 1-1/2-week peak of 2.985 percent. ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, raising the chances it may use next week’s meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying program. Praet’s comments sent the euro to $1.1796, its highest level since May 22, on Wednesday. The common currency last traded up 0.1 percent at $1.1789. The dollar index was down 0.1 percent to 93.525. Worries over the effects of reduced ECB bond buying triggered a broad sell-off in German Bunds and other European government debt, which spilled over to Treasuries, analysts said. Higher yields helped to lift S&P 500 financials, which rose 1.8 percent and were the biggest percentage gainer among S&P 500 sectors. “The U.S. 10 year Treasury yield rose alongside its eurozone peers overnight, while U.S. stocks rallied, reflecting a risk-on attitude among investors,” said Makoto Noji, senior FX/bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump would meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit this week. Although Kudlow said Trump would not back down from the tough line he has taken on trade, the comments appeared to calm investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4 percent to 25,146.39, the S&P 500 gained 0.86 percent to 2,772.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.67 percent to hit its record closing high of 7,689.24. Oil prices rose on Thursday to shake off some of the previous session’s losses, supported by plunging exports from OPEC-member Venezuela. Brent crude futures last traded at $75.84 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at 65.04, rising 0.6 percent and 0.5 percent on the day, respectively. Copper hit a five-month high of $7,278.50 per tonne, though the gains were driven more by supply concerns in Chile than by stronger demand. Market participants, wary of event risk, are monitoring developments ahead of the G7 summit later this week and the U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for next week. Reporting by Tomo Uetake

2018-06-07,"* Hot weather in China, Japan and Korea pushes up demand * Thermal coal market outperforms LNG this year, close to Brent * But analysts say coal rally could soon wane By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 7 (Reuters) - Australian thermal coal prices have hit their highest level since late 2016 as the market heats up on strong demand across North Asia and China in particular. Spot prices for delivery from Australia’s Newcastle terminal last closed at $114 per tonne, just down from Monday’s $114.50, the highest since November 2016. Coal last reached such levels back in early 2012. Newcastle is now up by almost 130 percent from the record lows seen in early 2016. With a near 11 percent increase since the end of 2017, Newcastle coal has far outperformed its main fuel competitor, liquefied natural gas LNG-AS. Coal is even close to the 13.5 percent rally in Brent crude oil prices, which has come on the back of voluntary production restraint by producer cartel OPEC, supply disruptions in Venezuela and looming new U.S. sanctions against major exporter Iran. Traders said the price rally was largely down to a surge in imports from China, as an early summer heatwave drives up electricity demand for air conditioning and industrial cooling. “Since April, the seaborne thermal coal market has seen quite the move ... with stronger Chinese demand being a key driver,” said Dutch bank ING in a note to clients, adding that this was largely down to “warmer than usual weather.” Weather data in Thomson Reuters Eikon showed that average temperatures in China’s capital Beijing are set to surge to 29 degrees Celsius in the coming days, which is 7 degrees above the seasonal norm. Hot weather is also supporting demand in other key demand regions in North Asia, including Japan and South Korea, traders said. However, commodities brokerage Marex Spectron said in a note to clients this week that some of the market tightness was likely short-term and could soon wane, as the peak of the heat wave passes. ING also said China was “set to take a step back from the seaborne market” in order to support domestic miners which could put pressure on Newcastle coal prices.

2018-06-07," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - Coal prices in Asia are being driven to multi-year highs by a rare combination of simultaneous demand growth in the region’s top four importers. Depending on the price used, thermal coal is either close to a two-year high or near the strongest in six years as China, India, Japan and South Korea imported more of the polluting fuel in the first five months of this year compared to the same period in 2017. The Australian thermal coal benchmark, the weekly Newcastle Index, ended last week at $108.89 a tonne, not far from the $110.60 hit in late February, which was the highest price since March 2012. The daily spot price for Newcastle cargoes hit $114.50 a tonne on Monday, the highest since reaching $114.75 in November 2016, which in turn was the best since March 2012. (Graphic: China, India coal imports vs price: reut.rs/2M4dGak) Lower grade thermal coal from Indonesia has also been performing strongly, with 4,200 kilocalorie per kilogram coal assessed by Argus Media ending last week at $46.82 a tonne, up 14 percent since the year low in mid-April. It’s still below the peak this year of $51.04 a tonne from late February, which was the highest price since October 2011. No matter which way the numbers are sliced and diced, the message is the same, namely that coal prices are performing strongly despite the fuel becoming increasingly unpopular in many countries because of its contribution to air pollution and climate change. It’s also unusual for the top four Asian importers to be demanding more seaborne coal at the same time, as is currently the case. China imported 104.5 million tonnes of coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This was up 10.2 percent, or 10.7 million tonnes, from the same period in 2017, according to the data. India, the second-biggest coal importer after China, brought in 77.4 million tonnes in the January-May period, up 3.3 percent, or 2.5 million tonnes, from the first five months of last year. Third-ranked Japan imported 74.1 million tonnes, up 2.4 million tonnes, while the region’s number four importer, South Korea, brought in 51.7 million, a small gain of 500,000 tonnes. Put together, these four countries imported 16.1 million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first five months of the year. This has had the effect of tightening the market, given the lack of new supplies to meet the demand. In fact, exports from the top three shippers to Asia have been remarkably flat in the January-May period, according to the vessel-tracking data. Australia shipped 161.8 million tonnes in the first five months, up slightly from the 160.6 million in the same period in 2017. Indonesia managed 167.7 million tonnes, up from 161.2 million, while South Africa was steady at 33.6 million. This means that the increase in import demand isn’t really being met by the traditional export powerhouses, allowing countries such as the United States and Russia to plug the gap. The United States shipped 41.7 million tonnes of coal in the first five months of 2018, with 14.7 million tonnes heading to Asia. This is up 14.9 percent from the 36.3 million tonnes it shipped in the same period in 2017, of which 12.1 million went to Asia. It’s a similar story for Russia, with total shipments up 9.8 percent, or 7.1 million tonnes, to 79.8 million tonnes, of which 33.2 million tonnes went to Asia, a gain of 11.8 percent. What the numbers show is that even though prices are high, and rising, the traditional major exporters are struggling to boost shipments. In Australia this is most likely because of an inability to boost production quickly enough, in Indonesia it’s largely because the government is mandating that more coal be supplied to the domestic market, and in South Africa there are infrastructure constraints, mainly on the rail system. The numbers also show that currently the price of coal is high enough to make U.S. cargoes competitive in Asia, despite the greater cost of freight. The bulk of U.S. coal exported to Asia is coking coal used to make steel, but with the thermal price above $100 a tonne, it’s likely that more of the power-station fuel will head east, especially to buyers in South Asia.

2018-06-07,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters. That’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports. The tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminium tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors. Solar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal. The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables. GTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies. Officials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment. Companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations. “There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner. The 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent. Leading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said. That amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline. Developer Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy. “Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said. Neither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later. Both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests. Other companies are having similar problems. Scott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff. Pine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said. The company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff. “It was just not feasible,” Hanes said. For some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. South Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said. Other developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020.  Some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January. The company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West. Intersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels. The 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said.  Trump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices. Panel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar, for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation. SunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many. But SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs. Jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said. Heliene - a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year - said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota. “The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”  Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/trump-effect-solar/insight-billions-in-u-s-solar-projects-shelved-after-trump-panel-tariff-idUKL2N1SL19M,07 Jun 2018,"President Donald Trump’s tariff on

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 percent to extend its gains, hitting a 2-1/2-month high for a second straight day. Japan’s Nikkei average rose 0.8 percent. Notable gainers include the technology-heavy Taiwanese stocks, with Taiwan’s main index nearing the 27-year high of 11,270 hit on January 23. The index has rallied 4.25 percent since last Wednesday, boosted by the rally in tech stocks and the Nasdaq. The euro held near a two-week high while Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond hit its own two-week high of 0.486 percent growing conviction the European Central Bank would announce as early as next week its intention to end a drawn-out stimulus programme by year-end. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield hit a fresh 1-1/2-week peak of 2.985 percent. ECB Chief Economist Peter Praet said on Wednesday that robust growth made the central bank increasingly confident that inflation is on its way back to target, raising the chances it may use next week’s meeting next week to reveal more about the end of its bond-buying program. Praet’s comments sent the euro to $1.1796, its highest level since May 22, on Wednesday. The common currency last traded up 0.1 percent at $1.1789. The dollar index was down 0.1 percent to 93.525. Worries over the effects of reduced ECB bond buying triggered a broad sell-off in German Bunds and other European government debt, which spilled over to Treasuries, analysts said. Higher yields helped to lift S&P 500 financials, which rose 1.8 percent and were the biggest percentage gainer among S&P 500 sectors. “The U.S. 10 year Treasury yield rose alongside its eurozone peers overnight, while U.S. stocks rallied, reflecting a risk-on attitude among investors,” said Makoto Noji, senior FX/bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said late on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump would meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at the G7 summit this week. Although Kudlow said Trump would not back down from the tough line he has taken on trade, the comments appeared to calm investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4 percent to 25,146.39, the S&P 500 gained 0.86 percent to 2,772.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.67 percent to hit its record closing high of 7,689.24. Oil prices rose on Thursday to shake off some of the previous session’s losses, supported by plunging exports from OPEC-member Venezuela. Brent crude futures last traded at $75.70 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at 65.01, each rising 0.5 percent on the day. Copper hit a five-month high of $7,278.50 per tonne, though the gains was driven more by supply concerns in Chile than by stronger demand. Gold prices edged higher, with spot gold last traded at $1,297 per ounce, up 0.1 percent on the day, loosely supported by a weaker dollar amid ongoing concerns about a trade war between the United States and its allies. India’s central bank raised its policy rate for the first time in more than four years on Wednesday, but surprised some economists by keeping its stance “neutral” instead of changing it to “tighten”. Market participants, wary of event risk, are monitoring developments ahead of the G7 summit later this week and the U.S.-North Korea summit scheduled for next week. Reporting by Tomo Uetake

2018-06-07,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - An ever-creeping wall of lava from Kilauea Volcano has engulfed two entire seaside housing tracts at the eastern tip of Hawaii’s Big Island, government scientists reported on Wednesday, an area where civil defence officials said nearly 280 homes once stood. The obliteration of the Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland subdivisions by a river of molten rock some 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.6 metres) tall brings to at least 400 the number of homes and other structures consumed by lava during the past month. That latest toll of property losses from Kilauea’s ongoing upheaval, which entered its 35th day on Wednesday, far surpasses the 215 structures destroyed by lava during all 35 years of the volcano’s last eruption cycle, which began in 1983. “Vacationland is gone, there’s no evidence of any properties there at all,” Wendy Stovall, a vulcanologist with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), told reporters on a conference call. At the adjacent Kapoho Beach Lots to the north. “Just a few homes” are left standing, she added. County property tax records show a total of 279 homes existed in the two subdivisions combined, according to David Mace, a Federal Emergency Management Agency spokesman currently assigned to the Hawaii County Civil Defense authority. Several miles (km) to the west, another 130 homes have been confirmed destroyed in and around the Leilani Estates community, where lava-spouting fissures in the ground first opened May 3 on the volcano’s lower flank, according to civil defence officials. Mace said property losses in the east-end developments of Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland have yet to be officially documented. The two communities, comprising a quiet vacation spot once popular for its snorkelling and tide pools, sat at the edge of a small, shallow inlet called Kapoho Bay. Lava pouring into the ocean there has completely filled in the bay, extending nearly a mile (1.6 km) out from what had been the shoreline, USGS scientists said. Plumes of white steam and hydrochloric acid fumes, a vaporous, corrosive mix formed from lava reacting with seawater as it enters the ocean, could be seen rising from a distance. Authorities began evacuating the Kapoho area last week, with most residents ushered to safety by early on Saturday, hours before lava severed all road access to the region.  “I just locked my doors and walked away,” said Betty Oberman, a 28-year Vacationland resident who headed the neighbourhood watch group there. “It’s an emotional roller coaster.” The river of lava then spread out into a towering blob about a half-mile (800 metres) wide as it crept through the flat, open expanse of the subdivisions, swallowing everything in its path over the next few days. A handful of residents who initially stayed behind rather than heed evacuation orders were airlifted by helicopter on Sunday. Most of the two dozen volcanic vents have grown largely quiet over the past week, with just one, Fissure 8, still spewing large volumes of molten rock from the ground as of Wednesday, the USGS said. That fissure is the origin of the lava flow that devastated Kapoho. Lava had covered nearly 8 square miles (20.7 sq km) of landscape as of Monday, and some 9,900 earthquakes had been recorded on the Big Island since Kilauea rumbled back to life last month. That’s nearly 10 times the monthly historic average for seismic activity on Hawaii Island, the USGS said.

2018-06-07,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Executives from oil majors were set to gather in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday to compete for stakes in Brazil’s pre-salt oil play, home to some of the world’s most alluring offshore geology, as rising oil prices boost appetite for expensive offshore projects.  A record 16 companies, including Chevron Corp (CVX.N), BP Plc (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) registered to bid for four blocks in the offshore Campos and Santos basins, part of the so-called fourth pre-salt auction on Thursday. In the pre-salt layer, billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. Brazil, South America’s top producer, has recently attracted record bids from the likes of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), also registered to compete on Thursday, as oil majors seek to replenish depleted reserves.  A rise in oil prices CLc1 LCOc1 to around $75 a barrel may entice even more interest, analysts say.     Decio Oddone, director of Brazilian oil regulator ANP, said he expected it to be the first pre-salt auction where all blocks are sold, meaning an injection of 3.2 billion reais (619.74 million pounds) into Brazil’s cash-strapped government.    “Brazil has a history of respecting contracts and the assets are appealing,” said Oddone, brushing off concerns about a possible impact on the auction from a fresh wave of government meddling in fuel prices at state-controlled oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA).  A truckers’ strike over higher diesel prices paralysed commerce in Brazil last month, prompting the government to announce measures to cut prices for the fuel. This fanned fears of more government interference at Petrobras and sent its chief executive officer packing.   Under current Brazilian rules, Petrobras will likely serve as operator and take at least a 30 percent stake in all pre-salt blocks it expresses an interest in prior to the bid round. Petrobras has raised its hand for the Dois Irmãos field in the Campos Basin and the Três Marias and Uirapuru fields in the Santos basin. Including the fourth field, Itaimbezinho, the areas up for auction make up more than 4,000 square kilometres and mandatory bonuses to the government range from 50 million reais ($13 million) to 2.65 billion reais ($696 million) per block. Other potential bidders include Spain’s Repsol SA (REP.MC), France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA), and China’s CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK). They will compete based on how much oil after cost they pledge to the government. Minimums per block range from 7 percent to 22 percent.

2018-06-07,"CARACAS/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela has released two local executives of U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) jailed since mid-April during a corruption probe in the oil sector, authorities and the company said on Wednesday. The arrests of Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez by intelligence agents at Chevron’s Puerto La Cruz offices spooked other foreign companies operating in the OPEC nation in partnership with state oil company PDVSA.  “They are free,” the state prosecutor’s office said in an email to Reuters, adding that both had been given unspecified alternative conditions to jail. Chevron said in a statement that its two employees had been released on Wednesday, adding: “Our colleagues are in good health and have been reunited with their families.”  One source close to Chevron said the two Venezuelans had to report to authorities every 15 days. The arrests were the first at a foreign oil firm since the government launched a purge last year that has resulted in the detentions of more than 80 executives at Petroleos de Venezuela SA and partners. In the aftermath, Chevron evacuated other staff. But the government of President Nicolas Maduro, condemned by the West and major Latin American nations over a May 20 re-election that critics said was a farce cementing dictatorship, has been trying to project a more benign image in recent days. It freed dozens of anti-Maduro activists over the weekend.  Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza reiterated calls on Wednesday for dialogue with the U.S. government, which has imposed sanctions aimed at squeezing the socialist government. The two Chevron employees had been facing possible treason charges for refusing to sign a parts contract for a joint venture with PDVSA, sources said. Chevron, the world’s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer, with 2017 revenue of $135 billion (£100.51 billion), operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects. The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year to $329 million, according to regulatory filings. The arrests marked an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures’ governance, sources have told Reuters. Venezuela is engulfed in a severe political crisis and economic meltdown, with oil production declining and the sector in chaos amid corruption, a brain drain and U.S. financial sanctions making shipments and transactions ever more difficult.

2018-06-07,"* PDVSA warns of force majeure as it struggles to meet obligations * Surging US crude output pulls WTI discount to Brent over $10/b By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, June 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Thursday to shake off some of the previous session’s losses, supported by plunging exports by OPEC-member Venezuela. Brent crude futures were up 33 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $75.69 a barrel at 0101 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 38 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $65.11 a barrel. It ended the previous session 1.2 percent lower at $64.73 a barrel. Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), is nearly a month behind in shipping crude to customers from its main oil export port, according to Reuters data, as chronic delays threaten to breach state-run PDVSA’s crude supply contracts if they are not quickly cleared. Tankers waiting to load more than 24 million barrels of crude, almost as much as PDVSA shipped in April, are sitting off the country’s main oil port, according to the data. The backlog is so severe, PDVSA has told some customers it may declare force majeure, allowing it to temporarily halt contracts, if they do not accept new delivery terms. “OPEC supply changes remain the biggest uncertainties in the market,” said Xi Jianrui, senior crude analyst with oil consultancy JLC said. Venezuela’s supply trouble comes amid voluntary production cuts by OPEC which have been in place since 2017 in order to tighten the market and prop up prices. The group is due to meet at its headquarters in Vienna, together with top producer but non-OPEC member Russia, on June 22 to discuss production policy. OPEC-member Iraq said on Wednesday that a production increase was not on the table as the market was stable and prices good. This comment followed an unofficial request from the United States asking OPEC’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to boost output. Outside OPEC, however, there were ongoing signs of rising output. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA hit another record last week at 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd). That’s a 28 percent gain in two years, or an average 2.3 percent growth rate per month since mid-2016. Surging U.S. production has helped widen WTI’s discount to Brent to more than $10 per barrel CL-LCO1=R. The United States is close to becoming the world’s biggest crude oil producer, edging nearer to the 11 million bpd churned out by Russia, with exports also surging. U.S. crude inventories also rose, gaining 2.1 million barrels in the week to June 1, to 436.6 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday.

2018-06-07,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday praised the job being done by Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who is under fire over ethics and spending issues. “EPA is doing really, really well,” Trump said at an event at Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters attended by Pruitt. “Somebody has to say that about you a little bit, you know that, Scott.” Trump has repeatedly expressed his support for Pruitt, who has vigorously pursued Trump’s campaign promises to reduce environmental regulations and increase fossil fuel production. But there have been mounting ethics concerns about Pruitt. The EPA chief has been criticized for paying below-market rent on a lobbyist-owned condominium, for his routine use of first-class travel, excessive spending on security and costly office renovations. More than 100 lawmakers, including several Republicans, have called for Pruitt to step down. This week, congressional Democrats released the transcript of an interview in which Millan Hupp, a close aide to Pruitt, said the administrator had her carry out personal errands, including researching the purchase of an old mattress from the Trump International Hotel. Hupp and another close aide, Sarah Greenwalt, resigned on Wednesday, the EPA said. Hupp’s resignation was first reported by The Atlantic magazine.  Pruitt in a statement called Hupp a “valued member of the EPA team from day one.” The Washington Post reported this week that Pruitt asked his EPA scheduler to arrange a meeting last year with the chief executive of the restaurant chain Chick-fil-A. Pruitt eventually spoke with the company’s legal department about his wife, Marilyn, opening a franchise, the Post reported. A representative for Chick-fil-A said Pruitt’s wife started but did not complete a franchisee application, according to the newspaper. Asked about the report, Pruitt did not directly comment on whether he sought a franchise for his wife, according to an excerpt of an interview with Nexstar Media Group posted on Twitter on Wednesday. “Chick-fil-A is a franchise of faith and it’s one of the best in the country, and so, that’s something we were very excited about, so, and we need more of them in Tulsa and we need more of them across the country,” said Pruitt, a former Oklahoma attorney general.
