The consultation, which will take place from June 11 to July 2, follows a nationwide trucker strike over diesel price hikes last month that paralyzed much of Latin America’s biggest economy. President Michel Temer agreed to cut diesel prices and change the frequency of price adjustments, wiping out a third of the market cap of state-oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA over fears of political interference.

2018-06-05,"(Repeats without change) By Dave Graham and Ana Isabel Martinez MEXICO CITY, June 5 (Reuters) - Mexican oil output could return to 2 million barrels per day by about 2022 if the next government pursues plans to auction off development blocs to private investors, Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell said on Tuesday. Mexico will elect a new president on July 1 but the front-runner in opinion polls, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has threatened to delay opening up the energy sector to private investment. He wants further oil and gas auctions to be halted if he wins. Prising open the oil and gas industry was a central pillar of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s plan to lift Mexico’s sluggish economic growth. However, that policy has been shaken by U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to dump the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The next Mexican president is scheduled to take office in December. The current Energy Minister Joaquin Coldwell told Reuters in an interview that two further auctions planned before the handover would go ahead, as would tenders for seven joint ventures known as farmouts. Joaquin Coldwell says Mexico must invest around $640 billion to arrest a longstanding slide in production and return output to 3 million barrels per day (bpd). Production, which peaked at almost 3.4 million in 2004, stood at 1.886 million bpd in April, official data show. It will probably not return to 2 million bpd for a few more years, he said. “Two million (bpd) could be in the second half of the next government if the auctions continue,” he said. “From 2022 approximately. And three million (bpd) by 2040.” Mexican presidential terms last six years. The auctions stem from 2013-14 changes to Mexico’s energy laws and began in mid-2015. However, they have yet to translate into higher crude oil output in Latin America’s no. 2 economy. Joaquin Coldwell said oil exploration and production was a long-term process and companies that had already made discoveries could add around 35,000 to 50,000 bpd to output by the second half of next year. Lopez Obrador says the contracts awarded under the opening should be revised to ensure there was no corruption involved and that all further auctions should be halted in the meantime. Several of Lopez Obrador’s economic advisers have said they expect the process to continue after the revisions, though he has floated the idea of unpicking the reform. Minister Joaquin Coldwell said the process of auctions had been the most transparent in the history of Mexico.

2018-06-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Nasdaq hit a record closing high for the second day in a row on Tuesday, helped by tech and consumer discretionary shares, while the euro recovered after Italy’s new prime minister said the government had never considered leaving the euro zone. Shares of Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Netflix (NFLX.O) all rose. Upbeat economic data also helped the S&P 500 eke out a small gain. But gains in equities were limited by worries about trade discussions. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said President Donald Trump may seek separate talks with Canada and Mexico in a bid to get individual trade deals with the two countries. Mexico responded to Trump’s metals tariffs by imposing its own duties on American steel, while also targeting agricultural products from pork to bourbon. Trump’s administration imposed tariffs of 25 percent on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum in March, citing national security grounds.  The market “continues to focus on one of two big issues - where we’re headed with the trade negotiations - NAFTA, China and tariffs with Europe. That’s probably the biggest concern for investors. But, on the positive side, (are) the economy’s strength and earnings’ strength,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. The U.S. services sector activity accelerated in May, pointing to robust economic growth in the second quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 13.71 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,799.98, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 1.93 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,748.8 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 31.40 points, or 0.41 percent, to 7,637.86. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.13 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.32 percent. Comments by Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte caused the dollar to fall and reverse gains to a near six-month high, as the euro recovered. The euro rose 0.1 percent against the dollar to $1.1712 EUR=. The dollar index .DXY, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.15 percent.  The Mexican peso MXN= gained 0.10 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 20.43. The Canadian dollar CAD=D4 rose 0.01 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar. Earlier, the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar fell against the dollar as the latest developments in the growing trade conflict between the United States and its neighbors prompted selling in the currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders piled back into lower-risk government debt, however, after Conte vowed to enact economic policies that could add to the nation’s debt load.

2018-06-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Brent crude reversed losses on Tuesday, after hitting its lowest price in nearly a month following a report the U.S. government asked Saudi Arabia and other major exporters to increase oil output. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 9 cents to settle at $75.38 a barrel, a 0.12 percent gain. It touched a low of $73.81, its lowest since May 8. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 77 cents to settle at $65.52 a barrel, a 1.2 percent gain. Earlier, WTI hit a session low of $64.22, the lowest since April 10.  The premium for Brent to WTI hit a session low of $9.38, recovering slightly from last week when the spread reached $11.57, the widest since March 2015. That divergence was “overcooked,” prompting profit-taking, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. The U.S. government has unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to raise oil output, three OPEC and industry sources said, although it has not requested a specific figure. Earlier on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported the U.S. government had asked the producers to increase oil production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd). OPEC supply tends to more directly influence Brent, whereas U.S. crude futures are more closely tied to U.S. supply.  The request comes after U.S. retail gasoline prices surged to the highest in more than three years and President Donald Trump in April complained about OPEC policy and rising oil prices. The national average on Tuesday was $2.94 a regular gallon, according to AAA. It also follows Washington’s decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran’s crude exports, which could disrupt global oil supply. Iran’s crude oil output could fall 1 million bpd as a result of renewed U.S. sanctions, according to a note from Standard Chartered. “Markets are forward-looking. The fact that Russia, Saudi Arabia and OPEC more broadly have started discussing raising output levels, you’ve got this pretty swift correction,” said Tyler Richey, co-editor of the Sevens Report in Jupiter, Florida.  Saudi Arabia and Russia were already discussing raising OPEC and non-OPEC oil output by around 1 million bpd, sources familiar with the matter said on May 25. Saudi Aramco has raised its July price for its Arab Light grade for Asian customers by 20 cents a barrel versus June to a premium of $2.10 a barrel to the Oman/Dubai average, it said on Tuesday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets in Vienna on June 22 to decide whether the group and non-OPEC producers, including Russia, should raise output to make up for any supply shortfall from Iran and Venezuela.  U.S. crude inventories fell by 2 million barrels in the week to June 1 to 432.8 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said on Tuesday, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 1.8 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 1 million barrels, API said.

The so-called FAANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon , Apple, Netflix and Alphabet - rose. The S&P technology index gained 0.4 percent, while the Nasdaq hit a record intraday high. Wall Street was on track for a third straight day of gains. “We’ve had a few strong days in the aftermath of the jobs report where the market focused on economic fundamentals more than the negative forces such as tariffs and trade,” said Liz Ann Sonders, the New York- based chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab Corp. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 12.51 points, or 0.05 percent, to 24,801.18, the S&P 500 gained 1.63 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,748.5 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.81 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,632.27. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.15 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.32 percent. Earlier, equity indexes dipped after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said President Donald Trump may seek separate talks with Canada and Mexico in a bid to get individual trade deals with the two countries. Mexico said it will impose tariffs of 15 percent to 25 percent on U.S. steel products and on some agricultural goods from pork to potatoes, in retaliation against Trump’s own metals tariffs. The latest development in a growing trade conflict between the United States and its neighbors prompted selling. The Mexican peso and Canadian dollar saw their biggest losses against the U.S. dollar. The Mexican peso lost 1.52 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 20.38. The Canadian dollar fell 0.39 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.1 percent, reversing gains to nearly a six-moth high with the euro up 0.09 percent to $1.1708. U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders piled back into lower-risk debt after the comments by Italy’s new prime minister. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.9131 percent, from 2.937 percent late on Monday. There was some selling of Italian government bonds after their rebound of the last few days, as traders digested the first comments from new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Conte confirmed much of the coalition’s budget-busting agenda. The 10-year Italian yield jumped 18 basis points to 2.736 percent after hitting a one-week low of 2.509 percent on Monday.

2018-06-05,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - The United States government has unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to raise oil output, but it has not requested a specific figure, three OPEC and industry sources said on Tuesday. The U.S. request to raise output has been made unofficially from Washington to each of the oil producers rather than to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries as a group, the sources said.  Earlier on Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. government had asked Saudi Arabia and some other OPEC producers to increase oil production by about 1 million barrels per day (bpd). U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on May 8, the day that President Donald Trump announced Washington would  “withdraw” from the Iran nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions on Tehran, that some countries were willing to increase oil output to offset losses to the global market. A spokeswoman at the White House’s National Security Council, asked about requests for more oil output, said: “We welcome any market-based action that increases energy access and fosters a healthy global economy.” OPEC is in the midst of a supply-cutting deal with Russia and other non-members. With oil recently reaching $80 a barrel, the highest level since 2014, producers are discussing easing some of the cutbacks and will meet to set policy later in June.  “Any decision has to be a collective decision and taken after debate. Now the most important thing for OPEC is to keep this group together,” an OPEC source said. “Even if the U.S. has asked for 1 million, does it mean that OPEC and its allies would raise by 1 million?” the source said.  Reuters reported on May 25 that the producers were considering a supply increase of 1 million bpd, with a final decision to be made at the June 22-23 meeting in Vienna of OPEC and non-OPEC ministers.

2018-06-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States warned governments and the private sector on Tuesday to crack down on what it described as Iranian efforts to exploit them to fund its support for terrorism, destabilizing actions in the region and rights abuses at home. The appeal, in a speech by the senior U.S. Treasury official for terrorism and financial intelligence, follows U.S. President Donald Trump’s May 8 decision to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic.  “You must harden your financial networks, require your companies to do extra due diligence to keep them from being caught in Iran’s deceptive web, and make clear the very significant risks of doing business with companies and persons there,” Under Secretary of the Treasury Sigal Mandelker said. “Companies doing business in Iran face substantial risks, and those risks are even greater as we reimpose nuclear-related sanctions,” she added. “We will hold those doing prohibited business in Iran to account.” The U.S. decision to leave the pact, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions, has antagonized its other parties: Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia. With U.S. sanctions returning between now and Nov. 4, it is not clear how enthusiastic U.S. allies or other nations such as China may be to comply with those sanctions, particularly those requiring foreign firms to reduce their imports of Iranian oil. The weight of the U.S. financial system and the reality of companies having to choose between selling to Iran or to the vast U.S. market, is likely to force many private firms to comply. “To those in the private sector, I urge you to also take additional steps to ensure Iran and its proxies are not exploiting your companies to support their nefarious activities,” Mandelker said. “You have to do more to make sure your compliance programs are airtight.” “The Iranian regime will deceive your companies, undermine the integrity of your financial systems, put your institutions at risk of our powerful sanctions, all to fund terrorism, human rights abuses and terrorist groups,” Mandelker added. She repeated U.S. threats to increase financial pressure unless Iran ceases actions such as supporting proxy forces hostile to the United States in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen. “Our powerful economic authorities will give the regime a clear choice: Change its unacceptable support for terrorism, destabilizing activities and human rights abuses, or face economic calamity,” Mandelker said.

The major has recouped all outstanding payments owed for previous investments in Iran’s upstream and has only an oil supply contract outstanding for the purchase of 2 million barrels of oil per month, the spokesman said. “The contract... will expire by the end of the year,” he said in emailed comments. The United States has threatened to impose secondary sanctions on European companies doing business with Iran after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. The European Union, once Iran’s biggest oil importer, is looking for ways to save the nuclear accord and safeguard investments made by European companies. But the risk of running foul of sanctions and losing access to the U.S. financial system has caused many companies to reassess their plans. In May, French oil major Total announced it might pull out of its investment in Iran’s South Pars gas field if it cannot secure a waiver from the US government. Eni said that evaluations it had carried out so far in regard to its limited activities in Iran did not point to any need to request specific waivers. In any event such activities would only be carried out to the extent sanctions allow them, the spokesman said. Reporting by Stephen Jewkes

2018-06-05,"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with his trade advisers on Tuesday to discuss an offer by China to import an extra $70 billion (£52.2 billion) of American goods over a year as Beijing tries to defuse a potential trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Two sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters there have been no discussions on what Washington would have to do in return. They said the Chinese offer included increased imports of agricultural and energy commodities as well as some manufactured goods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross met with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He at the weekend and a statement issued after the talks made no mention of specific offer or numbers. It was not clear whether Washington would accept the offer and whether it would be enough to avert a trade war. Trump was briefed on the offer and discussions were underway on how to proceed, one of the sources said. Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity. China has complained that it should not have to negotiate measures to reduce its $375 billion goods trade surplus with America under the threat of tariffs on up to $150 billion of its exports to the U.S as part of a separate dispute over intellectual property (IP) protections. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had said the IP tariffs were on hold after China signalled its willingness to reduce its trade surplus with the United States.  The administration has said that a final list of goods to be tariffed would be issued next week and that Treasury plans to limit Chinese investment in the United States were also under way. Ross’s talks in China were focused solely on increasing exports, one of the sources said. Structural issues like joint venture rules, market access and policies that result in technology transfers were not covered.

Alyeska Pipeline Service Co, the consortium that operates the 800-mile oil line that delivers oil from the North Slope to Alyeska’s marine terminal in Valdez, said the three planned shutdowns will allow for a series of maintenance tasks. The shutdowns are expected to last between 12 and 18 hours; the final planned shutdown of the season is scheduled for July 6. Alyeska routinely conducts major maintenance work during the summer, and system shutdowns allow for several tasks to be accomplished at the same time. “Planned major maintenance plays a critical role in sustaining (the pipeline) for decades to come,” Alyeska President Tom Barrett said in a statement. Alyeska is owned by oil companies operating on the North Slope. Pipeline throughput has averaged 543,703 barrels per day in 2018, according to Alyeska’s website.

2018-06-05,"* Stocks mostly ease, though Nasdaq hits a record high * Copper rises amid wage talks at world’s largest mine * Trade discussions a worry for investors (Updates to noon trading in U.S. markets; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Stocks on world indexes edged lower and the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar fell on Tuesday amid concerns over a trade war, even as U.S. technology shares extended recent gains to boost the Nasdaq index. The so-called FAANG stocks — Facebook, Amazon , Apple, Netflix and Alphabet - rose. The S&P technology index gained 0.2 percent, while MSCI’s global tech index < .dMIWO0IT00PUS> hit a record peak. Still, investors were wary about trade discussions and equity index futures pared gains after White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said President Donald Trump may seek separate talks with Canada and Mexico in a bid to get individual trade deals with the two countries. Mexico said it will impose tariffs of 15 percent to 25 percent on U.S. steel products and on some agricultural goods from pork to potatoes, in retaliation against Trump’s own metals tariffs. “The market is a little bit on edge when it comes to trade talks,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.95 points, or 0.28 percent, to 24,743.74, the S&P 500 lost 3.74 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,743.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.04 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,609.50. The Nasdaq earlier hit an intraday record. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.15 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.32 percent. The latest development in a growing trade conflict between the U.S. and its commercial partners prompted selling, and the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar saw their biggest losses against the U.S. dollar. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.12 percent to $1.1712. The Mexican peso lost 1.45 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 20.37. The Canadian dollar fell 0.56 percent versus the greenback at 1.30 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields fell as traders piled back into lower-risk government debt after Italy’s new prime minister vowed to enact economic policies that could expand the nation’s already heavy debt load. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.9095 percent, from 2.937 percent late on Monday. There was some selling of Italian government bonds after their rebound of the last few days, as traders digested the first comments from new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Conte confirmed much of the coalition’s budget-busting agenda. The 10-year Italian yield jumped 18 basis points to 2.736 percent after hitting a one-week low of 2.509 percent on Monday. Copper hit a six-week high as concerns about the potential supply impact of wage negotiations at the world’s biggest copper mine helped push prices back above $7,000 a tonne. Copper rose 2.01 percent to $7,115.00 a tonne. Oil was mixed. U.S. crude rose 0.09 percent to $64.81 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.69, down 0.8 percent on the day.

2018-06-05,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has named six new heads of departments including its finance unit after a government reshuffle last week saw several executives at the oil giant moving to other state posts, the company and industry sources said on Tuesday. Khalid al-Dabbagh was named acting service line head for finance, strategy and development at the world’s largest oil producer, taking over on an interim basis from Abdallah al-Saadan, who was senior vice president of the department, the sources who are familiar with the matter told Reuters. In his post, Saadan was effectively chief financial officer of Aramco, overseeing preparations for its initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to take place in 2019 and could be the world’s biggest. Aramco also appointed Motassim al-Maashouq, who is vice president of IPO development, to the additional post of vice president of treasury, the sources said. Aramco confirmed all the new appointments.   In the government reshuffle announced on Saturday under royal orders from King Salman, Saadan was named chairman of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, a government body formed to manage and oversee the development of those two cities. Saudi Arabia also named a prominent businessman as labor minister and new deputies to the Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Ministry. The Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources Ministry, under Khalid al-Falih, who is already chairman of Aramco, oversees oil and gas extraction, power generation and distribution, mining and industrial development. The appointments of deputies for Falih is a long awaited move meant to lessen the load on the minister who juggles a host of responsibilities from steering the kingdom’s oil and OPEC policies to managing development of local industries. “The Ministry of Energy has a huge portfolio with many challenging growth and development objectives and Falih needs deputies he knows can deliver results,” said Sadad al-Husseini, an energy consultant and former senior executive with Saudi Aramco. The Aramco appointments also include Mohammed Shammary, who becomes vice president for procurement and supply chain management, replacing Abdulaziz al-Abdulkarim, the sources said.  Abdulkarim was appointed on Saturday to the post of deputy energy minister for industry affairs. Nabeel al-Jama’ was named vice president for corporate affairs, replacing Nasser al-Nafisi, who was appointed to the position of assistant energy minister, while Nabil al-Dabal now heads the human resources department, the sources said.

2018-06-05,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - Six men wielding machetes have killed at least seven people and injured four others in northern Mozambique near an area where Islamist attacks have been reported, police said on Tuesday. The attack in Macomia, in Cabo Delgado province, on Monday came after at least 10 people were beheaded in a village near the northern town of Palma late last month. Mozambican media have reported a spate of attacks by Islamists since October, when police stations were attacked in the north, a predominantly Muslim region which lies near one of the world’s biggest untapped offshore gas fields. Mozambique has not been a focal point for Islamist militant activity in the past, and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists. Police spokesman Inacio Dina told Reuters that authorities were pursuing the men suspected of committing the latest attack to “neutralise them”.  Some residents of Macomia fled their homes following the violence, he added.

2018-06-05,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European countries are pushing back against any weakening of the rules underpinning a landmark global agreement to cap airline emissions at 2020 levels, especially those related to the types of aviation biofuels that can be used. France, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands have written to the U.N. aviation agency, which brokered the 2016 deal, to say they would have to reconsider their support should the compromise be weakened. This related particularly to criteria for the sustainability of alternative fuels and the carbon credits used to offset CO2 emissions, according to documents seen by Reuters. Countries at the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) are seeking to agree on rules that will govern how the overall deal, known as the Carbon Offset and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), will be implemented. They meet next week to try to find a compromise. “If some countries were to call into question certain aspects of the compromise, notably with regards to the emissions units and the sustainability of alternative fuels, the support given by France to this version of the text would be compromised,” France wrote in a letter to ICAO. Aviation biofuels, now produced in small volumes from renewable sources, are expected to play an important role in delivering the goal of carbon-neutral growth in airline CO2 emissions from 2020. But objections from several developing countries meant that the criteria for sustainable biofuels were provisionally scaled down to two from 12 originally. The two remaining criteria ensure aviation biofuels are not produced on land from razed forests or wetlands, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 percent compared with conventional jet fuel. But the Netherlands said in its letter that those criteria were “not sufficient to ensure environmental integrity and sustainability of aviation alternative fuels.” A source familiar with the matter said he does not believe the European countries would abandon CORSIA and relinquish their “voice at the table.” He said some developing countries were concerned that if the standards were too strict it would prevent them from building their own biojet fuel industries on agricultural land. “If you say that biofuel can’t displace crops then you have to go into the forest, but you can’t go into the forest,” said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity because the talks are confidential. “So where do I grow? In the sea?” In addition the six countries are pushing for strict rules on the carbon credits that airlines will have to purchase from environmental projects to offset their emissions. “The programs and projects should represent real, additional, permanent and verified reductions of greenhouse gases that are accounted for only once toward any climate mitigation or voluntary action,” Norway wrote in its letter to ICAO, adding that eligible projects should only be those that start after the end of 2019. The airline industry has supported a single global deal over a patchwork of regional measures, like the EU’s Emissions Trading System, and in February called on governments to approve the rules that will govern how CORSIA is implemented.

2018-06-05,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Car sales growth in Western Europe will be tempered this year by political uncertainty surrounding Italy and a new emissions test cycle which is leading to higher readings of carbon dioxide pollution (CO2), forecasters LMC Automotive said.  LMC has lowered its full-year forecast for 2018 sales growth in Western Europe to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent last month, LMC’s European analyst David Oakley said on Tuesday. Several carmakers including Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) have said they face challenges adapting their vehicle fleets to meet a new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP), which is based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios. [nB4N0ZH05A][nFWN1S40LJ] Because the new WLTP regime gives higher CO2 readings than the old NEDC system, it will force some carmakers to delay road certification and sales or push vehicles into a higher tax bracket. “The elephant in the room at the moment is the response of national governments – and manufacturers – to the new WLTP emissions and fuel economy testing procedure, which has the potential to cause significant tax increases in countries which have taxation regimes based on CO2 emissions,” Oakley explained. Western Europe sales in May were flat when compared to the same month a year ago, which LMC Automotive said was a good result given that there were fewer selling days than in the year-earlier month. Sales in Italy, which was rocked by political turmoil last month, fell 2.8 percent in May. Based on the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate (SAAR), demand improved to 14.8 million cars a year, up from 14.4 million vehicles in April, despite weak demand in Britain, which is down 6.8 percent year-to-date, LMC said.

2018-06-05,"(Reuters) - Conservative billionaire industrialist David Koch is retiring from his roles at Koch Industries and associated companies due to poor health, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. David Koch, 78, along with his elder brother Charles, have been a force in American politics since the 1980s. Their influence has largely been powered by a fortune centered on Koch Industries, the second-largest privately held company in the United States, whose operations range from refining and chemicals to ranching and forest products. The brothers are known to spend heavily on conservative initiatives and to oppose government intervention in business. David, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer almost two decades ago, is the executive vice president at Koch Industries. The brothers have donated several millions to doctors and researchers working toward a cancer cure. “David has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way,” Charles Koch wrote in the memo dated June 4. The company said no decision had been made on David Kochs’ replacement. David will also step down from his role as chairman for Americans for Prosperity, a grassroots conservative group that is a part of the Koch network, the memo said. The news comes a day after the brothers said they will launch a multimillion-dollar campaign to oppose President Donald Trump’s tariffs, and to champion free trade. The Kochs, who have channeled billions of dollars into conservative causes, kept their distance from Trump during the 2016 presidential election. Charles Koch spoke out against Trump’s proposed Muslim registry. The brothers also strongly support legislation that seeks to protect “Dreamers” - people brought illegally to the United States as children - from deportation. However, the Kochs found common ground with the new Republican president on issues including rolling back federal regulations and pulling out of the Paris global climate accord, after the election. Koch Industries was founded by Fred Koch in 1940, and was then called ‘Wood River Oil and Refining Company’. Charles Koch, Fred’s first born, joined the company in 1961, and in 1967, renamed the company Koch Industries Inc to honor his father.

2018-06-05,"OSLO (Reuters) - Sweden’s plans to renew its power grid in the densely populated southwest region may disrupt supplies that run through the area to neighboring states, operator Svenska Kraftnat (SVK) said. Some 400 kms (250 miles) of electricity lines will be gradually replaced in the next decade, in an area through which Swedish power and supplies from Norway, with its abundant and cheap hyrdropower, flow to Denmark, Germany and other countries. SVK did not give details of the extent of any disruption to its interconnections, as the upgrade was still in the planning phase. But it said the risk of unscheduled interruptions or blackouts would rise if the work was not carried out. “In 2018, the oldest parts of the transmission grid’s 400 kV power lines will approach an age of 70 years and parts of the 220 kV grid are even older... so old that it is no longer enough to maintain them,” SVK said in a statement to Reuters. Replacing the grid along Sweden’s west coast would cost roughly 3 billion Swedish crowns ($342 million) and would require decommissioning of some local lines that are used as international interconnectors, it said. “The existing power line needs to be out of commission for periods while the new one is being built,” it said. Upgrading the grid is only part of the renovation taking place between 2018 and 2027, SVK said, adding that further components in the national network would also be renewed. About 30 substations, 15 control facilities and 10 reactors and transformers are due for renewal, Svenska Kraftnat said, adding that nearly 500 high-voltage devices would be replaced. “If the power lines are not replaced before they get too old, the risk of interruptions increases and so does the risk of blackouts,” SVK said in a statement. Power line replacements will not cause risk to the electricity supply of the energy-hungry data centers of the region, it added.

2018-06-05,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s finance minister announced plans on Tuesday to  report to the anti-graft agency upfront payments of billions of ringgit the previous administration made to a Chinese firm for two pipeline projects that have barely begun. Since taking office two weeks ago, Lim Guan Eng has been driving a campaign to expose financial scandals in the administration of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, unseated in a stunning election defeat last month. Lim said Najib’s government had paid 8.25 billion ringgit (£1.4 billion) or 88 percent of the total value of two pipeline projects awarded to China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau (CCPB), although they are less than 15 percent complete. “We have discovered that the payment schedules for the above contracts are based almost entirely on timeline milestones, and not on progressive work completion milestones,” Lim said in a statement. In November 2016, CCPB won the contracts to build a 600-km (373-mile) petroleum pipeline along the west coast of peninsular Malaysia, and the 662-km (411-mile) Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline in eastern Sabah state. Lim said the contracts were negotiated directly by Najib’s office, and the former prime minister had ignored red flags raised by the attorney-general’s office on both deals. In March 2017, the finance ministry raised 85 percent of the project funding from China EXIM Bank through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Suria Strategic Energy Resources (SSER). The rest was raised by issuing sukuk, or sharia-compliant bonds. “Both the China EXIM Bank borrowings and the sukuk are secured with federal government guarantees,” Lim added. In a statement posted on his Facebook page, Najib said the negotiations and execution of the two projects complied with the necessary procedures and laws. The ex-premier said he welcomed an inquiry into the projects, but cautioned Lim against making “serious, politically motivated public allegations” that could negatively affect Malaysia’s foreign relations and international trade. Telephone calls from Reuters to CCPB’s office numbers listed on its website were not answered. Lim said he had ordered a report filed with the anti-graft agency, and the ministry would consider seeking China’s help to decide if moneylaundering figured in either deal. Najib and his family were dogged during the last three years of his near-decade-long rule by a scandal over billions of dollars allegedly siphoned from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and it became a key reason for his May 9 election defeat. 1MDB is also the subject of money-laundering investigations in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. Najib has denied any wrongdoing.  Last week, Lim said Malaysia would have to pay debts of about 50 billion ringgit racked up by 1MDB.

MSCI’s global tech index scored the milestone as the FAANGs — Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google — looked set to drive the technology-heavy Nasdaq to fresh highs when New York reopens shortly. The upbeat mood had raised Asia’s big BATTS — Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Taiwan Semiconductor, Samsung — with Alibaba notching a new high and Baidu surging 5 percent in its best day in more than a month. Europe got in on the act too as tech stocks there jumped more than 2 percent in a third day of gains that took them to their highest since the dot-com boom of 2001. “The market is being pushed up by just a few huge companies,” said Jerome Schupp, equity analyst at Prime Partners in Lausanne. “All big names from Apple to Amazon and Microsoft are able to make huge buybacks and acquisitions, and the internal growth of most of these companies is pretty in line with expectations.” Moves in other markets were modest or centered around growing nervousness about global trade tensions. The dollar, the euro and yen largely cancelled each other out, but the dollar made 1.7 percent on Mexico’s peso and 0.4 percent on Canada’s dollar as hopes for a new NAFTA deal looked to be falling apart. Instead, U.S. President Donald Trump is considering separate talks with the United States’ two neighbours, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday. “His preference now, and he asked me to convey this, is to actually negotiate with Mexico and Canada separately,” Kudlow said. “He may be moving quickly towards these bilateral discussions instead of as a whole.” Mexico also said it will impose tariffs of 15 percent to 25 percent on U.S. steel products and on some agricultural goods from pork to potatoes, in retaliation against U.S. President Donald Trump’s own metals tariffs. There was some selling of Italian government bonds again too after their rebound of the last few days and as traders digested the first comments from new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. “The truth is that we have created a radical change and we’re proud of it,” Conte told the Senate, where he is expected to win a confidence vote later in the day. The coalition, made up of the 5-Star Movement and the League, has about a 10-vote majority in the Senate and a wider margin in the lower house, which is due to hold its own confidence vote on Wednesday. Market participants will also be keeping an eye on a speech by ECB President Mario Draghi later for any indication of how the political developments in southern Europe may affect monetary policy. Other euro zone government bond yields were 1-2 basis points lower, as a measure of calm returned to the market. Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the bloc, saw its yield drop 1.5 bps to 0.40 percent, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield edged back to 2.91 percent after brushing 2.95 percent overnight. Spain also saw a change of government last week, with socialist Pedro Sanchez replacing conservative Mariano Rajoy. Investors assessed the likelihood of another election there as low, which kept a lid on volatility. For U.S. markets there was a flurry of manufacturing and services PMI data due between 1445 and 1500 GMT as well as more hints from Donald Trump that he will meet North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un in just over a week’s time. Asia’s moves overnight saw Japan’s Nikkei gain 0.2 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climb 0.15 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rise 0.25 percent after data showed China’s services sector expanding at a steady pace. The Australian dollar declined 0.15 percent to $0.7636 after climbing to a six-week high of $0.7666 overnight on upbeat domestic data. In commodities, oil prices went sideways after falling nearly 2 percent in the previous session on growing U.S. production and expectations of higher OPEC supplies. Brent crude futures dipped 15 cents to $75.13 while U.S. crude futures were up 19 cents at $64.95 a barrel after finishing the previous session down 1.6 percent. Industrial metals like copper, and zinc and aluminium were all 0.6-1.4 percent higher though safe-haven spot gold was little changed at $1,291.54 an ounce after posting three days of losses. Copper’s rise lifted it to its highest in six weeks and came as wage talks at the world’s biggest mine - BHP’s, Escondida mine in Chile - rumbled on. Last year, a failure to reach a labour deal at the mine led to a 44-day strike that jolted the global copper market. “Union leaders at the Escondida copper operation sent their most ambitious wage proposal to owners BHP Billiton, raising the possibility of strike action later this year,” analysts at ANZ bank said in a note.

2018-06-05,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) * Israel, Lebanon in stand-off over maritime border * Room for “cautious optimism” to end dispute, minister says * Both countries planning new offshore exploration * Israel to modify new licences to attract bidders By Ari Rabinovitch JERUSALEM, June 5 (Reuters) - New ideas proposed in U.S. back-channel mediation of an Israeli-Lebanese maritime dispute over oil and gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean raise the prospect of a partial deal this year, Israel’s energy minister said. Israel kicked off a gas bonanza in the eastern Mediterranean almost a decade ago with the discovery of two huge gas fields. Others were found in Egypt and Cyprus, and companies are now exploring Lebanese waters as well. One of the Lebanese blocks being explored, Block 9, borders Israel’s maritime zone and contains waters claimed by both countries. The disputed border also touches two other not-yet-licensed Lebanese blocks. This has led to years of brinkmanship with officials on both sides promising to protect their resources and warning about encroachment. “There are some new ideas on the table. More than that I cannot discuss,” Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, said in a Reuters interview. He oversees energy exploration in Israel and is the pointman in indirect negotiations with Lebanon. David Satterfield, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern Affairs, has shuttled between the countries in recent months as a mediator. Steinitz said that President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace negotiator Jason Greenblatt has also been involved. “There is room for cautious optimism. But not beyond cautious,” Steinitz said. “I hope that in the coming months, or by the end of the year, we will manage to reach a solution or at least a partial solution to the dispute.” But he added: “Nothing has been settled yet.” Even a partial agreement would be a major diplomatic achievement, as well as timely, since both Lebanon and Israel are planning new rounds of tenders for offshore exploration. A spokeswoman for Lebanon’s Energy and Water Minister Cesar Abi Khalil declined to comment on the negotiations between Lebanon and Israel or the specific points raised by Steinitz. Israel recently warned energy companies in Lebanon not to drill close to its border, and the consortium set to explore Block 9 - made up of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek - has said it would stay away from the disputed area. Steinitz also said he expected Israel to begin a new round of tenders for offshore blocks sometime between September and November. The new offshore exploration licences will be modified to make them more attractive to energy groups, after a previous auction got a tepid response, Steinitz said. Israel launched a bidding round in November 2016 after a number of the fields were found in Israeli waters. It accepted the only two bids it received - from Greece’s Energean and a consortium of Indian firms including ONGC Videsh , Bharat PetroResources, Indian Oil Corp and Oil India. Steinitz said there were lessons to be learned. “We will change the method in a way that it will be more accessible and attractive,” he said, without elaborating. “Additionally, I think there were two developments that will make the exploration more attractive.” He said companies were put off by concerns that they might not find a buyer for gas they discovered since Israel has a gas surplus and export options at the time were limited. But he said that had changed referring to the opening of two markets over the past year. Progress has been made in plans for an Israeli-European subsea gas pipeline and a $15 billion export deal to Egypt was signed.

2018-06-05,"(Adds Gazprom comment) KIEV, June 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz said on Tuesday a Dutch court had approved its petition to freeze Dutch assets of Gazprom to enforce an arbitration ruling that Naftogaz should receive $2.6 billion from the Russian company. That ruling, made by the Stockholm arbitration court in February, was meant to conclude a legal battle over gas deliveries. But Naftogaz says Gazprom has not complied with the ruling, which obliged the Russian company to resume gas supplies to Ukraine at market equivalent prices and pay $2.6 billion. Gazprom said on Tuesday it had received no official notification of a move to freeze its Dutch assets. “At the current time, no official notification from anyone in the framework of this process has been received by Gazprom,” the company said in a statement, adding it was aware Naftogaz was taking measures to enforce the ruling. Naftogaz said last month it would go to court to seize Gazprom assets in Europe, but would not touch Russian gas transit through Ukraine. Last week, the Ukrainian firm said it had also asked Swiss courts to enforce the arbitration award and Swiss authorities have taken measures against Gazprom’s assets too. The legal battle has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. Gazprom appealed against the Stockholm ruling in April, and the case is ongoing. Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe, where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the gas market.

2018-06-05,"KUALA LUMPUR, June 5 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s finance minister on Tuesday announced plans to  report to the anti-graft agency upfront payments of billions of ringgit the previous administration made to a Chinese firm for two pipeline projects that have barely begun. Since taking office two weeks ago, Lim Guan Eng has been driving a campaign to expose financial scandals in the administration of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, unseated in a stunning election defeat last month. Lim said Najib’s government had paid 8.25 billion ringgit ($2 billion) or 88 percent of the total value of two pipeline projects awarded to China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau (CCPB), although they are less than 15 percent complete. “We have discovered that the payment schedules for the above contracts are based almost entirely on timeline milestones, and not on progressive work completion milestones,” Lim said in a statement. In November 2016, CCPB won the contracts to build a 600-km (373-mile) petroleum pipeline along the west coast of peninsular Malaysia, and the 662-km (411-mile) Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline in eastern Sabah state. Lim said the contracts were negotiated directly by Najib’s office, and the former prime minister had ignored red flags raised by the attorney-general’s office on both deals. In March 2017, the finance ministry raised 85 percent of the project funding from China EXIM Bank through a wholly-owned subsidiary, Suria Strategic Energy Resources (SSER). The rest was raised by issuing sukuk, or sharia-compliant bonds. “Both the China EXIM Bank borrowings and the sukuk are secured with federal government guarantees,” Lim added. Telephone calls from Reuters to CCPB’s office numbers listed on its website were not answered. An aide to Najib could not respond immediately to a request for comment over text. Lim said he had ordered a report filed with the anti-graft agency, and the ministry would consider seeking China’s help to decide if moneylaundering figured in either deal. Najib and his family had been dogged during the last three years of his near-decade-long rule by a scandal over billions of dollars allegedly siphoned from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and a key reason for his May 9 election defeat. 1MDB is also the subject of money-laundering probes in at least six countries, including the United States, Switzerland and Singapore. Najib has denied any wrongdoing. Last week, Lim said Malaysia would have to pay debts of about 50 billion ringgit racked up by 1MDB.

2018-06-05,"(Repeats Monday story with no changes to text) By Alexandra Alper and Marta Nogueira RIO DE JANEIRO, June 4 (Reuters) - Growing Brazilian government meddling in Petrobras that prompted its former chief executive Pedro Parente to quit last week now looms over his successor as he seeks to crack on with reforms at the world’s most indebted oil company. After a trucker’s strike over rising diesel prices paralyzed Latin America’s largest economy, the government reacted by imposing fuel subsidies, worrying investors who saw it as a sign of new, unwelcome interference in state-run Petrobras. Parente resigned in protest, and former chief financial officer Ivan Monteiro was installed in his place on Friday, providing some comfort to jittery markets which hope he will press on with Parente’s market-friendly program. Shares in Petrobras - formally called Petroleo Brasileiro SA - rose more than 8 percent on Monday, helped by the decision to name Monteiro CEO as well as by some bargain-hunting after the shares lost about a fifth of their value. However, it is unlikely that 57-year-old former bank executive Monteiro will be able to escape government pressure, analysts said in the days following his appointment. Monteiro may want to turn Petrobras into a streamlined profit machine - but outgoing President Michel Temer and other politicians are scrambling to appease angry voters ahead of presidential polls in October. “Ivan Monteiro will be under serious political pressure because of the elections,” said Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “Candidates who are against asset sales, for example, will push hard against any major Petrobras decision on divestments.” Petrobras was not immediately available to comment. A spokesman for the president’s office said that the government would not meddle in pricing. Temer effectively ended the truckers’ protest after he promised to cut diesel prices by about 12 percent for 60 days through a mix of tax cuts and subsidies to Petrobras. The government also agreed to restrict price changes at the pump, reimbursing Petrobras for related losses. In another sign of a heavier government hand, the Mining and Energy Ministry said on Friday it was seeking a mechanism to “protect the consumer from the volatility of fuel prices at the pump.” But details have been scarce as to how Petrobras will be compensated and investors are wary of further meddling, especially steps that could extend beyond diesel to gasoline. The diesel subsidy plan and Parente’s exit “have all raised questions and increased the risk perception of political interference,” analysts at Brazilian bank Itau said in a client note. A wide-open election will add further pressure on the government to keep voters happy. Leftist candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video: “It is not enough for Parente to go, it is necessary to demand that the pricing policy that he imposed be changed.” Parente had insisted as a condition of taking the debt-laden and scandal-tarnished company’s helm in 2016 that he control how Petrobras priced fuel. Monteiro, seen by oil companies and investors as an avid supporter of changes sought by Parente, is not expected to get the same carte-blanche from the government as his predecessor, as the political mood in Brasilia has shifted. “Future reforms are going to be met with a jaundiced eye,” said Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar. More than just potential losses from fuel pricing are at stake. Petrobras is hoping to sell majority stakes in four refineries, but possible investors are already spooked by the prospect of competing with a company that is forced to sell fuel below cost, sources told Reuters last month. An aggressive two-year divestment target of $21 billion by the end of 2018, part of a bid to cut debt, could also be in play. But a round of bidding for oil blocks in Brazil’s choice offshore basins on Thursday is not expected to be affected, say oil majors, who will likely partner with Petrobras to win some of the blocks. And some see potential benefits from Parente’s exit, including the possibility of a quicker conclusion to a drawn-out dispute with the government over the value of the offshore transfer-of-rights area, where Petrobras paid top dollar to produce 5 billion barrels of oil. Oil majors are watching the negotiations closely, because a resolution could unlock an auction of nearby areas, considered to be some of the finest geology in Brazil’s pre-salt play. “I would guess the transfer-of-rights will be resolved because Ivan is more compliant than Pedro Parente,” said John Forman, former chief of oil regulator ANP. “He will yield more easily.” (Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle, Editing by Christian Plumb and Rosalba O’Brien)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/petrobras-succession-politics/rpt-analysis-deeper-brazil-government-meddling-looms-over-new-petrobras-ceo-idUKL2N1T61WG,05 Jun 2018,"Growing Brazilian

Europe got in on the act too as tech stocks there jumped more than 1 percent in a third day of gains that took them to their highest since the dot-com boom of 2001. “The market is being pushed up by just a few huge companies,” said Jerome Schupp, equity analyst at Prime Partners in Lausanne. “All big names from Apple to Amazon and Microsoft are able to make huge buybacks and acquisitions, and the internal growth of most of these companies is pretty in line with expectations.” Moves in other markets were modest or centred around growing nervousness about global trade tensions. The dollar, the euro and yen largely cancelled each other out, but the dollar made 0.6 percent on Mexico’s peso after Mexico said it would impose a 20 percent tariff on U.S. pork imports in retaliation for U.S. levies on steel and aluminium. There was some selling of Italian government bonds again too after their rebound of the last few days and as traders waited for the country’s senate to hold a confidence vote later on Giuseppe Conte’s appointment as prime minister. Market participants will also be keeping an eye on a speech by ECB President Mario Draghi for any indication of how the political developments in southern Europe may affect monetary policy. Other euro zone government bond yields were 1-2 basis points lower, as a measure of calm returned to the market. Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the bloc, saw its yield drop 1.5 bps to 0.40 percent, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield stood near the 11-day high of 2.946 percent brushed overnight. Spain also saw a change of government last week, with socialist Pedro Sanchez replacing conservative Mariano Rajoy. Investors assessed the likelihood of another election there as low, which kept a lid on volatility. Asia’s moves overnight saw Japan’s Nikkei gain 0.2 percent, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng climb 0.15 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index rise 0.25 percent after data showed China’s services sector expanding at a steady pace. The Australian dollar declined 0.15 percent to $0.7636 after climbing to a six-week high of $0.7666 overnight on upbeat domestic data. In commodities, oil prices went sideways after falling nearly 2 percent in the previous session on growing U.S. production and expectations of higher OPEC supplies. Brent crude futures dipped 15 cents to $75.13 while U.S. crude futures were up 19 cents at $64.95 a barrel after finishing the previous session down 1.6 percent. Industrial metals like copper, and zinc and aluminium were all 0.6-1.4 percent higher though safe-haven spot gold was little changed at $1,291.54 an ounce after posting three days of losses. Copper’s rise lifted it to its highest in six weeks and came as wage talks at the world’s biggest mine - BHP’s, Escondida mine in Chile - rumbled on. Last year, a failure to reach a labour deal at the mine led to a 44-day strike that jolted the global copper market. “Union leaders at the Escondida copper operation sent their most ambitious wage proposal to owners BHP Billiton, raising the possibility of strike action later this year,” analysts at ANZ bank said in a note.

2018-06-05,"DUBAI, June 5 (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco has named at least five new heads of departments including its finance unit after a government reshuffle last week saw several executives at the oil giant moving to other state posts, industry sources familiar with the matter said. Khalid al-Dabbagh was named acting service line head for finance, strategy and development at the world’s largest oil producer, taking over on an interim basis from Abdallah al-Saadan, who was senior vice president of the department, the sources told Reuters. In his post, Saadan was effectively chief financial officer of Aramco, overseeing preparations for its initial public offering (IPO), which is expected to take place in 2019 and be the world’s biggest. Aramco also appointed Motassim al-Maashouq, who is vice president of IPO development, to the additional post of vice president of treasury, the sources said. Aramco declined to comment on the new appointments. In the government reshuffle announced on Saturday under royal orders from King Salman, Saadan was named chairman of the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, a government body formed to manage and oversee the development of those two cities. Saudi Arabia also named a prominent businessman as labour minister and several new deputies to the Energy, Industry and Minerals Ministry. The Aramco appointments also include Mohammed Shammary, who becomes vice president for procurement and supply chain management, replacing Abdulaziz al-Abdulkarim, the sources said. Abdulkarim was appointed on Saturday to the post of deputy energy minister for industry affairs. Nabeel al-Jama’ was named vice president for corporate affairs, replacing Nasser al-Nafisi, who was appointed to the position of assistant energy minister, while Nabil al-Dabal now heads the human resources department, the sources said.

2018-06-05,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Air traffic control strikes are more of a threat to European airlines this year than a rise in fuel prices, the chief executive of British Airways-owner IAG (ICAG.L) said on Tuesday.  Global airlines have slashed their forecast for industry profits in 2018 due to a spike in fuel costs, but in Europe, there is an additional threat to profits from the cost of flight cancellations associated with air traffic control (ATC) strikes.  “From a European context, the thing most impacting is ATC strikes and the ongoing ATC environment which is a mess,” IAG CEO Willie Walsh told the CAPA-Center for aviation summit in Sydney.  “It’s destroying traffic through Europe.”  European airline industry body A4E has estimated the economic cost of ATC strikes in the European Union was 13.4 billion euros (11.76 billion pounds) between 2010 and 2017. Ryanair (RYA.I), a rival European airline, said earlier on Tuesday that ATC strikes and shortages caused it to cancel 1,100 flights in May compared with 43 in the same month last year. “It’s really a significant issue. We thought it would get better in 2018 but it’s getting worse,” Walsh said. France has been a particular problem area for airlines, where public sector workers have staged a series of protests over the government’s economic reforms. IAG’S airlines, which also include Iberia, Aer Lingus and Vueling, are having to spend more on fuel to travel via alternative routes to bypass French airspace, Walsh said.  “We end up paying compensation to customers. It’s completely outside our control,” he added, saying millions of passengers were affected and it cost airlines tens of millions of pounds. Walsh said that because IAG was hedged for this year, he wasn’t as concerned about fuel prices for 2018, but the higher prices would be a challenge for 2019.  “It’s much higher than we expected it to be,” he said.  The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said rising fuel costs will hurt industry profits, cutting forecasts by 12 percent. IATA expects an average oil price of $70 a barrel this year, up from $54.90 last year and its previous prediction of $60.

2018-06-05,"BEIJING, June 5 (Reuters) - Some industrial plants in China are facing limited power access or rationing due to a supply crunch as more than 30 cities in central and northern parts of the country issue heat alerts. The cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, warned that temperatures could reach more than 35 Celsius (95 Fahrenheit), according to the China Meteorological Administration. At least three cities - Shanghai, Hefei in Anhui province and Nanning in Guangxi province - have issued power usage plans to tackle possible tight supplies during peak periods, asking companies that are big consumers to stagger and reduce electricity use. Non-residential consumers will be asked to turn off landscape lighting and cap electricity use for air conditioners during hours when electrical supply is squeezed. Big industrial firms could also be ordered to cut power use by 12 percent or more in some emergency cases, according to the plans. “The city will stagger electricity consumption among some industrial users as Guangdong province saw a big electricity supply crunch in recent hot days,” said the Shenzhen division of grid operator China Southern Power Grid Co Ltd in two statements last week. Shenzhen saw its highest temperatures reaching more than 37C on Thursday and Friday. High coal prices have also stirred concerns over fuel shortages at coal-fired power plants despite Beijing’s efforts to cool the red-hot market. The most-traded thermal coal futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange reached a peak of 640.4 yuan ($99.90) a tonne on Friday, much higher than the “safe zone” for coal prices set by the state planner at less than 570 yuan. As of 1:50 p.m. (0550 GMT), Tianjin city had lifted its heat alert to red, the highest level of a three-colour system, as the city expects maximum temperature could rise beyond 40C later on Tuesday, according to the China Meteorological Administration. $1 = 6.4065 Chinese yuan

2018-06-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain may invest directly in a new nuclear power plant it wants built in northern Wales, the country’s business minister said, as it battles to find a cost-effective way to keep its nuclear ambitions alive.  The plant, to be built by a unit of Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T), would join Hinkley Point C in southwest England as part of a new generation of nuclear stations that London says it needs to replace ageing reactors and polluting coal plants. However, private investors have proved reluctant to take on the huge costs of new nuclear plants, and the government has come under fire for agreeing to pay a price for electricity from Hinkley Point C that is way above rival power projects.  “For this project, the government will be considering direct investment alongside Hitachi and the Japanese government agencies and other partners,” Greg Clark told parliament on Monday. He said negotiations with Hitachi would now begin and a key focus will be on achieving a lower cost for consumers. Hitachi’s Horizon Nuclear Power plans to construct at least 5.4 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity at two sites in Britain – the first at Wylfa Newydd in Wales. Clark said the move to consider direct investment in Wylfa came after government auditors recommended new financing models following the deal with France’s EDF (EDF.PA) to build Hinkley Point C.  Criticism of that deal has increased as the costs for other sources of power, such as wind, have come down.  Britain’s latest auction for offshore wind subsidies, held last year, awarded contracts as low as 57.50 pounds per megawatt hour (MWh) compared with the Hinkley Point C deal of 92.5 pounds per MWh. According to some estimates, Hinkley Point C could cost 30 billion pounds. Japanese reports have put the cost of Wylfa as high as 3 trillion yen ($27 billion). On Tuesday, Horizon said it had submitted hundreds of documents to Britain’s Planning Inspectorate, seeking a so-called Development Consent Order, which is required to begin construction of nationally significant infrastructure projects. It had also applied for other licences and permissions and expects the process to be completed by the end of next year, Horizon spokesman Ben Russell said. “We’ve always been clear that the financing and funding discussions are another important part of the jigsaw and we got that yesterday ... We think there’s a lot of momentum behind the project,” he added.

2018-06-05,"LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - British new car registrations rose for the second month in a row in May, recording an annual 3.4 percent increase as growing demand from individual consumers offset a decline from business buyers, according to data from a car industry body. Sales in Europe’s second-largest autos market had fallen for a year due to buyers shunning diesel over fears of possible new taxes and weaker consumer confidence in the wake of the Brexit vote, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) has said. But after an increase in April, demand rose to 192,649 units in May, boosted by a 10 percent increase among private buyers after a sharp fall in the same month last year. “May’s growth, albeit on the back of large declines last year, is encouraging and suggests the market is now starting to return to a more natural running rate,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes.

2018-06-05,"KIEV, June 5 (Reuters) - Ukraine’s state-owned Naftogaz said on Tuesday a Dutch court had approved its petition to freeze Dutch assets of Gazprom to enforce an arbitration ruling that Naftogaz should receive $2.6 billion from the Russian company. That ruling, made by the Stockholm arbitration court in February, was meant to conclude a legal battle over gas deliveries. But Naftogaz says Gazprom has not complied with the ruling, which obliged the Russian company to resume gas supplies to Ukraine at market equivalent prices and pay $2.6 billion. Naftogaz said last month it would go to court to seize Gazprom assets in Europe, but would not touch Russian gas transit through Ukraine. Last week, the Ukrainian firm said it had also asked Swiss courts to enforce the arbitration award and Swiss authorities have taken measures against Gazprom’s assets too. The legal battle has run alongside Ukraine’s broader political stand-off with Russia. Gazprom appealed against the Stockholm ruling in April, and the case is ongoing. Ukraine is a major transit country for Russian gas supplies to Europe, where Gazprom accounts for around 35 percent of the gas market.

2018-06-05,"June 5 (Reuters) - China’s BYD  is looking at launching battery production in Europe, the latest Asian battery maker aiming to make inroads in Europe as Brussels seek to build a home-grown industry to fuel a surge in electric car production. Europe has only one operating factory producing battery cells for electric cars - a plant in Britain that produces batteries for Nissan vehicles such as the LEAF. Below are details of plans to establish electric vehicle (EV) battery plants in Europe: NORTHVOLT northvolt.com The Swedish company, headed by a former Tesla executive, aims to build Europe’s biggest lithium-ion battery factory, producing 32 gigawatt hours (GWh) of battery cells a year by 2023, rivalling Tesla’s U.S. “gigafactory”. It has partnered with Siemens, ABB and Volkswagen-owned truckmaker Scania to build the 4 billion euro ($4.7 billion)plant while the European Investment Bank has provided financial support. TERRAE www.terrae.com The German-based consortium of 17 companies and research institutions plans to build two foundries, where lithium-ion battery cells are custom produced to customers’ specifications. The two factories aim to have a capacity of 34 GWh by 2028. BYD en.byd.com Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD is also one of the world’s biggest battery producers with the lowest production costs in the industry, according to Bernstein Research. BYD is considering cell production in Europe, an executive told Reuters, adding it was not clear where it might be located. BYD has a growing business making electric buses and is also involved in monorails, solar farms, and energy storage. The company has two production sites for electric buses in Europe, in Hungary and France. The company, backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, warned in March that Chinese subsidy cuts for new-energy vehicles could slash its quarterly profit by as much as 90 percent. CATL www.catlbattery.com/en China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) , one of the biggest EV battery producers, said in November it was planning a $2 billion initial public offering to boost its lithium-ion battery output six-fold to 50 GWh capacity by 2020. In January last year, CATL bought a 22 percent stake in Finnish auto supplier Valmet Automotive and has said it plans to build a factory in Europe, but has not announced details. Volkswagen and Daimler have said they plan to buy batteries from CATL. LG CHEM www.lgchem.com/global/main South Korea’s LG Chem plans to produce 100,000 EV batteries per year at a Polish factory due to be completed this year. LG Chem supplies batteries to Volkswagen, General Motors and Renault SA. SAMSUNG SDI www.samsungsdi.com South Korea’s Samsung SDI Co plans to open a factory near Budapest this year which would be able to produce batteries for 50,000 electric vehicles a year. Samsung SDI, an affiliate of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , also produces rechargeable batteries for electronic devices such as smartphones and energy storage systems. Samsung SDI, which already has a plant in Austria assembling battery packs, has supplied batteries to Volkswagen and BMW. SK INNOVATION eng.skinnovation.com/main.asp South Korea’s SK Innovation plans to break ground this year on a battery plant in Hungary and launch production from 2020, producing 7.5 GWh of batteries per year. Customers would include Daimler, it said. SK Innovation started as Korea Oil Corporation and owns South Korea’s largest crude oil refiner. It also has divisions for chemicals, lubricants, batteries and electronic materials. GSR CAPITAL www.gsrcapital.com/en Last year, Chinese investment firm GSR Capital bought Nissan Motor Co’s electric vehicle battery business - Automotive Energy Supply Corp - including battery plants in Japan, the U.S. state of Tennessee and England. The UK plant produces 2 GWh of lithium ion batteries per year for Nissan electric vehicles. In February, GSR signed a $4.5 billion joint venture deal with Turkey’s Zorlu Holding to build a factory that would launch production in 2023 for batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage systems. GSR said in March it would invest $500 million in Swedish electric car maker National Electric Vehicle Sweden (NEVS) and planned to start production of EV batteries at NEVS. GSR Capital Chairman Sonny Wu told Reuters the Swedish plant may launch output in mid- to late-2019 and GSR was also looking at elsewhere in Europe for additional battery factories. GS YUASA www.gs-yuasa.com/en Japanese battery maker GS Yuasa Corp said in January it would set up a factory in Hungary that would assemble lithium ion batteries and would consider producing cells on the site in the future. Last year, the Nikkei business daily reported the company would begin mass-producing a new lithium-ion battery that would double the range of electric cars as early as 2020. LISHEN en.lishen.com.cn Chinese battery maker Tianjin Lishen plans to open a sales office in Germany, its first in Europe, and has held talks with Volkswagen and Daimler, a source at the company said in April. Lishen’s biggest shareholder is China Electronic Technology Group (CETC), a state-owned firm managed by the central government, according to its website. SAFT www.saftbatteries.com France’s Saft, owned by energy company Total produces a range of batteries, including for back-up power and industrial applications, but not for electric vehicles. In February, it created an alliance with Siemans, Solvay and Manz to develop a new generation of batteries. The group will focus on advanced high-density lithium-ion and solid-state technology, targeting the market for electric vehicles, railway, marine sectors, among others. CONTINENTAL www.continental-automotive.com German auto parts and tyre maker Continental AG formed a joint venture in March with China’s CITC Ltd to produce so-called “mild” hybrid batteries in China.

2018-06-05,"LONDON/FRANKFURT/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD (1211.HK) is looking at launching battery production in Europe, joining Asian rivals aiming to cash in on a green car revolution and threatening attempts by Brussels to nurture a home-grown industry. Keen to capture a European car battery value chain that will be worth an estimated 250 billion euros (219.48 billion pounds) by 2025, the European Commission launched an alliance of local companies last year aiming to build 10-20 huge battery factories. But only Sweden’s Northvolt and Germany’s TerraE have plans for large lithium-ion battery factories in Europe so far and some leading European carmakers have already struck deals with Asian suppliers setting up in Hungary and Poland. “We are considering cell production outside of China and that includes Europe,” Julia Chen, Global Sales Director at BYD Batteries, told Reuters, speaking about the production of both automotive and home storage batteries. BYD 002594.SZ, which also makes electric buses, cars and solar panels, said it was not clear where in Europe a battery site might be. “It would be possible wherever there’s a market.” The company, which is backed by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), joins Korea’s SK Innovation (096770.KS), Japan’s GS Yuasa Corp (6674.T) and China’s Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) (300750.SZ) in looking to locate battery plants in Europe. South Korea’s LG Chem (051910.KS), Samsung SDI (006400.KS) both have European factories due to open soon while China’s GSR Capital already produces battery cells at a UK plant it bought from Nissan (7201.T). While Asian electric vehicle (EV) cell battery factories in Europe would bring jobs, Brussels is concerned companies in the bloc are missing out on a growth industry and risk becoming dependent on foreign technology. “We have to move fast because here we are in a global race. We need to prevent technological dependence on competitors,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic said at the launch of the European Battery Alliance’s action plan in May. But some investors say they are wary of backing European EV battery suppliers after seeing local solar panel firms founder in the face of cheap Chinese imports over the past decade. European battery companies would need billions in EU support to rival Asian firms that have received similar state subsidies and Brussels may be better off promoting next-generation solid-state EV batteries instead, investors say. “I don’t believe anyone in Europe can be competitive with the Asians,” said Gerard Reid, founder of Alexa Capital, which advises firms in the energy, technology and power infrastructure sectors. (For a graphic showing European EV battery supply and demand: tmsnrt.rs/2JnDSOX) Electric and hybrid vehicles are expected to account for 30 percent of the global auto market by 2030, according to metal consultants CRU www.crugroup.com, up from 4 percent of the 86 million vehicles sold last year. Global automakers plan to invest at least $90 billion in electric cars and batteries, the most expensive component in the vehicles, to finance hundreds of new models over the next five years. For now, carmakers in Europe have been importing batteries from Asia, but as production ramps up that will become less viable. Setting up production in Europe would cut shipping costs by a quarter, consultancy P3 Group www.p3-group.com/en estimates. But some carmakers are not waiting for a European industry, instead signing contracts with Asian firms coming to the region. German’s BMW (BMWG.DE) said it was not involved in the European alliance while Europe’s biggest automaker, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), said it plans to get batteries from LG Chem’s Polish factory due to open this year. Mercedes maker Daimler (DAIGn.DE) has awarded a contract to CATL. The European Commission’s plan calls for 110 million euros in battery related research, help for projects from a 2.7 billion euro EU innovation fund and the development of an EU “green battery” trademark. Supporters of the initiative argue Europe can carve out a niche by selling green batteries produced with renewable energy and ethically sourced raw materials. Northvolt, which has held talks with European automakers, aims to launch its $5 billion gigafactory in late 2020 and produce 32 gigawatt hours of battery capacity each year by 2023. But investors have been cautious about pouring money into new European battery ventures. Northvolt’s first financing round, intended to raise 80 million euros to 100 million euros to help set up a test factory, took slightly longer than expected, a spokesman said. In the end, the bulk of the financing was provided by the Swedish Energy Agency www.energimyndigheten.se/en and the European Investment Bank www.eib.org, which provided a loan of up to 52.5 million euros.     Much of the profit from the battery value chain is generated by producers of raw materials, such as cobalt and lithium, and those who assemble cells into complex systems, experts say. “There’s been a bit of imbalance in that value chain and that’s one of the reasons you see a limited amount of players in Europe,” said Northvolt founder and Chief Executive Peter Carlsson. “But we think that the model that we’re applying is changing this.” Carlsson, who used to work for U.S. electric car pioneer Tesla (TSLA.O), says Northvolt can make a profit through economies of scale, by using cheap hydropower and controlling the processing of raw materials. But Northvolt and TerraE will probably need about $2 billion each in government funding to build their gigafactories - given the state support provided for similar projects in Asia and the United States, said Asad Farid, an associate director at private bank Berenberg www.berenberg.de/en who specialises in battery technology. Four months after the European alliance launch the world’s biggest automotive supplier, Germany’s Robert Bosch [ROBG.UL] abandoned plans to make battery cells, saying it was too risky. SOLID-STATE SOLUTION? Investors are wary because of their experience with solar panel manufacturers as well as rapid advances in technology that are slashing the price of battery packs, which consultants Arthur D Little www.adlittle.com puts at $190-250 per kilowatt hour now. ""In battery manufacturing ... it's very much about scale. So the established producers in Korea, China and Japan have clear advantages over new entrants,"" said Simon Webber, lead portfolio manager on the global & international equities team at Schroders www.schroders.com. Tim Crockford, who manages Hermes Investment Management's  Impact Opportunities Fund here, said he was more interested in European firms researching cathode technology, areas with major barriers to entry in terms of research and development. “The attraction of the industry decreases as you move further down the value chain. Things like battery manufacturers and the battery pack assemblers, it’s much more fragmented market with lower barriers to entry,” said Crockford. While Hermes has avoided companies mass-producing EV cell batteries it has taken stakes in a lithium producer and a company that makes materials for battery cathodes, he said. The lithium-ion batteries used now are also likely to be overtaken in a matter of years by so-called solid-state technology that is expected to produce even cheaper batteries with higher energy density. ""The development cycle and the speed of technology progress in batteries is so huge at the moment, there's an opportunity for new and additional players to enter,"" said Timo Moeller, head of the McKinsey Center for Future Mobility here in Cologne. Developers in Europe believe that gives the region an opportunity to catch up.

2018-06-05,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - The president of Emirates airline said the rare combination of higher oil and a stronger dollar, which usually move in opposite directions, represented a “double whammy” in terms of their impact on costs but that passenger demand remained strong. “We have very strong summer bookings at higher prices,” Tim Clark told reporters at an airlines summit in Sydney, adding Emirates was monitoring those trends for any sign higher ticket prices were hurting demand. Global airlines body IATA on Monday downgraded its profit forecast for the industry, citing higher oil and labour costs, but also said yields, a proxy for air fares, were expected to rise 3.2 percent this year. IATA has cautioned that rising fares as airlines seek to make up for higher costs could temper growth in demand.  Clark, however, said he had not seen any sign of this yet and that the airline had managed to raise prices for the summer without hurting bookings. “The velocity of growth (in bookings) exceeds what we had seen last year,” he added. Some analysts warn that price-sensitive passengers who upped their spending when fares were down amid lower oil prices, would quickly evaporate when prices moved higher. “If airlines have to start putting prices up you can actually see a very quick fall in that growth rate,” said analyst Peter Harbison, chairman of CAPA-Centre for Aviation. To combat higher oil prices, airlines are locking in fuel hedges, lowering capacity, raising fares and retiring older jets, industry executives at the annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association said. Clark also said Emirates’ U.S. business had returned to growth after being hit by curbs on carrying large electronic devices in passenger jet cabins last year.  However, Emirates said it had no current plans to expand the so-called “fifth freedom” flights to the United States, services which have irked some U.S. airlines critical of the Dubai-based airline’s growth.  “Fifth freedom” flights are ones where an airline from one country operates between two different countries. For example, Emirates operates two such flights between Milan and New York and between Athens and Newark. The United States last month agreed a deal with the United Arab Emirates and in January with Qatar to resolve claims from the three largest U.S. carriers that Gulf airlines had received unfair government subsidies. UAE, as Qatar did in January, told the United States that the two UAE airlines have no current plans to add additional fifth freedom flights.  Some in the United States have suggested the deal stops the Gulf carriers from adding fifth freedom flights, but Clark said the agreement does not rule out such flights.   “Fifth Freedom” routes are not central to Emirates’ business,” he added. Clark downplayed talk of a global pilot shortage, saying  availability was back to normal.  As for aircraft availability, Boeing is on schedule to deliver the first upgraded 777X in June 2020, he said.  The world’s largest twin-engined passenger jet, which features folding wingtips to allow it to park in existing airport stands, has been hit by engine snags but Boeing has reorganised testing to try to keep it on track. Clark also said he expected to make a decision soon on engines for the carrier’s latest order of Airbus (AIR.PA) A380 superjumbos. The planes are due for delivery from 2020.  The General Electric (GE.N) and Pratt & Whitney (UTX.N) Engine Alliance venture powers most Emirates A380s, but it lost out to competitor Rolls-Royce (RR.L) on the latest deliveries.   Clark said the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines on its A380s has shown good performance on maintenance since being introduced to the Emirates fleet 14-15 months ago.  However, Emirates has delayed some A380 deliveries to allow Rolls-Royce to fix a fan blade problem. Emirates, which recently announced the launch of premium economy services in a challenge to rivals, plans to install up to 56 of the seats on the double-decker A380s using a bespoke seat design to be sub-contracted out to seat makers, Clark said.

2018-06-05,"PAHOA, Hawaii (Reuters) - A river of lava spewing from the foot of Hawaii’s Kilauea Volcano swallowed about three dozen more homes on the Big Island during a weekend of destruction that brought to nearly 120 the number of dwellings devoured since last month, officials said on Monday. Mounting property losses were reported a day after five or six people who initially chose to stay in the newly evacuated Kapoho area after road access was cut off were rescued by helicopter, according to the Hawaii County Civil Defense agency. All but a few of the estimated 500 inhabitants of Kapoho and adjacent Vacationland development are now believed to have fled their homes, an agency spokesman said. The area lies near the site of a seaside village buried in lava from a 1960 eruption. The latest damage came from a large lava flow that crept several miles (km) before severing a key highway junction at Kapoho on Saturday and then obliterating about a half dozen blocks of the subdivision over the weekend, the spokesman said. One finger of the lava poured into a small freshwater lake, boiling away all its water late on Saturday, while another finger spilled into Kapoho Bay on Sunday night, officials said. On Monday, civil defense reported a total of 117 homes and other structures destroyed across the island’s larger lava-stricken region, as the eruption from Kilauea, one of the world’s most active volcanoes, continued through its 33rd day. About three dozen of those structures, mostly private homes and vacation rentals, were lost during the weekend in Kapoho. The rest were consumed weeks earlier in the larger Leilani Estates subdivision several miles (km) to the west, where lava-spouting fissures in the ground first opened on May 3. About 2,000 residents have been displaced from Leilani since earlier this month as fountains of lava and high concentrations of toxic sulfur dioxide gas continued unabated. A mandatory evacuation of much the subdivision was imposed last week. Plumes of volcanic ash belched into the air by periodic daily explosions from the crater at Kilauea’s summit have posed an additional nuisance and a health concern to nearby communities. So too have airborne volcanic glass fibers, called “Pele’s hair,” wispy strands carried aloft by the wind from lava fountains and named for the volcano goddess of Hawaiian myth. Seaside residents and boaters also have been warned to avoid noxious clouds of laze — a term combining the words “lava” and “haze” — formed when lava reacts with seawater to form a mix of acid fumes, steam and glass-like specks. Lava flows have knocked out telephone and power lines, causing widespread communication outages, and forced the shutdown of a geothermal energy plant that normally provides about a quarter of the island’s electricity. At the same time, most of the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, one of the island’s biggest tourist attractions, remains closed indefinitely due to hazards from ash and volcanic rock ejected from the summit crater, and accompanying earthquakes that have damaged park facilities. Kilauea’s current upheaval comes on the heels of an eruption cycle that began in 1983 and had continued nearly nonstop for 35 years, destroying more than 200 homes. Scientists say they are unsure whether the latest activity is part of the same eruption phase or a new one, and how long it may last.

2018-06-05,"OSLO (Reuters) - Less than a 10th of all the plastic ever made has been recycled, and governments should consider banning or taxing single-use bags or food containers to stem a tide of pollution, a U.N. report said on Tuesday, U.N. World Environment Day. The study, billed as the most comprehensive review of government action to curb single-use plastics, said up to 5 trillion plastic bags were used worldwide each year. Spread out side-by-side, they would cover an area twice the size of France. “The scourge of plastic has reached every corner of the Earth,” Erik Solheim, head of U.N. Environment, wrote in the report, compiled with the Indian government and launched along with a slogan: “If you can’t reuse it, refuse it.”  “Only 9 percent of the 9 billion tonnes of plastic the world has ever produced has been recycled,” the report said. “Most ends up in landfills, dumps or in the environment.” China is the biggest source of plastic packaging waste, ahead of the European Union and the United States. Per capita, however, the United States produces most, ahead of Japan and the EU. But there are signs of action to limit plastic pollution, which harms life in the oceans, contaminates soils and releases toxic chemicals when burnt. “Targeted levies and bans - where properly planned and enforced - have been among the most effective strategies to limit overuse of disposable plastic products,” the report said. Elisa Tonda, who leads U.N. Environment’s Sustainable Lifestyle program, said more than 60 countries had bans or charges on single-use plastics such as bags or polystyrene containers. Thirty percent of countries found sharp drops in plastic bag consumption in the first year after imposing restrictions, while 20 percent saw little or no change. But in half the cases, governments failed to gauge the effects of restrictions, the report said. Among its recommendations, the report called for better sorting of waste and recycling, economic incentives to promote eco-friendly alternatives to plastics, education of consumers and promotion of reusable products. The report also found other cultural side-effects. In South Africa, plastic litter is jokingly referred to as “the new national flower”. In Ireland, windblown plastic bags caught in trees are referred to as “witch’s knickers”.

2018-06-05,"SEOUL, June 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday after falling nearly 2 percent in the previous session, but growing U.S. production and expectations of higher OPEC supplies continue to weigh on sentiment. Brent crude futures added 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $75.44 a barrel at 0020 GMT, after settling down 2 percent at $75.29 a barrel on Monday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 28 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $65.03 a barrel. It finished the previous session 1.6 percent lower at $64.75 a barrel. “It’s all about supply, whether it’s OPEC raising output or U.S. increasing production, all roads lead to higher global oil supplies, which is leaving oil traders shaking in their boots,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide whether the group and non-OPEC members including Russia will raise production to ease concerns over potential supply shortfalls from Iran and Venezuela. Over the weekend, OPEC and non-OPEC Arab oil ministers agreed on the need for continued cooperation to balance global supply, Kuwait’s state news agency KUNA reported. Increasing U.S. crude oil production has also put pressure on oil prices. In March, U.S. crude output rose to 10.47 million barrels per day, the highest on record, according to a monthly report by the Energy Information Administration (EIA). The number of rigs drilling in the United States was also up by two in the week to June 1, bringing the total to 861, the most since 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services said on Friday.

2018-06-05,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Growing Brazilian government meddling in Petrobras (PETR4.SA) that prompted its former chief executive Pedro Parente to quit last week now looms over his successor as he seeks to crack on with reforms at the world’s most indebted oil company. After a trucker’s strike over rising diesel prices paralysed Latin America’s largest economy, the government reacted by imposing fuel subsidies, worrying investors who saw it as a sign of new, unwelcome interference in state-run Petrobras. Parente resigned in protest, and former chief financial officer Ivan Monteiro was installed in his place on Friday, providing some comfort to jittery markets which hope he will press on with Parente’s market-friendly program. Shares in Petrobras - formally called Petroleo Brasileiro SA - rose more than 8 percent on Monday, helped by the decision to name Monteiro CEO as well as by some bargain-hunting after the shares lost about a fifth of their value. However, it is unlikely that 57-year-old former bank executive Monteiro will be able to escape government pressure, analysts said in the days following his appointment.  Monteiro may want to turn Petrobras into a streamlined profit machine - but outgoing President Michel Temer and other politicians are scrambling to appease angry voters ahead of presidential polls in October. “Ivan Monteiro will be under serious political pressure because of the elections,” said Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “Candidates who are against asset sales, for example, will push hard against any major Petrobras decision on divestments.” Petrobras was not immediately available to comment. A spokesman for the president’s office said that the government would not meddle in pricing.   Temer effectively ended the truckers’ protest after he promised to cut diesel prices by about 12 percent for 60 days through a mix of tax cuts and subsidies to Petrobras. The government also agreed to restrict price changes at the pump, reimbursing Petrobras for related losses. In another sign of a heavier government hand, the Mining and Energy Ministry said on Friday it was seeking a mechanism to “protect the consumer from the volatility of fuel prices at the pump.” But details have been scarce as to how Petrobras will be compensated and investors are wary of further meddling, especially steps that could extend beyond diesel to gasoline. The diesel subsidy plan and Parente’s exit “have all raised questions and increased the risk perception of political interference,” analysts at Brazilian bank Itau said in a client note. A wide-open election will add further pressure on the government to keep voters happy. Leftist candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video: “It is not enough for Parente to go, it is necessary to demand that the pricing policy that he imposed be changed.” Parente had insisted as a condition of taking the debt-laden and scandal-tarnished company’s helm in 2016 that he control how Petrobras priced fuel. Monteiro, seen by oil companies and investors as an avid supporter of changes sought by Parente, is not expected to get the same carte-blanche from the government as his predecessor, as the political mood in Brasilia has shifted. “Future reforms are going to be met with a jaundiced eye,” said Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar. More than just potential losses from fuel pricing are at stake. Petrobras is hoping to sell majority stakes in four refineries, but possible investors are already spooked by the prospect of competing with a company that is forced to sell fuel below cost, sources told Reuters last month. An aggressive two-year divestment target of $21 billion by the end of 2018, part of a bid to cut debt, could also be in play. But a round of bidding for oil blocks in Brazil’s choice offshore basins on Thursday is not expected to be affected, say oil majors, who will likely partner with Petrobras to win some of the blocks. And some see potential benefits from Parente’s exit, including the possibility of a quicker conclusion to a drawn-out dispute with the government over the value of the offshore transfer-of-rights area, where Petrobras paid top dollar to produce 5 billion barrels of oil.   Oil majors are watching the negotiations closely, because a resolution could unlock an auction of nearby areas, considered to be some of the finest geology in Brazil’s pre-salt play. “I would guess the transfer-of-rights will be resolved because Ivan is more compliant than Pedro Parente,” said John Forman, former chief of oil regulator ANP. “He will yield more easily.”  Reporting by Alexandra Alper; Additional reporting by Anthony Boadle, Editing by Christian Plumb and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/petrobras-succession-politics/analysis-deeper-brazil-government-meddling-looms-over-new-petrobras-ceo-idUKL2N1T5073,05 Jun 2018,"Growing Brazilian
