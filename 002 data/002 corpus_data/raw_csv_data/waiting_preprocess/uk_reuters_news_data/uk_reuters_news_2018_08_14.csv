2018-08-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Clouds are gathering over the outlook for the oil market, as trade tensions and rising crude supply threaten to swamp demand growth, but some of the world’s most prominent energy investors are convinced the price will return to record highs. The escalating trade war between the United States and China threatens global growth. The physical markets are already showing signs of strain as unwanted crude builds on ships and crushes prices for cargoes of oil. [CRU/E] [CRU/WAF] [CRU/MED] Aside from that, interest rates around the world are rising and the dollar is strengthening, which means emerging market oil buyers are seeing their import bill growing almost daily. Both OPEC and the International Energy Agency have warned about the risk of trade disputes to global demand growth in their most recent monthly market outlooks. [IEA/M] [OPEC/M]  Funds have cut their bullish bets on Brent and U.S. crude futures and options to their lowest in almost a year. [CFTC/] [O/ICE]  Despite all this, prominent hedge funds such as Andurand Capital and Westbeck Capital are betting oil could skyrocket to $150 a barrel from around $75 now LCOc1. The main driver is expected to be upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector, which kick in November.  “Our view is that by November 4, we will have lost between 1.3 and 1.4 million barrels (of output) a day. It is a very big number. That’s based on the view that the U.S. will allow a few temporary exception waivers .... Ultimately, we could see losses from Iran exceed 2 million barrels a day,” Jean-Louis Le Mee, chief executive officer of London-based Westbeck, said.    (GRAPHIC: Major forecasters' estimates of oil demand growth in 2018 - reut.rs/2vIs2Xp)   U.S. President Donald Trump in May walked away from a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Tehran that he said was one-sided in Iran’s favour.  Trump has also blamed OPEC for the 45-percent rise in oil prices over the last 12 months and, in June, exchanged sharp words with Iran on the subject.  Pierre Andurand, who runs the $1.2-billion Andurand Commodities Fund and predicted the rise and subsequent crash in the oil price in 2008, responded on Twitter by pointing out OPEC’s spare capacity was at its lowest ever. “There is going to be a real issue,” he wrote, predicting prices above $150 per barrel within two years. “We don’t sense a great deal of engagement yet from generalist investors. A few of them are starting to look at it now,” Will Smith, Westbeck chief investment officer said. “This is going to catch everybody by surprise. Some of the specialists are bullish – including Pierre (Andurand), ourselves and Energy Aspects,” he said.     Aside from the risk to Iranian supply, Venezuela’s crude production, which has already collapsed as a result of economic crisis, could fall below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, compared with 2 million bpd in mid-2017, Smith said. Andurand Capital declined to comment. Taking a contrarian view can be costly. Even Andurand took a hit in 2017 when he expected the oil price to rally sharply and, instead, it wallowed around the $50 mark.  And he wasn’t alone. A number of long-time oil investors such as U.S. commodity fund manager Andy Hall were reportedly so badly burned they shut up shop and bowed out. Westbeck’s Energy Opportunity Fund is up 4.1 percent in the year to July 13, showed an investor presentation shared with Reuters. Andurand’s commodities fund is up 12 percent in the first six months of 2018, according to data compiled by HSBC. The oil options market shows that, for contracts from October 2018 to December 2020, traders and investors are holding more contracts to buy crude futures - or calls - at $100 a barrel than any other. However, in line with Westbeck’s view that $150 oil is not one that is widely shared in the investment community, that position has barely changed in the last month, having dropped by a mere 1,500 lots to just over 107,000 lots, equivalent to 100 million barrels of oil.  (GRAPHIC: Brent crude oil investors bulk up on bearish sell options - reut.rs/2P9dAQA)   By contrast, in the last month, the largest change in holdings, or open interest, has materialised in contracts to sell oil - or puts - at $60 to $65 a barrel between October 2018 and December 2020. This position has grown by nearly 45,000 lots to 140,000 lots, or 140 million barrels of oil.     A month ago, the amount of open interest in calls maturing in this time period outnumbered that of puts by nearly three to one. This ratio is now down to two to one. “If we are right about oil going from $75 to $150 over the next 12 to 18 months, out-of-the-money oil options, further down the curve ... look very exciting. The pay back there is just fantastic if we are right,” Westbeck’s Smith said.

2018-08-14,"* Lira rebounds 5 percent after three week-long thrashing * Rand and rouble, European bank stocks also drive higher * MSCI ex-Japan subdued but Nikkei bounces 2.3 pct * China economic data mostly softer than forecast * Euro finds some support, yen and Swiss franc favoured * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - World share markets fought to regain their footing on Tuesday, as Turkey’s lira pulled out of its recent nosedive and reassuring data from Germany helped offset the latest wobbles in China’s giant economy. After three weeks of heavy pounding, Turkey’s lira finally got some respite as signs the country’s authorities were trying to address the situation triggered a 5 percent relief rally to 6.5 per dollar. Yet it had lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and nerves were briefly tested again as Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan urged Turks to boycott U.S. electronic products in response to recent criticism from Washington. The rot also stopped for the South African rand, the Russian rouble and the Brazilian real. Argentina’s central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday. Even so, the peso hit a record low. “These things get very volatile in both directions once you have had a really big move,” Saxo bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy said. “To suggest this thing is over, you would have to see that Turkey is isolated... I’m not there yet and I don’t think the market is there yet.” European shares also steadied after two days of selling as anxieties over contagion from the Turkish currency crisis eased. After falling to a 21-month low on Monday, euro zone bank stocks initially rose 0.8 before slipping back again, while the cross-sector pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark and Wall Street futures both climbed. Sentiment was helped as data showed that Europe’s largest economy, Germany, picked up more steam than expected in Q2 , although the markets’ bounce might have been stronger had surveys from China not proved softer than expected. Chinese retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all grew by less than forecast in July, a triple dose of disappointment that underlined the argument for more policy stimulus in China as trade risks also intensify. The Shanghai blue-chip index closed down 0.5 percent and weighed on MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which eased 0.1 percent. Moves elsewhere were mixed. Japan’s Nikkei rose 2.3 percent and Australian stocks added 0.8 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were still a fraction higher and 10-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent. Investors were encouraged that U.S. declines had been only minor on Monday after the losses by the lira and other emerging-market currencies. The Dow ended Monday down 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.25 percent. MSCI’s benchmark emerging market equities index touched its lowest level since July 2017 in Asian trading though, taking losses since late January to just shy of the 20 percent threshold generally accepted to be a ‘bear market’. “The more significant emerging-market concern relates to the risk that regional underperformance becomes a source of disruption through swings in capital flows and currencies,” said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual. “While the focus at present is on Turkey, where currency depreciation and rising rates has translated into a marked tightening of financial conditions, it could spread to Mexico, Brazil and India.” Sherwood cited the NAFTA negotiations as a key risk for Mexico and upcoming elections in Brazil and India as potential threats for those two markets. For graphics on wider market impact of Turkish lira crash click The day’s rise in risk appetite saw bond yields in Spain and Italy dip, although the euro was still struggling at $1.1407 , having touched its lowest since July 2017 on Monday. It also reached one-year lows against the yen and Swiss franc, safe harbours in times of stress. The dollar was a touch firmer at 110.89 yen, having hit a six-week trough around 110.10 on Monday. Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. currency was barely budged at 96.300. In commodity markets, gold briefly slid to its lowest since late January 2017. It was last at $1,195 an ounce. U.S. government data last week showed that gold speculators had lifted their bearish bets to a record. Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York’s SPDR Gold Trust GLD, have dropped about 10 percent from their April peak and are at their lowest since February 2016. Oil prices rose after a report from OPEC confirmed that top exporter Saudi Arabia had cut production to avert looming oversupply. Brent gained just over a dollar to $73.74 a barrel while U.S. crude added 99 cents to $68.18. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney, editing by Larry

2018-08-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - British renewable energy investor Quercus said it will halt the construction of a 500 million euro (445.9 million pounds) solar power plant in Iran due to recently imposed U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The solar plant in Iran would have been the first renewable energy investment outside Europe by Quercus and the world’s sixth largest, with a 600 megawatt (MW) capacity. Iran has been trying to increase the share of renewable-produced electricity in its energy mix, partly due to air pollution and to meet international commitments, hoping to have about 5 gigawatt in renewables installed by 2022. In June, before the U.S.-imposed sanctions, more than 250 companies had signed agreements to add and sell power from about 4 gigawatt of new renewables in the country, which has only 602 MW installed, Iranian energy ministry data showed. Washington reimposed sanctions last week after pulling out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions.  U.S. president Donald Trump has also threatened to penalise companies that continue to operate in Iran, which led banks and many companies around the world to scale back their dealings with Tehran. “Following the U.S. sanctions on Iran, we have decided to cease all activities in the country, including our 600 MW project. We will continue to monitor the situation closely,” Quercus chief executive Diego Biasi said in an email on Tuesday. The firm will continue to monitor the situation closely, said Biasi, who declined to comment further. Last year Quercus said it would set up a project company and sell shares via a private placement after attracting interest from private and institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds. Construction was expected to take three years, with each 100 MW standalone lot becoming operational and connecting to the grid every six months. Independently-owned Quercus has a portfolio of around 28 renewable energy plants and 235 MW of installed capacity. The firm, founded by Biasi and Simone Borla in 2010, controls five investment funds and has a network of “highly regarded external partners,” it says on its website. The 600 MW plant it aimed to construct in Iran would be the firm’s largest investment. Quercus declined to comment on the details of its decision to cease the plan and on any financial losses that could result from it. Fearing the consequences of the U.S. embargo, a string of European companies have recently announced they would scale back their business in Iran. On Tuesday, German engineering group Bilfinger (GBFG.DE), said it did not plan to sign any new business in the country, while automotive supplier Duerr (DUEG.DE) on Aug. 11 said it had halted activities in Iran. Another project, planned by Norway’s Saga Energy, which said last October it aimed to build 2 GW of new solar energy capacity in Iran and to start construction by the end of 2018, has also stalled. Saga Energy’s chief of operations Rune Haaland told Reuters it was still working on getting the funding, which is more complicated since recent developments, and although it aimed to push on with its plans, construction could be delayed.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said a 7.5 percent import tariff would be applied to 500 consumer goods, including those bought online, in a bid to curb imports. In addition, she said energy projects at state companies that require a large amount of imports would be delayed. “With these, we hope our current account deficit ... can be lowered significantly,” Indrawati told a news briefing after a cabinet meeting. She made the announcement after President Joko Widodo urged his ministers to make “real progress” to reduce the current account deficit and maintain the rupiah exchange rate at “a fair level”. “Although we understand they will affect several sectors, these stabilisation measures ... will maintain Indonesia’s economic stability to face foreigners’ perception against the condition in emerging markets,” Indrawati added. Indonesia has seen a market selloff intensify after a report on Friday showed its current account deficit had widened to 3 percent of GDP in the second quarter, the highest in nearly four years. After plunging by more than 1 percent on Monday, the rupiah on Tuesday hit its weakest level since October 2015, at 14,630 a dollar, before recovering slightly. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond was 8.007 percent on Tuesday, the highest since December 2016, as investors were also spooked by the currency turmoil in Turkey. Indonesia’s stock benchmark fell to its lowest in over a month after losing around 5 percent so far this week. Indonesia’s central bank intervened to defend the rupiah on Monday and again on Tuesday conducted auctions for cheaper foreign exchange swap contracts to reduce hedging costs. Bank Indonesia (BI) will expand its swaps to not only U.S. dollars, but also euro, yen and yuan daily to allow commercial banks to reswap any contract they offer to corporate clients in those currencies, Governor Perry Wariyo told the news briefing. BI is due to announce its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. It has raised the rate by 100 basis points since mid-May to defend the rupiah, but is expected to hold, a Reuters poll showed. A majority of analysts forecast BI would hold, but five who initially had pencilled in a hold changed their views to expect a 25-basis point hike after the rupiah’s fall. BI has spent billions of dollars to defend the currency. Foreign exchange reserves had declined $13.7 billion from February through July, as BI sought to stabilise the rupiah. Analysts say running a current account deficit is fine as long as a country attracts enough foreign direct investment (FDI). But Indonesia funds its gap with portfolio investment, since it does not receive enough FDI. On Tuesday, the investment board reported FDI into Indonesia contracted for the first time since at least 2011 in the second quarter from a year earlier. The investment board’s chief, Tom Lembong, attributed the decline to project suspensions as investors remain cautious on the financial and political outlook. Indonesia will hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2019. The government previously announced a plan to widen the use of biodiesel starting September and delay some infrastructure projects to reduce imports. Separately, energy ministry spokesman Agung Pribadi said the government is drafting a regulation to require oil contractors to sell crude output to state energy company Pertamina to help support the rupiah. Contractors, such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil , currently split their crude output with the government and are allowed to export their share.

2018-08-14,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Marcelo Teixeira ITAÍ, Brazil, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Last year, Brazilian farmer Gustavo Lopes sized up his sugarcane plantation against his soybean fields. He looked at global trends, including rising U.S.-China trade tensions and a stubborn sugar-market glut. Then he tore up the last of his cane fields and ditched a decades-old supply contract with a local sugar mill. Lopes planted soybeans across his 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) farm in Sao Paulo state - a bet that paid off earlier this month when Chinese buyers loaded up on South American soy after Beijing imposed tariffs on U.S. beans. The farmer got his highest price ever for soybeans. “It was unusual for this time of year,” Lopes said in an interview at his farm, where he’s prepping to plant another soy crop in September. “It’s got to be a result of Chinese demand.” Shifting trade flows are redefining the Brazilian landscape, spurring more farmers to align their crops with Chinese appetites. The nation’s soy plantings have expanded by 2 million hectares in two years - an area the size of New Jersey - while land used for cane shrank by nearly 400,000 hectares, according to government data. China’s growing demand for meat has supercharged soy imports for animal feed. The Asian nation paid $20.3 billion last year for 53.8 million tonnes of soybeans from Brazil, nearly half its output — and up from 22.8 million tonnes in 2012. A new 25 percent Chinese tariff on U.S. soybeans - a retaliation for U.S. levies by President Donald Trump - is expected to boost Brazil’s soy exports to an all-time record this year. Brazilian soybean exports to China rose to nearly 36 million tonnes in the first half of 2018, up 6 percent from a year ago. In July, they surged 46 percent from the same month a year earlier to 10.2 million tonnes. Brazil’s grains boom has it rivaling United States as the world’s top soy producer this year, after outpacing U.S. exports over the past five years. All that soy is eating into Brazil’s sugarcane belt, which is reeling from sugar prices near multi-year lows. Chinese sugar tariffs have weighed on the global market for the sweetener as developed nations continue to cut back consumption. “We lost 3,000 hectares of cane area to grains in the last two years,” said Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, chief executive of Nova América, one of the largest cane growers in Brazil, managing 110,000 hectares. Rezende said he had seen farmers migrating from sugarcane into grains in nearly every state where both crops are viable. The crop swap is catching on quickly with farmers, threatening the survival of cane mills they once supplied. About 60 cane mills have closed in the past five years in Brazil’s center-south cane region. About 270 that remain open must fight harder than ever to secure cane supplies. Agroconsult, an agribusiness consultancy, said it has received requests from mills to calculate the premium they will have to pay producers to keep them from switching to grains. Douglas Duarte, a director at the Londra mill in Itaí - which used to lease part of the Lopes farm - said he has plans to add 500,000 tonnes of capacity at the mill but has yet to line up enough cane supplies. With so many farmers focused on grain, Duarte has worked to sign leases with families who are not interested in actively managing their land. “In places where the owners have expertise with grains — the equipment and everything — then you can’t compete,” he said. In some places, the closing of cane mills has also discouraged planting. Farmer Antonio de Morais Ribeiro Neto gave up planting cane last year after the closure of the sugar mill that he supplied, called Usina Maracaju. Biosev SA, the Brazilian sugar arm of global commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co, shut it down in a cost-cutting move. So Riberio replaced 400 hectares of cane with soybeans, adding to the 2,000 hectares of soy he already had planted. As he watched the U.S.-China trade war escalate, he bought two new grain silos, more soybean-planting machinery and a new harvester. Plenty of sugar mills, which often grow part of the cane they process, have realized they cannot fight the soy boom and decided to plant their own soybeans as part of a crop rotation strategy. Cane fields typically need to be replanted after five or six years, and mills are using the renovation window to produce soybeans. “In the past, those areas subject to renovation would be left fallow until the following year,” said Victor Campanelli, who has exploited the niche. His firm, Agro Pastoril Paschoal Campanelli, manages the planning, inputs and equipment for sugar mills’ one-off soy crops, sharing in the profits. While the grains bonanza has many farmers flush with cash, some are wary about relying so much on one crop and one massive importer. “This Chinese demand has attracted all the farmers,” said Marcos Cesar Brunozzi, who switched part of his land from sugar to grains in the state of Minas Gerais. “I hope the whole situation doesn’t change suddenly, because we are betting big.” Lopes has no regrets about tearing up his cane fields. Last year, his sugarcane yielded a net profit of 480 reais per hectare - compared to 2,600 reais per hectare for his soy fields. “I know it won’t always be that way,” he said. “But still, it’s a huge difference.” Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira

The deals were struck between Glencore and Japanese utilities such as Shikoku Electric, Chugoku Electric and Kansai Electric after bilateral talks, a source at a Japanese coal buyer said, requesting anonymity as he was not allowed to speak in public about commercial deals. Glencore did not respond to a request for comment. A Chugoku Electric spokesman confirmed the utility struck some annual contracts at $110 a tonne with Glencore, but said other deals were agreed at different levels or index-linked prices. Shikoku Electric said it settled the April-March contract with Glencore last month but declined to disclose the price. Kansai Electric declined to comment. “We’ve agreed with Glencore at $110 per tonne for the April-March contract late last month,” said another source at a utility directly involved in the talks, also declining to be named. A trader with a major commodity merchant also confirmed the deals. The deal marks a breakthrough after Japan’s Tohoku Electric and Glencore, the world’s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, failed earlier this year to agree an annual supply deal that has in the past been used as an industry benchmark. The contractual price came in nearly 30 percent higher than an annual supply price a year earlier, and 16 percent above a deal for October 2017-September 2018, reflecting a tighter global market for the world’s dominant power generation fuel. Australian spot thermal coal cargo prices have hit several six-year highs in recent months, and at $120 per tonne remain a third above this year’s lows in April, pushed up by a summer heatwave across the northern hemisphere as well as output cuts in China, the world’s biggest consumer of coal. The deals between Japanese utilities and Glencore give coal markets welcome clarity after Tohoku and Glencore abandoned their talks on an annual contract that traditionally set prices for the region. With annual imports of around 115 million tonnes, Japan is one of the world’s biggest importers of thermal coal. Its utilities buy around 40 percent of all Australian thermal coal exports. But volumes under the long-term contract have been declining as utilities try to diversify supply sources and trade more in the spot market as part of Japan’s energy market liberalisation. Still, miners say term contracts will remain important. “End users like to have a mix of spot exposure and they like to have some certainty in their portfolios - as, I have to say, producers also benefit from,” Paul Flynn, Chief Executive at Whitehaven Coal said in an earnings conference call on Tuesday. Japan is Whitehaven’s biggest customer. “Despite the gyrations that you’ve seen over the last 18 months and two years, in particular, with the setting of those prices, I think both sides of that equation continue to have a commitment to maintain both pricing regimes.” In a sign the decades-old practice of buyers and miners bilaterally working out a fixed price will continue, Tohoku and Glencore have already begun preliminary talks on an October 2018-September 2019 annual contract, multiple sources said.

2018-08-14,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Ecopetrol SA, Colombia’s state-run oil company, said on Tuesday its second-quarter net profit rose to 3.5 trillion pesos ($1.17 billion), up 170 percent from the same period in 2017, thanks to higher crude prices. The company plans to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves, drilling 620 wells and doubling the number of rigs in operation from last year. Consolidated oil and gas production in the second quarter rose to 721,000 barrels per day (bpd), the company said in a regulatory filing. Protests which led to the temporary closure of some fields had lowered consolidated production to 701,000 bpd during the first quarter. Ecopetrol is targeting output of 725,000 bpd of crude and gas equivalent by the end of 2018, up from 715,000 bpd last year. “We knew how to take advantage of a favorable crude price environment and at the same time we reaffirmed our technical operative and financial capacities,” Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in the statement. The company’s reserves have dipped to the equivalent of about 7.1 years of production, well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies. The company spent $1 billion in investment during the first half, the filing said, a 15 percent increase on the same period in 2017. Investment is concentrated on exploration and production, which were up 23 percent. The company had said it expects to quicken investment in the second half and that the run-up to the country’s June elections slowed spending because anti-corruption laws make it difficult for public companies to open bidding for contracts during elections. President Ivan Duque, who took office this month, has promised to invest in Ecopetrol’s refineries and crack down on guerrilla groups that attack pipelines. Colombia has struggled to attract investment and maintain output as bombings and protests have frequently interrupted operations. Pumping through the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline was stopped for six months this year due to repeated attacks by Marxist ELN rebels. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in April to June increased by 52.9 percent compared with the same quarter in 2017, to 8.6 trillion pesos, Ecopetrol said. Total sales in the first quarter were up 29.2 percent compared with the same period last year, to 16.98 trillion pesos. Ecopetrol will hold a call with investors on Wednesday.

2018-08-14,"(Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Diamondback Energy Inc on Tuesday agreed to buy shale rival Energen Corp in an all-stock deal valued at $9.2 billion, giving it an expanded footprint in the country’s largest and fastest growing oil field.  Energen had been under pressure from activist investor Corvex Management for more than a year to sell itself to address weak returns. The proposed acquisition is Diamondback’s second in the Permian in a week, after striking a deal to pay $1.2 billion for Ajax Resources LLC.  West Texas shale producers also are facing pressure to expand scale and efficiency in the Permian basin as higher costs for services, and the need to secure limited pipeline transport out of the region, weigh on smaller and midsize companies.   The deal values Energen’s properties at about $65,000 per acre (0.4 hectare), among the highest prices in the Permian in the last several years, said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at data provider DrillingInfo.  Concho Resources Inc earlier this year paid $8 billion in stock, or more than $70,000 per acre, for West Texas shale rival RSP Permian.   The purchase brings together two companies with holdings in the same areas of the Permian, said Dittmar, potentially allowing for longer horizontal wells, shared labor and equipment.     For independent oil producers like Diamondback, adding new drilling prospects represents the best way to compete for services with larger rivals that have moved into the Permian this year despite pressure by investors to focus on shareholder returns.  Shale producers including Apache Corp, ConocoPhillips, Parsley Energy and Pioneer Natural Resources recently have increased their 2018 capital budgets as oil prices have held above $65 a barrel.  Exxon Mobil Corp, BP PLC and other large oil companies that missed out on in the early years of the shale boom are also boosting shale investments, using historical alliances to secure a larger role with oilfield service and pipeline companies in the Permian. Last month, BP agreed to pay $10.5 billion, its largest purchase in nearly two decades, to acquire assets in three shale basins from Australian mining company BHP Billiton. That deal also was spurred by hedge fund Elliott Management.  Corvex and activist Carl Icahn, who last week disclosed he had acquired more stock in Energen, were not available for immediate comment. Diamondback’s implied offer of $84.95 per Energen share represents a premium of about 16 percent to Energen’s Tuesday close. The transaction includes $830 million in net debt. Energen shares rose 9.3 percent to $79.90 in after-market trading, while Diamondback shares fell 5.5 percent to $126.40. Citigroup Global Markets Inc is the financial adviser to Diamondback, while J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co are financial advisers to Energen.

2018-08-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World share markets rebounded on Tuesday as Turkey’s lira pulled out of a recent nosedive and reassuring data from Germany helped offset the latest softness in China’s economy. After three weeks of heavy pounding, the lira TRYTOM=D3 recovered some ground, trading at about 6.37 to the dollar, up almost 8 percent from the previous day's close.  The Turkish currency was supported by news of a planned conference call in which the finance minister will seek to reassure investors concerned by President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over the economy and his resistance to interest rate hikes to tackle double-digit inflation.  The dollar advanced to a 13-month peak against a basket of major currencies as traders increased their safe-haven holdings of the U.S. currency on worries about the lira-related fallout. The Turkish currency lost almost 10 percent on Monday and nerves were briefly tested again as Erdogan urged Turks to boycott U.S. electronic products in response to recent criticism from Washington. “I don’t believe it’s all over,” said Minh Trang, senior currency trader at Silicon Valley Bank in Santa Clara, California. “We are just getting a bit of reprieve from the recent down move.” The Turks have exhausted the possibility of interest rate hikes and are backed into a corner by their inadequate level of currency reserves, Paul McNamara, emerging markets investment director at GAM Investments in London, said in a note. A much-needed demand slowdown in Turkey is causing asset-quality problems in banks, he said. The role of construction in the Turkish economy, for example, is comparable to that in Spain or Ireland ahead of the European bust a decade ago, he said.

2018-08-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Tuesday, weighed down by a strengthening U.S. dollar as investors remained concerned about the financial crisis in Turkey. Brent crude LCOc1 dipped 15 cents to settle at $72.46 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 16 cents to close at $67.04 a barrel. Futures extended losses in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude stocks unexpectedly rose by 3.7 million barrels last week, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.5 million barrels. Earlier in the session, oil prices rose, supported by gains in equity markets, but pared gains at mid-day as the U.S. dollar index touched its highest since late June 2017. A stronger dollar makes greenback-denominated oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.  “Usually when the dollar starts making highs, it’s probably a sign that we’re still concerned about the Turkish situation,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “There’s still a bit of nervousness on the global stage.” U.S. stock indexes broadly gained and Turkey's lira recovered, a day after crashing to an all-time low against the dollar, feeding worries that the country's crisis might spread to other emerging markets. TRYTOM=D3. “The equities and the U.S. dollar are keying primarily off of the unfolding saga in Turkey and although the lira has posted a significant rebound today, the standoff between Turkey and the U.S. is showing no sign of progress,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “Consequently, worries over contagion are apt to increase in the process of reducing risk appetite and renewing downside pressures on oil pricing.” Oil’s losses were capped by concerns over lower global crude supply from top producers. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Monday that Saudi Arabia had cut production. Export declines from Iran also are expected as Washington re-imposes sanctions. But OPEC expects oil supply by countries outside the cartel to increase by 2.13 million bpd next year, 30,000 bpd more than forecast last month, boosted by new U.S. shale production. “We do have a tighter fundamental picture right now than we had a year ago,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “You continue to see signs that demand is pretty robust.” However, some analysts say trade disputes between the United States and China and turmoil in emerging markets could curb energy demand. China’s economy is showing signs of cooling with investment in the first seven months of the year slowing and retail sales softening, data showed.

2018-08-14,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 14 (Reuters) - South African state-owned power firm Eskom has hired financial adviser Lazard to draft a plan to shore up its balance sheet as it struggles to emerge from a financial crisis, two banking sources told Reuters. Cash-strapped Eskom is critical to Africa’s most industrialised economy as it supplies more than 90 percent of its power and is one of its most indebted state firms. President Cyril Ramaphosa appointed a new board at Eskom early this year in one of his first interventions since becoming leader of the ruling African National Congress (ANC). He later secured the backing of senior ANC figures for a radical overhaul of Eskom. “Eskom hired Lazard to come up with options for the company’s turnaround strategy,” one of the banking sources said. “This isn’t a straightforward debt restructuring.” The second source said Lazard had been hired several weeks ago to look at ways to improve the company’s balance sheet but did not elaborate further. Lazard, whose business includes advising companies on deals and debt restructuring, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment. An Eskom spokeswoman asked for questions to be submitted by email but did not answer immediately. Eskom said last month it was considering selling non-core assets and job cuts after swinging to a full-year loss. The company, which employs around 47,000 people, also said last month it was not planning on restructuring its debt.

The country’s existing 445,000 barrel per day (bpd) refining system operates well below capacity due to mismanagement and lack of investment, forcing the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to import the bulk of the country’s gasoline. NNPC said in a statement it was considering plans to establish a 100,000 barrel per day brownfield refinery at its Port Harcourt and Warri sites in collaboration with private sector investors. The company said its strategy was “aimed at getting private sector investors to bring in brownfield refineries so that they can share facilities”. NNPC said investors had already begun relocating a refinery from Turkey to Nigeria to be installed near the state oil company’s Port Harcourt refinery. It did not name any companies or provide a timeline. A spokesman for the state oil company did not immediately respond to a phone call, text message and email seeking comment. NNPC has sought new investment for years to reduce the reliance on imported oil products.

2018-08-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Cyclical indicators point to slower and more uneven growth in the global economy for the rest of this year and into 2019, which means the rise in oil consumption is likely to moderate, especially for distillates like diesel. Economic growth remains strong in the United States, but in much of the rest of the world clear signs of slackening momentum have emerged since the start of the year. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P8CShp) Strong and synchronised global growth in 2017 has given way to a weaker and more varied picture in 2018 and 2019, which is likely to be less supportive for oil consumption and prices: These trade-oriented indicators are all correlated closely with one another and with the rate of expansion in the world economy - and they all tell a consistent story of slowing momentum outside the United States. The softening outlook for world trade has filtered through to the oil market, with Brent calendar spreads and spot prices peaking in April and May respectively. Medium-density refined fuels, including road diesel, marine gasoil and jet kerosene, are the most heavily geared to the growth of freight given their dominance in the road, rail, shipping and air cargo sectors. If global trade growth slows, consumption of mid-distillates will also decelerate — though the outlook for these fuels is complicated by the introduction of new marine fuel regulations at the start of 2020. So far, the main cyclical indicators point to a slackening of growth momentum rather than a more pronounced slowdown in the world economy. None of the major economic forecasters is predicting a recession later in 2018 or 2019. However, the number of risk factors in the global economy is multiplying, and includes: Cocktails of some or all of these risk factors have preceded most recent international economic crises in the last four decades, including the Latin American debt default (1982), Mexico’s debt default and the tequila crisis (1994), Thailand’s devaluation and the Southeast Asian financial crisis (1997) and Russia’s financial crisis (1998). Compounding the uncertainty, the outlook for fiscal, monetary and trade policies has become confused, with the world’s largest economies all trying to pursue inconsistent policies on tariffs and currency valuations. The United States is pursuing an expansionary fiscal policy combined with a restrictive monetary policy, causing the real exchange rate to appreciate, while simultaneously trying to reduce the external trade deficit with tariffs. Fiscal policy has turned strongly pro-cyclical even though the expansion is over nine years old, unemployment is at multi-decade lows, and inflation has accelerated to the fastest rate for more than six years. China has eased monetary policy and allowed its currency to depreciate since the start of the year to offset the impact of higher U.S. tariffs and counter a slowdown in its domestic economy. The currencies of the euro zone and the United Kingdom have also weakened, supporting flagging domestic growth but now creating problems with rising imported inflation. There is a significant possibility that global growth will experience either a mild or a deeper slowdown over the next 12-18 months. It is, of course, possible the current loss of momentum will turn out to be no more than a temporary soft patch, with growth accelerating again. On balance, however, the main leading indicators suggest the pace of economic expansion - and the outlook for growth in oil consumption - will continue slowing for at least the next six months.

2018-08-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Clouds are gathering over the outlook for the oil market, as trade tensions and rising crude supply threaten to swamp demand growth, but some of the world’s most prominent energy investors are convinced the price will return to record highs. The escalating trade war between the United States and China threatens global growth. The physical markets are already showing signs of strain as unwanted crude builds on ships and crushes prices for cargoes of oil. [CRU/E] [CRU/WAF] [CRU/MED] Aside from that, interest rates around the world are rising and the dollar is strengthening, which means emerging market oil buyers are seeing their import bill growing almost daily. Both OPEC and the International Energy Agency have warned about the risk of trade disputes to global demand growth in their most recent monthly market outlooks. [IEA/M] [OPEC/M]  Funds have cut their bullish bets on Brent and U.S. crude futures and options to their lowest in almost a year. [CFTC/] [O/ICE]  Despite all this, prominent hedge funds such as Andurand Capital and Westbeck Capital are betting oil could skyrocket to $150 a barrel from around $75 now LCOc1. The main driver is expected to be upcoming U.S. sanctions on Iran’s energy sector, which kick in November.  “Our view is that by November 4, we will have lost between 1.3 and 1.4 million barrels (of output) a day. It is a very big number. That’s based on the view that the U.S. will allow a few temporary exception waivers .... Ultimately, we could see losses from Iran exceed 2 million barrels a day,” Jean-Louis Le Mee, chief executive officer of London-based Westbeck, said.    (GRAPHIC: Major forecasters' estimates of oil demand growth in 2018 - reut.rs/2vIs2Xp)   U.S. President Donald Trump in May walked away from a 2015 nuclear deal between world powers and Tehran that he said was one-sided in Iran’s favour.  Trump has also blamed OPEC for the 45-percent rise in oil prices over the last 12 months and, in June, exchanged sharp words with Iran on the subject.  Pierre Andurand, who runs the $1.2-billion Andurand Commodities Fund and predicted the rise and subsequent crash in the oil price in 2008, responded on Twitter by pointing out OPEC’s spare capacity was at its lowest ever. “There is going to be a real issue,” he wrote, predicting prices above $150 per barrel within two years. “We don’t sense a great deal of engagement yet from generalist investors. A few of them are starting to look at it now,” Will Smith, Westbeck chief investment officer said. “This is going to catch everybody by surprise. Some of the specialists are bullish – including Pierre (Andurand), ourselves and Energy Aspects,” he said.     Aside from the risk to Iranian supply, Venezuela’s crude production, which has already collapsed as a result of economic crisis, could fall below 1 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, compared with 2 million bpd in mid-2017, Smith said. Andurand Capital declined to comment. Taking a contrarian view can be costly. Even Andurand took a hit in 2017 when he expected the oil price to rally sharply and, instead, it wallowed around the $50 mark.  And he wasn’t alone. A number of long-time oil investors such as U.S. commodity fund manager Andy Hall were reportedly so badly burned they shut up shop and bowed out. Westbeck’s Energy Opportunity Fund is up 4.1 percent in the year to July 13, showed an investor presentation shared with Reuters. Andurand’s commodities fund is up 12 percent in the first six months of 2018, according to data compiled by HSBC. The oil options market shows that, for contracts from October 2018 to December 2020, traders and investors are holding more contracts to buy crude futures - or calls - at $100 a barrel than any other. However, in line with Westbeck’s view that $150 oil is not one that is widely shared in the investment community, that position has barely changed in the last month, having dropped by a mere 1,500 lots to just over 107,000 lots, equivalent to 100 million barrels of oil.  (GRAPHIC: Brent crude oil investors bulk up on bearish sell options - reut.rs/2P9dAQA)   By contrast, in the last month, the largest change in holdings, or open interest, has materialised in contracts to sell oil - or puts - at $60 to $65 a barrel between October 2018 and December 2020. This position has grown by nearly 45,000 lots to 140,000 lots, or 140 million barrels of oil.     A month ago, the amount of open interest in calls maturing in this time period outnumbered that of puts by nearly three to one. This ratio is now down to two to one. “If we are right about oil going from $75 to $150 over the next 12 to 18 months, out-of-the-money oil options, further down the curve ... look very exciting. The pay back there is just fantastic if we are right,” Westbeck’s Smith said.

After three weeks of heavy pounding, Turkey’s lira finally got some respite as signs the country’s authorities were trying to address the situation triggered a 5 percent relief rally to 6.5 per dollar. Yet it had lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and nerves were briefly tested again as Turkey’s President Tayyip Erdogan urged Turks to boycott U.S. electronic products in response to recent criticism from Washington. The rot also stopped for the South African rand, the Russian rouble and the Brazilian real. Argentina’s central bank unexpectedly raised interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday. Even so, the peso hit a record low. “These things get very volatile in both directions once you have had a really big move,” Saxo bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy said. “To suggest this thing is over, you would have to see that Turkey is isolated... I’m not there yet and I don’t think the market is there yet.” European shares also steadied after two days of selling as anxieties over contagion from the Turkish currency crisis eased. After falling to a 21-month low on Monday, euro zone bank stocks initially rose 0.8 before slipping back again, while the cross-sector pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark and Wall Street futures both climbed. Sentiment was helped as data showed that Europe’s largest economy, Germany, picked up more steam than expected in Q2 , although the markets’ bounce might have been stronger had surveys from China not proved softer than expected. Chinese retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all grew by less than forecast in July, a triple dose of disappointment that underlined the argument for more policy stimulus in China as trade risks also intensify. The Shanghai blue-chip index closed down 0.5 percent and weighed on MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, which eased 0.1 percent. Moves elsewhere were mixed. Japan’s Nikkei rose 2.3 percent and Australian stocks added 0.8 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were still a fraction higher and 10-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent. Investors were encouraged that U.S. declines had been only minor on Monday after the losses by the lira and other emerging-market currencies. The Dow ended Monday down 0.5 percent, the S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq fell 0.25 percent. MSCI’s benchmark emerging market equities index touched its lowest level since July 2017 in Asian trading though, taking losses since late January to just shy of the 20 percent threshold generally accepted to be a ‘bear market’. “The more significant emerging-market concern relates to the risk that regional underperformance becomes a source of disruption through swings in capital flows and currencies,” said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual. “While the focus at present is on Turkey, where currency depreciation and rising rates has translated into a marked tightening of financial conditions, it could spread to Mexico, Brazil and India.” Sherwood cited the NAFTA negotiations as a key risk for Mexico and upcoming elections in Brazil and India as potential threats for those two markets. For graphics on wider market impact of Turkish lira crash click The day’s rise in risk appetite saw bond yields in Spain and Italy dip, although the euro was still struggling at $1.1407 , having touched its lowest since July 2017 on Monday. It also reached one-year lows against the yen and Swiss franc, safe harbours in times of stress. The dollar was a touch firmer at 110.89 yen, having hit a six-week trough around 110.10 on Monday. Against a basket of currencies, the U.S. currency was barely budged at 96.300. In commodity markets, gold briefly slid to its lowest since late January 2017. It was last at $1,195 an ounce. U.S. government data last week showed that gold speculators had lifted their bearish bets to a record. Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York’s SPDR Gold Trust GLD, have dropped about 10 percent from their April peak and are at their lowest since February 2016. Oil prices rose after a report from OPEC confirmed that top exporter Saudi Arabia had cut production to avert looming oversupply.

2018-08-14,"OSLO (Reuters) - British renewable energy investor Quercus said it will halt the construction of a 500 million euro (445.9 million pounds) solar power plant in Iran due to recently imposed U.S. sanctions on Tehran. The solar plant in Iran would have been the first renewable energy investment outside Europe by Quercus and the world’s sixth largest, with a 600 megawatt (MW) capacity. Iran has been trying to increase the share of renewable-produced electricity in its energy mix, partly due to air pollution and to meet international commitments, hoping to have about 5 gigawatt in renewables installed by 2022. In June, before the U.S.-imposed sanctions, more than 250 companies had signed agreements to add and sell power from about 4 gigawatt of new renewables in the country, which has only 602 MW installed, Iranian energy ministry data showed. Washington reimposed sanctions last week after pulling out of a 2015 international deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear programme in return for an easing of economic sanctions.  U.S. president Donald Trump has also threatened to penalise companies that continue to operate in Iran, which led banks and many companies around the world to scale back their dealings with Tehran. “Following the U.S. sanctions on Iran, we have decided to cease all activities in the country, including our 600 MW project. We will continue to monitor the situation closely,” Quercus chief executive Diego Biasi said in an email on Tuesday. The firm will continue to monitor the situation closely, said Biasi, who declined to comment further. Last year Quercus said it would set up a project company and sell shares via a private placement after attracting interest from private and institutional investors, including sovereign wealth funds. Construction was expected to take three years, with each 100 MW standalone lot becoming operational and connecting to the grid every six months. Independently-owned Quercus has a portfolio of around 28 renewable energy plants and 235 MW of installed capacity. The firm, founded by Biasi and Simone Borla in 2010, controls five investment funds and has a network of “highly regarded external partners,” it says on its website. The 600 MW plant it aimed to construct in Iran would be the firm’s largest investment. Quercus declined to comment on the details of its decision to cease the plan and on any financial losses that could result from it. Fearing the consequences of the U.S. embargo, a string of European companies have recently announced they would scale back their business in Iran. On Tuesday, German engineering group Bilfinger (GBFG.DE), said it did not plan to sign any new business in the country, while automotive supplier Duerr (DUEG.DE) on Aug. 11 said it had halted activities in Iran. Another project, planned by Norway’s Saga Energy, which said last October it aimed to build 2 GW of new solar energy capacity in Iran and to start construction by the end of 2018, has also stalled. Saga Energy’s chief of operations Rune Haaland told Reuters it was still working on getting the funding, which is more complicated since recent developments, and although it aimed to push on with its plans, construction could be delayed.

Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said a 7.5 percent import tariff would be applied to 500 consumer goods, including those bought online, in a bid to curb imports. In addition, she said energy projects at state companies that require a large amount of imports would be delayed. “With these, we hope our current account deficit ... can be lowered significantly,” Indrawati told a news briefing after a cabinet meeting. She made the announcement after President Joko Widodo urged his ministers to make “real progress” to reduce the current account deficit and maintain the rupiah exchange rate at “a fair level”. “Although we understand they will affect several sectors, these stabilisation measures ... will maintain Indonesia’s economic stability to face foreigners’ perception against the condition in emerging markets,” Indrawati added. Indonesia has seen a market selloff intensify after a report on Friday showed its current account deficit had widened to 3 percent of GDP in the second quarter, the highest in nearly four years. After plunging by more than 1 percent on Monday, the rupiah on Tuesday hit its weakest level since October 2015, at 14,630 a dollar, before recovering slightly. The yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond was 8.007 percent on Tuesday, the highest since December 2016, as investors were also spooked by the currency turmoil in Turkey. Indonesia’s stock benchmark fell to its lowest in over a month after losing around 5 percent so far this week. Indonesia’s central bank intervened to defend the rupiah on Monday and again on Tuesday conducted auctions for cheaper foreign exchange swap contracts to reduce hedging costs. Bank Indonesia (BI) will expand its swaps to not only U.S. dollars, but also euro, yen and yuan daily to allow commercial banks to reswap any contract they offer to corporate clients in those currencies, Governor Perry Wariyo told the news briefing. BI is due to announce its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday. It has raised the rate by 100 basis points since mid-May to defend the rupiah, but is expected to hold, a Reuters poll showed. A majority of analysts forecast BI would hold, but five who initially had pencilled in a hold changed their views to expect a 25-basis point hike after the rupiah’s fall. BI has spent billions of dollars to defend the currency. Foreign exchange reserves had declined $13.7 billion from February through July, as BI sought to stabilise the rupiah. Analysts say running a current account deficit is fine as long as a country attracts enough foreign direct investment (FDI). But Indonesia funds its gap with portfolio investment, since it does not receive enough FDI. On Tuesday, the investment board reported FDI into Indonesia contracted for the first time since at least 2011 in the second quarter from a year earlier. The investment board’s chief, Tom Lembong, attributed the decline to project suspensions as investors remain cautious on the financial and political outlook. Indonesia will hold parliamentary and presidential elections in 2019. The government previously announced a plan to widen the use of biodiesel starting September and delay some infrastructure projects to reduce imports. Separately, energy ministry spokesman Agung Pribadi said the government is drafting a regulation to require oil contractors to sell crude output to state energy company Pertamina to help support the rupiah. Contractors, such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil , currently split their crude output with the government and are allowed to export their share.

2018-08-14,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Marcelo Teixeira ITAÍ, Brazil, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Last year, Brazilian farmer Gustavo Lopes sized up his sugarcane plantation against his soybean fields. He looked at global trends, including rising U.S.-China trade tensions and a stubborn sugar-market glut. Then he tore up the last of his cane fields and ditched a decades-old supply contract with a local sugar mill. Lopes planted soybeans across his 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) farm in Sao Paulo state - a bet that paid off earlier this month when Chinese buyers loaded up on South American soy after Beijing imposed tariffs on U.S. beans. The farmer got his highest price ever for soybeans. “It was unusual for this time of year,” Lopes said in an interview at his farm, where he’s prepping to plant another soy crop in September. “It’s got to be a result of Chinese demand.” Shifting trade flows are redefining the Brazilian landscape, spurring more farmers to align their crops with Chinese appetites. The nation’s soy plantings have expanded by 2 million hectares in two years - an area the size of New Jersey - while land used for cane shrank by nearly 400,000 hectares, according to government data. China’s growing demand for meat has supercharged soy imports for animal feed. The Asian nation paid $20.3 billion last year for 53.8 million tonnes of soybeans from Brazil, nearly half its output — and up from 22.8 million tonnes in 2012. A new 25 percent Chinese tariff on U.S. soybeans - a retaliation for U.S. levies by President Donald Trump - is expected to boost Brazil’s soy exports to an all-time record this year. Brazilian soybean exports to China rose to nearly 36 million tonnes in the first half of 2018, up 6 percent from a year ago. In July, they surged 46 percent from the same month a year earlier to 10.2 million tonnes. Brazil’s grains boom has it rivaling United States as the world’s top soy producer this year, after outpacing U.S. exports over the past five years. All that soy is eating into Brazil’s sugarcane belt, which is reeling from sugar prices near multi-year lows. Chinese sugar tariffs have weighed on the global market for the sweetener as developed nations continue to cut back consumption. “We lost 3,000 hectares of cane area to grains in the last two years,” said Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, chief executive of Nova América, one of the largest cane growers in Brazil, managing 110,000 hectares. Rezende said he had seen farmers migrating from sugarcane into grains in nearly every state where both crops are viable. The crop swap is catching on quickly with farmers, threatening the survival of cane mills they once supplied. About 60 cane mills have closed in the past five years in Brazil’s center-south cane region. About 270 that remain open must fight harder than ever to secure cane supplies. Agroconsult, an agribusiness consultancy, said it has received requests from mills to calculate the premium they will have to pay producers to keep them from switching to grains. Douglas Duarte, a director at the Londra mill in Itaí - which used to lease part of the Lopes farm - said he has plans to add 500,000 tonnes of capacity at the mill but has yet to line up enough cane supplies. With so many farmers focused on grain, Duarte has worked to sign leases with families who are not interested in actively managing their land. “In places where the owners have expertise with grains — the equipment and everything — then you can’t compete,” he said. In some places, the closing of cane mills has also discouraged planting. Farmer Antonio de Morais Ribeiro Neto gave up planting cane last year after the closure of the sugar mill that he supplied, called Usina Maracaju. Biosev SA, the Brazilian sugar arm of global commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co, shut it down in a cost-cutting move. So Riberio replaced 400 hectares of cane with soybeans, adding to the 2,000 hectares of soy he already had planted. As he watched the U.S.-China trade war escalate, he bought two new grain silos, more soybean-planting machinery and a new harvester. Plenty of sugar mills, which often grow part of the cane they process, have realized they cannot fight the soy boom and decided to plant their own soybeans as part of a crop rotation strategy. Cane fields typically need to be replanted after five or six years, and mills are using the renovation window to produce soybeans. “In the past, those areas subject to renovation would be left fallow until the following year,” said Victor Campanelli, who has exploited the niche. His firm, Agro Pastoril Paschoal Campanelli, manages the planning, inputs and equipment for sugar mills’ one-off soy crops, sharing in the profits. While the grains bonanza has many farmers flush with cash, some are wary about relying so much on one crop and one massive importer. “This Chinese demand has attracted all the farmers,” said Marcos Cesar Brunozzi, who switched part of his land from sugar to grains in the state of Minas Gerais. “I hope the whole situation doesn’t change suddenly, because we are betting big.” Lopes has no regrets about tearing up his cane fields. Last year, his sugarcane yielded a net profit of 480 reais per hectare - compared to 2,600 reais per hectare for his soy fields. “I know it won’t always be that way,” he said. “But still, it’s a huge difference.” Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira

2018-08-14,"* Contract price up nearly 30 pct from deal a year earlier * Chugoku, Shikoku, others settle Glencore deals -sources * Tohoku, Glencore in preliminary talks on Oct-Sept deal -sources (Adds preliminary talks between Tohoku and Glencore in paragraph 19) By Yuka Obayashi TOKYO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Japanese utilities and global mining giant Glencore have settled an Australian thermal coal import contract for April 2018-March 2019 at $110 a tonne, according to several people with knowledge of the matter. The deals were struck between Glencore and Japanese utilities such as Shikoku Electric, Chugoku Electric and Kansai Electric after bilateral talks, a source at a Japanese coal buyer said, requesting anonymity as he was not allowed to speak in public about commercial deals. Glencore did not respond to a request for comment. A Chugoku Electric spokesman confirmed the utility struck some annual contracts at $110 a tonne with Glencore, but said other deals were agreed at different levels or index-linked prices. Shikoku Electric said it settled the April-March contract with Glencore last month but declined to disclose the price. Kansai Electric declined to comment. “We’ve agreed with Glencore at $110 per tonne for the April-March contract late last month,” said another source at a utility directly involved in the talks, also declining to be named. A trader with a major commodity merchant also confirmed the deals. The deal marks a breakthrough after Japan’s Tohoku Electric and Glencore, the world’s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, failed earlier this year to agree an annual supply deal that has in the past been used as an industry benchmark. The contractual price came in nearly 30 percent higher than an annual supply price a year earlier, and 16 percent above a deal for October 2017-September 2018, reflecting a tighter global market for the world’s dominant power generation fuel. Australian spot thermal coal cargo prices have hit several six-year highs in recent months, and at $120 per tonne remain a third above this year’s lows in April, pushed up by a summer heatwave across the northern hemisphere as well as output cuts in China, the world’s biggest consumer of coal. The deals between Japanese utilities and Glencore give coal markets welcome clarity after Tohoku and Glencore abandoned their talks on an annual contract that traditionally set prices for the region. With annual imports of around 115 million tonnes, Japan is one of the world’s biggest importers of thermal coal. Its utilities buy around 40 percent of all Australian thermal coal exports. But volumes under the long-term contract have been declining as utilities try to diversify supply sources and trade more in the spot market as part of Japan’s energy market liberalisation. Still, miners say term contracts will remain important. “End users like to have a mix of spot exposure and they like to have some certainty in their portfolios - as, I have to say, producers also benefit from,” Paul Flynn, Chief Executive at Whitehaven Coal said in an earnings conference call on Tuesday. Japan is Whitehaven’s biggest customer. “Despite the gyrations that you’ve seen over the last 18 months and two years, in particular, with the setting of those prices, I think both sides of that equation continue to have a commitment to maintain both pricing regimes.” In a sign the decades-old practice of buyers and miners bilaterally working out a fixed price will continue, Tohoku and Glencore have already begun preliminary talks on an October 2018-September 2019 annual contract, multiple sources said.

2018-08-14,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Buyout group Carlyle (CG.O) is starting preparations for a stock market listing of German speciality chemicals group Atotech, a former part of oil group Total (TOTF.PA) which could be valued at around $5 billion (£3.92 billion), people close to the matter said.  The private equity investor has asked investment banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering which is expected to take place in New York next year, two of the people said, while another person said a German IPO was also a possibility.  Carlyle declined to comment.  Atotech, a Berlin-based maker of speciality chemicals and equipment for printed circuit boards and semiconductors, posted adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $329 million on sales of $1.2 billion last year.     Carlyle bought Atotech in 2016 at an enterprise value of $3.2 billion or 12 times its core earnings. The investor would likely seek a valuation of at least 13-14 times Atotech’s expected core profit of up to $400 million, or roughly $5 billion, two of the people said.  U.S.-listed peers such as Cabot Microelectronics (CCMP.O), Entegris (ENTG.O), Quaker Chemical (KWR.N) and Versum Materials (VSM.N) trade at 11-15 times their expected core earnings. “For Carlyle, it’s about taking some money off the table and using a window of opportunity ahead of a potential correction of stock markets,” one of the people said, adding that the deal could take place in the second quarter, based on 2018 earnings. Earlier this year, Atotech increased its debt by $500 million to pay its owners a special dividend of the same amount. [nL2N1SU26R] While a listing is seen as the most likely exit route, Carlyle will also consider potential bids from chemicals groups or other investors, the people said.  At the time of Carlyle’s buyout, peers such as Umicore (UMI.BR) and Sinochem (600500.SS) showed interest in the firm which is specialised in metallization, panel plating and corrosion protection. Atotech, which was founded in 1993 through a merger of Elf Atochem M&T Harshaw and Schering’s (BAYGn.DE) electroplating division, employs more than 4,000 staff.

2018-08-14,"KUALA LUMPUR/BEIJING (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad arrives in China on Friday seeking to renegotiate, and perhaps cancel, billions of dollars worth of Chinese-invested projects entangled in domestic graft probes. Ties have been strained since a stunning election victory returned Mahathir to power in May and he suspended unpopular Chinese projects authorised by former premier Najib Razak. During his decade-long rule, Najib courted Chinese investment and was a cheerleader for President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in southeast Asia. But Mahathir has vowed to discuss the “unfair” deals on his visit. “Where we can drop the project, we will,” the 93-year-old  told reporters this week. “But we may have to postpone some because we have made agreements, and to breach the agreements will cost us a lot.”  The centrepiece of China’s infrastructure push in Malaysia is the ambitious $20-billion East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project, work on which has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations. Hit by ballooning costs, lack of transparency and the risk it could saddle Malaysia with uncomfortably large debt, the 688-km (428-mile) project has come to symbolise Najib’s scandal-ridden administration. Najib, charged with money laundering and corruption over state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) [TERRN.UL], has denied wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty to all charges.  During his election campaign, Mahathir was critical of the benefits of the Chinese projects, which helped him win. His government also halted work on two projects worth more than $2.3 billion awarded to the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau  that have been linked to graft at 1MDB. “China has been very spooked by Mahathir’s election,” said a Malaysian official familiar with talks before the visit, speaking on condition of anonymity. China is nervous that Malaysia wants to cancel the projects, “but we just want to reassess them,” the official added. Mahathir’s trip is set to run until Tuesday, but he will first visit the eastern city of Hangzhou to meet e-commerce giant Alibaba’s chief Jack Ma before flying to Beijing, the source said.  China’s eagerness to save the BRI from another embarrassing setback leads some analysts to believe it might be open to striking a pragmatic compromise with Malaysia. “They don’t want a failure to taint their name,” said one Malaysian source involved in the contract reviews. “They don’t want to be involved in a project that is clear-cut corruption.”  Other major projects that have hit hurdles include a rail link from Indonesia’s capital of Jakarta to southeastern Bandung and the ports of Hambantota in Sri Lanka and Gwadar in Pakistan. “The Chinese are open to ideas and negotiation in many BRI countries where projects run into problems,” said Abdul Majid Ahmad Khan, president of Kuala Lumpur’s Malaysia-China Friendship Association. “But Malaysia has to be clear on what it wants.” Mahathir has courted Japan in recent weeks, announcing plans for a big yen-denominated loan when he visited Tokyo.  His shift away from China is also seen as an opportunity for the United States, worried at Beijing’s growing regional clout  and building of islands in the South China Sea.       But for Malaysia to distance itself from biggest trading partner China would further hurt its economy, sluggish under massive debt. “The domestic politics and change in government delivered a shock to the bilateral relationship, at the very least it has increased uncertainty and risk,” said Pang Zhongying, an international relations expert at the Ocean University of China, adding that the changes had inspired caution. Residents of Malaysia’s placid coastal town of Kuantan hoped the ECRL, launched a year ago, would boost economic activity through the link to the Malacca Strait, a key shipping lane.   “The east coast people want (the ECRL),” said Andy Chiew, a Kuantan-based official of the Malaysia-China Chamber of Commerce.   But for now, the project has hit the buffers.

2018-08-14,"FUKUSHIMA, Japan (Reuters) - A statue of a child wearing what appears to be a hazardous material suit unveiled near the site of a Japanese nuclear disaster has drawn a barrage of criticism from residents and forced the sculptor to apologise. The 6.2-metre high statue, “Sun Child”, was put up in the city of Fukushima, north of Tokyo, this month and shows a child in what appears to be a bright yellow “hazmat” suit holding a helmet in one arm. On the child’s chest is a radiation counter reading zero. A major earthquake and tsunami on March 11, 2011, led to meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since the Chernobyl accident in 1986. Many thousands of people were displaced by leaking radiation and many have still been unable to return home. Residents said the statue would only prolong the painful memories of an accident that seemed destined to forever link the name Fukushima with nuclear disaster. “I don’t think Fukushima will be able to escape from its tainted reputation, so I understand what the sculptor wanted to say,” said Ikue Tsunoda. “However, residents don’t wear hazmat suits, so I think that was provocative,” she said. Sculptor Kenji Yanobe said he had worked on the theme of radioactivity since 1991, as a way of showing how difficult it was for humans to deal with nuclear power.  He said he wanted to show the air was now safe - the child in is shown with the helmet off, and the counter on its chest points to zero, though he said he was sorry the work had disturbed people. “I sincerely apologise to those who were upset by my artwork,” Yanobe said in a statement on his website. City officials sought to smooth over the controversy. “The statue represents the future free from nuclear disaster,” said Mariko Furukawa, manager of the city’s Board of Education. Some 18,000 people were killed by the 2011 earthquake, most of them by the tsunami waves that swept ashore.

2018-08-14,"(Adds details from wholesale markets for power, CO2) FRANKFURT, Aug 14 (Reuters) - RWE sold the bulk of its power generated from nuclear and brown coal-fired plants from 2018 and the following three years at prices well below current levels, company data showed on Tuesday. The German utility sold more than 90 percent of production in both 2018 and 2019 at 28 euros ($31.98) per megawatt hour (MWh), according to slides prepared for an analyst call on the company’s first-half results. More than 90 percent of 2020 output was sold at 29 euros and more than 40 percent of 2021 was also sold at 29 euros. By comparison, wholesale market prices for German 2019 baseload power currently stand at a record 46.35 euros, according to Thomson Reuters data. The 2020 and 2021 contracts stand at 43.30 and 42.15 euros respectively. Energy traders track hedge rates to assess the size of future volumes tied up with counterparties and the value of forward production. Electricity output from RWE last year fetched 31 euros/MWh. The volume of the 2018 position amounts to 85-90 terawatt hours (TWh). RWE, which is exposed to mandatory European carbon emissions rights prices due to its coal-heavy portfolio with high CO2 emissions, also said its CO2 position was financially hedged until the end of 2022. The implied price at which it covered its output with emissions allowances was good news, ranging between 5 to 6 euros a tonne CO2 for 2018 through 2021, when the present price of CO2 for expiry Dec. 2018 has shot up to 18.09 euros. RWE also produces electricity in hard coal and gas-fired power stations across EU countries and stands to become a big player in renewables in an asset swap deal with rival E.ON . RWE also sells ahead power generated from hard coal and gas but closer to delivery dates, and said it benefitted there a little from the recovery in prices, although it also had to pay higher fuel costs. European wholesale power forwards have risen by over a third since February, due to strong long-term prices of related fuels and carbon, which has firmed on EU market reforms aimed at incentivising emissions cuts to protect the climate.

2018-08-14,"* MSCI ex-Japan subdued but Nikkei bounces 2.3 pct * China data mostly softer than forecast, economy cools * Turkish lira holds for the moment, but crisis not over * Euro finds some support, yen and Swiss franc favoured * Gold loses safe-haven status, near 13-month low By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Asian share markets fought to regain their footing on Tuesday as tremors from the collapse of the Turkish lira ebbed, though sentiment took a fresh knock when Chinese economic data proved softer than expected. Retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all grew by less than forecast in July, a trifecta of disappointment that underlined the need for more policy stimulus in China even as trade risks intensify. The Shanghai blue chip index was off 0.9 percent and weighing on MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan which eased 0.25 percent. Moves elsewhere were mixed, with Japan’s Nikkei the shining star in Asia rising 2.3 percent. Australian stocks added 0.8 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were still a fraction firmer, while 10-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent . Spreadbetters pointed to a strong start for the European market with London’s FTSE futures up 0.3 percent. Investors had been encouraged that falls on Wall Street were only minor overnight. The Dow ended Monday down 0.5 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq 0.25 percent. Turkey’s lira found a moment’s respite at 6.70 per dollar , up 2.6 percent, after the central bank said it would provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for banks. Yet it still lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and has shed more than two-fifths of its value so far in 2018. The rot spread to the South African rand and the Argentine peso. Argentina’s central bank surprised by raising interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday, but it was still not enough to stop the peso hitting a record low. “The more significant emerging market concern relates to the risk that regional underperformance becomes a source of disruption through swings in capital flows and currencies,” said Matt Sherwood, head of investment strategy at Perpetual. “While the focus at present is on Turkey where currency depreciation and rising rates has translated into a marked tightening of financial conditions, it could spread to Mexico, Brazil and India.” Sherwood cited the NAFTA negotiations as a key risk for Mexico and upcoming elections in Brazil and India as potential threats for those two markets.

2018-08-14,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state-run oil and chemicals group Sinochem is in advanced talks to transfer its 33.6 percent stake in a debt-laden refinery to state giant PetroChina (0857.HK), part of Sinochem’s plan to shed non-core assets ahead of a $2 billion listing of its energy arm, people briefed on the matter said.  The move is in line with a transformational strategy pushed by Sinochem chairman Ning Gaoning to zero in on core assets as it finalises a merger with ChemChina that will create the world’s biggest industrial chemicals firm, worth around $120 billion (£94 billion). It isn’t yet clear what the valuation of the stake in the export-focused 200,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) West Pacific Petrochemical Corp (WEPEC) refinery will be, the people said.   Two sources, who have knowledge of WEPEC’s finances, estimated the refinery’s debt exceeded assets of around 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) by nearly 50 percent at end-2017, due to deep losses in 2008 and 2014, even after refining margins improved over the past few years.  PetroChina has a stake of about 28 percent in WEPEC.  Though advanced, the talks on a deal may still take months or longer to reach a conclusion, they said, declined to be named as the discussions were not public. Majority control of WEPEC could help PetroChina consolidate its dominance in the northeast China fuel market and pave the way for future plant upgrades.  Both Sinochem and PetroChina declined to comment. “Sinochem has two main reasons to leave (WEPEC) - the plant’s poor balance sheet, which is not going to help Sinochem’s (energy unit) IPO,” one person said. “Despite being its single-largest shareholder in the refinery, Sinochem does not have a domestic offtake deal to manage its share of fuel production, leaving it primarily as a financial investor.”      PetroChina manages and operates WEPEC, based in northeastern port city Dalian. As well as Sinochem, other stakeholders include France’s Total (TOTF.PA), with 22.4 percent, and local firms backed by the Dalian government. Total itself previously sought to exit WEPEC after nearly two decades of investment, according to people familiar with the matter, and industry sources close to Total said the French firm still intends to pull out. A Total official in Beijing couldn't immediately be reached for comment. (reut.rs/2M9H2Ih)   In exchange for its exit, Sinochem has asked for a role as WEPEC’s agent for crude oil imports and refined fuel exports under a 10-year deal, according to four people briefed on the talks.  Sinochem’s plan comes with private chemicals giant Hengli Group set to start up a mega-refinery and petrochemical complex also in Dalian later this year. That facility, costing some $10 billion, consists of a giant 400,000-bpd crude oil processor and a 1 million tonne-per-year ethylene plant. The Hengli venture, to be followed by a similar integrated complex being built by private group Zhejiang Rongsheng Group on the east coast, is set to shake up the country’s refining industry, long-dominated by state giants like PetroChina.   Reflecting the changing landscape, Sinochem last January teamed up with Hengli to procure crude oil and marketing refined fuel for the private upstart. It also plans to expand its fully owned Quanzhou refinery in south China, a top source of profits over the past two years.

2018-08-14,"ITAÍ, Brazil (Reuters) - Last year, Brazilian farmer Gustavo Lopes sized up his sugarcane plantation against his soybean fields. He looked at global trends, including rising U.S.-China trade tensions and a stubborn sugar-market glut. Then he tore up the last of his cane fields and ditched a decades-old supply contract with a local sugar mill. Lopes planted soybeans across his 1,600-hectare (4,000-acre) farm in Sao Paulo state - a bet that paid off earlier this month when Chinese buyers loaded up on South American soy after Beijing imposed tariffs on U.S. beans. The farmer got his highest price ever for soybeans. “It was unusual for this time of year,” Lopes said in an interview at his farm, where he’s prepping to plant another soy crop in September. “It’s got to be a result of Chinese demand.” Shifting trade flows are redefining the Brazilian landscape, spurring more farmers to align their crops with Chinese appetites. The nation’s soy plantings have expanded by 2 million hectares in two years - an area the size of New Jersey - while land used for cane shrank by nearly 400,000 hectares, according to government data. China’s growing demand for meat has supercharged soy imports for animal feed. The Asian nation paid $20.3 billion last year for 53.8 million tonnes of soybeans from Brazil, nearly half its output — and up from 22.8 million tonnes in 2012. A new 25 percent Chinese tariff on U.S. soybeans - a retaliation for U.S. levies by President Donald Trump - is expected to boost Brazil’s soy exports to an all-time record this year. Brazilian soybean exports to China rose to nearly 36 million tonnes in the first half of 2018, up 6 percent from a year ago. In July, they surged 46 percent from the same month a year earlier to 10.2 million tonnes. Brazil’s grains boom has it rivaling United States as the world’s top soy producer this year, after outpacing U.S. exports over the past five years. All that soy is eating into Brazil’s sugarcane belt, which is reeling from sugar prices near multi-year lows. Chinese sugar tariffs have weighed on the global market for the sweetener as developed nations continue to cut back consumption. “We lost 3,000 hectares of cane area to grains in the last two years,” said Roberto de Rezende Barbosa, chief executive of Nova América, one of the largest cane growers in Brazil, managing 110,000 hectares. Rezende said he had seen farmers migrating from sugarcane into grains in nearly every state where both crops are viable. The crop swap is catching on quickly with farmers, threatening the survival of cane mills they once supplied. About 60 cane mills have closed in the past five years in Brazil’s center-south cane region. About 270 that remain open must fight harder than ever to secure cane supplies. Agroconsult, an agribusiness consultancy, said it has received requests from mills to calculate the premium they will have to pay producers to keep them from switching to grains. Douglas Duarte, a director at the Londra mill in Itaí - which used to lease part of the Lopes farm - said he has plans to add 500,000 tonnes of capacity at the mill but has yet to line up enough cane supplies.  With so many farmers focused on grain, Duarte has worked to sign leases with families who are not interested in actively managing their land. “In places where the owners have expertise with grains — the equipment and everything — then you can’t compete,” he said. In some places, the closing of cane mills has also discouraged planting.  Farmer Antonio de Morais Ribeiro Neto gave up planting cane last year after the closure of the sugar mill that he supplied, called Usina Maracaju. Biosev SA (BSEV3.SA), the Brazilian sugar arm of global commodities trader Louis Dreyfus Co, shut it down in a cost-cutting move. So Riberio replaced 400 hectares of cane with soybeans, adding to the 2,000 hectares of soy he already had planted. As he watched the U.S.-China trade war escalate, he bought two new grain silos, more soybean-planting machinery and a new harvester. Plenty of sugar mills, which often grow part of the cane they process, have realized they cannot fight the soy boom and decided to plant their own soybeans as part of a crop rotation strategy. Cane fields typically need to be replanted after five or six years, and mills are using the renovation window to produce soybeans. “In the past, those areas subject to renovation would be left fallow until the following year,” said Victor Campanelli, who has exploited the niche. His firm, Agro Pastoril Paschoal Campanelli, manages the planning, inputs and equipment for sugar mills’ one-off soy crops, sharing in the profits. While the grains bonanza has many farmers flush with cash, some are wary about relying so much on one crop and one massive importer.  “This Chinese demand has attracted all the farmers,” said Marcos Cesar Brunozzi, who switched part of his land from sugar to grains in the state of Minas Gerais. “I hope the whole situation doesn’t change suddenly, because we are betting big.”  Lopes has no regrets about tearing up his cane fields. Last year, his sugarcane yielded a net profit of 480 reais per hectare - compared to 2,600 reais per hectare for his soy fields. “I know it won’t always be that way,” he said. “But still, it’s a huge difference.” Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira; Editing by Brad Haynes and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-grains-sugar/brazils-farmers-dump-sugar-for-soy-as-trade-war-boosts-chinese-demand-idUKL8N1UE61J,14 Aug 2018,"Last year, Brazilian farmer

The country produced 281.5 million tonnes of coal in July, down 2 percent from the same month last year and the lowest since September 2016, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. The drop came as a heatwave scorched the nation, prolonging a hotter-than-average summer and helping push coal imports to their highest in 4-1/2 years. That underscores the challenge for China as it aims to wean the nation off its favourite fuel as part of its war on smog. The sizzling weather boosted output of thermal electricity, generated almost entirely by coal-fired capacity and the country’s main source of power, along with hydropower. “Coal miners were not under big pressure to ensure coal supplies this summer since China bought lots of coal from the overseas market while stocks at ports have been at a high level,” said Wang Fei, coal analyst at Huaan Futures. Futures for delivery in January were on Tuesday up 0.32 percent at their highest since early July. Chinese coal output over the first seven months of 2018 reached 1.98 billion tonnes, up 3.4 percent compared with the same period last year, the data showed on Tuesday. The production of coke used in steelmaking fell 4.3 percent in July to 35.51 million tonnes, its lowest since December 2017. Year-to-date output was 247.46 million tonnes, down 3.3 percent.

Refinery throughput last month reached 50.95 million tonnes, or 11.95 million barrels per day (bpd), according to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics. That compared to 12.11 million bpd in June. For the first seven months of 2018, refinery production climbed 9.2 percent year-on-year to 350.57 million tonnes, or 12.07 million bpd, the data showed. Facing strict government scrutiny on taxes since March and oil prices near $70 a barrel, independent plants, sometimes known as ‘teapots’, were forced to scale back operations over the second quarter, many taking advantage of the adverse market conditions to carry out maintenances, analysts said. Crude oil output in July dropped 2.6 percent on-year to 15.85 million tonnes, or 3.73 million bpd. That marked the lowest daily rate since at least June 2011, and was down from the previous month’s level of 3.86 million bpd, according to the official data. Production over the first seven months of 2018 fell 2.1 percent to 109.95 million tonnes. But crude output has this year been declining more slowly than in 2017 as companies step up developments to cash in on the higher crude oil prices. Natural gas output in July rose 10.5 percent on-year to 13 billion cubic metres, while production over the first seven months was up 5.5 percent from last year at 90.5 bcm. State energy producers face geological and technical challenges in boosting production fast enough to cover rapid demand growth, with imports of the fuel growing more than a third in the first half of the year. National oil majors last week pledged to expand investment in domestic oil and gas exploration and production, in response to President Xi Jinping’s call to boost national energy security.

Retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all grew by less than forecast in July, a trifecta of disappointment that underlined the need for more policy stimulus in China. The Shanghai blue chip index was off 0.6 percent and weighing on MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan which eased 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei held onto its early 1.1 percent gain, while Australian stocks added 0.8 percent. EMini futures for the S&P 500 were still a fraction firmer, while 10-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent. Investors had been encouraged that falls on Wall Street were only minor overnight. The Dow ended Monday down 0.5 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq 0.25 percent. Turkey’s lira found a moment’s respite at 6.9250 per dollar after the country’s central bank said it would provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for banks. Yet it still lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and has shed more than two-fifths of its value so far in 2018. The rot spread to the South African rand and the Argentine peso. Argentina’s central bank surprised by raising interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday, but it was still not enough to stop the peso hitting a record low. JPMorgan economist David Hensley argued that strains in most other emerging markets (EM) would be contained. “Negative developments in Turkey will likely be eventually seen, along with Argentina, as isolated given their exceptional external imbalances compared to most EM countries,” he said. “Nonetheless, we are mindful of political risk elsewhere in the EM involving Russia as well as Brazil, Mexico, and even India.” For now, concerns about the exposure of European banks to Turkey pushed up bond yields in Spain and Italy and hobbled the euro.

2018-08-14,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s heavily subsidized domestic gasoline prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses due to fuel smuggling, President Nicolas Maduro said in a televised address on Monday. “Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,” Maduro said in a televised address. Venezuela, like most oil producing countries, has for decades subsidized fuel as a benefit to consumers. But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1,000,000 percent this year. That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can now fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times. Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2 million bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported. Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighboring countries. Maduro said the government would still provide “direct subsidies” to citizens holding the “fatherland card,” a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services. He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.

Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $72.87 per barrel at 0111 GMT, up 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 32 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $67.52 per barrel. In July, Saudi Arabia told the producer group of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that it had cut production by 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.288 million bpd. OPEC’s monthly report published on Monday, which uses data from secondary sources, confirmed the Saudi cut, which traders said triggered crude’s upward move early on Tuesday. That came despite the Saudi move coming in anticipation of a slowdown in oil demand. The OPEC report said it expected world oil demand to grow by 1.43 million bpd in 2019, down from 1.64 million bpd in 2018. OPEC said the demand slowdown would come on the back of potentially lower economic growth as a result of trade disputes between the United States and China as well as emerging market turmoil.

2018-08-14,"(Repeats Aug. 13 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2MGLCd9 By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 13 (Reuters) - Persistent hedge fund liquidation over the last four months has weighed heavily on the oil market, both spot prices and calendar spreads, ending the previous rally and putting the cyclical upswing into a prolonged pause. Hedge funds resumed their liquidation of bullish long positions in petroleum last week, according to the most recent regulatory and exchange data. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 30 million barrels in the week to Aug. 7. Bullish long positions were reduced by 32 million barrels to 1.021 billion, while bearish short ones were also trimmed by 2 million barrels to 108 million (tmsnrt.rs/2MGLCd9). Net long positions have been cut in 11 of the last 16 weeks, with a total reduction of 380 million barrels, or 27 percent, since April 24. As in previous weeks, liquidation was concentrated in crude, with net positions in Brent cut by 18 million barrels and in ICE and NYMEX WTI by 9 million barrels. Portfolio managers made only very minor changes to net length in U.S. gasoline (-1 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-2 million barrels) and European gasoil (essentially unchanged). Fund managers remain fundamentally bullish on the outlook for oil prices, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a ratio of more than 10:1. But the hedge fund community has become more cautious since late April, when long positions outnumbered shorts by 14:1. Few fund managers are willing to bet on a sustained fall in prices, with short positions across the petroleum complex reduced to their lowest level since at least 2013. Instead, the fund community has gradually squared up some former bullish positions as the upward momentum that carried prices higher for almost 11 months between June 2017 and May 2018 has faded. Rising production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Russia has eased concerns about crude availability later in 2018, despite the prospective imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s exports. Meanwhile, many analysts and traders now anticipate at least a modest slowdown in oil consumption growth as higher oil prices begin to bite and global trade growth decelerates.

2018-08-14,"* Nikkei bounces 1 pct after Wall St losses limited * Turkish lira holds for the moment, but crisis not over * Euro finds some support, yen and Swiss franc favoured * Gold loses safe-haven status, near 13-month low By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Asia share markets tried to regain their footing on Tuesday as tremors from the collapse of the Turkish lira ebbed a little and Wall Street proved resilient to the shockwaves. Japan’s Nikkei led the early running with a gain of 1.0 percent, while Australia added 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat having found support above the July low of 525.52. EMini futures for the S&P 500 edged up 0.2 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields held at 2.88 percent . Investors were encouraged that falls on Wall Street were only minor. The Dow ended Monday down 0.5 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 0.40 percent and the Nasdaq 0.25 percent. Chinese economic data could provide a distraction with July retail sales, industrial output and urban investment all due. Forecasts favour a slight pick up in activity while the outlook should be supported by Beijing’s recent efforts to encourage lending and boost infrastructure spending. Turkey’s lira found a moment’s respite at 6.9500 per dollar after the country’s central bank said it would provide liquidity and cut reserve requirements for banks. Yet it still lost almost 10 percent on Monday alone and has shed more than two-fifths of its value so far in 2018. The rot spread to the South African rand and the Argentine peso. Argentina’s central bank surprised by raising interest rates by 5 percentage points on Monday, but it was still not enough to stop the peso hitting a record low. JPMorgan economist David Hensley argued that strains in most other emerging markets (EM) would be contained. “Negative developments in Turkey will likely be eventually seen, along with Argentina, as isolated given their exceptional external imbalances compared to most EM countries,” he said. “Nonetheless, we are mindful of political risk elsewhere in the EM involving Russia as well as Brazil, Mexico, and even India.” For now, concerns about the exposure of European banks to Turkey pushed up bond yields in Spain and Italy and hobbled the euro. The single currency was last at $1.1398, having touched its lowest since July 2017 on Monday. It also reached one-year lows on the yen and Swiss franc, traditional safe harbours in times of stress. The dollar steadied at 110.63 yen, having hit a six-week trough around 110.11 on Monday. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was a shade softer at 96.338. In commodity markets, gold looked to have lost its safe-haven halo and slid to its lowest since late January 2017. It was last down at $1,1192.66 an ounce. U.S. government data out last week showed that gold speculators had lifted their bearish bets to a record. Holdings of the largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF), New York’s SPDR Gold Trust GLD, have dropped about 10 percent from their April peak and are at their lowest since February 2016. Oil prices inched higher in early Asian trade with Brent up 15 cents at $72.76 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 17 cents to $67.37. Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-08-14,"(Reuters) - California Water Service Group (CWT.N) said on Monday it raised an all-cash offer to buy SJW Group (SJW.N) by nearly 3 percent, the latest attempt to woo its fellow California utility out of a proposed tie-up with Connecticut Water Service Inc (CTWS.O). The trio form part of a four-way merger battle begun in March when SJW announced a planned combination with Connecticut Water, a move that drew local suitors for both businesses who argued regional consolidation was better than a trans-America deal. CalWater’s new offer for SJW of $70 per share, detailed in a market filing, represents a premium of 12 percent to the stock’s Monday close and values the company at about $1.45 billion. That is above the $68.25 bid CalWater made in April, which was rejected by SJW citing regulatory and financing concerns. The new proposal also sweetens terms for SJW by offering it up to two board seats and opening the possibility that SJW management would gain a role in the combined company. CalWater also offered to consider alternative transaction structures - details of which were not disclosed in the statement - as well as an additional $0.50 per share for every quarter the deal was delayed by regulatory approval beyond a set timetable. SJW shares were up 7.3 percent at $66.95 in after-hours trading, while California Water was up 7 percent at $42.90. Responding to CalWater’s offer in a separate filing, SJW said it would “carefully review and consider all aspects of CalWater’s revised proposal.” CalWater’s offer comes a week after SJW said it had agreed to a revised deal with Connecticut Water, in which it would buy the New England utility for $1.1 billion in cash. Connecticut Water has separately attracted interest from Eversource Energy (ES.N), which on Monday said in a statement it remained committed to its $64 per share offer made in July and rejected by Connecticut Water. Water utilities, particularly in California which has experienced severe drought conditions in recent years, often see mergers and acquisitions as a way to increase scale and efficiency.
