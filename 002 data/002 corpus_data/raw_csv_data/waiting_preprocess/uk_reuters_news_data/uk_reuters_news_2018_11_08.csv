2018-11-08,"(Reuters) - Coca-Cola has mastered the business of getting its sweet, fizzy drinks into even the most isolated of Papua New Guinea’s far-flung tropical islands and mountain villages.  But getting the proceeds out of the South Pacific nation is proving much more troublesome, undermining efforts by the host of this month’s APEC meeting to portray itself as an attractive destination for international investment.  Australian-listed Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX), which distributes Coke in the region, recently disclosed it was holding more of PNG's kina PGK= currency than it wanted due to foreign exchange restraints, a complaint echoed by other big businesses. The restrictions, used to prop up the kina by fixing its value in a narrow band, have created a shortage of dollars and a weeks-long queue to buy them. That is stifling business investment and with it, the country’s economic prospects, business leaders say. “For most customers, it has provided an impediment to the growth of their business,” said Robin Fleming, Chief Executive of Bank South Pacific, PNG’s biggest commercial bank and largest foreign exchange dealer. “It’s really strained some of those relationships with their suppliers overseas,” he said on the phone from his office in the dusty seaside capital, Port Moresby. Port Moresby is the venue for this month’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of world leaders and PNG is hoping to use the high-profile event to showcase the nation and its investment credentials. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said earlier this year that after APEC, “everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is” and not confuse it with an African country.     Papua New Guinea has one of the largest economies in the Pacific Islands region, backed by mining, timber, fishing and huge energy reserves. Riding booming commodity prices, the kina touched as high as $0.47 in 2013 but fell as low as $0.33 the following year when the oil price plunged.     Demand for kina also dropped away sharply since the end of construction in 2014 of a giant LNG project led by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N). The dollar shortfall was exacerbated by lower-than-expected tax receipts from the PNG LNG project and disruptions to copper and gold exports. Papua New Guinea’s central bank responded by fixing the currency to a 150 basis point band either side of about $0.41 in June 2014. That made dollars cheaper overnight, driving a spike in demand exceeding meager supplies held locally by exporters. Demand for foreign currency exceeded supply by about $500 million in August, according to Papua New Guinea’s central bank’s most recent policy update. That has left businesses - even those earmarked for priority access to foreign currency such as food, fuel, aviation and medicine - pleading with suppliers to accept late payments. “It does make it a challenge to get the currency you need to import materials,” such as sugar, aluminum tins and plastic bottles, Coca-Cola Amatil’s Sydney-based spokesman Patrick Low said. Meanwhile, CCA’s stockpile of cash in kina jumped by more than a third over the 12 months to June 30 to 687 million kina ($200 million), half-year accounts show. Other businesses find themselves similarly hamstrung. “We need to minimize our purchasing in Australia,” said Ariel Sarangya, who manages a computer shop in the highlands and has cut back buying stock due to a lack of foreign currency. “You need to wait up to three months, sometimes more than that, it’s up to the banks. We have to take whatever they give.” Heineken (HEIN.AS) subsidiary South Pacific Brewery Ltd has quit all non-essential capital expenditure since the crunch began and has struggled to remit dividends to its parent, managing director, Stan Joyce, told Reuters. The company even briefly considered buying coffee and trying to sell that offshore to bring in some U.S. dollars, he added.  Economists say the solution is to let the kina gradually fall to encourage dollars to flow. But the government is staking its hopes on an anticipated $13 billion in foreign investment expected as part of an expansion of the PNG LNG project, and recovering commodity prices, to stabilize the currency. It has also cut dollar-denominated imports of fuel and last month raised $500 million with its debut sovereign bond issue. “Much work going into import replacement, bringing fishing and logging industries processing onshore, lowering transport, energy and communication costs,” Treasurer Charles Abel said in an email, adding the backlog should be cleared by year’s end. Businesses and economists are less sure, and say restraints need to be dropped before investment flows again. In the meantime, though, Coke is flowing just fine, with PNG revenue and earnings up for the half-year. “The most popular drink here in Papua New Guinea is Coke,” said Raymond Yafus, a storeman at a supermarket in PNG’s second-largest city, Lae.

2018-11-08,"BOGOTA, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol will carry out a cleanup operation after a bomb attack on the Cano Limon pipeline on Thursday sparked a forest fire and spilled crude into a waterway, the company said. The attack is the 77th this year on the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline, which has been out of service for much of 2018 because of bombings and illegal taps. The pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels per day, was not functioning at the time of the attack, which followed one on Oct. 24. Cleanup personnel will begin work on close to a kilometer of contaminated water in a canal in Canaguata, in Boyaca province, as soon as the army deems it safe, the company said. The fire in a nearby section of forest continues to burn, sending black columns of smoke skyward, a video released by Ecopetrol showed. The regular bombings have not affected exports or production at the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum , because crude can be moved through a second, nearby pipeline. The company did not name the group responsible for the bombing but a military source blamed the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies, claiming they seize natural resources without benefiting Colombians. The ELN and the administration of former President Juan Manuel Santos began peace talks in February 2017, but current right-wing President Ivan Duque has said he will not continue the dialogue until the group frees all its hostages and ceases criminal activities.

2018-11-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California clean air regulators will hold talks next Tuesday with their federal counterparts and the White House over Trump administration efforts to stop Sacramento from adopting tighter vehicle emissions rules than Washington, a spokesman for the state confirmed on Thursday. The video conference meeting will be the first since Sept. 20 between the California Air Resources Board, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal Transportation Department.  California and 19 other states late last month demanded the Trump administration abandon a proposal to freeze fuel efficiency standards after 2020 and strip California of the ability to impose stricter rules. California Governor Jerry Brown said at an Oct. 28 news conference that President Donald Trump was “taking steps to destroy the American automobile industry” by freezing requirements. Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler responded that the federal government was still waiting for a formal counter-proposal from California. “It is my hope that we can continue to work together and reach one national standard,” he said in a statement. A senior administration official said the White House expected California to make a counterproposal at the meeting. A  spokesman for the California board, Stanley Young, confirmed the meeting but declined further comment. An EPA spokesman declined comment on the meeting. The states, including California, New York, Illinois, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, called the Trump administration proposal “unlawful” and “reckless.” They have vowed to sue if regulators move forward with the proposal. A group representing major automakers including General Motors Co, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) last month urged Washington “to set achievable future standards that continue to advance environmental and energy goals while recognizing marketplace realities.” Automakers are urging a compromise on nationwide emissions rules. Most back significant changes to soften or make it easier to comply with the Obama-era standards but do not favor Trump’s freeze, even though the administration says it would reduce regulatory costs for automakers by more than $300 billion over the next decade. Automakers want to avoid a prolonged legal battle between Washington and the most populous U.S. state. California has made reducing greenhouse gas emissions a priority and will fight to retain authority to set its own emissions rules. Trump’s preferred plan would freeze standards at 2020 levels through 2026, resulting in 500,000 barrels per day more oil consumption by the 2030s. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell more electric vehicles. The Obama administration adopted rules that call for a nearly 5 percent annual increase in fuel efficiency requirements over that period.

2018-11-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets declined on Thursday, snapping a seven-session winning streak, with U.S. stocks on the defensive and the dollar strengthening after the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unchanged.  The U.S. central bank held rates steady and said ongoing strong job gains and household spending had kept the economy on track. Its statement showed little change in the Fed’s outlook for the economy since the Fed’s previous meeting in September aside from noting that “business investment had moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.” U.S. shares extended losses after the Fed statement, on the heels of Wednesday’s post-election rally of more than 2 percent. Those gains came as investors celebrated political gridlock in the United States as Democrats took control of the House of Representatives after the midterm congressional vote, while Republicans maintained control of the Senate.     A spate of weak earnings also gave investors reason for pause, with Qualcomm (QCOM.O) one of the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index, down 8.2 percent as the loss of chip sales to Apple (AAPL.O) caused the company to cut its fourth-quarter outlook. “There are those people who are unsatisfied by this statement because they were looking for a more dovish tone after last month’s market volatility,” said Gene Tannuzzo, deputy global head of fixed income at Columbia Threadneedle In Minneapolis.   “That’s why we see short-term yields ticked up and stocks down here. They are still on track.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 11.12 points, or 0.04 percent, to 26,191.42, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 7.05 points, or 0.25 percent, to 2,806.84 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 39.87 points, or 0.53 percent, to 7,530.89.

2018-11-08,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Michel Temer on Thursday signed into law  hundreds of millions of dollars in incentives for automakers such as General Motors Co (GM.N) and Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) to produce locally and continue developing engines that run on both gasoline and ethanol. The plan, known as Rota 2030, replaces a previous package of tax exemptions known as Innova Auto that had expired at the end of 2017. It will also provide incentives to improve the fuel efficiency and safety of vehicles, as well as for investment in research and development.  Brazil, once one of the world’s top five auto producers, is recovering from a two-year recession which saw car sales plummet. Most global automakers have plants in the country, benefiting from tariffs that keep out imports, which they say help offset the country’s high labour costs and often rickety infrastructure. As signed into law, Rota 2030 will run for 15 years and provide tax credits over the next five years estimated to total 2.1 billion reais ($560 million) in 2019 and 1.5 billion reais in 2020.  The vast majority of Brazil’s cars have so-called “flex” engines which run on both gas and ethanol, produced from local sugar. Rota 2030 lowers by at least 3 percentage points the tax on industrial products applied to “flex” motors.  Brazil’s sugar lobby said in a press release “that the amendment had been developed and suggested by the ethanol industry in line with the demands of the auto industry.” The bill also renews incentives for the car industry to have assembly plants in the poorer Northeast region of Brazil, where Ford Motor Co (F.N) and Fiat (FCHA.MI) have factories. Rota 2030 was voted on by Brazil’s lower chamber on Wednesday, by the Senate on Thursday and then signed by Temer, who also attended the inauguration of the Sao Paulo International Motor Show.  The World Trade Organization criticized Innova Auto for being overly protective of the domestic industry.  While the initial Rota 2030 bill provided fiscal incentives for both local industry as well as auto imports, Congress excluded the incentives for imports, raising the possibility the program will also be questioned.

2018-11-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 2 percent on Thursday as investors focused on swelling global crude supply, which is increasing more quickly than many had expected. The market focused on record U.S. crude production and signals from Iraq, Abu Dhabi and Indonesia that output will grow more quickly than expected in 2019. Fears of the potential supply glut dampened a rally early in the session driven by Chinese data that showed record oil imports.  “There’s a trifecta of trouble created by U.S. stockpile builds, OPEC overproduction and the watering down of Iran sanctions,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York.  Brent crude futures LCOc1, the global benchmark, fell $1.42, or 1.97 percent, to settle at $70.65 a barrel, the lowest since mid-August. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell $1.00, or 1.6 percent, to $60.67 a barrel, the lowest since March 14. In post-settlement trade, both contracts extended losses.   China’s crude imports rose to 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, up 32 percent from a year earlier, customs data showed. China will still be allowed to import some Iranian crude under a waiver to U.S. sanctions that will enable it to purchase 360,000 bpd for 180 days, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. U.S. crude output reached a new record high of 11.6 million bpd in the latest week and the country has now overtaken Russia as the world’s largest oil producer. The move higher in production was a large jump, “not just a tick,” Yawger said.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration said this week it expects output to top 12 million bpd by the middle of 2019, thanks to shale oil. [EIA/M] Even with U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil in place, investors believe there is more than enough supply to meet demand. Waivers granted to the sanctions intensify the market’s perception that sanctions may not limit crude supply as much as initially expected. This view is reflected in price charts showing the front-month January Brent futures contract trading at a discount to February. This price structure, known as contango, materializes when market players believe there is a supply glut and decide to store oil rather than sell it. This creates an even larger pool of unsold crude. Some market watchers believe the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia may take steps to reduce supply. “OPEC and Russia may use (production) cuts to support $70 per barrel,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Saudi Arabia’s top government-funded think-tank is studying the possible effects on oil markets of a breakup of OPEC, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. The research project does not reflect an active debate inside the government over whether to leave the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the near term, the Journal reported.

2018-11-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and an independent monitoring team still have “a lot of work to do” before the company’s compliance procedures can be certified after a $27 billion global emissions cheating scandal, Larry Thompson, an independent compliance auditor, said on Thursday. Thompson, a former deputy U.S. attorney general, was installed in 2017 as compliance auditor as part of VW’s criminal plea agreement with the U.S. Justice Department. Thompson had been due to appear at a conference hosted by German magazine Automobilwoche, but instead spoke to participants in a video recording due to a scheduling conflict. He said VW was making good progress on improving its processes, and cited what he called “very good cooperation and support” by VW’s project management office, as well as top company executives and the works councils of both VW and Audi. VW and other German carmakers agreed on Thursday to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,430) per vehicle, including through trade-in incentives, to help reduce diesel emissions given a growing number of driving bans in major cities. Top German politicians say the emissions cheating scandal damaged the global reputation of the German car industry, and say consumers should not bear the cost of retrofitting cars. Thompson said his team had reviewed thousands of pages of documents and spoken with hundreds of employees and officers. Now, he said, VW and the monitoring team would begin testing to ensure revamped compliance procedures actually worked. “This effort is critical. Ultimately I must certify that the company’s compliance program is effective, that it is designed to prevent and detect violations of the anti-fraud and environmental laws,” he said. “Both the company and the monitor team have a lot of work to do before certification.” In August, when Thompson released a first public report on the turnaround effort, he said he disagreed with some VW executives’ use of privacy and attorney client privilege rights to withhold information. Hiltrud Werner, VW’s chief of integrity and legal affairs, said the company was working hard to transform its culture through a wide range of measures, including asking managers to take be more pro-active about compliance issues. “This is a hot phase for us, and that means we must bundle all energies in the company,” she told the conference, adding that certification was due to be completed by mid-2020.  “It is my personal conviction that we don’t need more compliance experts, we need 100-percent compliant managers,” she said, adding the goal was to ensure that top managers were forced to “permanently grapple with this issue, and that it remains in the consciousness of everyone.”  Reporting by Andrea Shalal, editing by Tassilo Hummel, David Evans and Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/volkswagen-compliance/update-2-still-a-lot-of-work-to-do-for-vw-after-diesel-scandal-u-s-compliance-auditor-idUKL8N1XJ8O2,08 Nov 2018,"Volkswagen and an

2018-11-08,"NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Headed into the winter, temperatures have been colder than usual in the United States, and the cost of heating has been higher - a trend likely to be extended in the next couple of months. That has fuel companies already warning about supply. Some heating oil service companies have rushed to deliver fuel earlier this season, while natural gas utilities are firing up emergency plans in case demand skyrockets and as more people look to switch to the cheaper fuel. Heating oil costs, particularly in the U.S. Northeast, are expected to hit four-year highs this winter. That’s driving consumers to request switching to cheaper natural gas, but that’s worrying utilities who say there will not be enough pipelines to handle demand in subsequent cold seasons. Households burning fuel oil can expect to pay an average of $1,589 this winter, or $213 more than last year, up 15.5 percent, according to the U.S. Energy Department. That will hit households in the U.S. Northeast hardest, since over 80 percent of the homes burning oil for heat are located there. That’s lit a fire under East Coast fuel providers, who have ramped up heating oil deliveries and services earlier than last year. “This is unexpected demand due to weather,” said Chris Fazio, executive vice president at Approved Oil, a Brooklyn, New York-based fuel delivery company. “It’s been a pretty good shot to the arm.” At Approved Oil, sales were about 15,000 barrels a day in recent weeks, compared with just 6,000 barrels a day in October last year, said Fazio. Consumers are expected to use an average of 501.9 gallons of heating oil this winter, the most since 2014-2015, EIA said. For a graphic on heating oil futures, see: tmsnrt.rs/2RHCXcJ By contrast, U.S. homes using natural gas in the Northeast are expected to pay just $727 this winter, down 2.1 percent from last year, even as homes in the region are projected to burn 0.5 percent more fuel this year than last with temperatures forecast to be about 0.8 percent colder than last year. That price tag is still higher than the national forecasted average of $598 this winter and it is driving more requests for customers to switch to natural gas. Companies have warned that capacity of the pipes supplying gas to New York City and New England has not kept up with growing demand. “We continue to see an increase in demand from oil to gas conversions and new construction and anticipate the need for additional capacity to meet demand in time for the winter of 2020/2021,” said Karen Young, a spokeswoman for National Grid Plc, which supplies 3.6 million customers in New York and New England. In recent years, New York state has blocked several new pipelines, including Williams Cos Inc’s Northeast Supply Enhancement and Constitution projects, from entering the state. Consolidated Edison Inc, which supplies power and gas in New York City and its suburbs, this year adopted energy efficiency programs and a “demand response” plan to incentivize consumers to reduce gas use on peak days. The company told New York state regulators in a recent filing that it may need to impose “a temporary moratorium” on new gas customers due to limited space on existing pipelines. Con Edison’s incentive programs will help maintain service but they “do not eliminate the need for a new natural gas pipeline to keep up with our region’s energy needs,” said Marc Huestis, senior vice president of gas operations.

2018-11-08,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) intends to sell electric cars for less than 20,000 euros (17,400 pounds)and protect German jobs by converting three factories to make Tesla (TSLA.O) rivals, a source familiar with the plans said. VW and other carmakers are struggling to adapt quickly enough to stringent rules introduced after the carmaker was found to have cheated diesel emissions tests, with its chief executive Herbert Diess warning last month that Germany’s auto industry faces extinction. Plans for VW’s electric car, known as “MEB entry” and with a production volume of 200,000 vehicles, are due to be discussed at a supervisory board meeting on Nov. 16, the source said. Another vehicle, the I.D. Aero, will be built in a plant currently making the VW Passat, a mid-sized sedan, the source said. The Wolfsburg-based carmaker, which declined to comment on the plans, is also expected to discuss far-reaching alliances with battery cell manufacturer SK Innovation (096770.KS) and rival Ford (F.N), the source said. The November 16 strategy meeting will discuss Volkswagen’s transformation plan to shift from being Europe’s largest maker of combustion engine vehicles into a mass producer of electric cars, another source familiar with the deliberations said. VW’s strategy shift comes as cities start to ban diesel engine vehicles, forcing carmakers to think of new ways to safeguard 600,000 German industrial jobs, of which 436,000 are at car companies and their suppliers.  An electric van, the ID Buzz, is due to be built at VW’s plant in Hannover, where its T6 Van is made, the source said.  To free up production capacity for electric cars in Hannover, VW’s transporter vans could be produced at a Ford (F.N) plant in Turkey, if German labour unions, who hold half the seats on VW’s board of directors, agree, the source added.  VW and Ford are in “exploratory talks” about an alliance to develop self-driving and electric vehicles and to complement each other’s global production and sales footprints,  Reuters reported last month. Ford has strong sales and profits in the United States thanks to its exposure to the lucrative pickup truck segment, while Volkswagen dominates the market for passenger cars in Europe. The companies are considering cooperation deals in the areas of commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles, although a final agreement will unlikely be announced at the November 16 strategy meeting at Volkswagen, the second source said. The details of a cooperation deal with Ford may take until the end of the year to be finalised, the second source said. The German carmaker will mainly focus on debating the merits of converting its VW factories in Emden, Zwickau and Hanover, which all build combustion-engined cars, to electric ones under the plans being discussed by the board of directors, the source said. Carmakers in Germany agreed on Thursday to spend up to 3,000 euros per vehicle to add more efficient exhaust filtering systems to cut diesel emissions, but failed to prevent bans on diesel vehicles by Cologne and Bonn. EU lawmakers have agreed to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030 after a U.N. report called for dramatic steps to slow global warming. Diess said to cut average fleet emissions of carbon dioxide in Europe by 30 percent by 2030, VW needs to raise its share offully electric vehicles to 30 percent of new car sales. The shift from combustion engines to electric cars wouldalso cost 14,000 jobs at VW by 2020 as it takes less time to build an electric car than a conventional one and because jobs will shift overseas to battery manufacturers. In Europe there are about 126 plants making combustionengines, employing 112,000 people. The largest such plant inEurope is VW’s in Kassel.

2018-11-08,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to review its tariffs on Argentine biodiesel could mean a reversal of fortune for exporters whose shipments from the South American country have been practically nil, the biodiesel chamber of Argentina said on Thursday. The U.S. Department of Commerce announced on Wednesday there was “just cause” to review the taxes it applied at the end of 2017 to Argentine biodiesel, which cut off access to the main market for Argentina’s product at the time. Wednesday’s announcement prompted enthusiasm from Argentine biofuel exporters whose shipments have slowed to a trickle since September as the European Union (EU), the new main destination for Argentine biofuel, also considers adding tariffs. “This is a necessary and important first step,” Victor Castro, executive director of the Argentine Chamber of Biofuels (CARBIO), whose members include biodiesel exporters Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd, told Reuters. “We are convinced that tariffs are a totally unfair measure and it is very important to be able to export to that market,” he said, adding that due to limited international commercial activity, the production level in Argentine biodiesel plants has been very low. Argentina is one of the world’s top producers of biodiesel fuel, exporting 1.65 million tons worth $1.224 billion in 2017. This year, biodiesel producers in Argentina exported almost 1.1 million tons of the fuel between January and August, of which 85 percent went to the EU, according to official data from Argentina state statistics agency INDEC. However, in September and October the volume of biodiesel shipped abroad was zero. The halt in exports coincided with the EU’s expected decision on whether to sanction Argentina’s biodiesel industry over suspicions of receiving subsidies. The EU postponed its ruling in late September, saying it would continue its investigation. The announcement by the United States that it will review the tariffs comes a few months after Argentina increased duties on biodiesel exports and cut tariffs on grains and soybean oil shipments, a key ingredient for biodiesel production in Argentina.

2018-11-08,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. soybean crop will be smaller than expected but stocks are forecast to rise sharply as a trade fight with China weighs heavily on exports, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday. The government also trimmed its outlook for domestic corn production in its monthly supply and demand report, with yields from the ongoing harvest coming in below expectations. Chicago Board of Trade soybean futures <0#S:> fell sharply after the report was released, with the most active January contract sinking 1.6 percent to a one-week low. “Finally, USDA is aggressive in lowering its forecast for the U.S. export program for soybeans,” said Terry Reilly senior analyst with Futures International in Chicago. USDA forecast 2018/19 U.S. soybean production at 4.600 billion bushels, down from its previous estimate of 4.690 billion bushels. It also lowered its average soybean yield estimate to 52.1 bushels per acre compared with 53.1 bushels per acre a month ago. Despite the cuts, the soybean harvest and yield forecasts would still be the biggest ever, if realized. Analysts had been expecting a soybean crop of 4.676 billion bushels and yields of 52.9 bushels per acre, based on the average of analysts estimates in a Reuters poll. USDA boosted its estimate of 2018/19 soybean ending stocks, which had already been projected at a record high, to 955 million bushels, topping the average estimate of 898 million bushels. It slashed its export outlook for the current marketing year to 1.900 billion bushels from 2.060 billion bushels. “I think we’re still headed over that one-billion-bushel threshold if the China-U.S. trade spat doesn’t end,” Reilly said. For corn, the government pegged U.S. production at 14.626 billion bushels, based on an average yield of 178.9 bushels per acre. In October, USDA had forecast the corn harvest at 14.778 billion bushels and yields at 180.8 bushels per acre. Domestic corn stocks were pegged at 1.736 billion bushels, down from the government’s October forecast of 1.813 million bushels. Analysts, on average, had been expecting 1.773 billion bushels. CBOT corn futures <0#C:>, which had been trading slightly higher before the report was released, dropped 1.5 percent. USDA also nearly doubled its estimate of world corn supplies to 307.51 million tonnes, following China’s sharp revision to its production data for the past 10 years. It put 2018/19 global soybean ending stocks at 112.08 million tonnes and global wheat ending stocks at 266.71 million tonnes.

2018-11-08,"(Adds details, background) WARSAW, Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United States could still impose sanctions related to the building of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would bring Russian gas directly to Germany under the Baltic Sea, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Thursday. Perry was speaking in Warsaw during a visit to east European countries as the administration of President Donald Trump seeks to encourage the purchase of gas from the United States or other suppliers rather than increasing purchases from Russia. Asked at a news conference whether Washington could impose sanctions on companies working on the project, Perry said: “I saw no signals where we would ever get to the point where we can support Nord Stream 2.” He added that “sanctions were an option that the president maintained.” Russia’s Gazprom is the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering 50 percent of the 9.5 billion euro  ($11 billion) bill. Gazprom’s Western partners are Austrian OMV along with Uniper, Wintershall, Shell and Engie. The CEO at OMV said in October he was optimistic Denmark would approve the project next year and the new gas transport route would start operations in late 2019. The pipeline, which will double the amount of gas Russia can pump under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing traditional routes via Ukraine, has been strongly opposed by Poland and the United States. Warsaw and Washington signed on Thursday a joint declaration on enhanced energy security cooperation. “This is also a clear signal that the U.S. strongly supports a pro-Poland and pro-Europe energy security policy,” Perry said of the deal with Warsaw. “Energy security in turn requires energy diversity. That is the reason we oppose the Nord Stream 2 project which would further increase the dangerous energy dependence many European nations have on the Russian federation,” Perry added. As part of a wider plan to reduce reliance on Russian gas, Poland has increased purchases of liquefied natural gas (LNG)from the United States. On Thursday, Poland’s state-run gas firm PGNiG signed a long-term deal with Cheniere on LNG supplies. ($1 = 0.8773 euros) Reporting by Joanna Plucinska

U.S. shares modestly fell in the wake of Wednesday’s post-election rally of more than 2 percent. Those gains came as investors celebrated political gridlock in the U.S. as Democrats took control of the House of Representatives after the midterm congressional vote, while Republicans maintained control of the Senate. A spate of weak earnings also gave investors reason for pause, with Qualcomm one of the biggest drags on the benchmark S&P 500 index, down nearly 7 percent as the loss of chip sales to Apple caused the company to cut its fourth-quarter outlook. “It is definitely just a little profit taking from yesterday, the volume yesterday was not big, so I don’t think there was a lot of conviction in yesterday’s rally,” said Tim Ghriskey, Chief Investment Strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. “There is some uncertainty about what Democrats are going to mean to the White House, whether that is going to have any impact on the deregulation that has occurred, taxes.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.31 points, or 0.10 percent, at 26,205.10, the S&P 500 was down 3.43 points, or 0.12 percent, at 2,810.46 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 18.61 points, or 0.25 percent, at 7,552.23.

Traders are currently see only a 7.2 percent chance the Fed will raise rates by a quarter-point at today’s meeting, according to CME’s FedWatch, down from 7.8 percent on Wednesday. The dollar index was up 0.27 percent against a basket of major currencies, with the euro edged down 0.04 percent at $1.142. Oil neared three-month lows, surrendering early gains as investors focused on global crude supply, which is increasing more quickly than many had expected. U.S. crude fell 0.81 percent to $61.17 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.40, down 0.93 percent on the day.

2018-11-08,"* Hellenic Petroleum Q3 EBITDA at 237 mln euros * EBITDA beats analysts forecast * Refining sales volumes outweigh lower margins * To increase payout (Adds detail on dividend) By Angeliki Koutantou ATHENS, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Hellenic Petroleum, Greece’s biggest oil refiner, reported a 15 percent rise in third-quarter core profit on Thursday with stronger sales volumes more than offsetting lower refining margins. Adjusted for oil inventory holding, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) came in at 237 million euros ($271 million), up from 206 million euros in the same period a year earlier. The figure beat analysts average forecast of 213.4 million euros in a recent Reuters poll. Hellenic, which operates three refineries in Greece and exports more than half of its output, said refining sales volumes, thanks to high utilisation rates of its refineries, outweighed a 20 percent drop in benchmark refining margins and higher provisions for CO2 emissions rights. Refining sales volumes rose 8 percent in July to September to 4 million tonnes. For the nine months to September, EBITDA, including oil inventory gains, rose 20 percent to 731 million euros. Hellenic has said it expected EBITDA to top 1 billion euros this year, up from 851 million euros last year. Under Greece’s privatisation programme, Hellenic has agreed to sell a 35 percent stake in Greece’s gas grid operator DESFA for about 280 million euros. Hellenic said it expected to conclude the sale in the last quarter of the year and that it will use most of the proceeds to repay existing debt. The company will pay out an interim dividend of 0.25 euros per share. Total dividend for the year could be at least 0.45 euros a share and Hellenic may also consider a special dividend from the DESFA proceeds, Deputy Chief Executive Officer Andreas Shiamishis told an analysts conference. Hellenic paid a dividend of 0.40 euros a share last year. The United States on Monday granted exemptions from crude oil sanctions against Iran to several countries, including Greece. Asked about the impact of the waiver on Hellenic, Shiamishis said the company will wait until the United States formalise their decision. “Once we know what exactly we can and we can’t do, we will act accordingly,” he said.

2018-11-08,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Iran is likely to ride out the storm from U.S. oil sanctions, suffering recession but no economic meltdown, thanks to rising crude prices and deepening divisions between the United States and other major powers, officials and analysts say. “Iran’s situation is better than pre-2016 because of high oil prices and the fact that the U.S. is isolated this time,” said a European diplomat who asked not to be further identified.  Iran emerged in early 2016 from years of global sanctions under a deal with world powers that curbed its disputed nuclear program. But President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in May, calling it flawed to Iran’s advantage, and reimposed far-reaching U.S. sanctions in phases, with the most damaging oil and banking penalties taking effect on Nov. 5. Trump aims to force Washington’s longtime adversary to accept tougher restrictions on its nuclear activity, drop its ballistic missile program and scale back support for militant proxies in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria. But the broadly united front of world powers that enforced sanctions on Iran previously, pushing Iran into nuclear restraint, has unraveled since Trump took office and clashed with allies over everything from trade to collective security. The other signatories to the nuclear deal - Germany, France, Britain, the European Union, Russia and China - have condemned Trump’s walkout from the pact. The EU is preparing a special mechanism to enable payments for Iranian oil and other exports without U.S. dollars, possibly through a barter system.  “It will be a difficult period but Iran’s economy will withstand it for various reasons,” a second diplomat said, “including (the fact of) Russia being under (U.S. and EU)sanctions, Saudi Arabia having its own financial and political issues, and (trade war) between China and the United States.”    Big power disunity and EU moves to circumvent Trump’s sanctions regime have given Tehran a psychological boost - but  not dissuaded foreign businesses ranging from oil majors to trading houses and shipping concerns from pulling out of Iran for fear of incurring new U.S. penalties. Still, while the U.S. clampdown will probably trigger recession in Iran next year, economic meltdown should be avoided, with a reduced but still significant volume of oil exports continuing, a Fitch solutions analyst said. “Tehran is still likely to see a substantial share of its foreign exchange earnings maintained,” Andrine Skjelland told Reuters. “This will enable Tehran to continue subsidizing imports of selected basic goods, keeping the costs of these down and thus limiting inflation to some extent.”    In hopes of mitigating the immediate economic hit, Iranian authorities have hinted that Tehran might have to sell its oil at a discount to entice buyers going forward.     “Oil revenues might decline but (they) will still be enough to run the country,” said an official involved in Iran’s international commerce. “If we sell our oil for $1 less than market price, it will have tens of buyers.” In another counter-measure made possible by state control of the oil sector, Iranian authorities are using special exchange centers to sell dollars at cheaper rates to importers of basic foods, medicine and other essential goods.    IHS Markit senior economist Patrick Schneider doubted that Iran could cushion the economic blow in the near term. “Despite the rhetoric and attempts to mitigate the downside effects..., uncertainty will remain prevalent for the next 6-12 months,” he told Reuters.  The International Monetary Fund has forecast that Iran’s economy will contract in 2018 by 1.5 percent and by 3.6 percent in 2019 due to the dwindling of oil revenues.      At the same time the World Bank anticipates inflation in Iran jumping to 23.8 percent in 2018-19 from 9.6 percent in 2017-18, and to 31.2 percent in 2019-20. But Iranian officials are defiant, citing Trump’s isolation in repudiating the nuclear deal, climbing oil prices and Trump’s agreement to grant sanctions waivers to eight countries especially dependent on Iranian crude.     “Crude prices are rising. Even if Iran’s oil sales drop to 800,000 barrels per day (bpd), we will be able to run the economy. But we will send much more than that. Our economy will be far from collapse,” said a senior Iranian official. “Our budget is based on oil of $57 per barrel and is now over $75 per barrel.” In October, Iran’s crude exports were estimated at 1.82 million bpd by data intelligence company Kpler and 1.5 million bpd by another firm that traces Iranian shipments.     Trump granted 180-day sanctions waivers to China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey, which together took in over 80 percent of Iran oil exports last year, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.        “Even without the exemptions, we will sell our oil. We will bypass sanctions. We have so many countries that are on our side. America cannot do a damn thing,” said a senior official close to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The sanctions, however, will inevitably erode Iran’s state finances and raise already high inflation and jobless rates, making life harder for ordinary Iranians. Since May, when Trump took Washington out of the nuclear deal, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the value of the rial currency has plunged.     The rial’s weakness has sent prices of some imports rocketing, destroying jobs as some factories using imported parts have folded. Around 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have begun to close down in the past few months due to scarcity of raw materials and hard currency, according to the Iranian state news agency IRNA.     Moreover, Trump’s sanctions against Iran’s financial sector essentially make 30 banks and their subsidiaries off-limits to foreign lenders, undermining its means to facilitate trade.

2018-11-08,"COLOGNE, Germany/BERLIN (Reuters) - German carmakers agreed to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,430) per vehicle to help reduce diesel emissions as the government and industry respond to driving bans in major cities. While Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer and car bosses were hammering out a deal on anti-pollution measures in a five-hour meeting on Thursday, a court ruled that two more German cities, Cologne and Bonn, must impose bans on older diesel vehicles. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) are prepared to offer hardware retrofits to clean up older diesel vehicles at their own cost, Scheuer said following the meeting, adding that rival BMW (BMWG.DE) was still refusing to do so. But all three big German carmakers, including VW, were committed to spending up to 3,000 euros for various measures, including trade-in incentives. Scheuer said they were all keen to press ahead with such incentives, which aim to convince customers to buy newer, cleaner vehicles that have lower emissions and would not be affected by driving bans. The government has been pushing carmakers to shoulder more of the burden of retrofitting cars, though Germany’s auto giants have been reluctant to take on more costs than necessary. “Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW will make sure their customers can remain mobile,” Scheuer told reporters, urging foreign rivals, like Fiat and Peugeot to match the efforts he said the German firms had made. Scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of pollutant emissions from diesel cars has dealt repeated blows to the global reputation of Germany’s car industry in recent years. As the industry leaders were meeting Scheuer, a court in Cologne ordered driving bans in some parts of the city from next April, underlining the stakes for politicians concerned that a lack of progress could trigger deeply unpopular driving bans. Environmental lobby group DUH had filed complaints against the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, home to Cologne and Bonn, saying the cities needed to ensure their nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels stuck to permitted limits and calling for a ban of diesel vehicles in those cities. “It will cause disruption for the transport infrastructure of the city of Cologne and have a significant impact on residents, commuters and the whole of Cologne,” said State Environment Minister Ursula Heinen-Esser.

2018-11-08,"NEW DELHI, Nov 8 (Reuters) - India on Thursday approved a plan to allow foreign oil companies to store oil in the Padur strategic petroleum reserve, law minister R. S. Prasad said, as the world’s third biggest oil importer seeks to cut storage costs. Global oil producers, including Saudi Arabia, have shown interest in investing in India’s strategic oil storage, which the country uses to hedge against energy security risks as it relies heavily on oil imports. India has built emergency storage in underground caverns at three locations to hold 36.87 million barrels of crude. The underground 2.5 million tonne Padur strategic reserve in southern Karnataka state has four compartments to hold about 18.5 million barrels of oil. “Participation by foreign oil companies will significantly reduce budgetary support of government of India by more than 100 billion rupees ($1.38 billion) based on current prices,” Prasad told a news conference. He said India would have the first right to the oil stored in the caverns in case of emergency. India imports about 82 percent of its crude requirements. India hopes to invite bids in three to four months to fill Padur, the chief executive of Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Ltd said last month. The Padur site located is about 5 km (3 miles) from the south west coast and 40 km from the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd’s refinery. India has already leased half of its Mangalore strategic petroleum reserve to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) for seven years. ADNOC has been allowed to sell some of its oil from the storage to Indian refiners. In the first phase, India has built 3 strategic petroleum reserves with combined capacity of 5.33 million tonnes, enough to meet demand for 9.5 days. In the second phase, the country is building two storage facilities with total capacity of 6.5 million tonne that could supply an additional 11.5 days of India’s oil needs based on current consumption trends. $1 = 72.3800 Indian rupees

2018-11-08,"JOHANNESBURG, Nov 8 (Reuters) - France’s EDF Group signed an agreement on Thursday to build and operate a 1.2 billion euro ($1.37 billion) hydropower project in Cameroon, the first step in a plan to expand its hydropower business in Africa, a company executive said. The 420-megawatt project will be located on the Sanaga River near Nachtigal Falls, around 65 km (40 miles) northeast of the capital Yaounde and, when operational, will contribute 30 percent of Cameroon’s total electricity generation capacity. “It’s the first of its kind (in Africa) for EDF to have all these industrial roles together: to design, negotiate, piloting the project, building, operating and maintenance,” Marianne Laigneau, who heads EDF’s international division, told Reuters. EDF will own a 40 percent stake in the project and the Cameroon state will hold 30 percent. The International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank’s investment arm, will also own 30 percent and is coordinating lending from 11 development finance institutions and four local commercial banks. The contracts were signed in Paris between representatives from EDF, the IFC and the government of Cameroon, along with lenders involved in financing the project. EDF will put 120 million euros in equity into the project and will operate the facility for 35 years, selling the power to the grid via a power purchase agreement. Construction is due to begin by the end of this year with the project expected to go into operation in 2023. EDF has 432 hydropower plants in operation around the world. And as its global strategy focuses more on Africa, it aims to develop more hydroelectric projects on the continent. “We are completely convinced there is a large hydro potential in Africa,” Laigneau said. “We are looking for opportunities with partners, because we are always operating with local partners, in Cameroon after Nachtigal ... in Ivory Coast, in South Africa, in Zambia just to mention a few of them.” As it seeks to spur growth in businesses outside its home market, EDF has turned to Africa, where a rapidly expanding population is underserved by often unreliable power grids. Less than 40 percent of African households have access to national power networks, according to the International Energy Agency. EDF is already active in the renewable energy sector in Africa with industrial wind and solar projects. And has taken stakes in several off-grid solar start-ups, a strategy Laigneau said the company was ramping up. “We started with pilot projects in a limited number of countries. And now we are developing in more countries - Togo, Kenya, Ghana, Senegal. More countries. Ambitious targets. More products ... It’s a competitive market,” she said.

2018-11-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - An oil tanker and a Norwegian navy frigate collided off Norway’s west coast on Thursday, injuring eight people and triggering the temporary shutdown of a North Sea crude export terminal, Norway’s top gas processing plant and several offshore fields. The frigate, which recently took part in a major NATO military exercise, was aground and tilting on one side, live television pictures showed. The Norwegian military was attempting to save the ship. “We are working on stabilising the vessel,” Norwegian Navy Counter-Admiral Nils Andreas Stensoenes told a news conference, adding that the eight injured were all Navy crew. Some 137 crew were on board at the time of the accident.  “We are very glad that no lives got lost and that the injuries are not more serious than they are,” he added.  Police and the national Accident Investigation Board were investigating the accident, which took place at 0326 GMT. The tanker had left Equinor’s (EQNR.OL) Sture oil shipment terminal with a cargo of crude, and the facility was shut for several hours on Thursday as a result.  The Kollsnes gas plant, with a processing capacity of 144.5 million cubic metres per day, was also shut for several hours. Both the Sture terminal and the Kollsnes plant were restarting on Thursday afternoon, Equinor said in a statement.  Kollsnes processes gas from the Troll, Kvitebjoern and Visund fields for Britain and the rest of Europe. The Troll A platform was also restarting operations after its earlier temporary shutdown, Equinor said. UK wholesale gas prices were up ahead of news of the incident and increased further afterwards. Gas for immediate delivery TRGBNBPWKD was up 6.2 percent at 66.50 pence per therm at 1136 GMT. Norway is a major supplier of gas to Britain so big outages can impact UK gas prices. Flows from Norway to Britain were down by 14-15 million cubic metres due to the Kollsnes outage. “Norwegian outages due to the collision have prompted extra buying. The market was already quite bullish due to lower temperatures,” a British gas trader said. There was no sign of a leak from the oil tanker, although it would return to port for inspection, the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre for southern Norway told Reuters. The Sture terminal receives oil via pipelines from North Sea fields, including Oseberg, Grane, Svalin, Edvard Grieg and Ivar Aasen, which in turn is exported to global markets on tankers. Oseberg, Grane and Ivar Aasen were restarting output after being shut, their operators said.  Oil output from the fields delivering to the Sture terminal was around 350,000 barrels per day in August, the latest data available from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate showed. The Sture terminal has a capacity to store one million cubic metres of crude oil and 60,000 cubic metres of liquefied petroleum gas in rock chambers.  LPG mix and naphtha are also exported from the terminal via the Vestprosess pipeline to the Mongstad oil terminal. Oseberg is one of the crude streams underpinning the global Brent oil benchmark. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down 21 cents at $71.86 a barrel by 1249 GMT. Production at the Edvard Grieg field was shut on Thursday, a source with knowledge of its operations said. It was not immediately clear whether output had restarted there too. The Sola TS, an Aframax class vessel built in 2017, belongs to Tsakos Energy Navigation (TNP.N), the company’s website says.

2018-11-08,"* Sonatrach aims to draw in foreign firms to lift gas output * Most of energy reserves relay in Algeria’s remote south * Sufi preachers can influence wary southern communities By Lamine Chikhi HASSI MESSAOUD, Algeria, Nov 8 (Reuters) - After persuading oil majors to help explore Algeria’s vast shale gas reserves, state energy firm Sonatrach has started reaching out to a different kind of partner: mystical Sufi preachers. Sonatrach CEO Abdelmoumen Ould Kaddour and his colleagues have been courting Sunni Muslim Sufi masters from communities in areas near prospective southern gas fields to win over locals worried about possible disruption from exploration work. The state company brings Sufi preachers to meetings in the country’s southern region, where most of Algeria’s energy reserves lie and which is also home to more traditional communities, to explain prospects for jobs and other benefits. “Sonatrach has to show it cares about people. We appreciate that it invites us to attend its gatherings and conferences in the south,” Sufi master Bayziz Ibrahim said at a Sonatrach meeting at Ouargla, near Algeria’s biggest oilfield Hassi Messaoud. Sonatrach has been increasingly turning to foreign firms, which have long been reluctant to invest in Algeria because of red tape and tough terms, to push up oil and gas output. But it needs to ensure that international companies which sign up do not face protests from local communities, like the demonstrations that forced Sonatrach temporarily to halt shale exploration tests near the southern In Salah gasfield in 2015. Sufi leaders can influence these often remote communities from their zawiyas, which are houses where people gather to listen to sermons, recite the Koran and conduct rhythmic rituals that aim to bring practitioners of Sufism closer to God. “We will tell the people and the youth that Sonatrach’s efforts are to be welcome,” Ibrahim told Reuters on the sidelines of the gathering attended by people from the area, members of the local authorities and Sonatrach employees. Ibrahim ended the meeting by leading prayers. “You need to respect people, you need to talk to people, and the best way is to go through their spiritual leaders,” said Osmani, a local at the gathering who only gave his first name. Villagers in the south of Algeria often grumble that too much of the nation’s energy wealth heads to the north and the capital Algiers, so Sonatrach has promised to build new public facilities, such as a cultural centre, hospital and stadium. Sonatrach executives also point to the thousands of jobs it had provided in the energy industry and related work to youths in the south during the past 15 months. More opportunities may be on the way. In October, Sonatrach reached a deal with Britain’s BP and Norway’s Equinor to develop Algeria’s shale gas reserves, estimated to be the world’s third largest. It is seeking a similar agreement with U.S. firm Exxon Mobil Corp.

2018-11-08,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British company Dyson, which makes bagless vacuum cleaners, has succeeded in overturning a European Union law on energy efficiency labelling after a five-year battle, with Europe’s second highest court backing its argument that the legislation discriminated against its products. The Luxembourg-based General Court on Thursday reversed a 2015 ruling, which rejected Dyson’s challenge to the law, and scrapped the labelling regulation.  The requirements were introduced by the European Commission in September 2014 to inform consumers of energy efficiency levels and cleaning performance of vacuum cleaners, among other items. The goal was to prevent energy waste, reduce fuel bills and cut carbon emissions. Dyson in 2013 challenged the proposed rules, which apply in all of the 28 EU countries, saying the labelling requirements on vacuum cleaners discriminated against its particular technology and misled customers about the efficiency of some vacuum cleaners, particularly those with bags. It said the rules unfairly benefited its German rivals. The General Court agreed with the company’s arguments and scrapped the regulation, saying that the EU executive’s testing method failed to comply with key elements of the directive. The move came after the EU Court of Justice (ECJ) last year ordered the lower tribunal to re-examine the case following an appeal by Dyson. “Tests of a vacuum cleaner’s energy efficiency carried out with an empty receptacle do not reflect conditions as close as possible to actual conditions of use,” judges said. The ruling means that companies will not be required to display energy efficiency labels on their products, but will still have to comply with eco-design rules designed to cut energy and resource consumption. The Commission, which can appeal the case at the ECJ but only on points of law, said it would study the ruling before deciding on the next step. “This judgement does not put into question the effectiveness of EU energy efficiency policy in general or the important contribution it makes on meeting European Union efficiency targets,” Commission spokeswoman Anna-Kaisa Itkonen told reporters. Dyson welcomed the judgement. “We have been arguing consistently that the Commission committed two legal violations to the detriment of European consumers and Dyson,” the company said in a statement. European Parliament lawmaker Ashley Fox urged the EU executive to refine its testing process. “The Commission must now urgently design new tests that properly inform shoppers, promote a reduction in energy use and are fair to innovative entrepreneurs like Mr Dyson,” he said, referring to British inventor James Dyson, the founder of Dyson.

2018-11-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The U.S. government’s finances are on an unsustainable trajectory and are likely to worsen further after the mid-term elections, adding to the list of problems facing the global economy and oil markets in 2019/2020. The U.S. federal government’s outlays exceeded its receipts by $779 billion in Fiscal Year 2018, which ended on Sept. 30, according to the Congressional Budget Office (“Monthly budget review”, CBO, Nov. 7). The budget deficit would have been even worse at $823 billion if certain outlays had not been brought forward and recorded in the previous financial year because the first day of Fiscal 2018 fell on a weekend. Even so, the deficit increased to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product, up from 3.5 percent the previous year, and the highest since Fiscal 2013, when the economy was still recovering from the global financial crisis. Government receipts increased by just $14 billion (less than 1 percent) while outlays rose by $127 billion (around 3 percent), worsening the deficit by $113 billion compared with the previous year. Higher receipts from individual income taxes (+$96 billion), payroll taxes (+$9 billion) and customs duties (+$7 billion) were mostly offset by lower collections from corporate income taxes (-$92 billion) and fines (-$7 billion). Government outlays increased for net interest on the public debt (+$62 billion), social security (+$43 billion), defence (+$38 billion), Medicare (+$16 billion) and Medicaid (+$14 billion). Increased government spending, especially on defence, has helped fuel the acceleration in economic growth (“A big reason U.S. economy is accelerating; government spending”, Wall Street Journal, Oct. 25). (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QAh6n2) But the federal government’s deteriorating financial position and increased borrowing needs are also driving up yields on Treasury securities affecting borrowing costs across the entire economy and worldwide. Yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes have risen to more than 3.2 percent, more than double the recent low in 2016, and the highest since 2011 (tmsnrt.rs/2QAh6n2). Tax cuts and increased spending at a relatively late point in the economic cycle have also encouraged the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in order to hold inflationary pressure in check. The combination of fiscal stimulus and tightening monetary policy has caused the exchange rate to appreciate, worsening the trade deficit as exporters and import-competing firms lose competitiveness to foreign rivals. In effect, the economy is being over-stimulated by fiscal policy and the resulting imbalance is showing up in rising interest rates, increasing borrowing costs, an appreciating exchange rate and a widening trade deficit. Government borrowing is likely to increase over the next two years, making all these financial imbalances even worse, and creating a major source of vulnerability in the global economy. The Congressional Budget Office has forecast the budget deficit will worsen to around $1 trillion (around 4.5 percent of GDP) in both Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2020 (“The budget and economic outlook”, CBO, April 2018). In practice, the government’s financial position is likely to deteriorate even more than this as the president and Congress compete for votes ahead of the next elections by seeking to extend tax cuts and raise spending. With Congress divided between a Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and a Republican-controlled Senate, legislators are unlikely to agree on either spending cuts or tax increases to contain the deficit. Instead, lawmakers and the president are more likely to try to please their core supporters by agreeing to extend selected tax breaks and spending programmes in a bid to buy votes ahead of the next election in 2020. President Donald Trump has already indicated he wants to work with congressional Democrats on a big infrastructure bill saying on Wednesday “we have a lot of things in common on infrastructure”. Funding for major infrastructure programmes could come from the federal government, state and local governments, or private sources. Federal government funding would hit the deficit directly. Funding from state and local sources or the private sector, perhaps with tax incentives, would further stimulate an economy already operating close to full capacity. If the economy starts to slow in 2019 or 2020, the president and congressional leaders will push for even more tax cuts and higher spending to offset the slowdown. Even more than other administrations, the current White House has linked its credibility to the strength of the economy and a rising stock market, so it will do everything possible to avert a recession between now and 2020. The most likely scenario is that the fiscal position will continue to deteriorate in 2019/2020, keeping upward pressure on interest rates, borrowing costs, the exchange rate and the trade deficit. This course is obviously unsustainable over the long run, although it is not clear whether it can be kept going for at least two more years until after the next election. In the meantime, the risk of sudden and disruptive changes in inflation, interest rates, asset prices or the exchange rate are a major source of risk to the global economy and oil consumption in 2019/2020.

2018-11-08,"* Project was to generate 7 pct of UK electricity * Could create tens of thousands of jobs * South Korea still interested in Moorside site * UK govt says its a “commercial decision” (Updates with unions, government comment) LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Japan’s Toshiba Corp said on Thursday it would scrap a British nuclear plant project after failing to find an investment partner, but South Korea indicated it was still interested in building a reactor at the site. The Moorside project in northwest England was expected to provide around 7 percent of Britain’s electricity, but faced setbacks after Toshiba’s nuclear arm Westinghouse went bankrupt last year. It was part of Britain’s efforts to build a new fleet of nuclear reactors to replace ageing coal and other nuclear plants due to close in the 2020s. New projects have struggled due to high costs and weak electricity prices. “Whilst NuGen will not be taking the project forward, the Moorside site in Cumbria remains a site designated by government for nuclear new build,” NuGen, the Toshiba business in Britain, said in a statement. “It is now for the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority as the owner of the site and the government to determine its future.” NuGen had been trying to sell its business for 18 months but it is now being liquidated. South Korea’s Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) had been a preferred bidder but lost that status in July as delays to concluding a deal dragged on. South Korea’s energy ministry however said it would talk with the British government. “The ministry plans to closely coordinate with the British government on the Moorside project while monitoring the NuGen liquidation process with KEPCO,” Korea’s Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in a statement. KEPCO had said it wanted to use its own nuclear reactor design for the project, which has not been submitted for approval from Britain’s nuclear nuclear regulator. British employment unions Unite and GMB called on the British government to step in to help save the Moorside project which NuGen said would create tens of thousands of direct and indirect jobs in the local area. The government said all proposed new nuclear projects in Britain are led by private sector developers. “While the Government has engaged regularly with the companies involved, this is entirely a commercial decision for Toshiba,” a spokesperson for Britain’s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said. Toshiba had also held talks about selling the project with Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc but they also fell through, a source told Reuters last month. The British government has come under fire for the costs of new nuclear plants, in particular Hinkley Point C in southwest England which is due to come online in 2025 and is being built by France’s EDF along with China General Nuclear Power Corp. It has said it would consider investing directly into the Wylfa Newydd plant in Wales to be built by Japan’s Hitachi Ltd in an attempt to keep the costs down.

Traders were gearing up for the U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in a confident mood and the contrast to the last one in late September, when stock markets had just begun one of their most painful poundings in years, was stark. European shares hit a one-month high after Asia and Wall Street had set similar milestones overnight, as solid results from SocGen, Commerzbank and caterer Sodexho soothed concerns about slowing corporate earnings. S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq futures pointed to Wall Street giving back a bit of ground later, but the dollar, bond yields and MSCI’s world stocks index were all holding their gains. The U.S. currency pulled slowly away from 2-1/2-week lows hit after Donald Trump’s loss of the House of Representatives in Tuesday’s mid-term elections reduced the chance of another blizzard of tax cuts. That in turn made analysts and money managers more optimistic that the U.S. economy wouldn’t ultimately overheat and force the Fed to keep jacking up borrowing costs. “We think we are close to the end of the appreciation of the dollar,” said fund manager Amundi’s Didier Borowski, who expects the Fed to pause its hiking cycle next year as the economy starts to slow. “Usually we see a year-end rally (in stocks),” he added. That rally may in fact be arriving early. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng advanced 0.9 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.2 percent overnight, receiving a mild lift from stronger-than-expected October Chinese exports data. With shippers rushing to get their goods into the United States before higher trade tariffs kick in next year, exports rose 15.6 percent from a year earlier, smashing forecasts for a modest slowdown to 11 percent. Australian stocks, which tend to move with China’s fortunes, rose 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei surged 1.8 percent, almost matching Wednesday’s 2 percent Wall Street leap. In the bond market there was plenty of activity too. The 10-year Treasury note yield eased slighted having risen as high as 3.25 percent but those on Europe’s equivalent German Bund benchmark kept climbing to a 2-week high. Italian government bond yields were up to six basis points higher as the European Commission forecast the country’s 2019 budget deficit would be much higher than suggested by Rome, at 2.9 percent rather than 2.4 percent. That pushed Italy’s bond spread over higher-rated Germany out to 290 basis points and Mizuho rates strategist Peter Chatwell warned of a possible further sell-off if Rome’s populist coalition government ramped up its anti-Brussels rhetoric again. Under EU rules, of which the Commission is the enforcer, Italy should cut its structural deficit next year to 1.2 percent of GDP rather than allow it to rise, and continue cutting it every year until it reaches a surplus. “In our model, it doesn’t move fair value much from 300 bps (over Germany) but scary headlines are likely to cause a widening,” he added. The euro largely took the Italian drama on the chin having already swung back to almost a cent down against the dollar overnight to just above $1.14. Focus was also pivoting to the Fed. The U.S. central bank won’t hold a news conference this month but will, as always, publish a statement, which is expected to lay the ground for a fourth rate hike of the year next month. “We think the Fed will keep raising rates until the data turns,” said Allianz Global Investors strategist Ann-Katrin Petersen in Frankfurt. That means three further rate hikes to 3-3.25 percent by the end of next year, which would further stretch the gap between U.S. and European interest rates. The dollar, which has soared this year on that divergence, was up 0.3 percent against a basket of top currencies and within striking distance of Wednesday’s one-month peak of 113.82 against the Japanese yen. Trade war tensions have been another factor spurring on the greenback. China’s latest salvo in that feud on Thursday was a call for Washington to respect its choice of development path, state media reported President Xi Jinping saying. Trump and Xi plan to meet on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina at the end of the month. Meeting former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in Beijing, Xi said he and Trump would have a “deep exchange of views”, the official Xinhua news agency reported. In commodities, U.S. crude futures edged up to $61.73 a barrel after falling to an eight-month trough on Wednesday. Brent crude rose 0.2 percent to $72.20 a barrel following a loss of 1.4 percent the previous day. Oil prices struggled after surging U.S. crude output hit another record and domestic inventories rose more than expected. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-11-08,"MOSCOW, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil firm, Rosneft , snubbed a meeting chaired by Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday aimed at consulting domestic energy companies as leading global producers signal a possible cut in crude output. A return to oil production curbs by OPEC and its allies next year cannot be ruled out, two sources in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said on Wednesday, in an effort to avert a supply glut that could weigh on prices. Some Russian companies, including Rosneft, opposed voluntary production cuts in the past, citing the risk of losing global market share to other countries and a need to maintain profitability. According to the list of Thursday’s attendees, seen by Reuters, Rosneft was represented at the meeting by Vladimir Feigin, head of a Moscow-based energy think-tank. He was listed as an adviser to Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin, a critic of OPEC and long-standing ally of President Vladimir Putin. Rosneft, which accounts for 40 percent of Russian oil output, declined to comment. Such events in the past were attended by high-ranking Rosneft officials, such as Pavel Fedorov, first vice-president for economics and finance. Russia has been cranking up oil production to capitalise on high prices, raising output to a 30-year high of 11.41 million barrels per day last month. Sechin said last month that Rosneft could increase production by the end of the year. The meeting at the Russian Energy Ministry took place before a gathering of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. JMMC monitors implementation of the 2016 Vienna accord on oil production cuts between OPEC and other producers led by Russia. In June, the pact’s participants decided to ease the curbs as production cuts had been much deeper than envisaged. The head of mid-sized oil producer Russneft, Evgeny Tolochek, said after the meeting on Thursday that oil production cuts had not been discussed.

2018-11-08,"SEATTLE, Nov 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Washington state voters have turned down what would have been the first U.S. carbon tax - but “carbon pricing” efforts are expected to push on in 2019, with nearly a dozen largely eastern states considering legislative proposals, experts say. Lawmakers in New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont aim to introduce carbon pricing legislation, including carbon taxes and market-based carbon cap-and-trade measures, said Michael Green with Boston-based carbon pricing think tank Climate XChange. The rejection of the Washington ballot initiative in mid-term elections this week “shifts the limelight to legislative approaches,” he said. Also, “California, Washington, Oregon and British Columbia have dominated” the issue, Green said. “It’s going to be the East Coast’s turn to make it happen and lead on climate.” Putting a pricetag on greenhouse gas emissions is considered crucial to stemming global climate change as it factors damage from climate change into economic decision making, including by businesses, economic experts say. In Washington, the Carbon Emissions Fee and Revenue Allocation Initiative would have imposed a $15 fee on each metric ton of carbon emissions, rising $2 a year until the state’s 2035 emissions target is met. While backers had not yet conceded defeat as of late Wednesday, the “no” votes were leading with more than 56 percent. The initiative’s defeat came after Washington voters turned down a similar proposal in 2016 and the state legislature failed to pass a carbon tax in the 2018 legislative session despite having a Democratic majority and a governor who strongly favors climate action. Voters in Portland, Ore., did approve a business tax to fund renewable energy on Tuesday. But some carbon pricing advocates think state legislatures now represent a better path forward. Green said he believes carbon pricing will have more success if leaders take a multi-state approach. For example, proposed legislation in Rhode Island and Connecticut contains “trigger” clauses that would enact carbon pricing only if their larger neighbours in Massachusetts and New York, respectively, adopt such policies. This strategy builds on the existing regional cap-and-trade system for electricity in the Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states. Massachusetts Republican Governor Charlie Baker, who was re-elected Tuesday, expressed support for a regional carbon tax during a gubernatorial debate on November 1. But legislative groups believe that Washington state’s multiple unsuccessful attempts at a carbon tax advanced the issue nationally. “Despite the setback of the Washington ballot initiative failing, the progress made from this fight cannot be overlooked,” said Jeff Mauk, executive director of the National Caucus of Environmental Legislators. “Washington was the first state to progress a carbon price to the Senate floor,” he said, and a “strong and diverse coalition” of backers formed around the latest ballot initiative. Mauk pointed to the likelihood of a “cap-and-invest” bill being introduced in Oregon’s next legislative session, and the potential for action in New Mexico, a state that has previously studied carbon pricing. Progressive legislators are also pledging to continue pushing for carbon pricing in Washington, though this week’s defeat suggests there may be less immediate momentum. Carbon pricing advocates pointed to the continuing financial power of Big Oil, which funded the successful opposition campaign to Washington’s carbon tax with more than $30 million spent on negative ads. The industry also successfully opposed a ballot initiative in Colorado calling for greater distances between oil and gas drilling and public spaces. “State legislators nationally need to learn a really difficult lessons from this: The oil companies will stop at absolutely nothing and they will spend anything they need to make sure that if any carbon pricing initiative ever goes to the ballot, it is defeated,” Washington State Senator Kevin Ranker told the Thomson Reuters Foundation via telephone. Oil lobbyists insist their opposition to taxes does not equate to across-the-board rejection of carbon pricing. “With this election behind us, there is an opportunity for interested parties to work together on a market-based program to provide real greenhouse gas emission reductions without leaving consumers and industries that fuel our state’s economy to bear an unfair burden,” said Catherine Reheis-Boyd, president of the Western States Petroleum Association, which helped bankroll the “no” campaign in Washington. Green believes petroleum lobbyists will have a harder time influencing lawmakers in states without significant oil industry jobs than it did influencing voters in Washington and Colorado. According to the World Bank, 46 countries and 25 states, cities or other jurisdictions have put a price on carbon, with another 53 carbon pricing schemes scheduled for implementation. “Carbon pricing in the United States is not dead and in fact, I think it has greater momentum,” Ranker said.

Manager magazin had reported that German carmakers Daimler (DAIGn.DE) and Volkswagen were prepared to fully cover the costs of the retrofits, which would reduce emissions to within permitted limits. The VW spokesman said the report was false, adding that Volkswagen had not made such an offer. Manager magazin later updated its report to say that VW was sticking with its position that it was willing to cover 80 percent of the costs. Car executives are meeting with German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer on Thursday to discuss how to tackle diesel emissions in Germany. Scheuer is due to make a statement on the outcome of the talks. Daimler declined to comment on the manager magazin report. BMW said it would comment after talks with Scheuer had concluded. The group has so far said it is not prepared to take part in a diesel hardware retrofit scheme.

2018-11-08,"CAPE TOWN, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Uganda expects to start producing oil in 2021, a year later than initially planned, and its refinery should be up and running by 2023, its oil minister said on Thursday. France’s Total is an investor in Uganda’s oilfields, with China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow Oil . “Our initial target was 2020. That seems to have slipped and we are looking now at 2021,” Irene Muloni said at the Africa Oil Week conference in Cape Town. That date is in line with industry targets. In April Uganda signed a deal with a consortium, including a subsidiary of General Electric, to build and operate a 60,000 barrel per day refinery that will cost $3 billion-$4 billion. Muloni said the refinery should be operational by 2023. Uganda discovered crude reserves more than 10 years ago but the start of production has been repeatedly delayed by disagreements with field operators over taxes and development strategy. Uganda initially said it would not produce oil until the refinery was complete but its timetable is now being driven by a planned export pipeline that will snake across neighbouring Tanzania. Muloni said she expected that to “come on line quickly. We are waiting for the companies to make their final investment decisions. The front-end engineering designs have been completed and we are just going through the processes of approval by the government.” She said she hoped it would be done before the end of 2018 but next year now looks more likely. Total has indicated it is willing to partly fund the project. The pipeline is being developed as a public private partnership. Government geologists estimate Uganda has crude reserves of 6.5 billion barrels in the Albertine rift basin along its border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Muloni said the success rate of finding oil there was over 85 percent “and the cost of finding oil in that place is less than a dollar a barrel.” (Editing by Susan Fenton)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/africa-oil-uganda/uganda-expects-first-oil-production-in-2021-refinery-by-2023-idUKL8N1XJ3VR,08 Nov 2018,"Uganda expects to start

Traders were gearing up for the latest U.S. Federal Reserve meeting in a confident mood and the contrast to a month ago, when markets were taking a painful pounding, could not have been more stark. European shares jumped to a one-month high after results from SocGen and Commerzbank and France’s Sodexho soothed concerns about slowing corporate earnings. Asia and Wall Street had set similar milestones overnight. The dollar and bond yields also rose, the U.S. currency pulling away from 2-1/2 week lows hit after Donald Trump’s loss of the House of Representatives in the midterms reduced the chance of another blizzard of tax cuts.

2018-11-08,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Toshiba Corp (6502.T) announced on Thursday it is shedding assets, cutting jobs and buying back its stock starting this week, sending its shares up 13 percent, as the once-mighty Japanese conglomerate aims to regain investor confidence.  The company announced it is liquidating its British nuclear power unit and selling its U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) business to China’s ENN Group as part of a new five-year business strategy, which also includes 7,000 job cuts, or 5 percent of its workforce, over five years. Toshiba’s shares surged 12.7 percent to close near two-year highs after the announcement, helped also by a much anticipated move to repurchase up to 40 percent of its own shares starting Friday.  The 143-year-old company has been trying to win back the market’s trust after a 2015 accounting scandal uncovered widespread irregularities at the laptops-to-nuclear conglomerate for years.   The scandal forced it to recognise huge cost overruns at now-bankrupt U.S. nuclear unit Westinghouse, prompting it to sell its prized memory chip unit earlier this year to a consortium led by U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital and leaving it with few growth businesses. “There had been reports about a possibility of selling non-performing business and job cuts so such moves had been expected at some point. But investors are taking heart,” said Hiroyuki Fukunaga, chief executive of Investrust, a financial advice firm.  “The share buyback announcement worth up to 40 percent of outstanding shares is definitely positive, too.” Toshiba had already promised a share buyback of 700 billion yen earlier this year, but the timing had been undecided. Its announcement on Thursday appeared to outweigh a weaker profit forecast - the company said it now expects a full-year operating profit of 60 billion yen rather than a previous estimate of 70 billion yen.  Toshiba had been trying to shed the troubled assets that could have exposed the Japanese company to future losses. The decision to liquidate NuGen, however, would be a blow to Britain’s plans to build a nuclear plant that was meant to provide 7 percent of the country’s electricity.  NuGen said 18 months of negotiations with a range of potential owners had failed to yield any deal, and that it was now up to the British government and the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to determine the future of the Moorside site in Cumbria. South Korea’s state-run Korea Electric Power Corp (KEPCO) (015760.KS) had been in talks with Toshiba to buy a stake in NuGen. South Korea’s energy ministry said on Thursday it will coordinate with the British government and monitor the liquidation process with KEPCO. Toshiba said it will sell the LNG business to ENN Ecological Holdings (600803.SS), a unit of Chinese gas company ENN Group.  It has spent years trying to either sell the gas to power customers or offload the business after signing a 20-year contract to buy LNG from Freeport in a venture announced in 2013. Asian LNG prices LNG-AS have plunged 42 percent in the past five years, raising fears of future losses. Toshiba will be paying the buyer $821 million to assume its commitment to purchase 2.2 million tonnes per year of the fuel from Freeport LNG in Texas - a cost booked as a charge for the current financial year. The company said its exit from the troubled businesses, along with the job cuts and other restructuring moves, will help it bolster its profitability in the longer run. It forecast an operating profit of 240 billion yen in fiscal 2021 compared to 60 billion yen in the current year.

2018-11-08,"(Corrects spelling of surnames) By Sebastien Malo NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - E nvironmentalists in the United States welcomed the election of candidates promising a ‘Green New Deal’, but cautioned that green goals would be hard to achieve under the administration of President Donald Trump. Congress will include four new representatives who campaigned on a public works program - similar to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal that helped end the 1930s depression - aimed at building a renewable energy economy. The plan will need to be packaged differently, said University at Albany political scientist Brian Greenhill, given Trump’s rollback of climate regulations and his dismissal of man-made global warming as a hoax. “I can’t imagine under the Trump administration that anything labeled ‘a Green New Deal’ would be successful, especially if it’s framed in terms of climate change,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. However, he added, the plan seemed like a “no-brainer” after recent discussions between House Republicans and Democrats about infrastructure as an area where the two parties could find common ground. Green victories came amid setbacks in Colorado, Arizona and Washington states, where voters rejected initiatives to curb fossil fuels by restricting drilling, putting a fee on carbon emissions, and mandating the wider use of renewable energy. Jason Albritton, a director at the Nature Conservancy, said that despite being “disappointed” by the rejection of those state measures, addressing environmental issues by creating jobs is “a potential path to success”.

2018-11-08,"TOKYO/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan’s Toshiba Corp will exit its U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by paying China’s ENN Ecological Holdings Co  more than $800 million to take over the unit as part of a plan to shed money-losing assets.  The sale is the disappointing culmination of a venture that puzzled analysts when it was announced in 2013. Asian LNG prices have plunged 42 percent in the past five years and the potential for future losses spurred Toshiba’s exit.      Under the deal, Toshiba will sell its Toshiba America LNG Corp unit to ENN Ecological, a unit of ENN Group, for $15 million, the Japanese company said in a statement on Thursday.  However, once that sale is complete, Toshiba will then make a one-off payment of $821 million to ENN to pass on its roughly $7 billion commitment, starting in 2020, to purchase 2.2 million tonnes per year of LNG over 20 years from Freeport LNG in Texas. “The project posed a huge risk, because no one knows how the situation will be over the next 20 years,” Toshiba’s Chief Executive Officer Nobuaki Kurumatani told reporters at a press conference. The company booked a charge of 93 billion yen ($818 million) for exiting the LNG business in its earnings it announced on Thursday. “The deal is our second major step to expand in the overseas upstream business. We expect to get 2.2 million tonnes of relatively low-cost LNG starting in 2020 to meet growing domestic demand,” said Clarissa Zhang, public relations director of ENN Ecological. Toshiba has spent years trying to either sell the gas to power customers or offload the business. Toshiba’s annual cost of its deal with Freeport was a bit over $360 million dollars, meaning the company is paying about two years of those costs to ENN to take the obligations, said Nicholas Browne, director of Asia-Pacific gas and LNG at Wood Mackenzie. “For ENN this represents a relatively low cost and immediate way to source significant U.S. volumes,” Browne said. “For Toshiba, it clearly ends their short foray in the LNG business. “ENN has been very open that it plans to set up an LNG trading business. As such, these volumes will contribute to their portfolio and some will not end up in China.” Still, the deal is a “positive sign for U.S. LNG developers that China is still open for business,” amid a trade war between the world’s two-biggest economies. Toshiba stunned the market in 2013, when it decided to enter the LNG business. With no experience in shipping or the logistics of the gas and LNG business it seemed an odd fit, analysts said at the time. Toshiba’s plan was to pitch LNG supplies as a sweetener to likely Asian buyers of its turbines used in combined cycle gas-fired power plants. “The company probably wanted to add value to its power plant business by selling not only the power plants but also fuel, but for plant builders, it’s always better to do it all via tenders,” said Junzo Tamamizu, managing partner of Clavis Energy Partners in Tokyo.

2018-11-08,"Nov 8 (Reuters) - The United States on Monday re-imposed sanctions against Iran’s oil exports to punish Tehran for its involvement in several Middle Eastern conflicts. Washington had been pushing governments to cut imports of Iranian oil to zero. But, fearing a price spike, it granted Iran’s biggest buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - sanctions waivers. That will allow the eight, which account for about 75 percent of all Iran’s oil exports, according to trade data, to import at least some oil for another 180 days. Washington and the recipients of the waivers have not disclosed how much oil they are allowed to import, or under what conditions deals can still be made. Analysts have estimated the overall volumes allowed under the waivers at between 700,000 and 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of around 3 million bpd in Iranian crude and condensate exports in mid-2018. J.P. Morgan said “the lack or difficulty in acquiring shipping insurance will help in reducing exports quickly as they did during last international sanctions.” The U.S. bank also said “payments for the oil by the exempt countries must go into escrow accounts in their local currency” and that this “means the money won’t directly go to Iran and it can only be used to buy certain non-sanctioned goods from its crude export customers.” Once the waivers expire after 180 days, new waivers are expected to be issued, with a source in China saying his country would likely receive another six months of exemptions, though at a lower rate of around 220,000 bpd. For further details, see below. China, the world’s biggest importer of crude oil, is also the top buyer of Iranian oil, and its mostly state-owned refiners have lobbied hard for waivers. Several Chinese sources with knowledge of the matter said China would be allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period of 180 days. That would be about half the daily average China has been importing from Iran since January 2016, trade data showed. However, one source said the United States had attached strings to the waivers, including counterparty disclosures and laying open settlement methods, which were being evaluated before placing new orders with Iran. India has become the world’s third-biggest oil importer, recently overtaking Japan. India is also Iran’s second-biggest oil customer and will be one of the most exposed to a forced drop in supply because of its relative proximity to Iran. One Indian source close to the country’s refining sector said India would likely be allowed to import around 300,000 bpd of Iranian crude during the exemption period compared with normal volumes of around 450,000 to 550,000 bpd. South Korea is a large buyer of Iranian condensate, a super light form of crude oil, used by its large petrochemical industry. A close U.S. ally, South Korea had stopped buying crude from Iran ahead of the sanctions while still lobbying for exemptions. This week, reports emerged that South Korea received a waiver allowing it to import around 4 million barrels a month, equal to about 130,000 bpd, of Iranian crude and condensate. South Korea has averaged over 200,000 bpd of oil imports from Iran so far this year, down from around 350,000 bpd in 2017. Banking sources said any Korean payments for Iranian oil would need to be made in its won currency. The won-denominated payments will go into escrow accounts handled by the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and Woori Bank. Officials from both banks said, however, that won-denominated payments for Iranian oil were still being reviewed, and that no schedule a for resumption was set yet. JAPAN , another key Asian U.S. ally, also ceased Iranian oil imports prior to the sanctions, but has received a waiver to import an undisclosed amount of oil from Iran in the next 180 days. Japan’s trade minister, Hiroshige Seko, said on Tuesday that Japanese buyers were expected to resume imports from the Islamic Republic again soon. Refining sources in Japan, however, said they first needed to evaluated the conditions attached to the waivers, with no new orders likely before December. Taiwan is only an occasional importer of Iranian oil, and no details regarding its waivers have been disclosed. Italy and Turkey have been importing around 200,000 bpd of oil from Iran over the past two years, with Greece importing less than 100,000 bpd. Italy and Greece have completely suspended purchases in recent weeks. The waivers for those countries took the market by surprise and trading sources have said they are now evaluating prospects for resuming some imports. Turkey has said it is also evaluating possible imports after receiving a waiver, but President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday the country would not abide by the sanctions as they were aimed at “unbalancing the world”.

While a divided Congress will make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislation, such as additional tax cuts, investors do not expect a reversal of recently enacted tax cuts and deregulation. “The key point after the midterm elections is that U.S. stocks showed they had developed immunity towards higher yields. The last time long-term Treasury yields were at this level a month ago, they had helped trigger a major fall by stocks,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Steady U.S. fundamentals will support this trend of equities and yields rising in tandem, which should also prop up the dollar in the longer term.” The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to 3.25 percent on Wednesday, its highest since Oct. 9, with Wall Street’s rally reducing demand for safe-haven debt. It last stood at 3.23 percent. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies gained 0.2 percent to 96.177, pulling back from 95.678 plumbed on Wednesday, its lowest since Oct. 22.

Some focus was also on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy due later on Thursday. The Fed, however, is not expected to hike interest rates until its next gathering in December and analysts expected this meeting to have limited market impact. The central bank has tightened monetary policy three times in 2018, with the latest rate hike coming in September. “A split Congress is unlikely to materially alter the Fed’s near-term hiking trajectory and the Fed will be biased to keep raising rates until the data or financial conditions turn,” strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote.

2018-11-08,"NEW YORK, Nov 7 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - E nvironmentalists in the United States welcomed the election of candidates promising a ‘Green New Deal’, but cautioned that green goals would be hard to achieve under the administration of President Donald Trump. Congress will include four new representatives who campaigned on a public works program - similar to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s New Deal that helped end the 1930s depression - aimed at building a renewable energy economy. The plan will need to be packaged differently, said University at Albany political scientist Brian Greenhill, given Trump’s rollback of climate regulations and his dismissal of man-made global warming as a hoax. “I can’t imagine under the Trump administration that anything labeled ‘a Green New Deal’ would be successful, especially if it’s framed in terms of climate change,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. However, he added, the plan seemed like a “no-brainer” after recent discussions between House Republicans and Democrats about infrastructure as an area where the two parties could find common ground. Green victories came amid setbacks in Colorado, Arizona and Washington states, where voters rejected initiatives to curb fossil fuels by restricting drilling, putting a fee on carbon emissions, and mandating the wider use of renewable energy. Jason Albertsons, a director at the Nature Conservancy, said that despite being “disappointed” by the rejection of those state measures, addressing environmental issues by creating jobs is “a potential path to success”. The most vocal champion of the Green New Deal has been , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 29-year-old educator who won a seat in New York state.

2018-11-08,"* Private refiners ramped up buying to meet fuel demand * Jan-Oct crude imports up 8 pct, on track for annual record * Gas imports in October rise y/y but ease back from September (Adds quote and details) BEIJING, Nov 8 (Reuters) - China’s crude oil imports rose to all-time high on a daily basis in October, supported by record demand from private refiners and healthy margins, customs data showed Thursday. Imports in October surged 32 percent from a year earlier to 40.80 million tonnes, or 9.61 million barrels per day (bpd), data from the General Administration of Customs showed, climbing from 9.05 million bpd in September. The previous daily record of 9.60 million bpd was touched in April 2018. The imports rose 8.1 percent for the first 10 months of the year from the same period last year to 377.16 million tonnes, or 9.06 million bpd, on track for another record year of shipments. The record volumes were a result of strong imports from China’s private refiners, often known as “teapots”. These oil processors bought 8.22 million tonnes of crude during the month, the highest monthly amount ever since Beijing began issuing import quotas to them in 2015, according to Emma Li, an analyst with Refinitiv Oil Research and Forecasts. “Independents bought record amounts of crude in October as they ramped up utilization rates to meet pent-up demand for gasoline and diesel,” Li said. “Many teapots also started stockpiling for January and February next year in a rush to use up their quota this year.” China’s overall import volumes for October were in line with Refinitiv Oil Forecast’s expectations of 40.95 million tonnes. The imports might have been higher except CNOOC Ltd’s Huizhou oil plant started a two-month long turnaround in October, curbing purchases from one of China’s largest refineries. Total natural gas imports in October via both pipeline and as liquefied natural gas (LNG) were at 7.3 million tonnes, up 25.6 percent from the same month last year, but easing from 7.62 million tonnes in September.

2018-11-08,"BRASILIA, Nov 7 (Reuters) - Brazil’s lower house of Congress on Wednesday passed a new  program for the auto industry that provides incentives for local companies that improve the fuel efficiency and safety of their vehicles and invest in research and development. The so-called Rota 2030 program will run for 15 years and provide tax credits over the next five years estimated to total 2.1 billion reais ($560 million) in 2019 and 1.5 billion reais in 2020. The bill must still win approval in the Senate. The program lowers by at least 3 percentage points the tax on industrial products applied to vehicles that have hybrid or “flex” motors that run both gasoline and ethanol. The bill has been long-awaited by the auto industry that was one of the hardest-hit sectors of the Brazilian economy during the recent two-year recession which saw car sales plummet. The bill renews the incentives for the car industry to have assembly plants in the poorer Northeast region of Brazil, where Ford Motor Co and Fiat have factories. ROTA 2030, which would go into effect next year, will exclude vehicle importers, which the government had included in the bill to avoid any complaints at the World Trade Organization (WTO).

2018-11-08,"* OPEC-led production cuts next year cannot be ruled out -sources * U.S. crude output tripled since 2008: tmsnrt.rs/2D82k38 * Broad Iran sanctions waivers have prevented price spike By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Thursday, supported by rumblings from within OPEC that production curbs may become necessary again to prevent a return of global oversupply. But soaring U.S. crude output, which hit a record 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) last week, kept a lid on prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $61.75 per barrel at 0120 GMT, up 8 cents from their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were up 6 cents at $72.13 a barrel. A group of producers around the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as Russia decided last June to relax output curbs in place since 2017, after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce oil prices and make up for supply losses from Iran. But with Iran sanctions now in place and oil still in ample availability, OPEC-led production cuts next year cannot be ruled out, two OPEC sources said on Wednesday. “OPEC and Russia may use cuts to support $70 per barrel,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. “The introduction of U.S. sanctions earlier this week against Iran failed to lift the market given the announcement that eight countries, including three of the world’s biggest importers, would receive waivers to carry on buying Iranian crude for up to six months,” Hansen said. Preventing oil prices from rising any further has been a relentless rise in U.S. crude output C-OUT-T-EIA, which hit a record 11.6 million bpd in the week ending Nov. 2, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data released on Wednesday. That’s a threefold increase from the U.S. low reached a decade ago, and a 22.2 percent rise just this year. It makes the United States the world’s biggest producer of crude oil. That has impacted U.S. crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA, which rose by 5.8 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 2, to 431.79 million barrels, the EIA said. Crude stocks moved back above their five-year average levels in October. Production has not just risen in the United States, but also in many other countries, including Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Brazil, stoking producer concerns of a return of oversupply that depressed oil prices between 2014 and 2017. “Producers are concerned about the potential oversupply ... after EIA reported that crude inventories rose by 5.8 million barrels,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

2018-11-08,"BUENOS AIRES, Nov 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said it would begin a review of  antidumping duties it placed last year on biodiesel imported from Argentina, the Argentine Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. trade officials had shut down the sale of Argentine biodiesel with steep tariffs after finding in late 2017 that imports from the South American country were being sold at prices well below market value in the United States. Washington was now prepared to reconsider that decision, the statement said. “If the negotiations are successful, imports of a product from our country, with high added-value, could recover their access to the very significant U.S. market,” said Argentine Foreign Minister Jorge Faurie in the statement. Reuters was unable to immediately reach the U.S. Department of Commerce to confirm the details of the announcement. President Donald Trump’s administration has made enforcement of trade laws a top priority. U.S. producers of biodiesel petitioned the government shortly after Trump took office, saying below-market foreign imports from both Argentina and Indonesia were harming domestic makers. In 2016, prior to the duties, Argentina accounted for two-thirds of U.S. biodiesel imports, totaling 916 million gallons (3.5 billion liters), according to U.S. government data. Argentina remains one of the world’s top providers of biodiesel fuel, exporting 1.65 million tonnes in 2017. But the retaliatory tariffs from the U.S. rattled the industry, causing major exporters in Argentina, including global grain producers Cargill and Bunge, to redirect their cargoes to other countries.

2018-11-08,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.5 pct, Nikkei climbs 2.1 pct * Dollar off lows as U.S. yields rise amid improved risk appetite * Oil struggles near 8-month lows * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday as investors, relieved to have moved past the U.S. midterm elections without any major political surprises, drove a Wall Street rally, while the dollar clawed back some of its earlier losses. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.5 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI added 1.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei gained 2.1 percent. Wall Street’s main indexes rose more than 2 percent on Wednesday, led by the technology and healthcare sectors as the market breathed a sigh of relief after the U.S. midterm elections, in which Democrats wrested control of the House of Representatives and Republicans retained the Senate. While a divided Congress will make it harder for President Donald Trump to push through new legislation, such as additional tax cuts, investors do not expect a reversal of recently enacted tax cuts and deregulation. “The key point after the midterm elections is that U.S. stocks showed they had developed immunity towards higher yields. The last time long-term Treasury yields were at this level a month ago, they had helped trigger a major fall by stocks,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “Steady U.S. fundamentals will support this trend of equities and yields rising in tandem, which should also prop up the dollar in the longer term.” The 10-year Treasury note yield rose to 3.25 percent on Wednesday, its highest since Oct. 9, with Wall Street’s rally reducing demand for safe-haven debt. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was at 96.18, after pulling back from a 2-1/2-week low of 95.678 plumbed on Wednesday. The greenback had fallen to the low on Wednesday in a knee-jerk reaction to the U.S. midterm election results, with a divided Congress seen dulling President Trump’s fiscal stimulus drive. Some focus was on the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy due later on Thursday. The Fed, however, is not expected to hike interest rates until its next gathering in December and analysts expected this meeting to have limited market impact. The euro was 0.05 percent higher at $1.1433 after pulling back sharply from a high of $1.1500 brushed earlier on Wednesday. The dollar was a shade higher at 113.56 yen and in striking distance of a one-month peak of 113.82 reached the previous day. In commodities, U.S. crude futures were flat at $61.67 a barrel after falling to an eight-month trough of $61.20 on Wednesday. Oil was pressured after surging U.S. crude output hit another record and domestic inventories rose more than expected.

2018-11-08,"* Australia’s treasurer blocks CK Group buyout of APA * Move seen partly to prevent Chinese ownership of gas assets * APA shares fall 11 pct to 5-month low (Adds analyst quote and background) SYDNEY, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Shares in Australia’s biggest gas pipeline company APA Group fell 11 percent on Thursday after Australia’s treasurer said he intended to block a A$13 billion ($9.5 billion) buyout by Hong Kong’s CK Group. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said after market hours on Wednesday that his preliminary view was that the takeover was against the national interest because it would create a concentration of foreign ownership in the sector. Frydenbeg said the move was not a reflection on CK Infrastructure Holdings Ltd, part of the empire founded by Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing. Analysts said the move appeared to be partly aimed at preventing Chinese ownership of a strategic asset. “I don’t think its just the China element, but a combination of important assets, concentration of ownership and China,” said Morningstar analyst Adrian Atkins. “I think the Chinese element maybe had a bit more of an impact than the treasurer’s letting on ... it’d probably be unpopular with the electorate to have a major asset go to a Chinese firm,” he said. The rebuff is likely to test an already strained relationship between Australia and its largest trading partner, just as Australia’s foreign minister makes a delayed visit to Beijing. Earlier this year, Australia banned China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from supplying equipment for a 5G mobile network citing national security risks, while Canberra last year accused Beijing of meddling in domestic affairs. APA Group shares, which had never traded at the A$11 offer price, fell back to pre-bid levels at A$8.48, an almost five-month low, wiping A$1.2 billion off its market value. The broader market opened higher. APA said it noted the treasurer’s decision and would update shareholders in due course. CK Infrastructure said in a statement on Wednesday that it had noted the treasurer’s comments.

2018-11-08,"BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President-elect Jair Bolsonaro faced the first setback in his plans to reduce the country’s massive deficit on Wednesday, as the Senate approved a 16 percent pay rise for the judiciary against his wishes.  The far-right politician was elected last month on a wave of anger over corruption and economic recession, which he and many voters blamed on the leftist Workers Party’s long reign in power. Bolsonaro, who takes the reins on Jan.1, has begun naming key cabinet posts and laying out his vision for government, but, like other leaders before him, has found making changes in Brazil may not be an easy task. He told reporters that it was “not the moment” to approve pay hikes. But the Senate went ahead and passed a bill raising judges’ salaries, which serve as a benchmark for other public sector pay. This will add an estimated 4 billion reais (£816.3 million) to next year’s deficit. Bolsonaro’s campaign pledges to merge the agriculture and environment ministries have also gone awry. As he named Congresswoman Tereza Cristina, the leader of Brazil’s farm caucus, to be his agriculture minister on Wednesday, he ditched his initial plan to merge the two portfolios. The plan had faced opposition from environmentalists, who said it would lead deforestation to explode, and from the farm sector that feared it would strain trade relationships. Cristina is an agronomist from the major farm state of Mato Grosso do Sul. She is the first woman to be named as a minister by Bolsonaro, who has a history of making misogynistic remarks. Bolsonaro, who has said he wants to reduce the number of ministries, said on Wednesday he planned to merge the labour ministry with another, without providing details. On his second day back in Brasilia as president-elect, Bolsonaro met with incumbent President Michel Temer to discuss prospects for what many say are urgently needed economic reforms. Bolsonaro said this week he would discuss with Temer the need to push through a pension overhaul this year to bring the deficit under control. At a news conference after the meeting, Temer said he had invited Bolsonaro to accompany him to the G20 summit from Nov. 30 to Dec. 1 in Buenos Aires, as part of the government transition. Bolsonaro also promised on Wednesday to prioritise a solution for Brazil’s public security problems, a central plank in the former army captain’s platform that emphasizes law and order.  Augusto Heleno, the head of a group of retired army generals who backed Bolsonaro’s presidential bid, will take the top security position in the new cabinet, a spokesman for the transition team said on Wednesday. Heleno had previously been announced as the next defence minister.  Bolsonaro told reporters that the chief executive of state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Ivan Monteiro, was not expected to stay in the new administration. But GloboNews TV channel later reported that Bolsonaro would keep Monteiro, who took the helm of the world’s most indebted listed oil company in June. Monteiro said Tuesday he was open to staying if invited. Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bolsonaro said he and his economic guru Paulo Guedes had not discussed the fate of central bank chief Ilan Goldfajn. His foreign minister will be a career diplomat, he said.
