2018-03-08,"* Reports North Korea offers to end nuclear, missile testing * Trump goes ahead with tariffs, exempts Canada and Mexico * Other exemptions could come but perhaps with conditions * Asia shares ex-Japan flat, Nikkei futures trade firmer * Euro dips as ECB cautious on policy, yen eases before BOJ By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 9 (Reuters) - Asian stocks looked set for guarded gains on Friday on reports North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had offered to stop nuclear testing and to arrange a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump. Fox News reported the offer was to be announced by South Korea’s national security adviser at a White House event at 0000 GMT. The mood had already brightened a little after Trump pressed ahead with tariffs but offered conditional exemptions for Canada and Mexico, offering at least the hope a full-blown trade war could be averted. The White House said other countries could apply for exemptions on the 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium, but details were sparse on when they might be granted and under what terms. Several major trading partners have said they will respond with tariffs or direct action of their own. “Markets have cheered up a little but exclusions are likely to come with caveats demanding reciprocity - that’s the kind of guy the President is,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at broker AxiTrader. “Fears have been eased in the immediate term, but it’s clear that China, and to a lesser extent the EU, is about to come in for greater scrutiny.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was barely changed, while Australia firmed a fraction. Futures for Japan’s Nikkei pointed to opening gains of around 150 points for that market . E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were up 0.1 percent, after Wall Street got a late lift from the tariff news. The Dow ended Thursday with a gain of 0.38 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.45 percent and the Nasdaq 0.42 percent. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso inched higher, though both countries remain locked in tough negotiations with the United States over NAFTA. Rising protectionism was a risk cited overnight by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi following the central bank’s latest policy meeting. While the ECB did drop its easing bias as some expected, Draghi sounded in no rush to start unwinding stimulus. Analysts suspected the central bank was also uncomfortable with the strength of the euro, which this week hit its highest since August 2014 on a trade-weighted basis. “Draghi did seem to be playing a dovish card today,” said Gavin Friend, a senior market strategist at NAB in London. “Observers have gotten a feeling we will have to wait perhaps until June for some meatier changes to communication.” Friend wagers the ECB will end bond buying between September and December, before moving to rate rises sometime in 2019. The dovish tone was enough to see the euro fade back to $1.2310, having shed 0.8 percent on Thursday. That helped the U.S. dollar gain 0.5 percent on a basket of currencies to stand at 90.129. The dollar nudged up 0.2 percent on the yen to 106.40 , amid a mild recovery in risk appetites. Attention now turns to the Bank of Japan’s policy meeting later on Friday. Fears of a global trade war, recent market volatility and a strong yen give the bank plenty of reason to maintain its massive asset buying campaign, and to play down the prospect of an exit anytime soon. “Actual policy tweaks in terms of asset purchases or yield-curve control settings remain some way off, but words can be very powerful,” said analysts at ANZ. “Any more detailed hints about timing will move the yen,” they added. “The global liquidity being provided by the BoJ and ECB has taken on added importance for asset markets since the Federal Reserve starting winding back its own quantitative easing programme.” Oil prices steadied in Asia after slipping overnight, with sentiment still dogged by signs of building inventories, surging U.S. crude production and jitters about a potential trade war. U.S. crude bounced 22 cents in early trade to $60.34 per barrel. Brent crude futures had ended Thursday down 73 cents at $63.61 per barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-03-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, headed for a second straight weekly drop on a stronger dollar, signs of an inventory build at the U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, surging U.S. crude production and investor jitters about a potential trade war.       Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 73 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $63.61 per barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 fell $1.03, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $60.12 per barrel. Brent was on track for a drop of around 0.8 percent this week, after last week’s 4.4 percent slide. WTI was on track for a 1.5 percent decline after a 3.6 percent slide last week. “It looks to me that crude has peaked and it’s heading lower,” said Walter Zimmerman, chief technical analyst at United-ICAP. “I see it heading back to test the early February lows, $57 for WTI and $62 for Brent. And I’m not at all confident that those levels are going to hold,” he said.  The dollar rose about 0.6 percent against a basket of currencies .DXY. A stronger greenback makes it more expensive to buy dollar-denominated commodities like oil.  Also pressuring crude prices, data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub rose by more than 290,000 barrels in the week to March 6, said traders who saw the data.  This increase, if confirmed by official data, would be the first build in 12 weeks at Cushing, where stockpiles have more than halved since November. Data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed U.S. crude production hit a record of almost 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) in the week ended March 2. The EIA production data is “finally taking some of the wind out of the sails of the bullish speculators,” said Rob Haworth, senior investment strategist with U.S. Bank Wealth Management.     Worries that Washington might start a trade war also put markets on edge. “Until the U.S. tariff issue is better defined, we feel that odds favor a renewed sharp downturn in the stock market that will easily spill into the oil space,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates said in a note.  U.S. crude output is expected to surge beyond 11 million bpd by late 2018, limiting the effectiveness of output cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other producers.    Adding to concerns is China’s reported drop in crude imports for February. Goldman Sachs re-issued its 2018 global oil demand growth forecast of 1.85 million bpd, despite recent signs of a slight slowdown, citing a strong start to the year and a pattern of second-quarter demand acceleration.

2018-03-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major U.S. stock indexes closed higher and Canadian and Mexican currencies gained briefly on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump set tariffs on steel and aluminium imports but exempted Canada and Mexico. Trump had earlier pledged to slap tariffs on all countries, and strategists said Thursday’s plan was milder than many investors expected. Other countries can apply for exemptions, according to the Trump administration, although details of when they would be granted were thin. “He dialed it back a little bit,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “But we’re still going in the wrong direction from a policy perspective if you’re a markets-focused globalist.” Trump is imposing 25 percent tariffs on steel imports and 10 percent for aluminium. Investors have been on edge since last week when Trump proposed the tariffs, sparking worries that the move would trigger a global trade war. The Canadian dollar and Mexican peso briefly gained against the dollar following Thursday announcement. “Probably a sigh of relief to the extent that it is not going to get slapped on Canada straight away,” said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist at Scotiabank. Canada is the largest supplier of both steel and aluminium to the United States The Mexican peso gained 0.09 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.64. The Canadian dollar rose 0.05 percent versus the greenback at 1.29 per dollar. The euro was up 0.02 percent to $1.2313, while the dollar index rose 0.53 percent.  Earlier, euro dropped as the European Central Bank signaled caution on inflation and protectionism. While the ECB took a small step toward weaning the euro-zone economy off protracted stimulus by dropping its easing bias, ECB President Mario Draghi said monetary policy would remain “reactive” and that underlying inflation was subdued.  Draghi also addressed the U.S. tariff plans, saying, “If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are.”  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 93.85 points, or 0.38 percent, to 24,895.21, the S&P 500 gained 12.17 points, or 0.45 percent, to 2,738.97, and the Nasdaq Composite added 31.30 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,427.95. The U.S. healthcare sector was rattled as health insurer Cigna Corp said it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co for about $54 billion. Express Scripts shares jumped 8.6 percent while Cigna dropped 11.5 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.45 percent, and the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.02 percent.     Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.8571 percent, from 2.883 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices fell and were setting up for a second consecutive weekly drop as the dollar strengthened and concerns over rising U.S. crude production continued to mount on signs of an inventory build at a key U.S. storage hub. Brent crude futures fell 73 cents, or 1.1 percent, to settle at $63.61 per barrel. U.S. crude futures fell $1.03, or 1.7 percent, to settle at $60.12 per barrel.

2018-03-08,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text) By Aaron Sheldrick and Malcolm Foster OKUMA, Japan, March 8 (Reuters) - A costly “ice wall” is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, data from operator Tokyo Electric Power Co shows, preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seven years after the disaster. When the ice wall was announced in 2013, Tepco assured sceptics that it would limit the flow of groundwater into the plant’s basements, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris from the site’s reactors, to “nearly nothing.” However, since the ice wall became fully operational at the end of August, an average of 141 metric tonnes a day of water has seeped into the reactor and turbine areas, more than the average of 132 metric tonnes a day during the prior nine months, a Reuters analysis of the Tepco data showed. The groundwater seepage has delayed Tepco’s clean-up at the site and may undermine the entire decommissioning process for the plant, which was battered by a tsunami seven years ago this Sunday. Waves knocked out power and triggered meltdowns at three of the site’s six reactors that spewed radiation, forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned to this once-fertile coast. Though called an ice wall, Tepco has attempted to create something more like a frozen soil barrier. Using 34.5 billion yen ($324 million) in public funds, Tepco sunk about 1,500 tubes filled with brine to a depth of 30 metres (100 feet) in a 1.5-kilometre (1-mile) perimeter around four of the plant’s reactors. It then cools the brine to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit). The aim is to freeze the soil into a solid mass that blocks groundwater flowing from the hills west of the plant to the coast. However, the continuing seepage has created vast amounts of toxic water that Tepco must pump out, decontaminate and store in tanks at Fukushima that now number 1,000, holding 1 million tonnes. It says it will run out of space by early 2021. “I believe the ice wall was ‘oversold’ in that it would solve all the release and storage concerns,” said Dale Klein, the former chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the head of an external committee advising Tepco on safety issues. “The hydrology of the Fukushima site is very complicated and thus the exact water flow is hard to predict,” he said, “especially during heavy rains.” The water inflows often fluctuate with rainfall. The dry month of January averaged 83 tons a day, Tepco data showed. But when a typhoon struck during the last week of October, 866 tons a day poured into the reactors. Overall, Tepco says a combination of drains, pumps and the ice wall has cut water flows by three-quarters, from 490 tons a day during the December 2015 to February 2016 period to an average of 110 tons a day for December 2017 to February 2018. It is hard to measure exactly how much the ice wall is contributing, Tepco officials say, but based on computer analysis the utility estimates the barrier is reducing water flows by about 95 tonnes a day compared to two years ago, before the barrier was operating. “Our assessment is that the ice wall has been effective,” said Naohiro Masuda, Tepco’s chief decommissioning officer, adding that rain falling within the ice wall perimeter contributed to surging volumes. “We now believe we have a system in place to manage the water level.” However, a government-commissioned panel on Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the ice wall, saying it was partially effective but more steps were needed. Controlling the groundwater seepage using the ice wall has been central to Japan’s program to show it had the Fukushima decommissioning in hand. The barrier was announced just days before Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared that Fukushima was “under control” in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee. In addition to the building costs, the ice wall needs an estimated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year to run, enough to power about 15,000 typical Japanese homes. Meanwhile, Tepco must decide how to cope with the growing volume of water stored on site. The purification process removes 62 radioactive elements from the contaminated water but it leaves tritium, a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water. Not considered harmful in low doses, tritium is released into oceans and rivers by nuclear plants around the world at various national standard levels. But local residents, particularly fishermen, oppose ocean releases because they fear it will keep consumers from buying Fukushima products. Many countries, including South Korea and China, still have restrictions on produce from Fukushima and neighbouring areas. A government-commissioned task force is examining five options for disposing of the tritium-laced water, including ocean releases, though no decision has been made. Ken Buesseler, a radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States, suggests that Tepco should open the tanks to external inspections to see if the water is safe. “From the public’s viewpoint, I think they’d want a bit of independent confirmation,” Buesseler said. “It’s no harder and a lot cheaper than building an ice wall.” ($1 = 106.0900 yen) Reporting by Malcolm Foster and Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by

2018-03-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil producer Hess Corp on Thursday disclosed plans to buy back an additional $1 billion in shares by the end of 2018, averting a second tangle with activist hedge fund Elliott Management on the eve of nominations for the Hess board. The new buyback would bring its total repurchase plan to $1.5 billion since late last year. It includes an accelerated share repurchase of $500 million. In that arrangement, generally the company will buy its shares from an investment bank.  The oil and gas producer said it would also add two new drilling rigs to its North Dakota operations and look to lower operating costs at its biggest production area.  Hess shares dipped 13 cents to $46.61 in Thursday afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Hess did not mention Elliott in its disclosure, but the company’s CEO said the greater buybacks would not hurt plans for heavy future investments in Guyana. Nominations for its board close on Friday.  “We can expand the buyback authorization without compromising our ability to fund this world-class investment,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement. Elliott, which owns more than 6 percent of Hess, said it supports the buyback and praised Hess’s plans to review its operations ahead of the Guyana project.  “We are encouraged that the company has indicated that they are committed to closing the value gap and will be dynamic in exploring further steps to do so” before beginning to produce oil from the project in Guyana, Elliott said in a statement. Exxon Mobil Corp, operator of the Guyana project, expects oil production there to begin by March 2020. In December, Elliott criticized what it called “continuing underperformance” at Hess, which has not made a profit since 2014, when its stock price was more than double current levels. Elliott expects to stay actively invested and to track changes at Hess, according to a person familiar with the fund’s plans.  Hess’s oil and natural gas production has dropped 7 percent in three years due largely to maturing operations in North Dakota. Rivals have bounced back faster from the industry downturn.   Elliott, the hedge fund led by billionaire Paul Singer, pushed for changes at Hess in 2013. Just ahead of the annual shareholder meeting in May 2013, Hess conceded to an agreement that added three Elliott appointees to the board, while Elliott supported five directors from Hess’s slate. John Hess remained CEO but yielded his role as chairman.

2018-03-08,"(Adds details from complaint, comment by Vivint, other background) By Nichola Groom March 8 (Reuters) - New Mexico’s attorney general on Thursday sued Vivint Solar Inc, alleging the company engages in unfair trade practices when signing up customers for its residential solar contracts. Vivint, one of the nation’s largest rooftop solar installers, said the lawsuit was without merit. The announcement comes a year after New Mexico’s attorney general told the company that the state intended to file an action against Vivint and its officers. The company disclosed that notice in a regulatory filing last March. Residential solar companies have faced criticism in recent years for aggressive sales tactics that contributed to a fall in adoption of rooftop solar last year. In the complaint, the state said Vivint’s contract, known as a power purchase agreement, “hooks consumers into paying more for energy, entangles consumers’ property rights, and ensnares consumers with a twenty-year contract.” It alleges that Vivint, which signs up customers through door-to-door solicitations, makes inaccurate promises about the cost savings provided by its solar systems and misleading claims about the power and rates provided by utilities. It also says Vivint’s practice of filing financial statements called “fixture filings” that list it as a secured party on a home’s title creates confusion when a homeowner tries to sell or refinance the property. The lawsuit was filed in New Mexico state court in Bernalillo County. Vivint, which is based in Lehi, Utah, said it could not comment specifically on the pending litigation. “Our commitment to our customers is to provide them the opportunity to adopt clean, renewable energy while always adhering to the highest ethical sales standards. We believe we have honored this commitment in New Mexico and that our practices in the state comply with applicable law,” the company said in an emailed statement.

2018-03-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group LP (BX.N) are working on a joint $10 billion (7.24 billion pounds) bid for BHP Billiton Plc’s BLT.L U.S. shale assets, Sky News said on Thursday. Shell and Blackstone’s offer will only be one of several credible proposals that BHP will receive for its U.S. shale operations, Sky News said, citing banking sources. BHP, Shell and Blackstone declined to comment.  Private equity companies have been active buyers of U.S. shale producing assets in recent years. This week, Devon Energy (DVN.N) said it sold some shale-gas assets in Texas for $553 million to a buyer that Tudor Pickering Holt energy analysts identified as a private equity firm. Devon did not disclose the name of the buyer.   BHP’s acreage is located adjacent to assets controlled by Shell and Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico. Anadarko bid late last year on BHP’s onshore properties, according to two people familiar with the transaction.  Anadarko did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Steve Pastor, BHP’s president for petroleum operations, said this week the company would consider swapping certain onshore oil and gas assets with competitors’ offshore assets as part of its effort to exit U.S. shale operations. BHP, the world’s largest miner, said last month it expected to receive initial bids for the operations in the June quarter.

2018-03-08,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland’s law on natural gas storage violates the European Union’s rules on security of gas supplies, the EU’s executive said on Thursday, giving Warsaw two months to address its concerns. Poland amended a bill on obligatory oil and gas reserves in the summer of 2017 to set conditions requiring private gas companies that want to import gas to maintain some reserves. Under the bill, gas importers with inventories abroad will have to book transmission capacity at cross-border links to be able to send gas to Poland in case of emergency.  “The conditions to fulfil the obligation by storing gas abroad in practice make such storage less attractive and more cumbersome than storing in Poland,” the European Commission said in a statement. “The Commission is of the view that the Polish gas storage obligation is incompatible with the EU measures to safeguard the security of gas supply.”  Poland, once viewed as a champion of democratic change after the fall of Communism, has been locked in disputes with Brussels since the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party came to power in 2015 over issues ranging from immigration and environment to the country’s rule of law.  Poland’s energy ministry played down the Commission’s concerns, saying they were part of a “routine analysis” of compliance of national laws with EU regulations. “The Minister of Energy positively assesses the functioning of the current system of security of supplies,” the ministry said in a statement on its website “The recent (law) changes have positively affected the level of energy security.”  Some smaller Polish players in the gas market have criticised the bill, saying it is unfair and will result in gas prices rising in Poland. Should Poland fail to address the EU concerns, the Commission may decide to send “a reasoned opinion,” which would take the infringement procedures further and could end in referring the case to the European Court of Justice.

2018-03-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House has made preliminary plans for a meeting on Monday between rivals in the corn and oil industries to discuss potential changes to the nation’s biofuels policy, two sources familiar with the planning told Reuters. Unlike previous meetings on the issue, President Donald Trump will not be in attendance, the sources said on Thursday, though agency leaders and executives from the oil and corn industry will participate and key lawmakers may also attend.  Trump is expected to be traveling early next week. A White House official did not immediately comment. The meeting is the latest in a series of talks between Big Corn and Big Oil arranged by the White House since late last year amid rising concern over the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a law requiring refiners to mix biofuels such as corn-based ethanol into their fuel. The battle between the oil industry and corn growers pits two traditionally Republican constituencies against each other. They are both now promoting their views to a Republican president over a program started under the administration of President George W. Bush that was designed to help farmers and reduce U.S. petroleum imports. The RFS currently requires refiners to cover the cost of blending increasing volumes of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into the nation’s fuel each year. To prove compliance, refiners must earn or purchase tradable blending credits, known as RINs - the price of which has skyrocketed in recent years. Last week, Trump supported a two-step approach to reducing credit costs. That had the backing of refiners but faced resistance from the corn industry, which supports the current form of the law, Reuters reported. The plan included a two-year cap on credit prices, as well as a concession to the ethanol industry that would allow higher-ethanol blended gasoline to be sold year-round - something advocates said could drive down credit prices in the long term.

2018-03-08,"(Updates with afternoon trading) * Euro falls as ECB’s president rings cautious note * Hopes of milder U.S. tariffs support market sentiment * Wall Street treads water ahead of tariff announcement * Oil slumps as rising U.S. supply weighs By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Thursday as the European Central Bank signalled caution on inflation and protectionism, while a gauge of global stocks edged higher as investors awaited more clarity on U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose import tariffs. While the ECB took a small step toward weaning the euro zone economy off protracted stimulus by dropping its easing bias, ECB President Mario Draghi said monetary policy would remain “reactive” and that underlying inflation was subdued. The euro was down 0.81 percent to $1.2311, while the dollar index rose 0.58 percent. “They toned down the easing bias but there is still a willingness to ease and the tone of Draghi’s comments was still dovish, stressing that there is still not a convincing uptrend in inflation,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Draghi also addressed the U.S. tariff plans, saying: “If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are.” MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.11 percent as the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.02 percent. Wall Street indexes were little changed ahead of White House announcement about the tariffs. Earlier, Trump said he was willing to strike a deal that could exempt Canada and Mexico from the tariffs. “As has been in the past, what President Trump says and what finally actually materializes are two different things,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. “It might be just wise to sit on the sidelines before we get some more clarity.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 75.2 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,726.16, the S&P 500 lost 2.68 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,724.12 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.99 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,394.66. Markets have been roiled over the past week by Trump’s plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum that have sparked fears of a global trade war. “It’s a news environment where people aren’t really sure what is going to happen,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “That’s the big thing that’s different this year versus last year: you’re seeing more of this volatility as people try to sort out some new regimes that are out there,” Delwiche said. The U.S. healthcare sector was rattled as health insurer Cigna Corp said it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co for about $54 billion. Express Scripts shares jumped 8.6 percent while Cigna dropped 10.9 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 6/32 in price to yield 2.8607 percent, from 2.883 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices fell and were setting up for a second consecutive weekly drop as the dollar strengthened and concerns over rising U.S. crude production continued to mount on signs of an inventory build at a key U.S. storage hub. U.S. crude fell 1.73 percent to $60.09 per barrel and Brent was at $63.50, down 1.31 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,321.56 an ounce.

2018-03-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - Global fisheries output will slump by 20 percent by 2300 and by 60 percent in the worst-hit North Atlantic region if governments fail to slow long-term global warming, a U.S. team of scientists said on Thursday. Most studies of climate risks extend to 2100 and overlook extra “catastrophic effects” such as the projected slump in ocean life that would only emerge in coming centuries, they said. Unchecked long-term warming would thaw sea ice around Antarctica and disrupt ocean currents, winds and the growth of tiny plankton, the report found. Worldwide, ever more nutrients would sink to the ocean depths, away from fish near the surface. “Marine ecosystems worldwide will be increasingly starved for nutrients,” lead author J. Keith Moore of the University of California, Irvine, told Reuters of the findings published in the journal Science. The shifts would cut the productivity of fisheries in 2300 by an average 20 percent and by 60 percent in the North Atlantic, where a normal upwelling of nutrients from deeper waters would be most reduced, according to computer simulations. Exceptions would be the Southern Ocean near Antarctica and in the Arctic Ocean around the North Pole where higher temperatures and shrinking ice, allowing more sunlight to reach the water, would boost the growth of tiny plants. Moore said such long-term projections involve many uncertainties but add to existing concerns about more heat waves, downpours and droughts that mainstream scientists link to a build-up of man-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. “We need to be thinking 1,000 years into the future, not 100 years,” he wrote in an email. “Global warming isn’t a problem our children can solve - it will be too late.” The study assumed greenhouse gases will continue to build up in the atmosphere, boosting average surface temperatures by 9.6 degrees Celsius (17 Fahrenheit) by 2300.  That would be far above goals set in 2015 by almost 200 nations under the Paris climate agreement to limit warming to “well below” 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times by phasing out fossil fuels this century. The report did not factor in other risks, such as an acidification of the oceans caused by the build-up of carbon dioxide that could undermine the ability of creatures such as lobsters and oysters to build protective shells. Charlotte Laufkoetter, a scientist at the University of Bern who was not involved in the study, praised the findings as based on the best existing science, despite the difficulty of projecting so far into the future. “There are of course several uncertainties - circulation in the Southern Ocean is very difficult to model,” she told Reuters.

2018-03-08,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Israel expects a decision to go ahead with the construction of a 2,000 kilometer (1,243 mile) pipeline linking vast eastern Mediterranean gas resources to Europe to be made by early 2019, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz told Reuters. The pipeline, which will cross from Israel and Cyprus into Greece and Italy in deep waters, would mark a major milestone for the rapidly developing gas industry in the Levantine Basin in the east corner of the Mediterranean, offering access to a large market. The European Union considers the pipeline, estimated to cost $7 billion, as “extremely competitive” as the four partner countries continue construction plans for the technically complex line, Steinitz told Reuters late on Wednesday on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference in Houston. “This summer we will reach a detailed agreement between the four founding states of the East Med pipeline and at the beginning of 2019 we hope to see a final investment decision,” he said. The pipeline, known as East Med, will be able to transfer between 9 to 12 billion cubic meters (bcm) annually, he said. The project owners are IGI Poseidon, a joint venture between Greece’s natural gas firm DEPA, and Italian energy group Edison.  More than 900 bcm of gas have been discovered offshore Israel while Cyprus’ Aphrodite gas field holds an additional 128 bcm. Both areas are expected to hold more reserves. Israel, where gas consumption has risen sharply over the past decade, will have 400 to 500 bcm available to export, Steinitz said. The vast amounts of gas discovered since the early 2000s in Israel have transformed the region’s economic reality as it signed a number of deals to sell natural gas to neighbors Jordan and Egypt. Israel is also considering the construction of a pipeline to Turkey, where gas demand is rapidly growing, although the project appears to have stalled in recent years amid political tensions between the two countries. “We can export to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey and still have enough extra gas for the pipeline,” he said.  Israel plans to launch this summer a new auction for 20 to 30 exploration offshore blocks to trigger the development of further gas resources, Steinitz said.  An auction late last year nevertheless attracted limited interest with Greece’s Energean and a consortium of Indian companies picking up blocks. In a sign of Israel’s growing efforts to attract foreign investors into the budding energy industry, the country recently opened an economic mission in Houston.

2018-03-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met the head of the Anglican church in London on Thursday and promised to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reforms, the British faith leader’s office said. Prince Mohammed is making an official visit to London to promote Saudi Arabia as a tolerant, modernising economy and build a wider trade and investment relationship with Britain, a long-term defence ally. On the second full day of his first foreign tour since becoming heir apparent to the Saudi throne last year, Prince Mohammed also had meetings with finance minister Philip Hammond, bankers and lawmakers, and was due to dine with Prime Minister Theresa May at her country residence later. State oil giant Saudi Aramco, whose lucrative stock market listing Britain is vying with the United States to attract, signed a preliminary deal to pursue international gas opportunities with Royal Dutch Shell. Prince Mohammed began the day with a symbolic visit to Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion of millions of Christians globally, at Lambeth Palace in central London. “The Crown Prince made a strong commitment to promote the flourishing of those of different faith traditions, and to interfaith dialogue within the Kingdom and beyond,” a statement from Lambeth Palace said. “The Archbishop shared his concern about limits placed on Christian worship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and highlighted the importance for leaders of all faiths to support freedom of religion or belief, drawing on the experience of the UK.” Saudi Arabia does not tolerate non-Muslims practising their faith publicly, forcing Christians to risk arrest by praying in private homes. Prince Mohammed and Welby viewed early texts from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths, including fragments of a Koran manuscript found in a Birmingham University library in 2015 that is thought to be among the world’s oldest. Earlier this week, Prince Mohammed met Coptic Pope Tawadros II at Cairo’s largest Coptic cathedral, part of his drive to rid the Gulf Arab kingdom of its reputation as a global exporter of an ultra-conservative brand of Islam. Welby also “voiced his distress” at the humanitarian situation in Yemen, the statement said. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting a war in Yemen in which 10,000 people have died and 8.3 million people have been left dependent on food aid. May, whose government has drawn widespread criticism for approving 4.6 billion pounds ($6.35 billion) worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia, was likely to repeat her own concerns over the humanitarian situation in Yemen during a private dinner. That criticism over the Yemen war and noisy demonstrations have contrasted with the warm welcome from the British government given the crown prince.  On Wednesday, Prince Mohammed met Queen Elizabeth for lunch and later met May to agree to target a 65 billion pound ($90 billion) increase in trade and investment ties. A government spokeswoman said Prince Mohammed met with Hammond on Thursday, and two sources said there was also a meeting with Standard Chartered group chief executive Bill Winters and HSBC CEO John Flint.

2018-03-08,"WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - A U.S. marine transportation company that pleaded for the Trump administration to protect its industry filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday, according to court records, the latest sign of struggles in the offshore energy services business. Louisiana-based Harvey Gulf International Marine LLC, which has more than 50 vessels in its fleet and supplies offshore oil rigs among other services, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Houston.  Harvey Gulf did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company said in court papers it had more than $1 billion in debt and has an agreement with lenders to reduce what the company owes. In return lenders would receive the equity in the company when it exits bankruptcy. Other creditors such as suppliers will be paid in full. A sharp drop in oil prices in 2014 cut demand for rigs, and over the past year many offshore drilling and service companies such as Seadrill Ltd SDRL.OL and Ocean Rig UDW Inc ORIG.O have filed for bankruptcy. [nL1N1NM1DO] Harvey Gulf operates vessels that qualify under the Jones Act, which mandates the use of U.S.-flagged vessels to transport goods between U.S. coasts.  U.S. authorities have allowed exemptions for decades to the Jones Act to permit foreign-flagged vessels, which are often cheaper, to support the oil-and-gas industry. The Obama administration in its final days had proposed rescinding those exemptions. In May 2017, Harvey Gulf took out a full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal urging Trump to implement the proposal.  “Mr. President, We are American. We hire American. We buy American,” Shane Guidry, Harvey Gulf’s chairman and chief executive officer said in the ad, which is displayed on the company’s website.  “In keeping with your campaign promises, please support our industry like you have done with Carrier, Ford and other U.S. companies. Let us help you make America great again!”  Days after the ad ran, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection withdrew the Obama proposal. The U.S. energy industry, which U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to support, had lobbied the agency to keep the waivers. [nL1N1IC1TC]  Guidry was described by the Louisiana-based Advocate newspaper as one of the biggest donors in the state to Republican candidates.

2018-03-08,"March 8 (Reuters) - Oil producers in the Permian basin could save 40-50 percent on frack sand costs by sourcing it from local basins, market research consultancy Energent said on Thursday. Sand, used to hold open tiny cracks in shale rocks in order to allow oil and gas to escape, is the most widely used proppant for hydraulic fracking. So far, the industry has relied upon frack sand hauled over 1,200 miles from Wisconsin at a cost of $110 per ton, Energent, which is a part of market research firm Westwood Global Energy Group, said. By the end of 2018, Energent expects over seven million tons of premium frack sand to be mined inside the Permian Basin every quarter. That can result in potential savings of $500,000 per well, and cut back dependency on sand-by-rail by 800,000 tons in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared to the first quarter, Houston-based Energent said. Last year, sand miners including Unimin Corp, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc and Hi Crush Partners LP spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new mines to address a surge in demand from the Permian. “It (local sourcing) will also focus attention on logistics within the basin itself ... which will also drive well economics,” Energent founder Todd Bush said. Apart from costs, hauling sand over large distances bring other logistical challenges. A severe winter has disrupted rail lines in recent quarters, delaying deliveries of sand from the U.S. Mid West and Canada. No.3 U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton Co and sand miner Fairmount Santrol Holdings have said they expect rail delays of sand deliveries to affect their quarterly results.

2018-03-08,"(Adds details on timeline, long-term outlook) By Libby George LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - The first vessel that will pump and store oil for Angola’s 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) Kaombo project is en route to the West African nation, operator Total said. The Kaombo oil block will produce its first oil this summer, Total said on Thursday. Once it is fully up and running, it will add roughly 14 percent to the OPEC member’s average 2017 output of 1.632 million bpd. The Kaombo Norte floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel left Singapore earlier this week, Total said. It can pump 115,000 bpd, half the oil block’s eventual production. The $16 billion offshore project will add a significant amount of oil to Africa’s number two exporter at a time when it is bound by output limits under a deal orchestrated by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. A source close to the project said the block was expected to pump roughly 100,000 bpd by August. Another FPSO, Kaombo Sul, is still in Singapore. OPEC is reducing output by roughly 1.2 million bpd as part of a deal with Russia and other producers that began in January 2017 and was extended until the end of 2018. So far, Angola has complied comfortably, pumping even less than the maximum agreed. Last month, its output of 1.6 million bpd amounted to 194 percent of compliance with promised cuts of 78,000 bpd. Declining production at mature fields has cut into Angola’s output, but the Kaombo addition could complicate efforts to maintain compliance. Angola’s state oil company Sonangol has said production will be roughly steady this year, and the above-target cuts earlier in the year could keep its average compliance for the year within OPEC’s limits. Longer term, Angola is expected to struggle just to maintain output, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) warning that only Venezuela will see a bigger drop in production over the next five years. Angola’s oil production peaked at 1.9 million bpd in 2008, the IEA said, warning in its five-year outlook that capacity will drop by some 370,000 bpd by 2023 even with the new projects. “Angola is expected to post the biggest slide in capacity after Venezuela as ageing oil fields lose steam and foreign investors, faced with relatively uncompetitive prospects, lose enthusiasm,” the IEA said.

2018-03-08,"(Updates with prices, adds analyst comment) By Mark Weinraub WASHINGTON, March 8 (Reuters) - U.S. corn supplies will be smaller than expected due to strong export demand and rising ethanol production while the already ample soybean stockpile was forecast to rise, the U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday. U.S. soybean exports face increased competition from Brazil, the top world supplier. The government raised its outlook for Brazil soybean production by 1 million tonnes and its export outlook for the country by 1.5 million tonnes. But it lowered its outlook for the Argentine soybean crop by 7 million tonnes. It also trimmed the Argentine corn harvest forecast by 3 million tonnes as hot and dry weather has cut yield potential in key growing areas of the country. “With those Argentinian corn numbers coming down, it will mean that the U.S. is well positioned to pick up some more business globally,” said Ted Seifried, chief ag market strategist for Zaner Group. The USDA also boosted its outlook for wheat ending stocks as U.S. supplies were priced too high to compete in the export market. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures, which had been trading close to unchanged for much of the session, rose to their highest since July 25. Wheat and soybeans weakened. In its monthly supply and demand report, USDA pegged corn ending stocks at 2.127 billion bushels, down from 2.352 billion last month and below the low end of market forecasts given in a Reuters poll. USDA raised its U.S. corn export forecast for the 2017/18 marketing year by 175 million bushels to 2.225 billion bushels. It also raised its estimate of corn used for ethanol to 5.575 billion bushels from 5.525 billion bushels. Domestic soybean ending stocks were seen at 555 million bushels, up 25 million bushels from the February forecast. The average of analysts’ estimates in a Reuters poll was 530 million bushels. USDA lowered its U.S. soybean export view to 2.065 billion bushels from 2.100 billion bushels. But it raised its crush estimate by 10 million bushels to 1.960 billion bushels. U.S. wheat ending stocks were seen at 1.034 billion bushels, up from 1.009 billion bushels in February. USDA lowered the wheat export outlook to 925 million bushels from 950 million bushels. In Argentina, the corn crop was seen at 36 million tonnes and the soybean crop at 47 million tonnes. Brazil’s soybean harvest was seen at 113 million tonnes and its corn harvest at 94.5 million tonnes. Additional reporting by Michael Hirtzer in Chicago

2018-03-08,"(Updates with U.S. trading, changes dateline, previously London) * Euro falls as ECB’s Draghi rings cautious note * Hopes of milder U.S. tariffs support market sentiment * Wall Street, European shares higher * Oil slumps as rising U.S. supply upsets bulls By Lewis Krauskopf NEW YORK, March 8 (Reuters) - The euro dropped on Thursday as the European Central Bank signalled caution on inflation and protectionism, while world stock markets edged higher as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed flexibility with his plan to impose steep import tariffs. While the ECB took a small step towards weaning the euro zone economy off protracted stimulus by dropping its easing bias, ECB President Mario Draghi said monetary policy would remain “reactive” and that underlying inflation was subdued. The euro was down 0.68 percent to $1.2328, while the dollar index rose 0.44 percent. MSCI’s gauge of key world stock markets gained 0.27 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.03 percent. “They toned down the easing bias but there is still a willingness to ease and the tone of Draghi’s comments was still dovish, stressing that there is still not a convincing uptrend in inflation,” said Chris Scicluna, head of economic research at Daiwa Capital Markets. Draghi also addressed the U.S. tariff plans, saying: “If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are.” Trump offered the prospect of relief from steel and aluminum tariffs to countries that “treat us fairly on trade” as he prepared for a White House meeting on the topic later in the day. “Anything that would suggest a little bit of a roll back from the tariffs is viewed as positive,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 10.06 points, or 0.04 percent, to 24,811.42, the S&P 500 gained 3.02 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,729.82 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.33 points, or 0.29 percent, to 7,417.98. Markets have been roiled over the past week by Trump’s plans to impose a 25 percent tariff on steel imports and 10 percent on aluminum that have sparked fears of a global trade war. “It’s a news environment where people aren’t really sure what is going to happen,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. “That’s the big thing that’s different this year versus last year: you’re seeing more of this volatility as people try to sort out some new regimes that are out there,” Delwiche said. The U.S. healthcare sector was rattled as health insurer Cigna Corp said it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co for about $54 billion. Express Scripts shares jumped 10.9 percent while Cigna dropped 9.7 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 2.8552 percent, from 2.883 percent late on Wednesday. Oil fell, following a sharp rise in the dollar, steering prices towards a second weekly decline, against a backdrop of rising U.S. crude production and inventories. U.S. crude fell 0.93 percent to $60.58 per barrel and Brent was at $64.03, down 0.48 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.3 percent to $1,321.43 an ounce.

2018-03-08,"HYDERABAD (Reuters) - Indian airlines Jet Airways (JET.NS), SpiceJet Ltd (SPJT.BO)  and AirAsia India are planning to add new jets to their fleets as they look to expand in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, the carriers said on Thursday. Domestic Indian passenger traffic increased by 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier, marking the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, the International Air Transport Association said in a monthly update released on Thursday. Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey said as long as oil prices remained below $80 per barrel, he expected the Indian aviation market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent for the next 20 years or so.  “We are committed to ensure that new airports are built, better air space management services are provided, so that there is no congestion in the skies,” Choubey said at the Wings India airshow. Indian airlines are scrambling to add more jets to meet demand for more domestic and international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for jet manufacturers Airbus SE (AIR.PA) and Boeing Co (BA.N). “The growth of the domestic Indian (aviation) market is the highest in the world,” Boeing Senior Vice President Asia Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar said. “Every segment of traffic in and out of India is going to grow for the next 20 years.” Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy. Jet Airways hopes to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its CEO Vinay Dube told reporters on the sidelines of the airshow.  The airline last year finalised a deal to buy a separate 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and said it was in “serious talks” for 75 more.  Dube said it would finalize the deal with one of the plane manufacturers, alluding to Boeing or Airbus.  AirAsia India is looking to expand its fleet to 60 jets from the current 14 over the next five years, a spokeswoman said. The airline’s parent, AirAsia Bhd (AIRA.KL), said in January it was considering an IPO of the Indian arm. SpiceJet’s Chairman Ajay Singh said his airline was studying the feasibility of Boeing’s and Airbus’ jets for longer haul international destinations, including western Europe and United States, as it looks to expand beyond short-haul international routes. When asked if a new middle-of-the-market jet that Boeing is studying would fit the bill for cost effective long-haul travel, Singh said: “conceptually it sounds interesting”. In July, SpiceJet had signed a provisional deal to buy 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets. He also said the low-cost carrier was close to announcing an on board Wi-Fi facility on its flights, which would offer in-flight entertainment including streaming movies, cricket and as well as shopping. The move, which could boost SpiceJet’s ancillary revenue, is likely to come by April, he said. Separately, Bloomberg on Thursday reported IndiGo, India’s biggest airline, plans to order as many as 50 Airbus A330 wide-body jets, citing people with knowledge of the matter.

2018-03-08,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - An agreement for Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE) to buy a 46.65 percent stake in German energy group Uniper (UN01.DE) from E.ON (EONGn.DE) could face intense scrutiny in Russia, Uniper’s Chief Executive Klaus Schaefer told journalists on Thursday. State-controlled Fortum has committed to seek regulatory approval for the deal from relevant jurisdictions, including Russia, by Oct. 31 at the latest, according to official offer documents. Securing approval in Russia, where Uniper operates several power plants, could be challenging, Schaefer said, pointing to a law that effectively prohibits foreign states or state-owned entities from gaining control over assets deemed as strategic. “And that is the case for our activities,” Schaefer said. “This law has a high relevance and therefore you have to consider how such an approval could look like, or not.” A Fortum spokeswoman said the Finnish company had filed for merger approval in Russia, as well as approval under the Russian strategic investment act, and expects both applications to be cleared.Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly service in October voiced concern about the deal, which would involve the purchase of more than 25 percent of Uniper’s Russian assets (UPRO.MM). Fortum was offered only 0.47 percent of Uniper shares in a tender that expired in February, on top of a 46.65 percent stake it negotiated separately with E.ON, after Uniper’s management advised shareholders not to tender their shares.     Uniper fought against the bid, saying it was hostile and too low and that the combination would make little sense given its heavy exposure to gas and coal-fired power plants while Fortum’s focus is on clean technologies. Separately, Fortum said some of its own investors had complained the Uniper deal would raise the company’s carbon footprint, and had also voiced scepticism over the involvement in building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline for Russian gas. “Many stakeholders such as SRI (socially responsible investors) have contacted Fortum to discuss the bid. The main concern ... has been the strategic fit of Uniper’s fossil-based production with Fortum low-carbon assets,” it said. The company defended its plans, however, arguing conventional energy production was still needed to ensure affordable security of supply in Europe. “Fortum acknowledges that not only the use of coal but also the origin of coal is a source of concern to some stakeholders ... Uniper is much more than a coal company,” it said.    While Fortum supports a phase-out of power generated from coal, this should be achieved within the European Union’s emissions trading scheme (ETS), the company added.

2018-03-08,"LONDON/DUBAI (Reuters) - State oil giant Saudi Aramco signed a preliminary deal to pursue international gas opportunities with Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) on Thursday as part of top crude exporter Saudi Arabia’s diversification drive before the listing of Aramco.  The memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed in London between the two companies was during the official visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to Britain, and would include gas upstream and liquefaction projects. “It is a discussion that began some time ago and now we have signed a memorandum to work on gas projects from upstream to downstream across the world and in Saudi Arabia. Concrete projects would be announced in due course,” Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden told Reuters after the signing ceremony. Last year, industry sources told Reuters Saudi Arabia and international oil companies had discussed gas venture opportunities inside the kingdom and abroad. Aramco is gearing up for a share listing later this year, aiming to get a valuation of up to $2 trillion in what could be the world’s biggest initial public offering (IPO). The kingdom has a long-term goal of increasing the use of gas for domestic power generation, thus reducing oil burning at home and freeing up more crude for export. Expanding its gas portfolio inside the kingdom as well as abroad could help increase Aramco’s valuation as it generates more revenue from exports than selling oil at lower domestic prices - Saudi Arabia is the world’s fifth-biggest oil consumer despite being only the 20th-biggest economy. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who is also Aramco’s chairman, had said Aramco was interested in investing in international upstream ventures, particularly gas, and could invest in importing gas into the kingdom.  Diversifying gas assets abroad would help Aramco achieve a better valuation and is attractive for investors, industry sources has said. Riyadh also plans to raise domestic gas prices, a move seen as an incentive for foreign companies. Aramco controls gas reserves in excess of 8 trillion cubic meters, according to BP’s annual energy review. The Saudi company has said it wants to explore for gas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea as well as onshore shale gas. Aramco’s gas strategy is part of the kingdom’s push to diversify its economy away from oil, a strategy known as “Vision 2030” championed by Prince Mohammed, amid a global drive to phase out the most polluting fossil fuels.

2018-03-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union has proposed making it a formal requirement for asset managers to consider “sustainability” when picking investments, a move the EU’s 23 trillion euro ($28.5 trillion) funds industry swiftly dismissed as a “tick-the-box” exercise. The EU wants more money going into sustainable and “green” projects that help cut greenhouse gas emissions, as part of a wider “capital markets union” project to expand funding from financial markets for companies and growth.  In an “action plan” published on Thursday, the European Commission said it would “clarify” the duty of asset managers and big investors to ensure they take sustainability into account in the “process” of investing. The European Fund and Asset Management Association said it did not believe such legislation was needed because investment in sustainable projects had to be driven by the owners of the assets being invested. “Any mandatory sustainability requirement, especially regarding investments, would turn environmental, social and governance into a ‘tick the box’ compliance exercise,” EFAMA said. PensionsEurope, which represents national pensions trade bodies, said the EU’s proposals needed to be flexible so as to avoid upsetting the role of trustees or social partners. “Pension funds’ main purpose will continue to be serving the best interests of their members and to delivering adequate pensions at low costs,” it said.  The EU’s proposal also includes plans for a checklist of what qualifies as a climate friendly and sustainable activities, definitions which could be used for creating EU labels for “green” financial products. The Commission will also look at how banks and insurers could benefit from lower capital charges if they invested in green projects. The Commission has retreated from an initial plan to go ahead with implementing these reductions after opposition from an advisory panel and central bankers who were worried about a green “bubble” being created. Markus Ferber, a member of the European Parliament, which will have final say on the proposals, said the EU should focus on keeping alive the bloc’s capital markets project, given that Britain, the EU’s biggest market, is leaving. “What we need is bold initiatives tackling obstacles in tax and insolvency law and measures that facilitate capital market financing by smaller companies,” Ferber said. “Sustainable finance, however, is only a diversion from the fact that one of the Commission’s flagship projects is about to tank,” he said, referring to slow progress with efforts to create a EU-wide capital market that can provide financing for businesses.

2018-03-08,"(Adds Johnson comments, changes date) LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Britain and Saudi Arabia want to strengthen a United Nations inspection regime for ships headed to Yemen, the British foreign minister said after meeting his Saudi counterpart in London. “Today we have agreed to strengthen the U.N. inspection of shipping in order to ensure that all Yemeni ports remain open to the humanitarian and commercial supplies that Yemen’s people so desperately need,” Boris Johnson told reporters on Wednesday evening, without providing details. Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies have been stationing naval forces in and around Yemeni waters since 2015. Western governments approved the show of military force as a way to stop arms reaching Iran-aligned Houthi fighters trying to overthrow Yemen’s internationally recognised government. The de facto blockade has exacted a dire humanitarian toll. The Saudi-led coalition’s ships have prevented essential supplies from entering Yemen, even in cases where vessels are carrying no weapons, Reuters reported last year. The U.N. Verification and Inspection Mechanism for Yemen (UNVIM) was set up in 2016 to ease delivery of commercial goods through the blockade but has failed to ensure the Yemeni people get the supplies they need. The country, already one of the world’s poorest, is on the brink of famine and in the midst of a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 2,000 people. Three years of fighting have left more than 10,000 other people dead. London already supports UNVIM in Djibouti with funds and experts. It was unclear what changes are now planned. Saudi-run Al Arabiya television reported earlier that Johnson also said London would seek a United Nations meeting on a political solution in Yemen.

2018-03-08,"* Hopes of milder U.S. tariffs support market sentiment * Europe up 0.2 pct, Nikkei up 0.5 pct, Hang Seng up 1.4 pct * Dollar steadies; Mexico peso, C$ recover * ECB’s inflation forecast subdued; hints at bond plans By Marc Jones LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - A sense of calm returned to global markets on Thursday, as traders took a break from worrying about a global trade war and focused instead on the European Central Bank’s plans to end its 2.5 trillion euro stimulus programme. European U.S. and Asian share markets all edged up - the first two for a fourth day - after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he may spare some key trade partners in his push to introduce protectionist tariffs. The euro lingered in the red though, as a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders and then a subdued ECB inflation forecast added to the weekend’s inconclusive Italian election, reinforcing caution. The central bank did however drop an explicit promise on its bond buying, which has been running for three years, and there was some pointed criticism from ECB chief Mario Draghi for Trump’s plans for more trade tariffs. “If you put tariffs against (those) who are your allies, one wonders who the enemies are,” he said. Wall Street opened higher just after Draghi spoke and the dollar was up marginally too. Trump is expected to sign a document to establish steel and aluminium tariffs by 3:30 p.m. eastern U.S. time, a source told Reuters. “This is just the beginning from a U.S. sector perspective as far as protectionism goes,” said Michael Luckman, a partner a law firm Gowling WLG. “Import tariffs could be applied to almost anything that a government believes will harm domestic producers, so this is likely to be the tip of the iceberg.” Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier. In the currency market, the dollar stabilised against other major currencies after its hit from fears about the tariff plan, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from steep losses. The euro traded down at $1.2377, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest since Feb. 16. The currency has been rising since it hit a seven-week low of $1.2154 when Trump unveiled his tariff plan last week. Bond markets were also steady with 10-year U.S. Treasury yields stuck at 2.87 percent and Germany’s benchmark barely budged at 0.67 percent having hit a five-week low of 0.60 percent on Monday. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” it said in it post-meeting statement. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had risen 1.0 percent, while in Japan the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.4 percent after China’s surprisingly strong trade data. Wall Street started with a 0.2-0.3 percent rise for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones which had both seen a choppy day on Wednesday. They had swung higher when White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports may exclude Canada, Mexico and some other countries. That soothed worries about the prospect of more aggressive trade measures after the departure of Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn. Masahiro Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the issue would hang over markets however. “Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.” Draghi wasn’t the only one in Europe to express concerns about Trump’s plans. European Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Europe was preparing immediate counter-measures in case of a trade skirmish. “If Donald Trump puts in place the measures this evening, we have a whole arsenal at our disposal with which to respond,” Moscovici told BFM TV on Thursday. The dollar traded at 106.17 yen, little changed in Europe, keeping some distance from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. There was plenty to navigate in emerging markets, too. Turkish assets largely shrugged off Moody’s cutting its credit rating deeper into junk-rated territory. Poland’s zloty touched a three-month low against the euro a day after its central bank governor said its first rate increase might come a year later than previously expected. The Mexican peso hovered cautiously at 18.71 per dollar , bouncing back from Wednesday’s low of 18.90 while the Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2890 off an eight-month low of C$1.3002 hit this week. Bitcoin steadied after slumping more than 7 percent on Wednesday after U.S. and Japanese regulators tried to tighten their grip on crypto-currencies. Japan’s financial regulator punished seven crypto-currency exchanges, suspending business at two of them, to bolster consumer protection after the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck. In commodities, oil prices inched back after falling more than 2 percent the previous day on record U.S. crude production and rising inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were just under $61 a barrel, down 0.3 percent, while benchmark Brent was 0.5 percent lower at $64 a barrel. Key industrial metals were weak.

2018-03-08,"HYDERABAD, March 8 (Reuters) - Indian airlines Jet Airways , SpiceJet Ltd  and AirAsia India are planning to add new jets to their fleets as they look to expand in the world’s fastest-growing aviation market, the carriers said on Thursday. Domestic Indian passenger traffic increased by 17.9 percent in January from a year earlier, marking the 41st consecutive month of double-digit growth, the International Air Transport Association said in a monthly update released on Thursday. Civil Aviation Secretary Rajiv Nayan Choubey said as long as oil prices remained below $80 per barrel, he expected the Indian aviation market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 15 percent for the next 20 years or so. “We are committed to ensure that new airports are built, better air space management services are provided, so that there is no congestion in the skies,” Choubey said at the Wings India airshow. Indian airlines are scrambling to add more jets to meet demand for more domestic and international flights, making it one of the most targeted sales markets for jet manufacturers Airbus SE and Boeing Co. “The growth of the domestic Indian (aviation) market is the highest in the world,” Boeing Senior Vice President Asia Pacific and India Sales Dinesh Keskar said. “Every segment of traffic in and out of India is going to grow for the next 20 years.” Boeing said in July it expected Indian airlines to order up to 2,100 new aircraft worth $290 billion over the next 20 years, calling it the highest-ever forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy. Jet Airways hopes to close a deal to buy another 75 narrowbody jets by the end of March, its CEO Vinay Dube told reporters on the sidelines of the airshow. The airline last year finalised a deal to buy a separate 75 Boeing 737 MAX aircraft and said it was in “serious talks” for 75 more. Dube said it would finalise the deal with one of the plane manufacturers, alluding to Boeing or Airbus. AirAsia India is looking to expand its fleet to 60 jets from the current 14 over the next five years, a spokeswoman said. The airline’s parent, AirAsia Bhd, said in January it was considering an IPO of the Indian arm. Indian low-cost carrier SpiceJet said in July it had signed a provisional deal to buy 40 Boeing 737 MAX 10 jets.

2018-03-08,"NAQOURA, Lebanon, March 8 (Reuters) - Lebanon and Israel have been holding talks nearly every day over a border dispute that has raised tensions between the two enemy states, according to the U.N. peacekeeping force on the frontier that is mediating their discussions. “There is a full engagement from all the sides and there have been meetings almost on a daily basis. The dialogue is open. No one has ever walked out from these meetings,” said Andrea Tenenti, spokesman for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Tensions have spiked recently over an Israeli border wall, Lebanese offshore energy exploration, and the growing arsenal of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah group, which Israel sees as the biggest threat on its frontier. Lebanon, Israel and UNIFIL were already holding three-way talks every few weeks in a building on the border near the peacekeepers’ base at Naqoura in southern Lebanon. They are now being held more often, Tenenti said, along with indirect talks conducted through UNIFIL. Israel is building a border wall near the Blue Line, as the frontier demarcation between the two countries in lieu of a formal border agreement is known. Lebanon has described the wall as an “aggression”, saying it intrudes into Lebanese territory. Israel says the wall will be entirely on its side of the Blue Line and in Israeli territory. At the same time, Lebanon has begun oil and gas exploration in a block that includes a small area of sea along the maritime frontier that is claimed by Israel. “There is a will to keep this dialogue open ... I think now, beside the heightened rhetoric, the reality on the ground is different and there is no appetite for instability or for war,” Tenenti said. Reuters footage from a recent trip to the border area showed construction work in areas along the Blue Line, including cranes erecting concrete blocks and bulldozers working at a fence. Israel occupied southern Lebanon from 1982 to 2000 and in 2006 it waged a month-long war against Hezbollah there. Israel says the Shi’ite Muslim group has grown stronger due to its role in the Syrian civil war, and has attacked it there. “The last 12 years have seen the quietest period the south of Lebanon has witnessed in over 30 years,” Tenenti said. “But it is important to keep in mind that things along the Blue Line are in general very sensitive. Anything could, if it is not addressed immediately, potentially spark into something bigger and increase tension.” For Abu Moussa Taher, 77, a shop owner in Naqoura, the idea of a new war seems distant. “It is impossible, I think. When you think of a war, you have to think of its consequences,” said Taher, who says he has witnessed all of the wars to hit the area since 1978.

2018-03-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - The leader of Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Arlene Foster, said on Thursday she saw little chance of a return to devolved government in the British province in the coming weeks or months. The province has been without a devolved executive for over a year since Irish nationalists Sinn Fein withdrew from the compulsory power-sharing government with the DUP, their arch-rivals. The executive is central to a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of violence. “For this past 13 months we have been unable to form a devolved government. I really regret that,” Foster said in a speech to the British Chambers of Commerce in London. “Given everything that happened over the past couple of weeks, I see little prospect of it being returned in the coming weeks or months.”  Foster, whose party supports Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government, added that she was disappointed that a return to violence in Northern Ireland had been raised in Brexit talks by those with little knowledge of the region. Arrangements for the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic are one of the thorniest issues of Brexit talks. Britain’s government has said it does not want a customs union with the EU, without which the EU says it would need to regulate Northern Ireland’s trade to avoid a return of customs checks. A hard border is opposed by Britain and Ireland, and Northern Irish political parties, and some Irish nationalists would see physical border infrastructure as an unwelcome symbol of British rule over Northern Ireland. Some supporters of Britain remaining in a close trading relationship with the European Union have raised the spectre of a return to armed conflict between British loyalists and those seeking a united Ireland if there is a hard border after Brexit. “I do object in the strongest terms to people who have limited experience of the ‘Troubles’ in Northern Ireland throwing threats of violence around as some kind of bargaining chip in the negotiating process,” Foster said. “To do so is an insult to the people of Northern Ireland.” She said the EU draft proposals to protect the open border in Ireland that would in effect keep the British province in a customs union with the bloc was an “act of bad faith.” “The Commission’s draft text is entirely unacceptable and actually represents an act of bad faith on the part of Brussels towards addressing the challenges facing the border in a fair and sensible fashion,” she said.

2018-03-08,"LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman met the head of the Anglican church in London on Thursday, promising to promote interfaith dialogue as part of his domestic reforms, the British faith leader’s office said. Prince Mohammed is making an official visit to London to promote Saudi Arabia as a tolerant, modernising economy and build a wider new trade and investment relationship with Britain - a long-term defence and security ally. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion of millions of Christians globally, received the crown prince at Lambeth Palace in central London, where the two talked for an hour. “The Crown Prince made a strong commitment to promote the flourishing of those of different faith traditions, and to interfaith dialogue within the Kingdom and beyond,” a statement from Lambeth Palace said. “The Archbishop shared his concern about limits placed on Christian worship in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and highlighted the importance for leaders of all faiths to support freedom of religion or belief, drawing on the experience of the UK.” The two men viewed a selection of early texts from the Christian, Muslim and Jewish faiths, including fragments of a Koran manuscript found in a Birmingham University library in 2015, which are thought to be among the world’s oldest. Welby also “voiced his distress” at the humanitarian situation in Yemen, the statement said. A Saudi-led coalition is fighting a war in Yemen in which 10,000 people have died and 8.3 million people have been left dependent on food aid. Protests over the Yemen war have jarred with a warm welcome from the British government during the visit to London. On Wednesday Prince Mohammed met Queen Elizabeth for lunch and later agreed to boost trade ties by 65 billion pounds  ($90.30 billion) in a meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May. Earlier this week, Prince Mohammed met Coptic Pope Tawadros II at Cairo’s largest Coptic cathedral, as the Gulf Arab kingdom tries to shed its reputation as a global exporter of an ultra-conservative brand of Islam which critics say has inspired Islamist militants worldwide. Promoting a more moderate form of Islam is one of the more ambitious promises made by Prince Mohammed under plans to transform Saudi and reduce its reliance on oil.

2018-03-08,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DaeVPS By John Kemp LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Despite the overwhelmingly bullish sentiment that still dominates talk about oil prices, the rally that started at the end of June 2017 seems to have run out of momentum. Front-month Brent futures prices peaked in the final week of January and have since been on a gently declining trend (tmsnrt.rs/2DaeVPS). Brent calendar spreads peaked even earlier in January and have also been gently softening for nearly two months now. Prices and spreads are back to levels they first reached in the middle of December ensuring there has been no real increase for three months. Hedge funds and other money managers remain overwhelmingly bullish, with a net long position in futures and options linked to Brent equivalent to 544 million barrels. Hedge fund long positions in Brent outnumber short ones by a ratio of more than 14:1, suggesting most portfolio managers still believe prices will rise further in the short term. But the net position also peaked in late January and has been slowly slipping since then, according to exchange data. Gross long positions have declined from a record 643 million barrels on Jan. 23 to 585 million barrels on Feb. 27. Hedge fund managers have been quietly liquidating some of their bullish long positions as prices have stopped rising. In the oil market, actions speak louder than words, and fund managers have turned more cautious over the last six weeks. The critical question is whether this is merely a pause, and the rally will resume shortly, or whether it marks a peak, at least temporarily. Brent prices have averaged just over $67 per barrel so far in 2018, which is not far from the forecast of $65 predicted by energy professionals in a survey at the start of the year. Recent news flow has been mixed, with oil consumption rising strongly, but production forecasts also being revised sharply higher. OPEC leaders have reiterated their commitment to curb output throughout this year and seem to be preparing to toughen their five-year inventory target. The organisation’s members, led by Saudi Arabia, appear to be informally targeting a price level above $70 per barrel in 2018. But U.S. oil and liquids production is now forecast to grow by 2.0 million barrels per day (bpd) this year - an enormous upward revision from the 1.3 million bpd increase predicted in December. The U.S. Energy Information Administration now forecasts total crude and liquids production will hit 18.4 million bpd by the end of 2018 (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, March 2018). The forecast has been revised repeatedly upwards from the 17.2 million bpd predicted nine months ago when the rally started (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, June 2017). In the circumstances, it is not obvious the next move in oil prices will be higher in the near term, and that caution has started to flow through into prices and fund manager positions.

2018-03-08,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Some 6,000 early deaths linked to nitrogen oxides (NOx) are recorded each year in Germany, the Federal Environmental Agency  said on Thursday, providing more evidence of the health hazards posed by the toxic particles mostly produced by diesel engines. The figure is likely to add pressure on carmakers and the government as they scramble to slow the demise of the diesel technology in which Germany’s car industry invested billions. The Environmental Agency (UBA) also said that NOx causes one million people to fall ill each year and that levels of the toxic particle are higher in 70 cities than the limit set under air quality standards. The car industry has relied on diesel as a stopgap technology to boost efficiency, meet CO2 emissions goals and buy time for a shift toward electric mobility. But sales of diesel cars have been falling since Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to cheating on emissions tests. Subsequent studies have exposed the true levels of NOx, which is emitted more abundantly by diesel vehicles than petrol engines. A German court ruled last month that German cities can ban the most heavily polluting diesel cars from their streets, a decision that could accelerate the demise of the combustion engine.

European and Asian share markets edged up — the former for a fourth day — after U.S. President Donald Trump suggested he may spare some key trade partners in his push to introduce protectionist tariffs. Germany’s Dax and the euro both lingered in the red though as a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders reinforced caution ahead of a 1330 ECB news conference and after the weekend’s inconclusive Italian election. It may all argue for a more neutral message from ECB chief Mario Draghi. Euro zone rates are still sub-zero but markets are watching for any signal on when it will end more than three years of unprecedented money printing. “They have stretched out the (buying) cycle and that made sense to us,” said Shoqat Bunglawala, Head of the Global Portfolio Solutions Group for EMEA and Asia Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We would expect them to end purchases this year but we think they will still stay flexible if there is any change to the growth picture in Europe.” Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar stabilised against other major currencies after its hit from fears about the tariff plan, while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from steep losses. The euro traded down at $1.2406, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest levels since Feb. 16. The currency has been rising since it hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit when Trump unveiled his tariff plan last week. Bond markets were also steady with U.S. Treasuries stuck at 2.88 percent and Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield barely budged at 0.67 percent having hit a five-week low of 0.60 percent on Monday. The ECB will publish new forecasts for euro zone inflation and for growth at its 1330 GMT news conference, which will feed the debate on how to end its stimulus. “The Governing Council expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of the net asset purchases,” it said in it post-meeting but pre-news conference statement. Wall Street futures were pointing to the S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq markets creeping higher when they reopen at 1430 GMT. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had risen 1.0 percent, while in Japan the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.4 percent after China’s surprisingly strong trade data. Wall Street’s S&P ended down just 0.05 percent on Wednesday at 2,726.8 after an initial loss of almost 1 percent, with tech shares a bright spot. They erased most losses as White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports may exclude Canada, Mexico and some other countries.

Masahiro Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the issue would hang over markets however. “Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.” Trump was expected to sign a proclamation to establish the tariffs on Thursday, but a White House official said it could slide to Friday as documents had to go through a legal process.

2018-03-08,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.-based fund manager Breakwave Advisors is launching the first exchange-traded fund (ETF) focusing on freight futures, reflecting growing investor interest in shipping as it emerges from a near-decade long crisis, a regulatory filing showed. Around 90 percent of traded goods by volume are transported by sea and global shipping sectors - such as dry bulk - are on course for a recovery this year, according to investors and analysts, prompting speculators to look for ways to trade.  Freight forward agreements (FFA), which allow investors to take positions on freight rates at a point in the future, are being seen as viable betting instruments.  Breakwave Dry Bulk Shipping ETF said in a prospectus filed to the SEC this week that its fund would provide investors with exposure to the daily change in the price of dry bulk FFAs by tracking the performance of a portfolio of nearest calendar derivatives contracts.  ETFs are a popular vehicle for tracking baskets of stocks, futures and derivatives, among other financial instruments, for much lower fees than actively-traded funds. Sources familiar with matter said the ETF, the first of its kind in shipping futures, was expected to be launched in the coming weeks. “Freight futures have not been that accessible to most investors out there,” one of the sources said, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. Another of the sources added that the ETF was likely to be of interest to many types investors, particularly hedge funds as they look for other types of exposure to the sector. Hedge funds are already loading hundreds of millions of dollars into the shipping sector through investments in stocks - putting behind them losses suffered in 2013 when, based on forecasts of improved world economic growth, they piled in to shipping debt and equity. Elsewhere, the London-run Baltic Exchange wants to make a tradable instrument out of its globally tracked main sea freight index, which gauges the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities including iron ore, grain and coal. The Baltic is also looking into launching a freight index for LNG (liquefied natural gas), creating further scope for trading plays.

2018-03-08,"DUESSELDORF (Reuters) - German energy group Uniper (UN01.DE) cannot rule out further delays to the start of its new hard-coal power plant Datteln 4, it warned on Thursday, the latest setback in a project that has for years been a major headache for the group. The latest announcement comes only three months after Uniper said the plant’s commercial operation would be delayed until the final quarter of this year, having previously planned to start it in the first half. “The currently planned commercial operation date is not before the fourth quarter 2018. Given pending lawsuits further delays cannot be ruled out,” the group said in its annual report published on Thursday. The construction of Datteln 4 has so far swallowed significantly more than 1 billion euros ($1.24 billion) in investment and more is needed to complete a site that was originally supposed to start up in 2011. Uniper last year filed a lawsuit against rival RWE (RWEG.DE) for cancelling a contract to buy power from the plant after continued delays and a significant decline in wholesale power prices over the past decade. Uniper, in which Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE) agreed to take a 47 percent stake last month, said that there was a risk that all investments made into Datteln 4 will have to be written off if a new development plan was declared invalid. The company’s full-year results on Thursday showed an 18 percent decline in operating profit, with Uniper citing weakness at its gas optimization business. Full-year adjusted earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) came in at 1.11 billion euros ($1.38 billion), slightly lower than the 1.16 billion average forecast in a Reuters poll.

2018-03-08,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big oil and big corn are touting opposing studies released this week on proposed biofuels policy reforms under consideration by the Trump administration, part of an ongoing clash between the two sides over the future of the program. Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N), a major oil refiner, funded a study by Charles River Associates that supports placing a cap on the price of biofuel blending credits under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) - a change meant to help refiners that complain the RFS now costs them a fortune. A rival report from Iowa State University, also released this week, said such a cap on credits would backfire by eroding U.S. demand for corn-based ethanol and potentially lowering corn prices, already under pressure from a supply glut. The corn industry did not directly fund the Iowa State study, but does provide funding to the university. The studies are meant to inform the administration’s deliberations on how, and if, to reform the RFS - which has become a major point of tension between two of President Donald Trump’s most important constituencies. The RFS requires oil refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels, mainly corn-based ethanol, into the fuel supply each year, or buy the renewable fuel credits, called RINs, from other companies that do the blending. The regulation was introduced during the administration of President George W. Bush to help farmers, cut petroleum imports, and improve air quality. But a surge in the price of RINs in recent years has upset merchant refiners who say the policy now costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Trump waded deeply into the debate last week, urging representatives of both sides to accept a compromise deal that caps prices for the credits while also removing seasonal limits on high-ethanol blend gasolines to expand the biofuels market. A cap would control costs for small refiners and help them stay afloat, said Brendan Williams, vice president of government relations for refining company PBF Energy (PBF.N).     The biofuels industry likes the idea of expanding high-ethanol blend gasoline sales, but has pushed back on the idea of a cap. “The RFS is a well-designed program,” said Brooke Coleman, head of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council. “Part of the whole mechanism working is that the price of RINs may go up, and so you should go long on biofuels.” “It’s a strategy to kill the RFS and to kill the economic incentive to blend,” said Coleman, referring to a 10-cent cap. Trump has not pushed a particular price level for the proposed RIN price cap, but Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas - an advocate for the refining industry - has called for a limit of 10 cents per RIN, a fraction of their current value. The Iowa State study said such a cap would translate to 4.6 percent less ethanol blending in 2018. And without an increase in exports, that would mean a drop in corn prices, too.  The Valero-funded study, on the other hand, said a price cap “could alleviate several of the most pressing issues with the RFS” while also continuing to incentivize investment in ethanol blending. In January, refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions blamed its bankruptcy on RINs. Bad deals and large investor payouts also played key roles in its collapse, Reuters reported. On Wednesday, 150 biofuel manufacturers sent an open letter to Trump urging him to protect the program. The letter came as a delegation of refinery workers held meetings with lawmakers urging changes to the RFS.

2018-03-08,"(Repeats item with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 8 (Reuters) - It’s safe to dismiss any impression that China’s imports of major commodities such as crude oil and iron ore were weak in February, despite the numbers suggesting as much. The timing of the Lunar New Year holiday usually affects when imports are counted as having arrived in the world’s largest buyer of commodities. This year the week-long holiday fell entirely in February, likely resulting in a pull-forward of the counting of imports into January, meaning February’s arrivals appear weaker than they should. Crude oil imports in February were 32.26 million tonnes, China customs said on Thursday, equivalent to about 8.41 million barrels per day (bpd). That looks like a massive drop from January’s 9.57 million bpd, which was the strongest month on record. Putting the first two months of 2018 together, however, gives an import rate of about 9.02 million bpd, up a fairly strong 10.8 percent from the same period last year. It’s a similar story for iron ore, with February imports plunging 16 percent to 84.66 million tonnes from January’s 100.3 million, which was the second-highest month on record. Again, taking the first two months together gives an import total of 185 million tonnes, up 5.4 percent on the same period last year. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters tends to be less lumpy than the official customs data, with the numbers showing January arrivals of 89.54 million tonnes of iron ore, and February pegged at 85.09 million, giving a two-month total of 174.63 million. The shipping data doesn’t exactly align with customs data as it doesn’t include any iron ore China imports that come overland, such as from neighbouring Mongolia. Coal imports were another area of strength in the first two months of 2018, rising 14.4 percent from the same period a year ago to 48.7 million tonnes, despite on the surface looking weak after they dropped 25 percent in February from January. Imports of unwrought copper also dropped in February, falling 20 percent from January to 352,000 tonnes. Similar to other major commodities, though, the copper imports were quite robust on a year-to-date basis, having increased by 9.8 percent in the January-February period this year compared to the same period in 2017. The conclusion can only be that China’s appetite for imported commodities remains robust and consistent with the current narrative of an economy that is performing fairly well, notwithstanding areas of concern, such as credit quality. A further sign of this is steel product exports, one of the few areas of genuine weakness in the Chinese commodity complex. Steel product exports are down 27.1 percent to 9.5 million tonnes in the first two months of the year compared to the same period a year ago. This is largely a reflection of a tighter domestic market in the wake of enforced closures of some blast furnaces over winter as part of measures to reduce air pollution. But it also shows that domestic steel prices are high enough to keep what is being produced within the local market. China’s steel exports have been trending lower in recent months, having slumped 30.5 percent in 2017. This fact sits somewhat uncomfortably with U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned new 25 percent tariff on imports, with China’s exports cited by his administration as one of the reasons behind the decision. Trump is on somewhat safer ground with his planned 10 percent import tariff on aluminium, given China’s exports of unwrought aluminium and products have surged 25.8 percent to 817,000 tonnes in the first two months of 2018 from the same period last year.

2018-03-08,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia, the world’s No.2 producer of palm oil, said on Thursday the European Union’s decision to curb imports of the commodity could undermine France’s hopes of winning one of Asia’s biggest fighter plane deals. France’s Rafale jet, built by Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), has been seen as the frontrunner in Malaysia’s plan to buy up to 18 planes in a deal potentially worth more than $2 billion. But talks hit a snag after EU lawmakers sought to stop the use of palm oil in motor fuels. Malaysia said this week it would respond with “might and tact” if the EU did not back down on the curbs. “The jet fighters the French are looking at, the Rafale, are also competing with the Brits who have left the EU. So they have to take that into consideration,” Malaysian Defence Minister Hishammuddin Hussein told a news conference. Malaysia has for several years been considering France’s Rafale jet and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European group that includes Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L) to replace Russian MiG-29s that are mostly grounded. BAE has campaigned hard for almost a decade and has set up a regional office in Kuala Lumpur to press its bid. Hishammuddin’s comments may encourage BAE, whose bid seemed to lose traction after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said he discussed a possible purchase of Rafale planes during a visit in 2017 by France’s then-president, Francois Hollande. Dassault Chief Executive Eric Trappier said palm oil curbs could “impact relations between several countries” but said talks with Malaysia had been going on “for a long time”. “New talks will depend on the new government,” Trappier told a news conference on the French firm’s results. BAE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Malaysia could lose about $500 million in annual revenue if the EU goes ahead with palm oil curbs, analysts estimate. It adds to troubles facing Malaysia’s prime minister Najib, whose ruling coalition will rely on votes from more than 600,000 palm oil plantation smallholders in elections due by August. French government sources said France would not back a total ban. “If it is sustainable palm oil then it could be used in biofuels,” a French official said. “The idea is to support a constructive and non-discriminatory approach of palm oil.” French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in comments reported by Malaysia’s New Straits Times in January that Malaysia “can rely on France” for support against the ban. Hishammuddin said Malaysia “cannot put a price tag” on its national interests when negotiating bilateral deals. He said those seeking strong bilateral ties should “not just look at economic considerations separate from other considerations, especially when it come to defense because we do have other options.” A decision on the planes has been delayed due to the approaching election and a shift in Malaysia’s focus towards upgrading aerial surveillance capabilities.

2018-03-08,"PARIS (Reuters) - Dassault Aviation (AVMD.PA), one of France’s leading military and civilian jet makers, voiced concerns over the impact of Brexit on Thursday, as it reported higher 2017 profits. Dassault Aviation’s head Eric Trappier told reporters that uncertainty over British defense spending and the Brexit process could impact French and British co-operation on joint military projects. In 2016, France and Britain agreed to invest 2 billion euros  ($2.5 billion) to help build a new drone, and in January this year the two countries also unveiled further joint initiatives in security and military spheres. Britain’s BAE Systems (BAES.L) and Rolls-Royce (RR.L), along with Dassault Aviation, Safran (SAF.PA) and Thales (TCFP.PA) of France, are among those involved in the drone project.  However, Trappier said there had been delays to that drone program, and added there were questions over the impact that Brexit could have on British government spending. Last year, France and Germany edged toward achieving a 70-year-old ambition to integrate European defenses when they signed a pact with 21 other EU governments to fund, develop and deploy armed forces after Britain’s decision to quit the bloc. Dassault Aviation forecast delivering 40 of its Falcon planes and 12 of its Rafale fighter jets for 2018.  Net sales were expected to be similar to the 2017 figure, while the company raised its dividend to 15.30 euros from 12.10 euros last year, with Dassault shares rising 1.6 percent in mid-session trading. Last month, Dassault Aviation announced plans for a new long-range business jet, renewing a battle with Gulfstream (GD.N) at the top end of the market as demand for the ultimate status symbol recovers from a prolonged recession.

2018-03-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China plans to create an energy ministry to oversee the country’s vast oil, natural gas, coal and power sectors, part of a government shake-up to make policymaking more efficient, four sources with ties to the country’s leadership said this week. The new ministry would replace the existing regulator, the National Energy Administration (NEA), which was created a decade ago and is part of the powerful state economic planner, the National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC). The new ministry would not be under the NDRC and would handle energy-related duties currently scattered across many government agencies, the sources said. The planned shake-up is part of a broader reshuffle of government departments, which will be presented to China’s largely rubber-stamp parliament on Tuesday. It is not clear if details of the changes will immediately be made public. China is also expected to overhaul its financial regulatory set-up, possibly merging different agencies to improve the ability to control financial risk, said four additional sources familiar with the matter. The NEA declined to comment and the NDRC did not respond to requests for comment. It was not known who will be appointed to run the new ministry. Nur Bekri heads the NEA and is a vice minister of the NDRC. Removing energy from the NDRC’s portfolio reflects the growing importance of the oil, gas and clean fuel sectors in the world’s biggest energy consumer. The plan comes after the ruling Communist Party agreed in late February to deepen reform of party and government departments to improve their function. While the February statement did not say which departments may be merged, re-organised or eliminated, it said the moves would strengthen market supervision and management of natural resources and environmental protection. The new ministry will be responsible for major ongoing tasks including a push to liberalise China’s electricity market, opening energy infrastructure such as gas pipelines and oil storage to private and foreign players, boosting renewable energy use and weaning the country off coal, its favourite fuel. The reorganisation comes as China prepares this month to launch its long-awaited crude oil futures contract, which will be Asia’s first pricing benchmark, giving the world’s top oil importer greater clout on the global market. It’s not known if the new department will also oversee the three state oil majors, Sinopec, and China National Petroleum Corp [CNPET.UL] and CNOOC. Unifying energy supervision under a standalone regulator may also help to reduce overlaps that have complicated the implementation of major policy in recent years.  “If this happened, the energy ministry would have more unified power to push through reform and regulate the market,” said Lin Boqiang, an energy expert with Xiamen University. He did not know about the plan. “The big question is whether the NDRC is willing to hand over its responsibility for the energy sector.” In 2016, government-enforced cuts in coal mining as part of Beijing’s supply-side reform and war on smog caused shortages of the fuel and a surge in prices, hurting utilities. Later, the NDRC had to reverse some of the most stringent measures. This past winter, Beijing’s push to heat homes with gas and electricity created chaos as some homes were freezing and factories were forced to shut due to lack of fuel. China formed its first energy ministry in 1988 from the remnants of the old electricity, coal and oil bureaus, but dissolved it in 1993. China set up the NEA in 2008 to improve coordination and conduct planning, but it has no policymaking powers and its decisions remain subject to the NDRC’s approval.

2018-03-08,"* Hopes of milder U.S. tariffs support market sentiment * Europe up 0.2 pct, Nikkei up 0.5 pct, Hang Seng up 1.4 percent * Dollar steadies; Mexico peso, C$ recover * ECB may offer hint on how it will end bond buying programme By Marc Jones LONDON, March 8 (Reuters) - Relative calm returned to global markets on Thursday, as traders took a brief break from worrying about a global trade war and focused back on how fast the European Central Bank will end its 2.5 trillion euro stimulus programme. Both European and Asian share markets edged higher — the former for a fourth day — after U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to introduce protectionist tariffs was tempered by signs he could spare some key trade partners. Germany’s Dax and the euro both lingered in the red though as a bigger-than-expected drop in German industrial orders reinforced euro zone caution after the weekend’s inconclusive Italian election. It may all argue for a more neutral message from ECB chief Mario Draghi later. Markets are on high alert for any signal on when it will end more than three years of unprecedented money printing. “They have stretched out the (buying) cycle and that made sense to us,” said Shoqat Bunglawala, Head of the Global Portfolio Solutions Group for EMEA and Asia Pacific at Goldman Sachs Asset Management. “We would expect them to end purchases this year but we think they will still stay flexible if there is any change to the growth picture in Europe.” Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar stabilised against other major currencies after its recent hit from fears about the tariff plan while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from their steep losses. The euro traded flat at $1.2406, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest levels since Feb. 16. The currency has been rising since it hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday, when Trump unveiled his tariff plan. Bond markets were also broadly steady with U.S. Treasuries stuck at 2.88 percent and Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield barely budged at 0.66 percent having hit a five-week low of 0.60 percent on Monday. The ECB will publish new forecasts for its main target of euro zone inflation and for growth later, which will feed the debate on its end to stimulus. In Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had risen 1.0 percent, while in Japan the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.4 percent after China’s surprisingly strong trade data. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended down just 0.05 percent at 2,726.8 after an initial loss of almost one percent, with tech shares being a major bright spot. They erased most losses as White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a media briefing that the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could exclude Canada, Mexico and a clutch of other countries. That soothed worries about the prospect of more aggressive trade measures after the departure of Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn. Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the issue would continue to hang over markets however. “Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.” Trump was expected to sign a presidential proclamation to establish the tariffs during a ceremony on Thursday, but a White House official said later it could slide into Friday because documents had to be cleared through a legal process. European Financial Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said Europe was preparing immediate counter-measures just in case of a major trade skirmish. “If Donald Trump puts in place the measures this evening, we have a whole arsenal at our disposal with which to respond,” Moscovici told BFM TV on Thursday. The dollar changed hands at 105.97 yen, little changed in Europe, keeping some distance from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. The Mexican peso last stood at 18.6900 per dollar, bouncing back from Wednesday’s low of 18.90 while the Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2888 to the U.S. unit, off its eight-month low of C$1.3002 hit earlier this week. Bitcoin steadied to after slumping more than 7 percent on Wednesday after U.S. and Japanese regulators tried to tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies. Japan’s financial regulator punished seven cryptocurrency exchanges, suspending business at the two of them, in an effort to shore up consumer protection after the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck. In commodities, oil prices inched back after falling more than 2 percent the previous day on the back of record U.S. crude production and rising inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.22 a barrel, down 0.1 percent, while benchmark Brent was 0.2 percent lower at $64.20 a barrel.

2018-03-08,"* New strategic industries on agenda for China’s top steel region * Hebei to promote AI, robotics as old industries are shut * Handan city still struggling, requiring special measures By David Stanway and Muyu Xu BEIJING, March 8 (Reuters) - The Chinese province of Hebei will pursue “high-quality development” this year as it looks to find alternative sources of economic growth while cracking down on polluters, local leaders said at a parliamentary meeting on Thursday. Hebei, home to nearly a quarter of China’s steel capacity and the location of six of the country’s 10 smoggiest cities, has been shutting down industrial plants and curbing coal use to reduce air pollution, much of which drifts into neighbouring Beijing. But apart from cracking down on polluters, Hebei has also vowed to promote strategic industries in areas like artificial intelligence, robotics, big data and new energy vehicles. During an open meeting of the Hebei delegation to the National People’s Congress held in front of journalists on Thursday and attended by Environment Minister Li Ganjie, provincial officials reinforced the message that Hebei was capable of shifting to cleaner growth. “We must promote technological innovation, allow new industries to become the mainstay of Hebei’s economy and turn Hebei into a major province for ‘high-quality development’,” Governor Xu Qin said, citing a slogan used by Premier Li Keqiang in his opening address to parliament this week. Hebei met its air quality targets last year, cutting average concentrations of particulate matter of less than 2.5 microns in size (PM2.5), small, breathable pollutants that can lodge deep in the lungs, by 7.1 percent to 65 micrograms per cubic metre. Hebei met those targets by aggressively shutting plants, especially in the steel sector. Hebei’s cities are now competing against one another to cut pollution after the province launched a new “punishment and reward” system that will fine the worst performers. The provincial capital of Shijiazhuang cut PM2.5 concentrations by 13 percent last year and Mayor Deng Peiran said he was increasingly confident in the city’s ability to tackle smog. Tangshan, China’s biggest steelmaking city, is making rapid progress diversifying its economy and shutting down polluting plants, the city’s top Communist Party official Ding Xingfeng said. The city cut PM2.5 concentrations by 10.8 percent last year. Tangshan plans to invest more than 100 billion yuan ($15.80 billion) this year on projects to “upgrade” its economy. However, Wang Litong, mayor of Handan, a heavily polluted steel hub and the only city in Hebei to see PM2.5 rise in 2017, was not called upon to speak at the meeting. Foreign media were not allowed to ask questions at the event, or given access to question officials. State-owned media agencies were allowed to ask questions and officials read their answers from prepared statements. $1 = 6.3290 yuan

In the first real look at its performance after it was forced to split its grid operations in January 2016, Eneco reported net profit from continuing operations of 127 million euros ($158 million), up from 103 million euros in 2016. Sales rose by 22 percent to 3.36 billion euros mostly due to acquisitions and investment in new wind capacity, the company said in a statement. Debt rose to 735 million euros from 415 million euros as the company borrowed to buy Eni’s Belgian operations and a 50 percent stake in German energy company LichtBlick. Eneco, which analysts have said could fetch as much as 4 billion euros in a trade sale due to its sustainable energy generation assets, reported a book value of 2.87 billion euros at Dec. 31, falling from 3.12 billion euros on the same date a year earlier. Eneco’s municipal shareholders voted for privatisation in October, to the dissatisfaction of the company’s management, who wanted to operate as independently as possible and to continue investing heavily in sustainable energy. After a public clash between shareholders and management that was eventually resolved only by intervention of a mediator, the company’s boards agreed last month to a sale or IPO. Chief executive Jeroen de Haas said in a statement he is determined that the company retains its pro-sustainable image regardless of the final outcome. “We understand that the majority of our shareholders wish to privatise Eneco Group and we would like to work together with the remaining and departing shareholders to arrive at an optimal outcome for all stakeholders,” he said. “Guarantees for the continuation of our sustainable course, and continuity of the company are central issues for us in this process.” Eneco generated 4.8 million Gigawatt hours of electricity from sustainable sources in 2017, up from 4.7 million. Fossil fuel generation increased to 3.4 million GWh from 3.1 million.

2018-03-08,"OSLO (Reuters) - The ethics watchdog for Norway’s $1-trillion sovereign wealth may blacklist more companies that produce too much greenhouse gas by scrutinising more industry sectors, including shipping and power. Carbon emissions became a criteria for exclusion from the fund in 2016 and last year the watchdog recommended that “a small handful” of firms be excluded from the fund for producing too much greenhouse gas emissions in either the oil, cement and steel industries. Those recommendations are currently under review with the board of the central bank, which oversees the fund, and a public announcement is expected soon, the bank’s governor told Reuters on Feb. 27.   Johan H. Andresen, chair of the fund’s publicly appointed Council on Ethics, said the watchdog would look at more firms in the energy, steel and concrete industries and add more sectors, including shipping and power producers. Speaking in an interview ahead of publication of the council’s annual report on Thursday, he said: “I expect there will be more companies recommended for exclusions based on the climate criteria.” “Shipping and power producers are among the sectors we may be looking at.” The world’s largest sovereign wealth fund was created from the proceeds of Norway’s oil industry and operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament. It owns shares in 9,100 companies, 1.4 percent of the world’s listed equity, so its decisions to drop or reinstate companies from its investments carry considerable weight among investors. Andresen said a company that is a big emitter of climate gases must show what plans it has to cut emissions by 2030 to remain in the fund’s portfolio, revealing for the first time what factors the watchdog takes into account.  “If they are very big emitters of greenhouse gas on an aggregate level and they are ‘worst in class’, they will really have to move,” said the 56-year-old Norwegian, who also owns private investment vehicle Ferd.  “They will need to have very credible plans to reduce emissions, that they have said they are going to do, not only to us, but to their shareholders.” The fund itself has proposed dropping oil and gas stocks from its benchmark index which, if accepted, would mean the fund would cut stakes in oil and gas companies over time. The proposal is currently under review at Norway’s finance ministry and will be voted on by parliament at a later date. Even if it goes ahead, the ethics watchdog will still have plenty of high polluters to examine. “It would reduce the number of suspects we are looking at, but I don’t think we will be out of work,” said Andresen. He declined to name specific companies.  The fund has also been looking at blacklisting companies because of corruption risks. One is Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA which is on a watch list for possible exclusion in the future if the ethics watchdog deems there is a risk of corruption. In January, state-controlled Petrobras agreed to pay $2.95 billion to settle a U.S. class action corruption lawsuit. The fund held a 0.68 percent stake in Petrobras worth $436 million at end-2017, according to fund data.  Andresen said that while there were parts of Petrobras that were trying to change their practice to a more sustainable one, an “inherent challenge” was the practice of changing Petrobras’ board members whenever a new government came to power.  “It is going to take some time for state-controlled companies to understand that they must adhere to these compliance practices which minority shareholders, or other shareholders, expect and which is the basis for which they are listed,” he said. The watchdog has an ongoing evaluation under the watch list scheme, he said. “We will just have to decide what kind of risk that entails and whether it makes it (Petrobras) more or less likely to be engaged in gross corruption in the future.” The fund’s ethics procedure was launched at the start of the millennium and 73 companies are presently excluded on recommendations by the Council on Ethics, on various grounds. Another 69 companies are excluded directly by the central bank based on their dependence on thermal coal. The fund gradually sells shares in any company it wishes to drop, before any announcement is made.  The main aim is to remove the ethical risk. The fund is forbidden by law from investing in companies that produce nuclear weapons or landmines, or are involved in human rights violations, among other criteria.  This year, Andresen said the ethics panel would definitely make a recommendation for exclusion due to the risk of corruption and was working actively on recommending exclusions regarding human rights violations in the textile industry in Asia. He also anticipated there could be more recommendations against shipping companies for the practice of “beaching” — running old vessels aground to be picked apart by manual labour. The fund excluded four shippers on these grounds in January.

2018-03-08,"OKUMA, Japan (Reuters) - A costly “ice wall” is failing to keep groundwater from seeping into the stricken Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, data from operator Tokyo Electric Power Co shows, preventing it from removing radioactive melted fuel at the site seven years after the disaster. When the ice wall was announced in 2013, Tepco assured sceptics that it would limit the flow of groundwater into the plant’s basements, where it mixes with highly radioactive debris from the site’s reactors, to “nearly nothing.” However, since the ice wall became fully operational at the end of August, an average of 141 metric tonnes a day of water has seeped into the reactor and turbine areas, more than the average of 132 metric tonnes a day during the prior nine months, a Reuters analysis of the Tepco data showed. The groundwater seepage has delayed Tepco’s clean-up at the site and may undermine the entire decommissioning process for the plant, which was battered by a tsunami seven years ago this Sunday. Waves knocked out power and triggered meltdowns at three of the site’s six reactors that spewed radiation, forcing 160,000 residents to flee, many of whom have not returned to this once-fertile coast. Though called an ice wall, Tepco has attempted to create something more like a frozen soil barrier.  Using 34.5 billion yen ($324 million) in public funds, Tepco sunk about 1,500 tubes filled with brine to a depth of 30 metres (100 feet) in a 1.5-kilometre (1-mile) perimeter around four of the plant’s reactors. It then cools the brine to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 Fahrenheit). The aim is to freeze the soil into a solid mass that blocks groundwater flowing from the hills west of the plant to the coast.  However, the continuing seepage has created vast amounts of toxic water that Tepco must pump out, decontaminate and store in tanks at Fukushima that now number 1,000, holding 1 million tonnes. It says it will run out of space by early 2021. “I believe the ice wall was ‘oversold’ in that it would solve all the release and storage concerns,” said Dale Klein, the former chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the head of an external committee advising Tepco on safety issues. “The hydrology of the Fukushima site is very complicated and thus the exact water flow is hard to predict,” he said, “especially during heavy rains.” (GRAPHIC: Water Seepage Flows at Fukushima, reut.rs/2FseHpb)  The water inflows often fluctuate with rainfall. The dry month of January averaged 83 tons a day, Tepco data showed.  But when a typhoon struck during the last week of October, 866 tons a day poured into the reactors.  Overall, Tepco says a combination of drains, pumps and the ice wall has cut water flows by three-quarters, from 490 tons a day during the December 2015 to February 2016 period to an average of 110 tons a day for December 2017 to February 2018. It is hard to measure exactly how much the ice wall is contributing, Tepco officials say, but based on computer analysis the utility estimates the barrier is reducing water flows by about 95 tonnes a day compared to two years ago, before the barrier was operating. “Our assessment is that the ice wall has been effective,” said Naohiro Masuda, Tepco’s chief decommissioning officer, adding that rain falling within the ice wall perimeter contributed to surging volumes. “We now believe we have a system in place to manage the water level.” However, a government-commissioned panel on Wednesday offered a mixed assessment of the ice wall, saying it was partially effective but more steps were needed. Controlling the groundwater seepage using the ice wall has been central to Japan’s program to show it had the Fukushima decommissioning in hand. The barrier was announced just days before Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared that Fukushima was “under control” in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee. In addition to the building costs, the ice wall needs an estimated 44 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year to run, enough to power about 15,000 typical Japanese homes. (GRAPHIC: Fukushima's ""ice wall"" IMG, tmsnrt.rs/2tqxK1k)  Meanwhile, Tepco must decide how to cope with the growing volume of water stored on site.  The purification process removes 62 radioactive elements from the contaminated water but it leaves tritium, a mildly radioactive element that is difficult to separate from water. Not considered harmful in low doses, tritium is released into oceans and rivers by nuclear plants around the world at various national standard levels. But local residents, particularly fishermen, oppose ocean releases because they fear it will keep consumers from buying Fukushima products. Many countries, including South Korea and China, still have restrictions on produce from Fukushima and neighbouring areas. A government-commissioned task force is examining five options for disposing of the tritium-laced water, including ocean releases, though no decision has been made. Ken Buesseler, a radiochemist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in the United States, suggests that Tepco should open the tanks to external inspections to see if the water is safe. “From the public’s viewpoint, I think they’d want a bit of independent confirmation,” Buesseler said. “It’s no harder and a lot cheaper than building an ice wall.” Reporting by Malcolm Foster and Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-disaster-nuclear-icewall/tepcos-ice-wall-fails-to-freeze-fukushimas-toxic-water-buildup-idUKL4N1QH1AL,08 Mar 2018,"A costly ""ice wall"" is

2018-03-08,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia, the world’s No.2 producer of palm oil, on Thursday said the European Union’s decision to curb imports of the commodity could impact France’s hopes of winning one of Asia’s biggest fighter jet deals. France’s Rafale jet, built by Dassault Aviation, had until recently been seen as the frontrunner in Malaysia’s plan to buy up to 18 new fighter planes in a deal potentially worth over $2 billion (1.44 billion pounds), but negotiations hit a snag after European lawmakers pushed to stop using palm oil in motor fuels. Malaysia said earlier this week that it would not shy away from a trade war and that it would respond with “might and tact” if the EU does not back down on curbing palm imports. “As you know, the jet fighters the French are looking at, the Rafale, are also competing with the Brits who have left the EU. So they have to take that into consideration (in relation to palm oil curbs),” Malaysia’s defence minister, Hishammuddin Hussein, said at a news conference outside parliament.  Britain’s BAE Systems has been on a consistent and public campaign for nearly a decade now to win the Malaysia contract, even establishing a regional office in the capital, Kuala Lumpur. Hishammuddin’s latest statement raises hopes for BAE, which looked to be on the backfoot after Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that he had discussed the possible purchase of Rafale fighters with Francois Hollande during the then-French president’s visit in March last year. Both Dassault and BAE did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Southeast Asia’s third-largest economy could lose some $500 million in annual revenue if the EU goes ahead with its plan to crimp palm imports, analysts have estimated. The move also adds to the troubles of Prime Minister Najib, whose ruling coalition will rely heavily on the votes of over 600,000 palm oil plantation smallholders and their families in national polls that must be held by August. Hishammuddin said Malaysia “cannot put a price tag” on the interests of the country and its people when negotiating bilateral deals. “So (to) those who want to have strong bilateral relations with us, do not just look at economic considerations separate from other considerations, especially when it come to defence because we do have other options,” he said. Malaysia has for several years been weighing France’s Rafale jet and the Eurofighter Typhoon, built by a European consortium including BAE, as it looks to replace its Russian MiG-29s - most of which are grounded. However, a decision has been delayed due to the upcoming national polls and a shift in Malaysia’s focus towards upgrading aerial surveillance capabilities.

2018-03-08,"* Hopes of milder U.S. tariffs support market sentiment * Nikkei up 0.5 pct, Hang Seng up 1.4 percent * Dollar steadies; Mexico peso, C$ recover * ECB may offer hint on how it will end bond buying programme * European shares are also set to open for higher By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, March 8 (Reuters) - Asian shares found relief on Thursday as fears about a global trade war amid U.S. President Donald Trump’s push to introduce protectionist tariffs were tempered by signs the move could include exemptions for key partners. European shares were also seen rising, with spread-betters expecting Germany’s Dax to rise 0.2 percent, France’s Cac to gain 0.3 percent and Britain’s FTSE to open flat. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.0 percent, while in Japan the Nikkei gained 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.4 percent after China posted surprisingly strong trade data for the first two months of the year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended down just 0.05 percent at 2,726.8 after an initial loss of almost one percent, with tech shares being a major bright spot. They erased most losses as White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a media briefing that the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could exclude Canada, Mexico and a clutch of other countries. That soothed worries about the prospect of more aggressive trade measures after the departure of Trump’s top economic adviser Gary Cohn. “Concerns about the U.S. tariff should ease today following the comments from the White House,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “Still the issue will continue to hang over in the markets. Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.” A White House official said on Wednesday Trump plans to offer Canada and Mexico a 30-day exemption from planned tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, which could be extended based on progress in NAFTA talks. Trump was expected to sign a presidential proclamation to establish the tariffs during a ceremony on Thursday, but a White House official said later it could slide into Friday because documents had to be cleared through a legal process. Investors worry that the U.S. tariff could trigger a trade war, shrinking global trade and eventually squeezing corporate profits that have so far benefited from strong global growth. Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in the first two months of this year from a year earlier. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar stabilised against other major currencies after its recent hit from fears about the tariff plan while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from their steep losses. The euro traded flat at $1.2406, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest levels since Feb. 16. The common currency has been rising since it had hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday, when Trump unveiled his tariff plan. The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but may tweak its communication stance to offer at least a few clues about its progress towards ending its unprecedented bond purchases later this year. “The focus in today’s ECB meeting will be whether the bank changes its forward guidance around QE,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities. “Any hawkish turn would boost the euro, pretty simple. If there are no changes to the wording, the euro could fall. But things are not that simple as investors have to worry about a potential trade war with the U.S,” he added. The dollar changed hands at 105.97 yen, little changed in Asia, keeping some distance from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. The Mexican peso last stood at 18.6900 per dollar, bouncing back from Wednesday’s low of 18.90 while the Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2888 to the U.S. unit, off its eight-month low of C$1.3002 hit earlier this week. Bitcoin fell as U.S. and Japanese regulators tried to tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies. Japan’s financial regulator punished seven cryptocurrency exchanges, suspending business at the two of them, in an effort to shore up consumer protection after the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said many online trading platforms for cryptocurrencies should be registered with the regulator and subject to additional rules. On the Bitstamp exchange, the digital currency traded at $9,780, falling 1.6 percent after having lost 7.6 percent on Wednesday, its biggest daily fall in over a month. In commodities, oil prices steadied after falling the previous day on the back of record U.S. crude production and rising inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.22 a barrel, up 0.1 percent after having fallen more than 2 percent the previous session.

2018-03-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s exports unexpectedly surged at the fastest pace in three years in February, suggesting both its economy and global growth remain resilient even as trade relations with the United States rapidly deteriorate. Trade tensions have jumped to the top of the list of risks facing China this year, with planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum signaling more measures may be on the way, Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum this week. China’s February exports rose 44.5 percent from a year earlier, far more than analysts’ median forecast for a 13.6 percent increase and January’s 11.1 percent gain, official data showed on Thursday. Imports grew 6.3 percent, missing forecasts for 9.7 percent growth and down from a sharper-than-expected 36.9 percent jump in January. Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a Analysts caution that Chinese data early in the year can be heavily distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year but in January in 2017.  But combined January-February data also showed a dramatic acceleration in export growth, good news for Beijing as it tries to crack down on risks in the financial system without sharply braking economic activity.     Exports rose 24.4 percent in Jan-Feb on-year, eclipsing 10.8 percent in December and up from single-digit growth in the same period last year. The gains came despite a much stronger yuan currency which is worrying the country’s exporters.  “The broad-based recovery in China’s major export markets could explain part of the reason why exports were still quite strong,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ in Hong Kong.  But tension with the U.S. “is definitely a near-term concern and a near-term downside risk to China’s trade outlook,” she added.     China’s goods surplus with the United States, a sore spot in relations between the two nations, narrowed slightly last month but is higher so far this year than at the same point last year. China’s trade surplus with the U.S. was $20.96 billion in February compared with $21.895 billion in January.     Boosted by a global trade boom, China’s exports last year grew the fastest since 2013 and served as one of the key drivers behind the economy’s forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion. But tough U.S. trade talk last year is now turning into action, clouding the outlook for a repeat performance. President Donald Trump is expected to sign a proclamation on Thursday or Friday to establish the steel and aluminum tariffs, to counter cheap imports, especially from China, though close U.S. allies may get exemptions. The measures are expected to go into effect in about two weeks, but economists see little immediate impact on China. China has already reduced steel exports to the U.S. to a trickle in response to strong demand at home and U.S. anti-dupming duties, and while aluminum shipments account for around 10 percent of its global exports of the metal, the number is still small compared with China’s total exports, according to ING economist Iris Pang. “All in all, the direct impact on China is minimal,” Pang said in a note published on Thursday. While China’s global steel exports have dropped by almost a third this year, tariffs on aluminum may be an easier sell for Trump, as China’s shipments increased over 35 percent in the first two months of the year.  Over time, however, any additional punitive U.S. measures and retaliations by China or its other major trading partners would reduce global trade flows, disrupt international supply chains and drag on global growth. China may be far more vulnerable to U.S. plans to combat intellectual property theft, which could hit its sales of hi-tech, high-value products. China’s global tech exports saw strong double-digit gains in the first two months of this year. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday that China would make a necessary response in the event of a trade war with the U.S. but said such a war would only harm all sides. “On paper, China has more to lose from a trade war – it exports far more to the U.S. than it imports,” Capital Economics said. “But (for the U.S.) there are few alternative sources for the main products that it buys from China,” such as mobile phones, tablets and network equipment, it added. At home, China’s domestic demand also appears solid, despite a cooling property market and rising borrowing costs that are expected to eventually rob the economy of some momentum. While February import growth softened, it climbed 21.7 percent in the first two months of the year, compared with 4.5 percent in December. Imports of commodities again led the way, with steel mills replenishing inventories of iron ore ahead of the seasonal construction pick-up in spring. China’s trade surplus widened to $33.74 billion for February, outperforming forecasts for $600 million and January’s $20.35 billion. For Jan-Feb combined, the surplus rose 43.6 percent from the year earlier period to $54.32 billion. The strong trade performance suggests a possible upside surprise in China’s industrial output data next week and in  economic growth for the first quarter as a whole. Analysts polled by Reuters earlier this year expected momentum to ease slightly to 6.6 percent this quarter from 6.8 percent late last year. Premier Li Keqiang said Monday that China aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent in 2018, the same target that it beat handily in 2017.

2018-03-08,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s huge Belt and Road initiative to build a new Silk Road will respect global rules and be free of “backroom deals”, the foreign minister said on Thursday, defending a key policy of President Xi Jinping’s. Unveiled in 2013, the Belt and Road project is aimed at connecting China by land and sea to Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Central Asia, and beyond to the Middle East, Europe and Africa. Xi pledged $124 billion for the plan at a summit last May but it has faced suspicion in Western capitals that it is intended more to assert Chinese influence than Beijing’s professed desire to spread prosperity and that it will mostly benefit Chinese companies. Visiting China in January, French President Emmanuel Macron said Belt and Road could not be “one-way”.   Speaking at a news conference on the sidelines of the annual meeting of parliament, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the Belt and Road was a “sunshine initiative” that was open and for all to benefit from. “Everything will operate in the sunshine,” Wang said. “There is no domination by one party; everyone participates equally. There are no backroom deals; there is openness and transparency. There is no winner-takes-all; only seeking win-win mutual benefit.” Wang pointed to what he said were several already very successful Belt and Road-linked projects, including building power plants in Pakistan and China’s operation of Greece’s largest port at Piraeus.   “China and France have joined hands to build a nuclear power station in Britain, becoming a model for cooperation in new high-tech projects for the Belt and Road,” he said, referring to the Hinkley Point scheme, which British Prime Minister Theresa May initially put on hold when she came to office in 2016. Wang said China was committed to best international practice. “Belt and Road is a global public good, and of course respects international rules. It is a global platform for cooperation, and naturally will run according to market rules,” he added. “It won’t only benefit China. Even more, it will bring benefit to the world.” Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-parliament-silkroad/china-says-no-backroom-deals-in-new-silk-road-initiative-idUKL4N1QQ29P,08 Mar 2018,"China's huge Belt and Road

2018-03-08,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 8 (Reuters) - It’s safe to dismiss any impression that China’s imports of major commodities such as crude oil and iron ore were weak in February, despite the numbers suggesting as much. The timing of the Lunar New Year holiday usually affects when imports are counted as having arrived in the world’s largest buyer of commodities. This year the week-long holiday fell entirely in February, likely resulting in a pull-forward of the counting of imports into January, meaning February’s arrivals appear weaker than they should. Crude oil imports in February were 32.26 million tonnes, China customs said on Thursday, equivalent to about 8.41 million barrels per day (bpd). That looks like a massive drop from January’s 9.57 million bpd, which was the strongest month on record. Putting the first two months of 2018 together, however, gives an import rate of about 9.02 million bpd, up a fairly strong 10.8 percent from the same period last year. It’s a similar story for iron ore, with February imports plunging 16 percent to 84.66 million tonnes from January’s 100.3 million, which was the second-highest month on record. Again, taking the first two months together gives an import total of 185 million tonnes, up 5.4 percent on the same period last year. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters tends to be less lumpy than the official customs data, with the numbers showing January arrivals of 89.54 million tonnes of iron ore, and February pegged at 85.09 million, giving a two-month total of 174.63 million. The shipping data doesn’t exactly align with customs data as it doesn’t include any iron ore China imports that come overland, such as from neighbouring Mongolia. Coal imports were another area of strength in the first two months of 2018, rising 14.4 percent from the same period a year ago to 48.7 million tonnes, despite on the surface looking weak after they dropped 25 percent in February from January. Imports of unwrought copper also dropped in February, falling 20 percent from January to 352,000 tonnes. Similar to other major commodities, though, the copper imports were quite robust on a year-to-date basis, having increased by 9.8 percent in the January-February period this year compared to the same period in 2017. The conclusion can only be that China’s appetite for imported commodities remains robust and consistent with the current narrative of an economy that is performing fairly well, notwithstanding areas of concern, such as credit quality. A further sign of this is steel product exports, one of the few areas of genuine weakness in the Chinese commodity complex. Steel product exports are down 27.1 percent to 9.5 million tonnes in the first two months of the year compared to the same period a year ago. This is largely a reflection of a tighter domestic market in the wake of enforced closures of some blast furnaces over winter as part of measures to reduce air pollution. But it also shows that domestic steel prices are high enough to keep what is being produced within the local market. China’s steel exports have been trending lower in recent months, having slumped 30.5 percent in 2017. This fact sits somewhat uncomfortably with U.S. President Donald Trump’s planned new 25 percent tariff on imports, with China’s exports cited by his administration as one of the reasons behind the decision. Trump is on somewhat safer ground with his planned 10 percent import tariff on aluminium, given China’s exports of unwrought aluminium and products have surged 25.8 percent to 817,000 tonnes in the first two months of 2018 from the same period last year.

2018-03-08,"* Feb oil imports 8.41 mln bpd, off Jan’s record 9.57 mln bpd * Feb daily natgas imports level vs Jan on peak winter demand * Independents curb crude oil purchases due to tax changes By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, March 8 (Reuters) - China’s February crude oil imports fell sharply from January’s record as independent refineries curbed buying amid worries about new tax rules, while natural gas imports held at high levels to heat homes during a bitter winter. China’s February crude oil imports of 32.26 million tonnes, or 8.41 million barrels per day, were 12 percent below January’s record high of 9.57 million bpd, data from the General Administration of Customs showed on Thursday. For the first two months of the year, China brought in 72.9 million tonnes of crude oil, or 9.02 million bpd, compared with an average of 8.4 million barrels bpd throughout 2017. “Teapots are cutting back utilization because of fears over the new consumption tax policy, which is supposed to work towards hampering tax evasion,” said Harry Liu of consultancy IHS Markit. China issued new tax rules in January that aimed to address a long-held complaint by China’s state-owned oil companies that privately owned refiners and blenders, known as teapots, have grabbed market share by undercutting their prices through tax avoidance. The lower imports also came as refineries eased up on buying ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February, when manufacturing plants shut for up to two weeks. A government crackdown on pollution and a push for tougher emissions standard also affected production for many refineries in the industrialised province of Shandong, a manager with an independent refinery said before the data was released. He declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. China, meanwhile, maintained its high pace of natural gas imports. February’s 6.94 million tonnes was steady on a daily basis with January’s 7.7 million tonnes, which marked the second highest level on record on a monthly basis. Imports of both piped gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG)have hovered around record highs in winter months as residents in northern regions switch to the fuel for heating as part of Beijing’s drive to clean up the environment. The massive government push to heat millions of homes and power thousands of factories with natural gas in northern China led to demand for the fuel outpacing supply, while delivery infrastructure struggled to manage the higher consumption. Wang Wen, gas analyst with consultancy Wood Mackenzie, expects LNG imports to ease after the winter heating season ends in mid-March, but purchases could buck the usual seasonal trend. “Let’s wait and see if the government is going to push wider the gasification campaign, or if there will be pent-up industrial demand emerging,” said Wang. State-run energy giants such as PetroChina and CNOOC may also start stockpiling LNG in summer months to fill the storage tanks drawn down in peak winter season, she added.

Data from the General Administration of Customs released on Thursday showed coal arrivals COA-IMP-TOT dropped to 20.9 million tonnes last month from 27.8 million tonnes in January, when freezing weather boosted demand. February’s imports were the lowest for any month level since July 2017. Still, for the first two months of the year the world’s No.1 coal importer brought in a total of 48.71 million tonnes of the fuel, up 14 percent from a year earlier, the data showed. Daily coal consumption at major utilities has declined to 524,700 tonnes as of March 2 from as much as 822,000 tonnes in early February, according to data from Wind consultancy, as cold winter weather eased across the country. “The coal supply crunch has eased since mid-February, so the advantages of imported coal became less obvious,” said Xu Bo, analyst at Haitong Futures. Northern China’s official winter heating season ends on March 15, pointing to a seasonal drop-off in demand, while Beijing has vowed to cut more steel and coal capacity as it tries to curb pollution. “Coal consumption may fall this year due to concerns of slowing economic growth and deepened capacity reduction targets in downstream sectors such as steel and coal-fired power,”  Man Shengang, chairman at Shandong Energy Zaozhuang Mining Group Co., told Reuters on Wednesday. China aims to maintain its national economic growth target at around 6.5 percent and cut more steel, coal and coal-fired power capacity in 2018.

2018-03-08,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has revoked the investment licence for a foreign-owned $3.2-billion (2.3 billion pounds) oil refinery project in the country’s central province of Phu Yen, a local government official told Reuters on Thursday. The 160,000-barrel-per-day facility was due to be built through investments from UK-based Technostar Management Ltd and Russia’s Telloil Group to produce liquefied petroleum gas, jet fuel, gasoline and diesel, according to state media. “The refinery was scheduled to become operational this year, but construction hadn’t started yet,” said Tran Thien Kim, deputy director of the province’s planning and investment department. The investor failed to deliver on investment pledges as stated in the licence, said Kim, who added that the province had informed the companies of the decision. “They are happy with the decision because it’s in line with their plan to scrap the project due to unfavourable market conditions,” he said. It is not uncommon for large-scale projects in Vietnam to have investment licenses revoked, often because of strict regulations and requirements from the authorities related to the speed of construction and the environment. Vietnam has one operational oil refinery which meets around one-third of the country’s demand for fuels. A second oil refinery will start commercial production from next month.

2018-03-08,"(Corrects percentage rise for combined Jan-Feb trade surplus in paragraph 13) BEIJING, March 8 (Reuters) - China’s exports unexpectedly surged at the fastest pace in three years in February, suggesting its economic growth remains resilient even as trade relations with the United States rapidly deteriorate. Trade tensions have jumped to the top of the list of risks facing China this year, with proposed U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports suggesting more measures may be on the way, Zhou Hao, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum this week. China’s February exports rose 44.5 percent from a year earlier, compared with analysts’ median forecast for a 13.6 percent increase, and an 11.1 percent gain in January, official data showed on Thursday. Imports grew 6.3 percent, the General Administration of Customs said, missing analysts’ forecast for 9.7 percent growth, and down from a sharper-than-expected 36.9 percent jump in January. Analysts caution Chinese data early in the year can be heavily distorted by the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday, which fell in February this year but in January in 2017. But combined January-February trade data also showed a dramatic acceleration in export growth. Exports rose 24.4 percent on-year in Jan-Feb, much better than 10.8 percent in December and 4 percent growth in Jan-Feb last year. The government also releases combined data for the first two months in an attempt to smooth out seasonal distortions. The deceleration in import growth for February may be payback for the previous month’s unusual strength, rather than a sign there has been an abrupt weakening in demand. Robust import growth in January was mostly led by commodities as factories scrambled to restock inventories ahead of the long holiday. Imports in the first two months of the year rose 21.7 percent, compared with 4.5 percent in December. China’s trade surplus widened to $33.74 billion for February, compared with forecasts for $0.6 billion and January’s $20.35 billion. For Jan-Feb combined, the surplus rose 43.6 percent from the year earlier period to $54.32 billion. Boosted by a global trade boom in 2017, China’s exports grew at the fastest pace since 2013 and served as one of the key drivers behind the economy’s forecast-beating 6.9 percent expansion last year. But tough U.S. trade talk last year is now turning into action. President Donald Trump is expected to sign a proclamation on Thursday or Friday to establish the steel and aluminium tariffs, to counter cheap imports, especially from China, though close U.S. allies may get exemptions. The measures are expected to go into effect in two months, but economists see little immediate impact on China. It has already reduced steel exports to the U.S. to a trickle, and while aluminium shipments account for around 10 percent of its total global exports of the metal, the number is still small compared with China’s total exports, according to ING economist Iris Pang. “All in all, the direct impact on China is minimal,” Pang said in a note published on Thursday. Over time, however, any additional punitive U.S. measures and retaliations by China or its other major trading partners would reduce global trade flows, disrupt international supply chains and drag on global growth. U.S. plans to combat intellectual property theft, which are believed to be moving quickly through the pipeline, could also have a more significant impact on China’s exporters, particularly in hi-tech, high-value industries. Net exports contributed 9.1 percent of China’s GDP growth last year. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Thursday that China would make a necessary response in the event of a trade war with the United States but said such a war would only harm all sides. Speaking on the sidelines of an annual meeting of China’s parliament, Wang said China had no intention of displacing the United States and that the two countries did not have to be rivals but should strive to be partners.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng led the region with rise of 1.2 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei gained 0.8 percent. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 ended down just 0.05 percent at 2,726.8 after an initial loss of almost one percent, with tech shares being a major bright spot. They erased most losses as White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a media briefing that the impending hefty U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium imports could exclude Canada, Mexico and a clutch of other countries. That soothed worries that the Trump Administration could lean more towards protectionist policies after the departure of his top economic adviser Gary Cohn. “Concerns about the U.S. tariff should ease today following the comments from the White House,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “Still the issue will continue to hang over in the markets. Investors need to see exactly what steps Trump will take and what retaliatory actions other countries will take in coming days.” A White House official said on Wednesday Trump plans to offer Canada and Mexico a 30-day exemption from planned tariffs on steel and aluminium imports, which could be extended based on progress in NAFTA talks. Trump was expected to sign a presidential proclamation to establish the tariffs during a ceremony on Thursday, but a White House official said later it could slide into Friday because documents had to be cleared through a legal process. Investors worry that the U.S. tariff could trigger a trade war, shrink the global trade, and eventually squeeze corporate profits that have so far benefited from strong global growth. Highlighting the strength of the global economy, Chinese trade data showed both exports and imports rose more than 20 percent in dollar terms from a year earlier in the first two months of this year. In the currency market, the U.S. dollar stabilised against other major currencies after its recent hit from fears about the tariff plan while the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar recovered from their steep losses. The euro traded flat at $1.2402, having risen to $1.2447 on Wednesday, its highest levels since Feb. 16. The common currency has been rising since it had hit a seven-week low of $1.21545 hit on Thursday, when Trump unveiled his tariff plan. The European Central Bank is all but certain to keep policy unchanged on Thursday but may tweak its communication stance to offer at least a few clues about its progress towards ending its unprecedented bond purchases later this year. “The focus in today’s ECB meeting will be whether the bank changes its forward guidance around QE,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities. “Any hawkish turn would boost the euro, pretty simple. If there are no changes to the wording, the euro could fall. But things are not that simple as investors have to worry about a potential trade war with the U.S,” he added. The dollar changed hands at 106.05 yen, little changed in Asia, keeping some distance from its 16-month low of 105.24 touched on Friday. The Mexican peso last stood at 18.7125 per dollar, bouncing back from Wednesday’s low of 18.90 while the Canadian dollar changed hands at C$1.2910 to the U.S. unit, off its eight-month low of C$1.3002 hit earlier this week. Bitcoin fell as U.S. and Japanese regulators tried to tighten their grip on cryptocurrencies. Japan’s financial regulator punished seven cryptocurrency exchanges, suspending business at the two of them, in an effort to shore up consumer protection after the $530 million theft of digital money from Tokyo-based Coincheck. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said many online trading platforms for cryptocurrencies should be registered with the regulator and subject to additional rules. On the Bitstamp exchange, the digital currency traded at $9,691, falling 2.3 percent after having lost 7.6 percent on Wednesday, its biggest daily fall in over a month. In commodities, oil prices steadied after falling the previous day on the back of record U.S. crude production and rising inventories. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.29 a barrel, up 0.2 percent after having fallen more than 2 percent the previous session.

2018-03-08,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea faces a long road to recovery after the powerful earthquake that hit the nation’s rugged highlands more than 10 days ago, with the death toll now believed to have climbed to more than 100, its leader said. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill flew over the worst-hit areas on Wednesday after a magnitude 6.7 aftershock struck the mountainous region already reeling from a 7.5 quake on Feb. 26. “There will be no quick fix. The damage from this disaster will take months and years to be repaired,” O’Neill said in Tari, the capital of Hela province. Australia and New Zealand sent more helicopters and planes to help deliver food, water and medicine to the remote region, where the government and aid agencies have been scrambling to reach villages stranded by landslides and collapsed roads. “Tragically, the Highlands Earthquake has already claimed the lives of an estimated more than 100 Papua New Guineans, with many more still missing and thousands of people injured,” O’Neill said in comments published by his office. The Feb. 26 quake forced oil giant ExxonMobil Corp to shut all its gas facilities in the country, which it expects will be down for around eight weeks while it carries out inspections and repairs. Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, which exports more than 8 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas a year, is the nation’s biggest export earner. The company has said its facilities in the highlands, where it produces and processes gas, and the 700-km (435-mile) pipeline that snakes through the jungle to the coast to feed the LNG plant all stood up well to the earthquake. “It has essentially come out unscathed,” ExxonMobil senior vice president Neil Chapman told analysts in New York on Wednesday. He said the main challenge to restoring operations was moving people back into the quake-hit area and fixing their living quarters. “It’s tough to get people in and out in the highlands right now. Accommodation is a challenge. Infrastructure is a challenge,” Chapman said. The eight-week estimate for restarting PNG LNG was preliminary, he said. “It could be shorter than that.” ExxonMobil’s PNG LNG partner Oil Search has been heavily involved in relief efforts while also trying to inspect and repair its oil and gas facilities in the highlands. “The integrity of facilities have been maintained and there has been no leakage from any of the facilities,” Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten told Reuters by phone from Port Moresby. He played down talk of looting and security problems at the oil and gas facilities. “I don’t think that’s going on, certainly in no serious way,” he said.

2018-03-08,"* U.S. crude oil inventories rise slightly less than expected * But U.S. crude stocks are still back above 5-year average * U.S. crude output reaches another record at 10.37 mln bpd By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday after falling the previous day on the back of record U.S. crude production and rising inventories. Brent crude futures were at $64.49 per barrel at 0100 GMT, up 15 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous close. That slight rise came after a more than 2 percent fall the previous day. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $61.29 a barrel, up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent. WTI also fell by more than 2 percent the previous session. The slight recovery on Thursday came amid a U.S. crude inventory build that was not as big as expected during the current seasonal demand lull at the end of winter, when many oil refineries shut down for maintenance. “Oil prices bounced back immediately after the release of the weekly oil inventories data from the Energy Information Administration ... (where) the headline figure was better than expected,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com. The EIA reported late on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories C-STK-EIA rose by 2.4 million barrels in the week to March 2, to 425.91 million barrels, less than the 2.7 million barrel increase analysts had forecast. Despite this, oil markets remain under pressure from the seasonal trend of rising inventories, which in the United States have climbed back above the 5-year average of 420 million barrels. Also looming over oil markets is soaring U.S. production, which last week marked another record, at 10.37 million barrels per day (bpd). “Crude is ... under pressure from rising U.S. production which hit a new high last week, now firmly above Saudi Arabia’s production level,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. At just below 11 million bpd, only Russia currently produces more crude oil than the United States, although the International Energy Agency (IEA) expects even this to change as the United States is set to surge past 11 million bpd by late 2018. With U.S. output outpacing demand growth, analysts say the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia, who together with some other producers have been withholding production in order to prop up prices, are under pressure to keep up the supply restraint, even at the cost of market share. “OPEC may ... have to extend its production agreement with Russia and co in order to avoid triggering another 2014-style sell-off in oil prices,” said Razaqzada.

2018-03-08,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Venezuelan state governor made an unusual visit to Washington this week seeking meetings in Congress to discuss the fate of an American imprisoned in the South American nation, U.S. sources said on Wednesday, as the country faces a possible new round of sanctions. Rafael Lacava, governor of Venezuela’s Carabobo state, requested meetings to discuss Josh Holt, a Mormon missionary from Utah. He and his Venezuelan wife, Thamara Caleno, have been held since they were arrested in 2016 on weapons charges after Holt travelled to Venezuela for their wedding. “We are aware that he is here. There are suspicions that the Venezuela government is using the illegitimate detention of Mr. Holt as a bargaining chip to talk about U.S. sanctions,”  a U.S. official said. “We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Holt and until he is released we continue to insist on regular ongoing consular contacts with him as called for under international law,” the official said. It is unusual for an official allied with Venezuela’s socialist government, a U.S. adversary, to visit Washington for such meetings. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering new sanctions targeting Venezuela’s oil sector to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro ahead of an election Washington and its allies consider a sham. Another U.S. source familiar with the situation confirmed Lacava was in Washington to discuss Holt, but did not believe sanctions would be discussed in Congress since lawmakers would defer to the administration on any such matter. “While I am not able to speculate on what else might be on Mr. Lacava’s agenda, I want to make very clear that the sole purpose of such meetings would be to encourage the release of Mr. Holt and his wife,” the source said. “There would be no negotiation, and any claim to the contrary is simply false,” the source said. Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and other lawmakers are working for Holt’s release. “While Senator Hatch prefers to not share details of sensitive meetings related to his nearly two year effort to have Josh Holt released on humanitarian grounds, he is optimistic he is making progress and will continue to work with the State Department and colleagues in the Congress to identify those to meet and work with who can get it done,” Hatch spokesman Matt Whitlock said.
