2018-11-27,"PARIS/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Officials from the Group of 20 leading industrialized nations gathered in Argentina are making slow progress in drafting a final communique for this weekend’s leaders summit, amid disagreements over language on trade and climate change, delegates said.   Representatives from the G20 countries known as “sherpas” began meeting in Buenos Aires on Monday to start intensive discussions around the communique, a non-binding agreement on policy issues that is due to be unveiled at the conclusion of the two-day summit, which begins on Friday. G20 leaders have met each year since the 2008 global economic crisis to try to reach broad agreement on important  issues such as trade. But increasingly they have been bedeviled by disunity, and a failure to agree on a communique this year would underscore growing divisions at a time of heightened international trade disputes. “The talks are difficult but that is not a surprise,” a European source told Reuters on Tuesday. “Concerning the progress on the statement, the talks are still ongoing so it is difficult to predict the outcome.” A French finance ministry source added: “It’s true the situation is quite frankly rather tense. The outcome in the coming days is quite uncertain.” A second source at the finance ministry said U.S. officials were pushing back on any mention of the Paris Climate Agreement. After signalling its intention to withdraw from the accord last year, the United States broke with other G20 member countries that have pledged to end coal usage and take steps to reach goals outlined in the accord. The French are also pushing for the communique to reject protectionism and commit to reforming the World Trade Organization and the rules of global commerce, the second French source said.       An Asian delegate told Reuters there was no progress made on Monday after a half-day session. A delegate from Latin America, who also requested anonymity, said a definitive draft was not expected until Thursday.  “We are in full negotiation with the other delegations. The text will be known once the leaders approve it,” Argentina’s Pedro Villagra Delgado, the lead organizer or “sherpa” of the G20, told Reuters on Tuesday. Villagra Delgado had said on Nov. 15 that climate change, steel and migration had emerged as the “most complicated” areas of discussion, delaying final approval on the communique. Recent history suggests the sherpas will struggle to agree to reach consensus. Officials from countries attending a major Asia-Pacific summit earlier this month failed to approve a joint communique for the first time as the United States clashed with China over trade and security.  In May, U.S. President Donald Trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the G7 industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony, again over tariffs and trade. Some sherpas have said this year’s G20 communique will likely be watered down to try to ensure approval from Trump, an avowed sceptic of man-made climate change who has adopted protectionist trade policies and a more isolationist foreign policy. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Tuesday it was unclear whether there would be a final communique. “If we didn’t get one, there’d be no tears shed,” he said.

2018-11-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rejected requests from the corn lobby to reallocate biofuel volumes waived under its small refinery exemption programme into its 2019 mandate, an agency official told Reuters on Tuesday. The official also said the 2019 biofuel mandate figures, due to be released this week, would be largely in line with the agency’s June proposal of 19.88 billion gallons, which includes 15 billion gallons of convention biofuels like ethanol.  The powerful corn lobby and top officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture have complained for months that the Trump administration’s expansion of the EPA refinery waiver programme threatens demand for crucial farm products like ethanol. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. “It is an issue of timing,” said the EPA official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “The primary reason why we’re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of SREs (Small Refinery Exemptions) will be for calendar 2019 and we won’t know that late 2019, early 2020. All we could do is guess, and we don’t do regulations by guessing here.” The refinery waiver programme is among the most controversial issues dividing the U.S. corn lobby and the oil industry. Since President Donald Trump’s election, the EPA has vastly expanded the number of waivers it has handed out to small refineries in a bid to reduce the refining industry’s regulatory compliance costs. The move has infuriated another key Trump constituency, the Farmbelt, which argues the programme erodes demand for biofuels. Under pressure, the EPA earlier this year began studying a potential overhaul in which biofuels blending obligations eliminated under the waiver programme would be reallocated, possibly in the following year, to other facilities, to ensure there was no net loss in overall blending volumes. “We would like to make everybody happy. It is not often the case we can,” the EPA official said. The EPA is set to formally announce its 2019 biofuels mandate volumes by Nov. 30.

2018-11-27,"(Adds quote from local mayor, number of vessels, production implications, Novatek trading strategy) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Yamal, one of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Arctic Russia, is expected to export as much as 11.7 million tonnes of LNG in the next seven months through Norway, according to the port hosting its ship-to-ship operations and Reuters calculations. The ramp-up in output puts the Novatek terminal, in operation for less than a year, in excess of its nameplate capacity, with the Norwegian transfers the only way it can deliver the additional LNG to the market. Yamal uses Arctic-classed LNG tankers to carry the gas through the Barents Sea; these vessels then transfer the cargo to more conventional tankers in Europe, enabling them to return sooner to the facility and pick up more supplies. These transfers began in Honningsvag, Norway, last week, cutting the journey time to the previous transfer points in France, Belgium and the Netherlands by at least 2,000 kilometres and freeing up the Arctic tankers sooner. Now, the local mayor of the tiny port on the tip of Norway, says up to 160 transfers are expected until the end of June. “Between 150 and 160 transfers will take place in the port’s fjord from November to June,” local mayor Kristina Sigursdottir Hansen told Reuters. “Ships will be coming with gas from Russia, from Yamal ... More than 300 ships actually (will be involved).” The Arc7-classed Yamal tankers in operation carry about 160,000 cubic metres or 73,000 tonnes of LNG per load, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data, making the volume expected to be involved in the transfers at 11.7 million tonnes until June. That puts Yamal’s output in the first six months of 2019 at 10 million tonnes, on track to exceed the facilities’ nameplate capacity of 16.5 million tonnes a year. Novatek said last week its third train, or plant, has begun operations. It did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The transfer operations in Norway come just as lower Asian LNG prices together with high shipping costs have closed an arbitrage with Asia and increased deliveries into Europe. A Novatek company source said earlier this month it expected these dynamics to continue until mid-2019. It has been in the market this month arranging cargo swaps between the Pacific and Atlantic basins to reduce its shipping costs to Asia, buying at least one cargo in the Pacific for December delivery. It was looking to arrange around three swap deals for this winter, according to the source. Norway’s Tschudi Shipping facilitates the ship-to-ship transfers, its chief executive Jon Edvard Sundnes said, confirming that there was a contract until June. He would not comment on the number of transfers. Jan Morten Hansen, regional director for the Norwegian Coastal Administration, said “that is what Tschudi told us”, when asked whether up to 160 transfers would take place. Four locations around Honningsvag can host the transfers and three operations are allowed to run simultaneously, he said. Additional reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova; Writing by Sabina

2018-11-27,"BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The European Union’s climate chief on Tuesday called on the bloc to aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the most ambitious path in a long-term strategy due to be announced on Wednesday. With President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of international efforts to curb global warming, Miguel Arias Canete said the EU had to lead by example at the next round of United Nations talks on climate change opening in Katowice, Poland, on Sunday. The 2050 strategy to be presented by the EU executive on Wednesday sets out eight scenarios for the bloc’s 28 nations to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement - two of which chart of a course for the Europe to become climate neutral. “It’s worth becoming the first major economy to fully decarbonise, to fully reach net zero emissions,” Europe’s Climate Commissioner Arias Canete told Reuters on Tuesday. “It is absolutely possible. For sure, it will require lots of investment. It will require lots of effort, but it is doable.” Under a package of climate legislation passed since the 2015 Paris accord from energy efficiency to renewable targets and curbs on transport pollution, the EU is on track to overshoot its pledge to reduce emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. The bloc currently is set to reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2050. “The message of the Commission is: ‘That’s okay, but we need to do more,” Arias Canete said. “The thing is, do you want to be a front mover, or a follower?” The U.N. talks are the most important since the Paris Agreement, with delegates from 195 nations set to haggle over the details and produce a “rule book” for the pact, which the United States has announced it will quit. By publishing its ambitious strategy on Wednesday, EU official hope to pull more weight at what are expected to be tough talks amid division among world powers. “It will not be an easy COP but the European Union arrives with lots of credibility to these talks and we can show the rest of the world, developed and developing, that we take climate policy very seriously,” Arias Canete said. “The role of the United States is less relevant and that puts more burden on our shoulders because we have to occupy territory that in the past was occupied by Americans.” While Trump on Monday rejected projections that global warming will cause severe economic harm, a U.N. report detailing the dangers has spurred ministers from 10 EU nations to call for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. Calls for more ambition, however, have divided the EU. Many nations, including economic powerhouse Germany, are struggling to meet their targets are worried that tougher cuts would threaten industry. EU national governments have until the end of 2019 to draft their own plans for reducing energy usage to keep in line with the bloc’s goals. To respond to the U.N. report and achieve net negative emissions, Arias Canete said the bloc’s economies will have to invest more in carbon capture and storage but also encourage consumers to change their habits.

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to triple its onshore wind power capacity by 2030 and multiply by five its solar power generation, enabling it to boost the share of renewables in its energy mix to 40 percent, according to the energy plan presented on Tuesday. French President Emmanuel Macron said the government would increase spending on renewables development to 8 billion euros  ($9.05 billion) annually from 5 billion to take total spending to 71 billion euros between 2019 to 2028. Nuclear-dependent France has lagged behind other European nations with only around 20 percent of electricity consumption coming from renewables. “By 2030, the production of the onshore wind farm will be tripled and the amount of energy produced from solar photovoltaic multiplied by five,” Macron said in a televised speech. France is on track to meet its target of 15 Gigawatt of installed wind power capacity by the end of the year, but installation of solar panels would likely fall short of the 10.2 GW target by the end of the year. Macron said the government would make sure power prices from renewables projects are kept low for consumers while developing more power interconnectors with European neighbors so as to always benefit from the least-cost power. To keep a check on power prices, the government also plans to reform France’s ARENH market mechanism which allows alternative power suppliers to buy up to 100 terrawatt hour (TWh) of power produced by French nuclear reactors every year at a fixed price of 42 euros/MWh. The mechanism, which allows French consumers to have one of the lowest electricity prices in Europe, is expected to end in 2025, Macron said. “It is indispensable that French people continue to benefit from it so long as the nuclear reactors are functioning,” he added.

2018-11-27,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Iran’s nuclear chief said on Tuesday he was warning the European Union’s top diplomat that Iranian patience was running out on the bloc’s pledges to keep up oil trade despite U.S. sanctions. Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said the Islamic Republic could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity - seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants - if it fails to see the economic benefit of the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear programme. “If we cannot sell our oil and we don’t enjoy financial transactions, then I don’t think keeping the deal will benefit us anymore,” Salehi told Reuters ahead of a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels. “I will pass certainly a word of caution to her (Mogherini): I think the period of patience for our people is getting more limited and limited. We are running out of the assumed timeline, which was in terms of months.” Following the meeting, Mogherini said she and Salehi remained committed to safeguarding the nuclear accord. “They equally expressed their determination to preserve the nuclear agreement as a matter of respecting international agreements and a key pillar for European and regional security,” Mogherini’s office said in a statement. It said Mogherini also repeated the EU stance “on issues of concern such as Iran’s role in the region” - alluding to Iranian involvement in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria. Under the 2015 deal with world powers, Iran restricted its enrichment programme, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May, arguing it was weak because it did not halt Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad, and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil export sector earlier this month. But Europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security. The EU and other remaining parties - China and Russia - have struggled to preserve trade incentives for Iran to respect the deal’s nuclear limits under U.S. pressure. In Brussels for talks on civilian nuclear cooperation that EU officials intended as a signal support for the accord, Salehi said the bloc’s efforts were encouraging but added: “We have not yet seen any tangible results.” He welcomed an EU plan to establish a special financial vehicle for non-dollar trade with Iran but only if it could preserve Iranian oil exports - Tehran’s economic lifeline. “It (the SPV) could be helpful in keeping the deal alive,” he said. “If there is nothing to reap, then what is the purpose of us staying in because voices in Iran are day by day becoming more against the deal.” Iran’s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. However, output is expected to recover somewhat from December thanks to U.S. waivers, including for two EU nations - Greece and Italy. Under the 2015 deal, Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile. Salehi reiterated warnings that Iran has the technical capacity to ramp up enrichment if the deal unravels. “It is very easy for us to go back to what we were before - even to a better position. We can start the 20 percent enrichment activity. We can increase the amount of enriched uranium.” Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to run civilian nuclear power stations, though still well short of highly enriched, or 80 to 90 percent, purity needed for a nuclear bomb.

2018-11-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin plans to appeal a London court decision to block him from buying shares in mining company Norilsk Nickel (GMKN.MM) from fellow investor Roman Abramovich, representatives at Potanin’s investment firm said on Tuesday. The ruling, taken in June, was considered to be advantageous for Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controls aluminum giant Rusal (0486.HK), and has long been at loggerheads with Potanin over control of Norilsk Nickel. He wanted to stop Abramovich, owner of England’s Chelsea soccer club, from selling shares in the company to Potanin, saying that would violate a 2012 shareholder agreement. Representatives of Interros, which manages Potanin’s assets, said they had filed a request together with Abramovich’s investment vehicle Crispian, to be allowed to appeal the decision. “Today the judge satisfied our request,” Interros said.  “Within 21 days after receipt of the court decision we have to submit our appeal to London’s Court of Appeal.”   Rusal, which holds a 27.8 percent stake in Nornickel, declined to comment. A representative for Abramovich did not respond to requests for comment.         In September, Potanin returned a 2 percent stake in Nornickel to Abramovich and his partners, that he had previously bought from them for about $800 million - a move which had increased his holding in the miner to 32.9 percent.    He had previously promised to return the stake to Abramovich if the London court ruled against the deal. Deripaska and Potanin have battled over control of Nornickel ever since Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer outside China, bought a stake in the miner just before the 2008 global financial crash. Abramovich stepped in as a “white knight” minority shareholder in 2012 to act as a buffer between Potanin and Deripaska. The long-running conflict was overshadowed in April this year by U.S. sanctions imposed against Deripaska and some of his companies, including Rusal.  Nornickel competes with Brazil’s Vale (VALE3.SA) for the rank of the world’s top nickel producer and is also the world’s largest palladium producer.

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - France is considering restructuring state-owned utility EDF and plans a steady reduction to the country’s reliance on nuclear power, the government said on Tuesday. In a long-awaited speech on energy strategy, President Emmanuel Macron said France would reduce the share of nuclear in the power mix to 50 percent by 2035, down from 75 percent today, rather than the total phasing out planned by neighbour Germany. The fate of EDF, long a symbol of French industrial might and a world leader in nuclear technology, is a politically sensitive issue in France. It has already led to the resignation of Macron’s former ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot, who accused the president of dragging his feet on nuclear power.  “I was not elected on a promise to exit nuclear power but to reduce the share of nuclear in our energy mix to 50 percent,” Macron said in an hour-long address, adding that 14 of EDF’s 58 nuclear reactors would be closed by 2035. EDF shares fell up to 4 percent on news of the plans, which a source close to the president’s office said could involve the state increasing its stake in the company. By 1630 GMT the shares were down 0.25 percent.  Macron’s action plan is broadly in line with EDF’s desire not to close any reactors before 2029, besides the previously scheduled closure of Fessenheim’s two reactors near the German border. No further closures are planned before the end of Macron’s term in 2022 Another two will be shut down over 2027-28 and a further two could face closure as early as 2025-26 if there is no risk of jeopardising France’s power supply. In his election campaign, Macron promised to stick to the former Socialist government’s target of reducing the share of nuclear to 50 percent by 2025. But he rowed back on the pledge a few months after taking office, angering environmentalists. As France reduces its dependence on nuclear energy, EDF is wooing overseas markets with the EPR model of reactor it is building at Hinkley Point, Britain’s first new plant in decades.  Macron said the schedule for shutting down reactors would depend on the evolution of France’s energy mix, including the planned increase of renewable energy and the expansion of interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries.  “It is a pragmatic approach ... which takes into account security of supply,” he said.  An Elysee note on the long-term strategy said the closures would focus on the oldest reactors, including at the Tricastin, Bugey, Gravelines and Chinon plants. It also said that, to limit job losses, no sites would be closed completely.  Macron did not mention a possible EDF restructuring but the Elysee note said the state could raise its 83.7 percent stake. “The state will consider boosting its stake in the capital of the company in line with the challenges and risks linked to the nuclear activity,” the note said.  Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy told a news conference that EDF’s structure was not necessarily the most efficient in the long run.  “We want EDF to remain an integrated group. There could be a parent company and subsidiaries,” he said.  Financial markets have long speculated that EDF’s nuclear activities could be put into a separate legal structure and renationalised, which would allow the state to subsidise the business and make nuclear energy available to EDF as well as its competitors.  Several of EDF’s major business activities are already operating as separate legal units, such as power grid operators RTE and Enedis, as well as its renewable energy division.  Greenpeace said that Macron had fallen prey to corporate interests.      “For the umpteenth time, the government has caved in to the nuclear industry lobby,” said Alix Mazounie, head of Greenpeace France’s nuclear campaign.

2018-11-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Tuesday, weighed down by uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade war and signs of increased global crude production, but losses were limited by expectations that crude exporters would agree to cut output at an upcoming OPEC meeting. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell 27 cents to settle at $60.21 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 7 cents to settle at $51.56 a barrel. Prices fell to their lowest since October 2017 last week - Brent at $58.41 and WTI at $50.15.  Both crude benchmarks are down more than 30 percent since early October, depressed by an emerging supply overhang and widespread financial market weakness. Market participants looked ahead to a meeting of leaders of the Group of 20 nations (G20), the world’s biggest economies, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1, with the trade war between Washington and Beijing top of the agenda.  U.S. President Donald Trump is open to a trade deal with China but is prepared to hike tariffs on Chinese imports if there is no breakthrough on longstanding trade irritants during a Saturday night dinner with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday. The White House sees the dinner as an opportunity to “turn the page” on a trade war with China. But he said the White House has been disappointed so far in the Chinese response to trade issues. “The current tariffs have already hurt the global economy and the looming escalation only dampens the petroleum demand outlook further,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  The top three crude producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia, will be at the G20 Summit, raising expectations that oil policy will be discussed. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna to discuss output policy with some non-OPEC producers, including Russia.  Saudi Arabia raised oil production to a record high in November, an industry source said on Monday, pumping 11.1 million to 11.3 million barrels per day (bpd). But the kingdom has been pushing for a collective production cut and is discussing a proposal to curb output by OPEC and its allies by as much as 1.4 million bpd, sources close to the discussions told Reuters this month. Trump has pressured Saudi Arabia, OPEC’s de-facto leader, not to cut production. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA also hit a record high this month of 11.7 million bpd, with stockpiles rising for nine straight weeks.  U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.5 million barrels last week to 442.7 million, industry group the American Petroleum Institute said late Tuesday, more than analysts’ forecasts for an increase of 769,000 barrels. If government data on Wednesday confirms that crude stockpiles increased, it would be the tenth consecutive build.

2018-11-27,"SYDNEY, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Torrential rain triggered flash flooding that turned streets into rivers in Sydney, Australia’s biggest city, on Wednesday, causing major disruptions to the morning commute. A spokesman for Ausgrid, the nation’s biggest electricity network, said the storm had so far left 8,100 homes without power around Sydney and the central coast. There was chaos on the roads, with at least five stranded motorists needing to be plucked from rising floodwaters, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. “The storm is pretty intense in and around the airport,” a Sydney airport spokesperson said. “We are operating from a single runway so that means that there are delays and likely some flights will be cancelled.” The central Sydney area had received 90 millimeters of rain, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, and state emergency services received dozens of calls for help. A series of storms was forecast to last through most of the day and ease in the evening, with strong winds continuing.

2018-11-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street logged modest gains on Tuesday as traders remained hopeful that the United States and China can work toward resolving their trade-related differences at the upcoming G20 Summit. Oil prices remained weak, while the U.S. dollar, which has benefited from safe-haven flows this year amid increased uncertainty over global trade, rose against its peers. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump will have a dinner meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the upcoming G20 gathering in Argentina and held open the possibility that the two countries would reach a trade deal.     All three major U.S. indexes finished positive after spending much of the session in negative territory, as Kudlow said there is an opportunity to “turn the page” on a trade war with China. His remarks followed Trump’s comments on Monday, when he said he expected to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from the current 10 percent and repeated his threat to impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China. “People want to believe that something good is going to come from the G20” meeting, said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York.  “(But) the longer it takes, the more concern the market feels that this is never going to happen, or it’s just more rhetoric and people start to lose faith.” U.S. stock options traders are braced for a surge in volatility around the G20 summit. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 108.49 points, or 0.44 percent, to end at 24,748.73, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 8.75 points, or 0.33 percent, to close at 2,682.2 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 0.85 points, or 0.01 percent, to finish at 7,082.70.     European markets opened subdued, but dipped as trading progressed. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  lost 0.26 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUSgained 1.17 percent. Trade-related worries lifted the greenback. The dollar index .DXY, which tracks the U.S. dollar versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was up 0.3 percent at 97.369. “Donald Trump’s renewed tariff threats against China have magnetized investors to the U.S. dollar,” Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM, said in a note. The Federal Reserve should be even more attentive to new economic data as its gradual interest-rate hikes edge it ever closer to a neutral stance, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Tuesday. Investors will now turn their attention to a speech on Wednesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and minutes from the central bank’s Nov. 7-8 meeting, to be released on Thursday, for further clues of how many more times the Fed is likely to raise interest rates. Sterling slumped against the dollar and the euro as doubts grew about whether British Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit agreement through a divided Parliament.  Treasury yields fell on Tuesday afternoon after $40 billion of new five-year notes were sold to strong demand and on resurgent worries about U.S.-China trade tensions. The benchmark 10-year government note yield US10YT=RR was down 1.5 basis points from Monday’s close, last at 3.06 percent. In commodity markets, oil prices dipped, weighed down by uncertainty over the U.S.-China trade war and signs of increased global crude production. But losses were limited by expectations that crude exporters would agree to cut output at an upcoming OPEC meeting.

2018-11-27,"BOSTON (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley adviser was sentenced to five years in prison on Tuesday after he admitted that he misused client funds to invest in a wind farm project and to cover his own personal expenses, including college tuition for his children. James Polese, 52, was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Mark Wolf in Boston, who said he could not understand how the investment adviser could be “so greedy and stupid” by carrying out the fraud when he was already financially successful. “It wasn’t just wrong,” Wolf said. “It was dumb, and it inflicted harm on the people you cared about.” The proceedings came after a former employee of the New York-based financial services firm who worked under Polese, Cornelius Peterson, was sentenced in June to 20 months in prison for participating in the scheme. Polese, who pleaded guilty in April to investment adviser fraud and bank fraud charges, in court apologized to his victims and Morgan Stanley, which employed him as a Boston-based adviser. “I’m sorry for tarnishing their name through my actions,” he said. In addition to prison, Wolf also ordered Polese to pay a $30,000 fine and $462,000 in restitution jointly with Peterson.  According to court papers, in 2014, Polese and Peterson transferred $100,000 from a Morgan Stanley client’s account without his permission to invest in a private equity fund created to support a wind farm project. Prosecutors said Peterson was on the fund’s board of directors, and Polese had himself invested money in the wind farm project, which needed additional funding. Both men later in 2015 used $400,000 from the account of an elderly Morgan Stanley client, Ralph Bates, to back a letter of credit in support of the project, causing him to incur $12,000 in fees, prosecutors said. Without Bates’ approval, in 2016 they also transferred $350,000 from his account, which was used for a real estate investment and to pay for Polese’s personal expenses, according to court papers. Polese also in 2017 used more than $93,000 from Bates’ account to make college tuition payments for two of his children and to pay his own credit card bills, prosecutors said. Bates, an 87-year-old philanthropist, said in court on Tuesday that Polese had “ripped me off for big bucks. “I’m at a loss for words,” he said. Morgan Stanley fired Polese and Peterson in June 2017 and has said it terminated them immediately after uncovering their misconduct. The case is U.S. v. Polese, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 18-cr-10028.

2018-11-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global oil markets are nervously eyeing OPEC’s upcoming meeting for clarity on future supply as the dust settles after a full-fledged rout in crude markets over the last several weeks.  So far, there is no clear view if production will be cut or remain steady, and that uncertainty raises the risk of more volatile trading after mass selling caused oil to drop by more than 30 percent in little over a month.  Participants generally expect OPEC will trim production at its Dec. 6 meeting by about 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), but there is enough uncertainty to make traders defensive. Speculators, once betting on $100-a-barrel oil, are now going the other direction, having boosted short positions in oil to their biggest in more than a year. The options market currently shows a record number of open positions in U.S. oil falling to $45 or $40 a barrel by the end of 2019, though bullish bets have also edged higher.   “Getting some resolution around the intent of the Saudis and OPEC ... would go a long way to helping the market feel better,” said Greg Sharenow, portfolio manager at PIMCO, who co-manages more than $15 billion in commodity assets.   He added that if OPEC does not reduce production, prices could tumble to $40 a barrel. The signals from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its leader, Saudi Arabia, have been mixed. Officials familiar with Saudi plans told Reuters they expect it to trim production, but an industry source also said Saudi oil output exceeded 11 mln bpd for the first time in November.  The cartel’s deliberations have been compounded by the growing influence of Russia, whose production has climbed to a post-Soviet era high, and by the United States, which is now producing at a record 11.7 million bpd. Russian oil executives and officials have been skeptical of the need to cut output. Meanwhile, the U.S. decision to reimpose sanctions on Iran, only to grant waivers to major importers of that nation’s oil, threw the market for a loop.  Macro-focused and commodity trading advisory funds (CTAs) had bet on a further rally ahead of renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran, but instead were caught wrong-footed after waivers were announced and U.S. production surged faster than expected. Wall Street banks looking to protect against exposure from selling options to oil producers intensified that selling, market sources said. Implied volatility, a gauge of options demand, soared, with U.S. crude CLATMIV implied volatility hitting its highest level since February 2016 last week.   The price swings hit funds hard. Among renowned oil bulls, the Andurand Capital Commodities Fund lost 4.1 percent for the month through Nov. 16, putting it down 15.7 percent for the year, according to HSBC data. Open interest in bearish bets on U.S. crude falling to $45 or $40 a barrel by the end of 2019 are at record levels CL450X9 CL400X9 but bets on U.S. oil rising to $80 a barrel by end-2019 are also high CL800L9, as some see the sell-off as having gone too far, too fast.  “As sharp as the falloff has been, I think the market is poised to have as sharp a comeback,” said Shawn Reynolds, portfolio manager of the VanEck Global Hard Assets Fund in New York. In recent weeks, both OPEC and the International Energy Agency cut their demand forecasts due to sagging fortunes in developing economies. The forward Brent futures LCOc1 curve - the market’s primary indicator of expectations for supply and demand - now signals a potential glut through mid-2019. CME Group’s OPEC Watch Tool, which uses option-market activity to predict the probability of OPEC’s decision, currently puts a 70 percent chance on a small OPEC production cut and a 30 percent chance of little to no change in output.        This uncertainty is in part due to U.S. President Donald Trump, whose decision not to punish the Saudis for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi has raised the possibility that the kingdom will be less inclined to cross Trump by cutting output dramatically. “President Trump’s tacit support of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (known as MbS) in the wake of the Khashoggi murder seems to have provided him with significant leverage over the Saudi leadership,” Capital Economics analysts said in a note.

2018-11-27,"PARIS/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Officials from the Group of 20 leading industrialized nations gathered in Argentina are making slow progress in drafting a final communique for this weekend’s leaders summit, amid disagreements over language on trade and climate change, delegates said.   Representatives from the G20 countries known as “sherpas” began meeting in Buenos Aires on Monday to start intensive discussions around the communique, a non-binding agreement on policy issues that is due to be unveiled at the conclusion of the two-day summit, which begins on Friday. G20 leaders have met each year since the 2008 global economic crisis to try to reach broad agreement on important  issues such as trade. But increasingly they have been bedeviled by disunity, and a failure to agree on a communique this year would underscore growing divisions at a time of heightened international trade disputes. “The talks are difficult but that is not a surprise,” a European source told Reuters on Tuesday. “Concerning the progress on the statement, the talks are still ongoing so it is difficult to predict the outcome.” A French finance ministry source added: “It’s true the situation is quite frankly rather tense. The outcome in the coming days is quite uncertain.” A second source at the finance ministry said U.S. officials were pushing back on any mention of the Paris Climate Agreement. After signalling its intention to withdraw from the accord last year, the United States broke with other G20 member countries that have pledged to end coal usage and take steps to reach goals outlined in the accord. The French are also pushing for the communique to reject protectionism and commit to reforming the World Trade Organization and the rules of global commerce, the second French source said.       An Asian delegate told Reuters there was no progress made on Monday after a half-day session. A delegate from Latin America, who also requested anonymity, said a definitive draft was not expected until Thursday.  “We are in full negotiation with the other delegations. The text will be known once the leaders approve it,” Argentina’s Pedro Villagra Delgado, the lead organizer or “sherpa” of the G20, told Reuters on Tuesday. Villagra Delgado had said on Nov. 15 that climate change, steel and migration had emerged as the “most complicated” areas of discussion, delaying final approval on the communique. Recent history suggests the sherpas will struggle to agree to reach consensus. Officials from countries attending a major Asia-Pacific summit earlier this month failed to approve a joint communique for the first time as the United States clashed with China over trade and security.  In May, U.S. President Donald Trump rejected a statement by fellow leaders of the G7 industrialized economies after a tense gathering ended in acrimony, again over tariffs and trade. Some sherpas have said this year’s G20 communique will likely be watered down to try to ensure approval from Trump, an avowed sceptic of man-made climate change who has adopted protectionist trade policies and a more isolationist foreign policy. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said on Tuesday it was unclear whether there would be a final communique. “If we didn’t get one, there’d be no tears shed,” he said.

2018-11-27,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has rejected requests from the corn lobby to reallocate biofuel volumes waived under its small refinery exemption programme into its 2019 mandate, an agency official told Reuters on Tuesday. The official also said the 2019 biofuel mandate figures, due to be released this week, would be largely in line with the agency’s June proposal of 19.88 billion gallons, which includes 15 billion gallons of convention biofuels like ethanol.  The powerful corn lobby and top officials in the U.S. Department of Agriculture have complained for months that the Trump administration’s expansion of the EPA refinery waiver programme threatens demand for crucial farm products like ethanol. Under the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard, oil refiners must blend increasing amounts of biofuels into their fuel each year or purchase blending credits from those that do. Small refineries can be exempted from the RFS if they prove that complying would cause them financial strain. “It is an issue of timing,” said the EPA official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. “The primary reason why we’re not reallocating in this rule is because we have no idea what the volume of SREs (Small Refinery Exemptions) will be for calendar 2019 and we won’t know that late 2019, early 2020. All we could do is guess, and we don’t do regulations by guessing here.” The refinery waiver programme is among the most controversial issues dividing the U.S. corn lobby and the oil industry. Since President Donald Trump’s election, the EPA has vastly expanded the number of waivers it has handed out to small refineries in a bid to reduce the refining industry’s regulatory compliance costs. The move has infuriated another key Trump constituency, the Farmbelt, which argues the programme erodes demand for biofuels. Under pressure, the EPA earlier this year began studying a potential overhaul in which biofuels blending obligations eliminated under the waiver programme would be reallocated, possibly in the following year, to other facilities, to ensure there was no net loss in overall blending volumes. “We would like to make everybody happy. It is not often the case we can,” the EPA official said. The EPA is set to formally announce its 2019 biofuels mandate volumes by Nov. 30.

2018-11-27,"(Adds quote from local mayor, number of vessels, production implications, Novatek trading strategy) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Yamal, one of the world’s largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals in Arctic Russia, is expected to export as much as 11.7 million tonnes of LNG in the next seven months through Norway, according to the port hosting its ship-to-ship operations and Reuters calculations. The ramp-up in output puts the Novatek terminal, in operation for less than a year, in excess of its nameplate capacity, with the Norwegian transfers the only way it can deliver the additional LNG to the market. Yamal uses Arctic-classed LNG tankers to carry the gas through the Barents Sea; these vessels then transfer the cargo to more conventional tankers in Europe, enabling them to return sooner to the facility and pick up more supplies. These transfers began in Honningsvag, Norway, last week, cutting the journey time to the previous transfer points in France, Belgium and the Netherlands by at least 2,000 kilometres and freeing up the Arctic tankers sooner. Now, the local mayor of the tiny port on the tip of Norway, says up to 160 transfers are expected until the end of June. “Between 150 and 160 transfers will take place in the port’s fjord from November to June,” local mayor Kristina Sigursdottir Hansen told Reuters. “Ships will be coming with gas from Russia, from Yamal ... More than 300 ships actually (will be involved).” The Arc7-classed Yamal tankers in operation carry about 160,000 cubic metres or 73,000 tonnes of LNG per load, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data, making the volume expected to be involved in the transfers at 11.7 million tonnes until June. That puts Yamal’s output in the first six months of 2019 at 10 million tonnes, on track to exceed the facilities’ nameplate capacity of 16.5 million tonnes a year. Novatek said last week its third train, or plant, has begun operations. It did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. The transfer operations in Norway come just as lower Asian LNG prices together with high shipping costs have closed an arbitrage with Asia and increased deliveries into Europe. A Novatek company source said earlier this month it expected these dynamics to continue until mid-2019. It has been in the market this month arranging cargo swaps between the Pacific and Atlantic basins to reduce its shipping costs to Asia, buying at least one cargo in the Pacific for December delivery. It was looking to arrange around three swap deals for this winter, according to the source. Norway’s Tschudi Shipping facilitates the ship-to-ship transfers, its chief executive Jon Edvard Sundnes said, confirming that there was a contract until June. He would not comment on the number of transfers. Jan Morten Hansen, regional director for the Norwegian Coastal Administration, said “that is what Tschudi told us”, when asked whether up to 160 transfers would take place. Four locations around Honningsvag can host the transfers and three operations are allowed to run simultaneously, he said. Additional reporting by Ekaterina Kravtsova; Writing by Sabina

2018-11-27,"BRUSSELS, Nov 27 (Reuters) - The European Union’s climate chief on Tuesday called on the bloc to aim for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, the most ambitious path in a long-term strategy due to be announced on Wednesday. With President Donald Trump pulling the United States out of international efforts to curb global warming, Miguel Arias Canete said the EU had to lead by example at the next round of United Nations talks on climate change opening in Katowice, Poland, on Sunday. The 2050 strategy to be presented by the EU executive on Wednesday sets out eight scenarios for the bloc’s 28 nations to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement - two of which chart of a course for the Europe to become climate neutral. “It’s worth becoming the first major economy to fully decarbonise, to fully reach net zero emissions,” Europe’s Climate Commissioner Arias Canete told Reuters on Tuesday. “It is absolutely possible. For sure, it will require lots of investment. It will require lots of effort, but it is doable.” Under a package of climate legislation passed since the 2015 Paris accord from energy efficiency to renewable targets and curbs on transport pollution, the EU is on track to overshoot its pledge to reduce emissions by 40 percent from 1990 levels by 2030. The bloc currently is set to reduce emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and 60 percent by 2050. “The message of the Commission is: ‘That’s okay, but we need to do more,” Arias Canete said. “The thing is, do you want to be a front mover, or a follower?” The U.N. talks are the most important since the Paris Agreement, with delegates from 195 nations set to haggle over the details and produce a “rule book” for the pact, which the United States has announced it will quit. By publishing its ambitious strategy on Wednesday, EU official hope to pull more weight at what are expected to be tough talks amid division among world powers. “It will not be an easy COP but the European Union arrives with lots of credibility to these talks and we can show the rest of the world, developed and developing, that we take climate policy very seriously,” Arias Canete said. “The role of the United States is less relevant and that puts more burden on our shoulders because we have to occupy territory that in the past was occupied by Americans.” While Trump on Monday rejected projections that global warming will cause severe economic harm, a U.N. report detailing the dangers has spurred ministers from 10 EU nations to call for greenhouse gas emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. Calls for more ambition, however, have divided the EU. Many nations, including economic powerhouse Germany, are struggling to meet their targets are worried that tougher cuts would threaten industry. EU national governments have until the end of 2019 to draft their own plans for reducing energy usage to keep in line with the bloc’s goals. To respond to the U.N. report and achieve net negative emissions, Arias Canete said the bloc’s economies will have to invest more in carbon capture and storage but also encourage consumers to change their habits.

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to triple its onshore wind power capacity by 2030 and multiply by five its solar power generation, enabling it to boost the share of renewables in its energy mix to 40 percent, according to the energy plan presented on Tuesday. French President Emmanuel Macron said the government would increase spending on renewables development to 8 billion euros  ($9.05 billion) annually from 5 billion to take total spending to 71 billion euros between 2019 to 2028. Nuclear-dependent France has lagged behind other European nations with only around 20 percent of electricity consumption coming from renewables. “By 2030, the production of the onshore wind farm will be tripled and the amount of energy produced from solar photovoltaic multiplied by five,” Macron said in a televised speech. France is on track to meet its target of 15 Gigawatt of installed wind power capacity by the end of the year, but installation of solar panels would likely fall short of the 10.2 GW target by the end of the year. Macron said the government would make sure power prices from renewables projects are kept low for consumers while developing more power interconnectors with European neighbors so as to always benefit from the least-cost power. To keep a check on power prices, the government also plans to reform France’s ARENH market mechanism which allows alternative power suppliers to buy up to 100 terrawatt hour (TWh) of power produced by French nuclear reactors every year at a fixed price of 42 euros/MWh. The mechanism, which allows French consumers to have one of the lowest electricity prices in Europe, is expected to end in 2025, Macron said. “It is indispensable that French people continue to benefit from it so long as the nuclear reactors are functioning,” he added.

2018-11-27,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Iran’s nuclear chief said on Tuesday he was warning the European Union’s top diplomat that Iranian patience was running out on the bloc’s pledges to keep up oil trade despite U.S. sanctions. Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, said the Islamic Republic could resume enriching uranium to 20 percent purity - seen as well above the level suitable for fuelling civilian power plants - if it fails to see the economic benefit of the 2015 deal that curbed its nuclear programme. “If we cannot sell our oil and we don’t enjoy financial transactions, then I don’t think keeping the deal will benefit us anymore,” Salehi told Reuters ahead of a meeting with EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini in Brussels. “I will pass certainly a word of caution to her (Mogherini): I think the period of patience for our people is getting more limited and limited. We are running out of the assumed timeline, which was in terms of months.” Following the meeting, Mogherini said she and Salehi remained committed to safeguarding the nuclear accord. “They equally expressed their determination to preserve the nuclear agreement as a matter of respecting international agreements and a key pillar for European and regional security,” Mogherini’s office said in a statement. It said Mogherini also repeated the EU stance “on issues of concern such as Iran’s role in the region” - alluding to Iranian involvement in Middle East conflicts from Yemen to Syria. Under the 2015 deal with world powers, Iran restricted its enrichment programme, widely seen in the West as a disguised effort to develop the means to make atomic bombs, in exchange for an end to international sanctions. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the accord in May, arguing it was weak because it did not halt Iran’s development of ballistic missiles or support for armed proxies abroad, and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s vital oil export sector earlier this month. But Europe sees the nuclear deal as an important element of international security. The EU and other remaining parties - China and Russia - have struggled to preserve trade incentives for Iran to respect the deal’s nuclear limits under U.S. pressure. In Brussels for talks on civilian nuclear cooperation that EU officials intended as a signal support for the accord, Salehi said the bloc’s efforts were encouraging but added: “We have not yet seen any tangible results.” He welcomed an EU plan to establish a special financial vehicle for non-dollar trade with Iran but only if it could preserve Iranian oil exports - Tehran’s economic lifeline. “It (the SPV) could be helpful in keeping the deal alive,” he said. “If there is nothing to reap, then what is the purpose of us staying in because voices in Iran are day by day becoming more against the deal.” Iran’s oil exports are expected to drop sharply to about 1 million bpd in November from a peak of 2.8 million bpd earlier this year. However, output is expected to recover somewhat from December thanks to U.S. waivers, including for two EU nations - Greece and Italy. Under the 2015 deal, Iran stopped producing 20 percent enriched uranium and gave up the majority of its stockpile. Salehi reiterated warnings that Iran has the technical capacity to ramp up enrichment if the deal unravels. “It is very easy for us to go back to what we were before - even to a better position. We can start the 20 percent enrichment activity. We can increase the amount of enriched uranium.” Uranium refined to 20 percent fissile purity is well beyond the 5 percent normally required to run civilian nuclear power stations, though still well short of highly enriched, or 80 to 90 percent, purity needed for a nuclear bomb.

2018-11-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin plans to appeal a London court decision to block him from buying shares in mining company Norilsk Nickel (GMKN.MM) from fellow investor Roman Abramovich, representatives at Potanin’s investment firm said on Tuesday. The ruling, taken in June, was considered to be advantageous for Russian tycoon Oleg Deripaska, who controls aluminum giant Rusal (0486.HK), and has long been at loggerheads with Potanin over control of Norilsk Nickel. He wanted to stop Abramovich, owner of England’s Chelsea soccer club, from selling shares in the company to Potanin, saying that would violate a 2012 shareholder agreement. Representatives of Interros, which manages Potanin’s assets, said they had filed a request together with Abramovich’s investment vehicle Crispian, to be allowed to appeal the decision. “Today the judge satisfied our request,” Interros said.  “Within 21 days after receipt of the court decision we have to submit our appeal to London’s Court of Appeal.”   Rusal, which holds a 27.8 percent stake in Nornickel, declined to comment. A representative for Abramovich did not respond to requests for comment.         In September, Potanin returned a 2 percent stake in Nornickel to Abramovich and his partners, that he had previously bought from them for about $800 million - a move which had increased his holding in the miner to 32.9 percent.    He had previously promised to return the stake to Abramovich if the London court ruled against the deal. Deripaska and Potanin have battled over control of Nornickel ever since Rusal, the world’s largest aluminum producer outside China, bought a stake in the miner just before the 2008 global financial crash. Abramovich stepped in as a “white knight” minority shareholder in 2012 to act as a buffer between Potanin and Deripaska. The long-running conflict was overshadowed in April this year by U.S. sanctions imposed against Deripaska and some of his companies, including Rusal.  Nornickel competes with Brazil’s Vale (VALE3.SA) for the rank of the world’s top nickel producer and is also the world’s largest palladium producer.

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - France is considering restructuring state-owned utility EDF and plans a steady reduction to the country’s reliance on nuclear power, the government said on Tuesday. In a long-awaited speech on energy strategy, President Emmanuel Macron said France would reduce the share of nuclear in the power mix to 50 percent by 2035, down from 75 percent today, rather than the total phasing out planned by neighbour Germany. The fate of EDF, long a symbol of French industrial might and a world leader in nuclear technology, is a politically sensitive issue in France. It has already led to the resignation of Macron’s former ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot, who accused the president of dragging his feet on nuclear power.  “I was not elected on a promise to exit nuclear power but to reduce the share of nuclear in our energy mix to 50 percent,” Macron said in an hour-long address, adding that 14 of EDF’s 58 nuclear reactors would be closed by 2035. EDF shares fell up to 4 percent on news of the plans, which a source close to the president’s office said could involve the state increasing its stake in the company. By 1630 GMT the shares were down 0.25 percent.  Macron’s action plan is broadly in line with EDF’s desire not to close any reactors before 2029, besides the previously scheduled closure of Fessenheim’s two reactors near the German border. No further closures are planned before the end of Macron’s term in 2022 Another two will be shut down over 2027-28 and a further two could face closure as early as 2025-26 if there is no risk of jeopardising France’s power supply. In his election campaign, Macron promised to stick to the former Socialist government’s target of reducing the share of nuclear to 50 percent by 2025. But he rowed back on the pledge a few months after taking office, angering environmentalists. As France reduces its dependence on nuclear energy, EDF is wooing overseas markets with the EPR model of reactor it is building at Hinkley Point, Britain’s first new plant in decades.  Macron said the schedule for shutting down reactors would depend on the evolution of France’s energy mix, including the planned increase of renewable energy and the expansion of interconnection capacity with neighbouring countries.  “It is a pragmatic approach ... which takes into account security of supply,” he said.  An Elysee note on the long-term strategy said the closures would focus on the oldest reactors, including at the Tricastin, Bugey, Gravelines and Chinon plants. It also said that, to limit job losses, no sites would be closed completely.  Macron did not mention a possible EDF restructuring but the Elysee note said the state could raise its 83.7 percent stake. “The state will consider boosting its stake in the capital of the company in line with the challenges and risks linked to the nuclear activity,” the note said.  Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy told a news conference that EDF’s structure was not necessarily the most efficient in the long run.  “We want EDF to remain an integrated group. There could be a parent company and subsidiaries,” he said.  Financial markets have long speculated that EDF’s nuclear activities could be put into a separate legal structure and renationalised, which would allow the state to subsidise the business and make nuclear energy available to EDF as well as its competitors.  Several of EDF’s major business activities are already operating as separate legal units, such as power grid operators RTE and Enedis, as well as its renewable energy division.  Greenpeace said that Macron had fallen prey to corporate interests.      “For the umpteenth time, the government has caved in to the nuclear industry lobby,” said Alix Mazounie, head of Greenpeace France’s nuclear campaign.

2018-11-27,"(Adds analyst comment, information on the Sunrise oil pipeline) Nov 27 (Reuters) - Next-day natural gas prices for Tuesday at the Waha hub in the Permian basin in Texas tumbled almost 80 percent to their lowest on record because of limits on the amount of gas that can move out of the region by pipeline. Prices at the Waha hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL fell to an average of 25 cents per million British thermal units (mmBtu), according to SNL data available on the Refinitiv Eikon going back to 1991. Traders said small amounts of fuel were even sold at negative prices as producers struggled to get rid of the gas. That compares with an average of $2.16 per mmBtu so far this year, $2.71 in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of $3.11. The Permian is the biggest oil-producing shale basin in the United States and since gas is associated with much of the oil comes out of the ground, it is also the nation’s second-biggest shale gas producing region, behind the Appalachian. Permian drillers want the oil, which is much more valuable than gas. In some cases the lack of infrastructure to remove gas from the region has forced some producers to burn or flare off some of the gas they pull out of the ground. The cause of the price collapse was “very likely driven, in our view by continued associated gas production growth poured into a region that won’t see new greenfield pipeline capacity for at least 10 months,” analysts at RBN Energy said in a report on Tuesday, noting “we are about to enter a period of complete exhaustion of Permian gas takeaway.” RBN said that increase in associated gas production was due in part to the expansion of Plains All American Pipeline LP’s Sunrise oil pipeline, which enabled oil trapped in the Permian to flow to the Gulf Coast. Several energy companies are building or developing new pipelines to enable more gas to flow out of the Permian region, including Oneok Inc’s WesTex and Roadrunner projects, Kinder Morgan Inc’s Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway projects and NAmerico Energy Holdings LLC’s Pecos Trail. Drillers will, however, have to wait until 2019 and beyond for those projects to enter service. As the number of rigs seeking oil in the Permian rose this year to the highest since 2015, the amount of oil and associated gas produced has increased to record highs, constraining the region’s existing gas and oil pipelines. Those gas constraints have boosted the discount Waha trades at below the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana NG-W-HH-SNL. That spread rose to $4.03 per mmBtu for Tuesday, its widest since September 2005, according to SNL data. That compares with an average discount of 90 cents so far in 2018, 27 cents in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of 14 cents. Reporting by Scott DiSavino; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and

2018-11-27,"* Trump says expects to move ahead on China tariffs * Dollar gains as Fed’s Clarida backs further rate hikes * Oil prices steady near year lows (Adds Wall Street open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Global stock markets edged lower on Tuesday, as the previous session’s strong rally ran out of steam after U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to quash hopes of a trade truce with China at the upcoming G20 Summit. Oil prices steadied, while the U.S. dollar, which has benefited from safe-haven flows this year as the trade conflict worsened, rose against peers. On Monday, Trump said he expected to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from the current 10 percent and repeated his threat to impose tariffs on all remaining imports from China. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires this week. “The market remains in a fragile state and because of that, anytime tariffs come into the picture you have worries,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York. Apple Inc was down 0.90 percent after Trump said tariffs could also be placed on laptops and iPhones imported from China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 148.28 points, or 0.6 percent, to 24,491.96, the S&P 500 lost 8.26 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,665.19 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 21.29 points, or 0.3 percent, to 7,060.56. European markets opened subdued, but dipped as trading progressed. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.63 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.31 percent. Trade-related worries lifted the greenback and the dollar index, which tracks the U.S. dollar versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies, was up 0.21 percent at 97.281. “Donald Trump’s renewed tariff threats against China have magnetized investors to the U.S. Dollar,” Lukman Otunuga, a research analyst at broker FXTM, said in a note. The Federal Reserve should be even more attentive to new economic data as its gradual interest-rate hikes edge it ever closer to a neutral stance, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Richard Clarida said on Tuesday. Investors will now turn their attention to a speech on Wednesday by Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and minutes from the central bank’s Nov. 7-8 meeting to be released on Thursday, for further clues of how many more times the Fed is likely to raise interest rates. Sterling was weaker across the board after Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult. Treasury yields fell less than a basis point amid renewed focus on trade tensions. The benchmark 10-year government yield was down a basis point from Monday’s close, last at 3.06 percent. In commodity markets, oil prices steadied, depressed by record Saudi production but supported by expectations that oil exporters would agree to cut output at an OPEC meeting next week. Brent crude oil was up 42 cents a barrel at $60.9 by 1545 GMT, not far above a 13-month low of $58.41 reached on Friday. U.S. light crude was up 33 cents at $51.96. Oil prices are down by almost a third since early October, weighed down by an emerging supply overhang and widespread financial market weakness. The stronger dollar weighed on gold, and spot gold slipped 0.56 percent to $1,215.45, a more than one-week low. Reporting by Saqib Iqbal Ahmed; additional reporting by Amy

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2030 could be between 13 billion and 15 billion tonnes more than the level needed to keep global warming within 2 degrees Celsius this century, a United Nations report estimated on Tuesday. The ninth annual U.N. Environment Programme (UNEP) report analyzed the impact of countries’ emissions cut targets and policies, and whether they are enough to limit global average temperature rise to a safer threshold below 2C. The assessment comes a few days before a U.N. climate conference starts in Poland from Dec. 2-14. The talks will produce a “rule book” on how to implement the 2015 Paris Agreement which aims limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. UNEP said annual greenhouse gas emissions reached a record high of 53.5 billion tonnes in 2017 after three years of decreases. They are not seen peaking by 2030, let alone by 2020. However, emissions in 2030 will need to be around 25 percent and 55 percent lower than last year to put the world on track to limit global warming to 2 degrees and 1.5 degrees Celsius respectively, the report said. “Increased emissions and lagging action means the gap figure for this year’s report is larger than ever,” the report said. Current climate policies are seen lowering emissions by up to 6 billion tonnes by 2030, implying global warming of around 3C by 2100, with warming continuing afterwards. “If the emissions gap is not closed by 2030, it is very plausible that the goal of a well below 2C temperature rise increase is also out of reach,” the report said. To keep warming below 2C, countries must triple their current efforts. For the more ambitious target of 1.5C, countries must raise ambitions by five times. Currently, the world’s 20 biggest economies, the G20, are collectively not on track to meet their 2030 pledges, UNEP said. Analysis and review of progress against pledges from countries to reduce their emissions under the Paris Agreement, so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), showed they were insufficient. Added impetus came last month in a report by the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) which said that keeping the Earth’s temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require rapid and unprecedented changes. “If the IPCC report represented a global fire alarm, this report is the arson investigation,” UNEP deputy executive director Joyce Msuya said in a statement.  “The science is clear; for all the ambitious climate action we have seen – governments need to move faster and with greater urgency. We are feeding this fire while the means to extinguish it are within reach,” he added. Institutions such as city, state and regional governments; companies; investors; higher education and civil society organizations are increasingly committing to climate action and are an important element in achieving global emissions goals. Although estimates on the emissions reduction potential vary, some 19 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) could be reduced by their actions by 2030. This would be enough to close the 2C gap, the report said.

2018-11-27,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s oil industry has no plans to demand the release of more oil products from national reserves to help areas affected by tight supply, an industry body said on Tuesday. The Economy Ministry last month authorised the release of products after logistics hiccups caused by months of low river water levels left some regions short of replacement supplies of gasoline, diesel and jet fuels. “There is currently no further request (directed at the ministry) by MWV related to the release of reserve volumes,” a spokesman for the Berlin-based Mineraloelwirtschaftsverband (MWV). “It is not ruled out there could be a further request but at the moment, it is not the case,” he added. The supply situation was still tight but had stabilised somewhat, he said. He also said that as of Nov. 22, the state of North-Rhine Westphalia had lifted a ban on tanker trucks travelling on Sundays, to help ease shortfalls at petrol stations. With river barges on key routes such as the Rhine not sailing fully or not at all, some filling stations had trouble restocking. The ban has been lifted until May 31, 2019.

2018-11-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he understood the anger felt by voters outside France’s big cities over the squeeze that fuel prices have put on households, but insisted he would not be bounced into changing policy by “thugs”. For over a week, “yellow vest” protesters have blocked roads across France and impeded access to some fuel depots, shopping centres and factories in protest against fuel tax hikes they say have eroded their spending power. The unrest, including violent skirmishes stirred by fringe groups in Paris over the weekend, has stung Macron as he tries to fight back against a sharp fall in popularity and exposed him to charges of being out of touch with voters. A little over 18 months into his presidency, it has raised questions about whether the 40-year-old former investment banker has misjudged his ability to overhaul France and its economy. “We must not change course, because the policy direction is right and necessary,” Macron said in an hour-long address outlining his blueprint for a transition towards cleaner energy. Striving to show both humility and empathy with anger among provincial voters, he said his administration needed to be smarter in its policymaking to avoid the emergence of a “two-speed France” where workers living outside cities were left behind and grew more frustrated with a perceived urban elite. The crisis, though, illustrated a “paradox” in a country that cherishes its generous welfare state and was becoming less inclined to pay for it through taxes, he said. “You cannot chant in the same slogan: ‘cut taxes and build more crèches, schools’,” Macron said. Two people have been killed and more than 600 injured during the 11 days of ‘yellow vest’ protests across France. Macron has warned that the violence which turned some Parisian boulevards into battlefields on Saturday risked unnerving foreigners, though he acknowledged on Tuesday that many protesters held legitimate grievances. “I will not confuse citizens and their demands with thugs,” Macron said. “I will not cede any ground to those who want to destroy and create disorder,” Macron said.  But he conceded the increase in diesel tax, which kicked in just as pump prices were rising, had inflicted more pain than anticipated. He sought to dampen the anger of protesters, dubbed “yellow vests” because of the high-vis jackets they wear at their barricades, with a proposal to review fuel tax rates quarterly to take into account global oil prices.  Protesters manning the roadblocks and the president’s political opponents were unimpressed with Macron’s overtures, even after the president said his ecology minister would meet representatives of their protest movement later in the day. “We’re all fed up,” one protester told BFM TV. “He’s not listening to us. Our anger is real.”  Far-right leader Marine Le Pen lambasted the speech as “devoid of any solutions”, while the Socialist Party leader Oliver Faure said Macron had turned a deaf ear to voters’ complaints. Conservative lawmaker Damien Abad said Macron’s remarks underlined the reality gap between the Elysee Palace and the rest of France.  “This was a technocrat’s speech, disconnected from the reality of French and not touching on their worries, including those of the ‘yellow vests’,” he said in a television interview.

2018-11-27,"BARCELONA, Nov 27 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Investment to tackle climate change is increasing around the world but remains far too low to limit global warming and avoid its most harmful consequences, as governments have committed to do, analysts said on Tuesday. A report from the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI), an international think tank, said initial estimates for global flows of climate finance in 2017 ranged from about $510 billion to $530 billion, a 12 to 16 percent increase from 2016. Updated figures for 2015 and 2016, based on new data becoming available, showed an annual average flow of $463 billion, which was 27 percent higher than in 2013-2014. CPI said the early figures for 2017 reflected rising investment in electric vehicles and funding from development banks. Renewable energy investment held steady after dropping 16 percent in 2016 on falling costs and fewer projects. But climate finance is still only a small share of what will be needed to decarbonise economies in the coming decades, as governments vowed to do in the 2015 Paris Agreement, it noted. Governments will meet in Poland Dec. 2-14 to work out rules for putting that accord into practice. “Unfortunately, we still have far to go,” said Barbara Buchner, CPI’s executive director for climate finance. “Leaders need to urgently continue and ramp up the progress toward the economy-wide transition needed to address climate change,” she added in a statement. The CPI report noted the particularly sparse resources allocated for adapting to wilder weather and rising seas as the planet heats up. Total adaptation finance – all from government sources – was only $22 billion per year in 2015-2016, it said. With the world already struggling with more destructive wildfires, storms, droughts and floods, that spending is “extremely low compared to the need”, which UN Environment has estimated at $56 billion-$73 billion per year. Private-sector investment in adaptation is hard to track, but if included the overall amount for adaptation could be much higher, the CPI report noted. Lead author Padraig Oliver said corporations and investors were under growing pressure to manage climate change risks. “The impacts are happening now, and it is an issue that is far more front and centre for businesses and their bottom line than three to four years ago,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Ahead of the annual U.N. climate conference, U.N. figures published last Friday showed rich countries were on track to meet a goal of raising $100 billion a year by 2020 to help poor nations go green and cope with climate shifts, analysts said. That report said total climate finance increased 17 percent between 2013-2014 and 2015-2016, reaching $681 billion in 2016. The CPI figures feed into the U.N. assessment, but do not include International Energy Agency estimates of investment in energy efficiency, which is why they are lower, Oliver said. The CPI report highlighted a jump in investment in electric vehicles around the world. Between 2011 and 2017, that rose 54 percent each year, on average, to reach $43 billion in 2017. Policies to promote sustainable transport are propelling investment, and it will likely continue rising, Oliver said. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Laurie Goering.

2018-11-27,"Nov 27 (Reuters) - Next-day natural gas prices for Tuesday at the Waha hub in the Permian basin in Texas tumbled almost 80 percent to their lowest on record because of limits on the amount of gas that can move out of the region by pipeline. Prices at the Waha hub NG-WAH-WTX-SNL fell to an average of 25 cents per million British thermal units (mmBtu), according to SNL data available on the Refinitiv Eikon going back to 1991. Traders said small amounts of fuel were even sold at negative prices as producers struggled to get rid of the gas. That compares with an average of $2.16/mmBtu so far this year, $2.71 in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of $3.11. The Permian is the biggest oil producing shale basin in the United States and since gas is associated with much of the oil comes out of the ground, it is also the nation’s second biggest shale gas producing region, behind the Appalachian. Permian drillers want the oil, which is much more valuable than gas. In some cases the lack of infrastructure to remove gas from the region has forced some producers to burn or flare off some of the gas they pull out of the ground. Several energy companies are building or developing new pipelines to enable more gas to flow out of the Permian region including Oneok Inc’s WesTex and Roadrunner projects, Kinder Morgan Inc’s Gulf Coast Express and Permian Highway projects and NAmerico Energy Holdings LLC’s Pecos Trail. Drillers will, however, have to wait until 2019 and beyond for those projects to enter service. As the number of rigs seeking oil in the Permian rose this year to the highest since 2015, the amount of oil and associated gas produced has increased to record highs, constraining the region’s existing gas and oil pipelines. Those gas constraints have boosted the discount Waha trades at below the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark in Louisiana NG-W-HH-SNL. That spread rose to $4.03/mmBtu for Tuesday, its widest since September 2005, according to SNL data. That compares with an average discount of 90 cents so far in 2018, 27 cents in 2017 and a five-year (2013-2017) average of 14 cents.

2018-11-27,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RhOtvg By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to exit from their former bullish positions in crude oil and fuels last week but the worst of the selling may be over, which has helped steady futures prices. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by another 54 million barrels in the week to Nov. 20. Portfolio managers have slashed their combined net long position by a total of 607 million barrels over the last eight weeks, the largest reduction over a comparable period since at least 2013, when the current data series began, and very likely the largest ever. Long positions were reduced by 55 million barrels to just 752 million barrels, the lowest level since January 2016, at the trough of the bear market (tmsnrt.rs/2RhOtvg). But short positions, betting on a further fall in prices, were trimmed, albeit by just 1 million barrels, the first such reduction in eight weeks. In particular, hedge fund managers reduced short positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI by 10 million barrels, the biggest reduction for 12 weeks. By Nov. 20, WTI prices had declined by 30 percent from their peak and Brent was down 28 percent, which likely convinced many fund managers the scope for further falls was much smaller than before. Long positions accumulated during the bull market in the second half of 2017 and early 2018 have now all been liquidated, and for the moment most managers appear reluctant to add new short positions. The wave of hedge fund selling which has hammered oil prices since the start of October may therefore have run its course for the time being. With positions now squared up, the next move in oil prices will be determined by how U.S. shale firms and Saudi Arabia react to the recent fall in oil prices and whether the global economy slows further.

2018-11-27,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Serbia has drafted a new law to ban the construction of small hydro power plants in protected areas, bowing to pressure from environmentalists aiming to preserve a network of waterways that see the Balkans dubbed the “blue heart” of Europe. The law, drafted by the ministry of environmental protection, will be forwarded to the government and parliament at the beginning of 2019, Ivan Karic, the state secretary at the ministry, told Reuters on Tuesday. Authorities and investors across the western Balkans view hydro power as a green alternative to other sources of energy, and say it could help countries in the region hit the renewable energy targets they need to meet to join the European Union. Under plans being considered by governments, a network of nearly 3,000 hydro plants could be built across the region, with about a third of them in protected areas. Campaigners say the dams would drain rivers used by local communities for drinking, farming, fishing and tourism, while destroying the habitat of species unique to the region, such as the Danube salmon and the Balkan lynx. “If this extreme non-ecological trend of diverting the streams into pipelines continues, we would soon have thousands of kilometers of Balkan streams and rivers forever lost,” said Karic. He also said that under the new legislation small hydro plants that have already been built could lose a right to subsidies for providing power if it is determined they do not respect environmental procedures. Non-governmental organizations Riverwatch and EuroNatur on Tuesday published a document showing that three quarters of the rivers in the Balkans are so ecologically valuable they should be completely off-limits for hydro power development. They assessed a river network of over 80,000 kilometers between Slovenia and Greece.  “We call upon investors and decision-makers in the Balkans and in the EU to refrain from approving hydro power plants in these no-go areas in the future,” they said.

After Deby wound up his two-day visit, Israel said in a statement that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would “visit Chad soon and announce, with the Chadian president, the renewal of ties”. No date was given. Chad is a Muslim-majority country, and most Muslim or Arab countries do not have formal ties with Israel. Some African countries have kept their distance from Israel since its occupation of the Palestinian territories in the 1967 Middle East war, but the Netanyahu government has been keen to improve relations with the continent. Some Sunni Muslim countries have also drawn closer to Israel in recent years due to shared concerns about the rise of Shi’ite power Iran. Meeting in Jerusalem, Netanyahu and Deby “discussed shared threats and the struggle against terrorism” as well as cooperation in agriculture, solar energy, water security and health, the statement from the Israeli premier’s office said. Netanyahu has cited Chad’s renewed relationship with his country as an example of how Israel can make diplomatic inroads in Africa and in the Middle East despite its on-going conflict with the Palestinians.

2018-11-27,"* Gazprom Neft could add 50,000 bpd of oil production next year * Shale oil development in Russia curbed by Western sanctions * Orenburg subsidiary seen cranking up annual oil output by 20 pct By Olga Yagova ORENBURG, Russia, Nov 27 (Reuters) - In the green-to-golden steppe some 1,500 km east of Moscow, a unit of Gazprom Neft , Russia’s third-biggest oil producer, is drilling hard as it eyes a production hike of 20 percent a year, developing once-forgotten and depleted fields. That thirst for growth, a cornerstone of Gazprom Neft’s plans to increase its oil production by 8 percent to 100 million tonnes (2 million barrels per day) in 2020, shows the struggle Moscow faces in adhering to a global deal on oil output. Next week in Vienna, OPEC and non-OPEC producers, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia respectively, will discuss whether - and by how much - their joint output could be curbed to prop up oil prices. Moscow opposes any new cuts, sources say. Such a decision would mark a policy U-turn after the partners agreed in June to raise global production. It would also hurt Russian oil firms, which want to boost their output. Gazprom Neft Orenburg, in Russia’s southern Urals region close to Kazakhstan, illustrates the trend in the Russian oil industry, which is pinning its hopes for growth on remote locations, hard-to-extract oil and areas such as the Arctic. Gazprom Neft Orenburg has tripled its oil production in the past five years and plans to produce 2.7 million tonnes in 2018 - a level close to that of its Prirazlomnoye oilfield in the Arctic Barents Sea, the only such project in Russia. “We see annual growth of 20 percent in the next three years,” Irek Khabipov, the head of Gazprom Neft Orenburg, told reporters in his office. For now, the Orenburg cluster accounts for around 4.5 percent of Gazprom Neft’s oil output and is set to take a share of 8 percent by 2022, according to Andrey Voropayev, head of oil production at Gazprom Neft. He was promoted to his post this year after heading Gazprom Neft Orenburg for three years from 2015. To increase oil flow at its Orenburg fields, which include mature ones and small, newly bought assets, Gazprom Neft is employing state-of-the-art technologies such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. The company said on Tuesday it had launched its first high-tech well at the Orenburg cluster, which allows for an increase in initial oil-flow rates of more than 40 percent thanks to a so-called multi-storey well and fracking technology. Gazprom Neft’s oil production is seen rising by between 20,000 and 30,000 bpd this year and it may add another 50,000 bpd next year, the highest growth rate among Russian peers. Apart from Orenburg, Gazprom Neft is focusing on its recently launched Novoporpovskoye and Messoyakha fields, while continuing to test technologies at the Siberia Bazhenov formation. Its earlier plans to tap shale oil jointly with Western partners have been hit by sanctions against Russia for Moscow’s role in the Ukrainian crisis in 2014.

European markets opened subdued, but dipped as trading progressed, with the pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark last down 0.4 percent, pulling back from a one-week high hit in the previous session. Asian markets put on a brave face, with Japan’s Nikkei adding 0.64 percent and Chinese blue chips down 0.1 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up 0.3 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 dipped 0.3 percent, indicating a lower open on Wall Street. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was flat on the day. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently. He said it was “highly unlikely” he would accept China’s request to hold off on the increase, planned for Jan. 1. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. “The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi is pivotal going into the year-end and for the outlook for global growth, which has shown signs of slowing,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG in London. “If there’s no breakthrough, that makes it more likely that more tariffs will be imposed, and that increases downside risks to trade.” The news initially put trade-sensitive currencies, including the Australian dollar, on the defensive, although it climbed back into positive territory in European trade. The dollar was flat against the yen at 113.585 The index that measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies was up 0.1 percent. Sterling was weaker across the board after Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult. “We are seeing a greater degree of stability in sterling, but it went below recent ranges on Trump’s comments,” said Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon in London. “Those remarks do not tell us anything we didn’t know already but the market is trading on headlines at the moment.” The euro edged lower to $1.13235. Shares in Apple Inc fell after hours in reaction to Trump’s comments that tariffs could also be placed on laptops and iPhones imported from China. Trump’s remarks came just as the mood among investors had shown signs of brightening and Wall Street took heart from an upbeat holiday shopping period. The Dow had ended Monday up 1.46 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.55 percent and the Nasdaq 2.06 percent. The rally came after the S&P 500 on Friday recorded its lowest close in six months, down more than 10 percent from September’s peaks and back in “correction” territory. In commodity markets, oil prices steadied, depressed by record Saudi Arabian production but supported by expectations that oil exporters would agree to output cuts at an OPEC meeting next week. U.S. crude was up 0.1 percent at $51.68 a barrel, while Brent futures rose 0.2 percent to $60.60. Analysts at National Australia Bank noted the 30 percent drop in oil since early October would drag on U.S. inflation in coming months, perhaps offering further reason for the Federal Reserve to go slower on tightening. “This is a starkly different picture to just a few months ago,” said NAB’s market strategist Tapas Strickland. “A stable to lower inflation outlook means there is no urgency for the Fed to hike rates. An early 2019 pause is thus becoming more probable.” The futures market has already shifted to imply two more hikes at most next year. The Fed itself is predicting three,  and more in 2020. Hints on rate moves may come from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks later on Tuesday, and Chair Jerome Powell, who will make an appearance the day after.

2018-11-27,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian steel and coal producer Mechel (MTLR.MM) has postponed completing a painful and lengthy debt restructuring process to 2019, the company said on Tuesday. Mechel, at one point on the brink of bankruptcy, has been in restructuring talks with its lenders for several years.  On Tuesday the company said the share of its unrestructured debt portfolio was now down to 9 percent. It had planned to complete the process by the end of this year, but has now postponed this to 2019. “We continue working on restructuring the remainder of our loans and expect to complete this process next year,” Mechel chief executive Oleg Korzhov said on Tuesday. The company said its net debt, excluding fines and penalties on overdue amounts, stood at 464.2 billion roubles ($6.97 billion) as of Sept. 30.  Mechel, controlled by Russian businessman Igor Zyuzin, borrowed extensively during the commodities boom in the 2000s. Its lengthy restructuring following the 2008 financial crisis was exacerbated by Russia’s economic crisis in 2014. Russia’s three largest state-controlled banks - Sberbank (SBER.MM), VTB (VTBR.MM) and Gazprombank - subsequently confirmed, in April 2017, a restructuring of $5.1 billion of Mechel’s more than $6 billion debt. In July made significant progress in restructuring the remainder of its debt after obtaining a loan to refinance an earlier pre-export financing agreement worth $1 billion.  Mechel’s third-quarter financial results, published on Tuesday, were weaker than in the second quarter, the company said, due to planned repairs at steelmaking facilities and transport limitations due to railway car shortages. This did not significantly impact revenues, Mechel said, as the price environment was strong. Revenues were down 3 percent to 79.97 billion roubles compared to the previous three months. Operating costs did rise, however, bringing down earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Core earnings dropped 17 percent in the third quarter, compared to the second, to 19.21 billion roubles.  “Later this year and next year we still have several major repairs ahead of us, necessary for increasing production and further expansion of our product range,” Korzhov said in a statement.

It was agreed in December 2015 in the French capital and aims to limit temperature rises to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius this century and “pursue efforts” for a 1.5C limit. COP24 - The Conference of the Parties (COP) is the supreme body of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Its 24th annual meeting will be held in Katovice, Poland. This year’s is the most important since 2015 as the end of the year is the deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the Paris Agreement. NDCs - Nationally Determined Contributions, or plans from each country to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change from 2020. Countries have to submit an updated and enhanced NDC every five years. GLOBAL STOCKTAKE - Every five years, countries will review their collective progress towards the Paris Agreement’s long-term goals. The first review is in 2023. TALANOA DIALOGUE - Talanoa is a word used in Fiji to describe sharing stories, building empathy and making decisions for the collective good. The dialogue is a process aimed at helping countries implement and improve their NDCs and is an initial review of progress and ambitions this year. COMMON BUT DIFFERENTIATED RESPONSIBILITIES (CBDR) - Historically an issue that has clouded the talks. Based on a “polluter-pays” principle where developed countries which had produced more emissions in the past should take the lead in fighting climate change. The Paris Agremeent added the words “in light of different national circumstances” so that rapidly developing economies such as China and Brazil should also make emissions cuts.

2018-11-27,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday that advanced second-generation nuclear reactors will lose their import tax exemption from Jan. 1, 2019 as Beijing seeks to support domestic suppliers and promote technological development. China is expected to triple its nuclear power capacity to reach 120-150 GW in total by 2030 as part of Beijing’s push to boost clean energy consumption. Pre-allocated 2019 import quotas for tax exemption on nuclear reactors with capacities of more than 1 gigawatt (GW) to Chinese manufacturing companies will also be canceled, the Finance Ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.  China has already committed itself to using advanced, safer and larger third-generation reactors, including Westinghouse’s AP1000 and Areva’s (ARVCF.PK) EPR, as well as its own home-grown Hualong One.  Last month, the United States said it was tightening controls on China’s imports of civil nuclear technology to prevent its use for military or other unauthorized purposes amid growing trade tension between the two countries. All of the 37 nuclear reactors in operation and half of the 20 reactors under construction are second or advanced-second generation, according to data from the China Nuclear Energy Association.

2018-11-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Divisions within Europe and tension between the United States and China pose major challenges to the next round of United Nations talks on climate change. The most important U.N. climate conference since the Paris Agreement of 2015 opens on Sunday in Katowice, Poland, in one of the most polluted coal-mining regions in Europe. Success, according to the conference’s Polish host, will need a miracle. Delegates from about 195 nations are on a deadline to produce a “rule book” to flesh out details of the pact, which the United States, at the behest of President Donald Trump, has announced it will quit. The 2015 deal aims to shift the world economy away from fossil fuels and limit the rise in global temperatures to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius to avert more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The pact was 20 years in the making and commits almost every country to fight global warming. But rules are needed to bring about real cuts in emissions and ensure they are closely monitored. U.N. scientists in October added to pressure for a strong outcome from the talks, saying the world will hit the 1.5C threshold around 2040 and unprecedented changes are needed in  the way people use energy.    Despite this call for unified action, there are divisions within the European Union and trade tensions between the United States and China, all of which have implications for climate policy.    The president of the talks, Poland’s former deputy energy minister Michał Kurtyka, has expressed hopes of a compromise while at same time acknowledging the scope of the task ahead.  “Only by a miracle can we realise success,” he said last month, although miracles were “a Polish speciality”. Then earlier this month he added: “Undoubtedly, the geopolitical situation in 2015 was much easier for discussing global agreements than the one we have in 2018. However, my talks with representatives from the whole world show that there is a willingness to reach a compromise in Katowice.”    POLITICAL, ECONOMIC RIFTS    Developing nations and those vulnerable to climate change, such as islands and low-lying states, are looking to big industrialised countries to deepen cuts in emissions. Senior Chinese climate change official Li Gao told reporters last month that some industrialised countries more responsible for climate change were backsliding on the “polluter pays” principle, which “will make it hard to reach a consensus”.  In the European Union, European Commission climate chief Miguel Arias Canete’s call for more ambitious goals was rebuffed by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who said it would be counter-productive because some European countries, including Germany, were struggling to meet their targets.    The United States has a seat at the negotiating table until it can formally quit in November 2020 at the earliest.     It may use its remaining time to try to develop ammunition for its trade dispute with China. Former climate and energy adviser to President Trump, George David Banks, told Reuters the administration wants to make sure it “corrects as many of the flaws of the agreement that it can”.    The United States has always been interested in getting a robust framework for reporting and measuring emissions cuts, particularly for developing countries such as China.     “It helps inform your trade policymaking and negotiations vis-a-vis the Chinese and others,” Banks said. The United States also plans to promote fossil and nuclear fuels at the talks, repeating a strategy that infuriated global-warming activists last year.

Its forecast, based on models from around the world, was in line with that of a U.S. government arm, the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center, earlier this month.  An El Nino - a warming of ocean surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific that typically happens every few years - last occurred in 2015-2016 and caused weather-related crop damage, fires and flash floods. “The forecast El Niño is not expected to be as powerful as the event in 2015-2016, which was linked with droughts, flooding and coral bleaching in different parts of the world,” Maxx Dilley, director of WMO’s Climate Prediction and Adaptation branch, said in a statement. “Even so, it can still significantly affect rainfall and temperature patterns in many regions, with important consequences to agricultural and food security sectors, and for management of water resources and public health, and it may combine with long-term climate change to boost 2019 global temperatures,” he said.

2018-11-27,"KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Malaysian state-owned oil and gas firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas, has set up a new business within the group to make a push into renewable energy, the head of the new venture said on Tuesday. Petronas has expressed interest over the last year to diversify into renewables amid low oil prices. In March, Chief Executive Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin said Petronas will explore new business areas including new energy and that the company will assess opportunities in solar power. Jay Mariyappan told an industry forum that the ‘New Energy’ team is in the early stages of looking at options in the renewable energy space. Mariyappan’s LinkedIn profile shows he started at Petronas in October. Before joining the Malaysian firm, he was managing director of Sindicatum Sustainable Resources, a Singapore-based clean energy developer. Petronas is the latest oil and gas major to look into the renewables space. Top oil companies including Royal Dutch Shell , BP and Total are investing more in cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind power and electric vehicle technology. Petronas is the sole manager of Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves and is a significant contributor to government revenue. Earlier this month, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said Southeast Asia is a potential hotspot for renewable energy, yet the region has not met expectations because it lacks policy frameworks that would encourage investment. Global renewable capacity, excluding hydro, has soared from under 100,000 megawatts (MW) in 2000 to more than 1 million MW in 2017, according to IRENA data. Only a tiny portion of that has come in Southeast Asia, though more efforts have been made recently. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations plans to generate 23 percent of its primary energy needs from renewables by 2025, up from just over 10 percent now. (Reporting by A.

2018-11-27,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Trump says expects to move ahead on China tariffs * European markets open subdued * Aussie dollar, Apple shares dip in wake of Trump warning * Oil slips By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Stock markets fought to keep a global rebound alive on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump seemed to quash hopes of a trade truce with China, clouding what had been a bright start to the week. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark was down 0.1 percent, pulling back from a one-week high hit in the previous session. Japan’s Nikkei managed to add 0.65 percent and Chinese blue chips rose 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was last up 0.4 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 dipped 0.1 percent and spreadbetters pointed to a subdued start for the major European Bourses. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares across 47 countries, was up less than 0.1 percent. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to raise tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently. He said it was “highly unlikely” he would accept China’s request to hold off on the increase, planned for Jan. 1. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. “The upcoming meeting between Trump and Xi is pivotal going into the year-end and for the outlook for global growth, which has shown signs of slowing,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG in London. “If there’s no breakthrough, that makes it more likely that more tariffs will be imposed, and that increases downside risks to trade.” The news initially put trade-sensitive currencies, including the Australian dollar, on the defensive, although it climbed back into positive territory in European trade. The dollar was flat against the yen at 113.615 The index that measures the dollar against a basket of other currencies was up 0.2 percent. Sterling was weaker across the board after Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult. The euro edged lower to $1.1319. OIL SHIFTS RISKS ON INFLATION, FED Shares in Apple Inc fell after hours in reaction to Trump’s comments that tariffs could also be placed on laptops and iPhones imported from China. Trump’s remarks came just as the mood among investors had shown signs of brightening and Wall Street took heart from an upbeat holiday shopping period. The Dow had ended Monday up 1.46 percent, the S&P 500 gained 1.55 percent and the Nasdaq 2.06 percent. The rally came after the S&P 500 on Friday recorded its lowest close in six months, down more than 10 percent from September’s peaks and back in “correction” territory. In commodity markets, oil prices were depressed by record Saudi Arabian production even as the kingdom tried to persuade other exporters to agree output cuts ahead of an OPEC meeting next week. Oil had climbed nearly 3 percent on Monday but that was seen as largely a technical correction after weeks of heavy losses, driven both by oversupply and demand worries. U.S. crude was off 1.38 percent at $50.92 a barrel, while Brent futures were down 1 percent to $59.83. Analysts at National Australia Bank noted the 30 percent drop in oil since early October would drag on U.S. inflation in coming months, perhaps offering further reason for the Federal Reserve to go slower on tightening. “This is a starkly different picture to just a few months ago,” said NAB’s market strategist Tapas Strickland. “A stable to lower inflation outlook means there is no urgency for the Fed to hike rates. An early 2019 pause is thus becoming more probable.” The futures market has already shifted to imply two more hikes at most next yea. The Fed itself is predicting three, and more in 2020. Hints on rate moves may come from Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida, who speaks later on Tuesday, and Chair Jerome Powell, who will make an appearance the day after.

2018-11-27,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Greenpeace activists climbed a 180-metre (590 feet) chimney at a power station in Belchatow, central Poland, on Tuesday to protest Warsaw’s coal policies ahead of U.N. climate talks this month. The state-run plant is Poland’s biggest power producer, Europe’s largest polluter and one of the biggest coal power plants in the world. Nine activists climbed an internal ladder to the top of the conical chimney at the plant, which is fueled by lignite and belongs to PGE. Activists say Poland’s dependence on coal and the disputes between the conservative nationalist government and the European Union could make the climate talks difficult. “I am from a mining family, we have been connected to coal mining for generations. There is no future in coal. What we need is a just transition from coal and fossil fuels to renewables,” Marek Jozefiak, an activist climbing the chimney said. Last week the energy ministry said in a draft document that by 2030 60 percent of power will come from coal and existing onshore wind farms will disappear. Poland also plans to replace some coal with nuclear power plant, photovoltaics and offshore wind farms by 2040. “The draft ignores the threats and challenges resulting from the climate crises and proves that the energy minister completely does not understand the changes, which take place in the world’s energy,” Pawel Szypulski from Greenpeace said.

2018-11-27,"* Net profit at 14.3 bln rgt vs 10 bln rgt year-ago * Higher production volume, but lower LNG sales (Adds dividend, production, sales volume) By A. Ananthalakshmi KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Malaysian state-owned energy firm Petroliam Nasional Berhad, or Petronas, on Tuesday said it will increase its dividend payout to the government after its third-quarter net profit jumped on higher revenue and oil prices. The new administration led by Mahathir Mohamad is relying more on Petronas - a significant contributor to government revenue and the country’s largest employer - to offset a revenue shortfall from the government’s plan to scrap a consumption tax. Higher and more stable oil prices have helped boost profit and dividends from Petronas even as its sales of liquefied natural gas had been recently hit by a supply disruption. Profit for July-September rose to 14.3 billion ringgit ($3.41 billion) from 10.0 billion ringgit in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue increased 19 percent to 63.9 billion ringgit. “The board expects the group’s performance to show an improvement compared to the previous financial year,” the company said in a statement. The company said its board last month approved an additional special 2 billion ringgit dividend to the Malaysian government - its sole shareholder - on top of the 24 billion ringgit it has already committed for the year. In the 2019 budget tabled earlier this month, the government said it will get a one-off dividend of 30 billion ringgit from Petronas next year, on top of the regular dividend of 24 billion. Petronas is the only manager of Malaysia’s oil and gas reserves, and is the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter after Qatar and Australia. The company said production volume totalled 2.313 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe) per day for the first nine months of the year, up from 2.296 mmboe per day in the same period in 2017. However, LNG sales volume dropped by 1.12 million tonnes from a year earlier to 20.79 million tonnes. Petronas told Reuters last week that a leak from the Sabah Sarawak Gas Pipeline in January had impacted production at the Kebabangan gas field in the eastern state of Sabah. The gas field is expected to return to full capacity by August 2019. $1 = 4.1910 ringgit

2018-11-27,"NEW DELHI/MUMBAI, Nov 27 (Reuters) - A wave of shutdowns will hit Indian state-owned refineries next year as the country prepares for cleaner fuels from April 2020, company officials said, in moves that could temporarily dent oil demand and push up imports of refined fuels. India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer, has surplus refining capacity and rarely imports gasoil and gasoline. It also means that demand for fuel produced by India’s privately owned refiners will likely climb during the period, as state refiners seek to fill the gap. State refiners - Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum , Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals - account for about 60 percent of the country’s nearly 5 million barrels per day (bpd) capacity. The refiners will have to shut gasoil- and gasoline-making units at their plants for 15 to 45 days to churn out Euro VI-compliant fuels from January 2020 to be able to sell them from April of that year. “Next year will be challenging for us as I have to protect my crude throughput and finish the job at the refineries and get ready for Euro VI by April 2020,” said B.V. Rama Gopal, head of refineries at IOC, the country’s top refiner. IOC plans a roughly month-long shutdown of gasoline- and gasoil-producing units at all of its 11 refineries, he told Reuters. Key parts of the refineries requiring a revamp include naphtha hydrotreaters, catalytic reforming units, isomerisation units, diesel sulphurisers and diesel hydrotreaters. In addition, some refiners have to revamp or set up new gasoline treaters, hydrogen production and sulphur recovery units. India has been gradually reducing sulphur emissions from vehicles since 2000, when fuel sold in the country had 500 parts per million (ppm). Motorists in Delhi, which faces major air pollution, moved in April this year to Euro-VI standards, which allow up to 10 ppm sulphur and are known locally as Bharat Stage-VI. HPCL will shut its diesel and gasoline units while upgrading the crude units at its Vizag and Mumbai refineries for 30 to 45 days, its chairman M. K. Surana said. He forecast a slight reduction in the company’s crude intake. “We will take the shutdown in one shot so we don’t have multiple disruptions,” Surana said. Surana and MRPL managing director M. Venkatesh, who intends to shut some refinery units for up to a month, said they see no need to import fuel in 2019 given that state fuel retailers can access robust production at local private refiners. Their view is challenged by analysts who estimate weaker gasoil and gasoline prices would prompt state refiners to import auto fuel instead of going to private peers who levy coastal freight charges on top of normal prices. A similar phenomenon was witnessed when India migrated to Euro IV fuel in phases to April 2017, said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of east of Suez oil for consultants FGE in Singapore. “There is a high possibility that the lengthy shutdown period could result in a shortage of current Euro IV products in the domestic market. In such an event, Indian NOCs (national oil companies) should turn to the international market for product purchases,” she said. FGE expects India could import 40,000 bpd of gasoline and 70,000 bpd of gasoil for about one quarter in 2019 because of the shutdowns. BPCL, India’s second-biggest state refiner, has upgraded two of its refineries to superior-grade fuels, and is revamping the fire-hit hydrocracker at its Mumbai refinery so it can produce cleaner diesel, its head of refineries R. Ramachandran said. BPCL plans to shut a crude unit and some other secondary units at the Mumbai refinery for maintenance and upgrades next year for 15-20 days to produce cleaner fuels. Ramachandran said there could be a need to import “some additional cargoes but it will not be a major hiccup”. “The shutdowns will be spaced out in a manner to ensure there is enough product in the market. It will be a well-orchestrated exercise,” he said. Reporting by Nidhi Verma

2018-11-27,"* Some trading companies say halt December bookings * Arriving cargoes not allowed to pass customs - source * Utilities sitting on record coal stocks * Newcastle coal falls below $100: tmsnrt.rs/2DMyPnZ (Adds Newcastle price fall below $100/t, graphic) By Meng Meng and Dominique Patton BEIJING, Nov 27 (Reuters) - China’s coal imports are set to slump in December as traders and utilities wind back purchases following signals from Beijing that it will stop clearing shipments until next year, trading companies and utilities told Reuters. Coal imports by the world’s top consumer of the material used for power generation, heating and steelmaking rose in the first 10 months of 2018 to 252 million tonnes, up 11 percent from a year ago and not far below last year’s total of 279 million tonnes, according to official data. However, domestic coal prices have eased in recent months, even as China enters its peak demand season over winter, with utilities sitting on record coal stocks amid a slowdown in electricity demand growth. “Customs have tightened up imports because domestic supplies are abundant,” said Zhang Min, senior coal analyst with Sublime China. “We did not see the usual winter stocking activities from utilities because they have so much inventory.” China National Building Materials International (CNBM), a major buyer of Indonesian and Australian coal, will stop buying foreign supplies in December for its utility clients, a senior executive with the company said. “Although Beijing did not issue an official document, we were told by utility clients that they need to keep imports this year below last year’s level,” said the executive, who declined to be named as they are not allowed to be quoted by media. A manager at Huaneng Group, one of China’s major utilities, confirmed that he was told by the country’s chief economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), to rein in purchases to ensure China’s imports do not exceed last year’s level. He declined to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. The NDRC and China’s General Administration of Customs did not respond to faxed questions on the issue. Huaneng Group did not respond to calls, an email and a fax seeking comment. CNBM declined to comment. International markets are taking note, with prices for Australian thermal coal cargoes for prompt loading from its Newcastle terminal falling this week below $100 per tonne for the first time since May. China has in the past imposed coal import restrictions, which has had the effect of increasing local prices by lowering competition. Earlier this year it banned smaller ports from receiving coal and it has also carried out strict inspections on low-quality coal. Customs also said that cargoes arriving in November will not be able to clear customs until late December or early January next year, the CNBM executive said. Huaneng currently has some cargoes on the water near ports, unable to dock because of the delayed import clearance, the manager said. Two coal traders based in eastern Zhejiang province said November arrivals in line with the trend so far this year would likely trigger a ban on imports. Both declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter. Domestic thermal coal futures prices have fallen more than 5 percent so far in November, compared with an 8 percent gain in November last year, while domestic output has risen 5.4 percent in the first 10 months of the year to 2.9 billion tonnes. Coal inventory at the six largest coastal power plants, a benchmark for stocks, rose to 17.32 million tonnes on Nov. 20, equivalent to 33 days of consumption, up from only 20 days a year ago, data from Qinhuangdao port showed. A renewed ban on imports would still not be enough to revive the market as appetite from power plants remains weak, the Huaneng manager said. The utility’s bookings in November had dropped sharply from previous months, he added. “It’s another bad year for utilities,” he said, pointing to Beijing’s shift to support clean energy, including gas for residential heating and industrial boilers, and the impact of slower economic growth.
