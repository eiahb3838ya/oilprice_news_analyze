2018-10-07,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Former Nigerian minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a  group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014, announced on Sunday that she will run for president next year.  Ezekwesili, 55, a former vice president for Africa at the World Bank, said she would run as the candidate of the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN). Nigeria’s presidential election is scheduled to take place in February 2019.  She served in Nigeria’s government between 2000 and 2007, first as minerals minister and later education minister. President Muhammadu Buhari, who took office in 2015, has been selected by the ruling party as its candidate while the main opposition People’s Democratic Party selected former vice president Atiku Abubakar at its convention on Sunday.[L8N1WN0G8] “I want to run for, and win, the 2019 presidential election to serve and put the citizens first by mobilizing and taking decisive actions on a number of big ideas that will help all of us build an exceptional nation,” Ezekwesili said in the capital Abuja. Ezekwesili said during her nomination that she would reform the state-owned oil company, NNPC, enable the private sector to create jobs and focus on human capital development. She said she planned to tour the country.  Africa’s most populous country, which is also the continent’s top oil producer, emerged from recession early last year. But growth remains sluggish and inflation has remained high, above the central bank’s single-digit target range.    “Governance keeps worsening. So we the citizens have decided to get into the political arena to make things right,” she said. Ezekwesili, one of the founders of civil society organisation Transparency International, was considered for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of her anti-corruption work.  She is known more recently for her work as co-founder of Bring Back Our Girls, a campaign which seeks to raise awareness about some 270 girls who were kidnapped from their school in the northeast Nigerian town of Chibok in April 2014 by Islamist group Boko Haram.  The campaign brought international attention to the girls’ plight.  Many of the Chibok girls managed to escape in the hours following their abduction or were released in the last few years, including 82 who were freed in an exchange deal that included several imprisoned Islamist insurgents. About 100 of the girls are still missing and their condition is unknown.

2018-10-07,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Commission fears that carmakers in Germany would seek to export old diesel cars removed from German streets under planned trade-off incentives to eastern European countries, Industry Commissioner Elzbieta Bienkowska said on Sunday. German carmakers and the government hashed out a compromise deal to cut pollution from diesel vehicles last week after environmental groups won a victory in February which allowed cities to ban older diesel cars. The government has asked carmakers to offer owners trade-in incentives and hardware fixes. Not all carmakers committed to the retrofits, as the hardware fixes are known, which would cost billions of euros. Most said the solution should be to encourage car owners to trade in their older diesel models for cleaner vehicles - which would bring a boost in sales, albeit at discounted prices. “Exports would mean pushing the air quality problem from the west to the east,” Bienkowska told the Tagesspiegel newspaper in remarks to be published on Monday. “The German government’s plan to avoid driving bans could intensify the problem.” Germany’s environment ministry has said it would try to overcome resistance from car makers to the expensive new exhaust filtering systems. Last year, Bulgaria imported more than 100,000 second hand cars from EU countries, more than a third of which were grossly polluting diesels, according to clean mobility group Transport and Environment. “It should be clearly determined what happens to the worn-out and poorly adjusted vehicles,” said Bienkowska, adding that the issue was a European problem not a national one. Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday defended the compromise, saying it was essential to prevent driving bans in German cities, which would affect hundreds of thousands of diesel car owners who commute to work from the countryside to  urban centres. But speaking at an event of the youth wing of her conservatives, Merkel also said car makers had “lied and cheated” by selling diesel cars that pollute more than the industry had said they would. Diesel cars have come under intense scrutiny after Volkswagen in 2015 admitted to using illegal software to cheat emissions tests, sparking a scandal that has cost it more than $27 billion in penalties and fines. “That people are becoming suspicious is the fault of the car industry not politicians,” Merkel said in the northern city of Kiel. EU environment ministers will discuss more ambitious car emission reduction targets when they meet in Luxembourg on Oct. 9. EU lawmakers last month backed carbon dioxide reduction goals for fleets of cars and vans of 45 percent by 2030, ambitious targets that are unpopular with national governments.

2018-10-07,"(Adds quotes, background) By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Oct 7 (Reuters) - The Nigerian central bank may reduce the amount it has ordered South African telecoms firm MTN to repatriate as part of an ongoing disagreement, central bank governor Godwin Emefiele said on Sunday. MTN and the central bank are in a dispute over the transfer of $8.1 billion of funds which the bank said the company had sent abroad in breach of foreign-exchange regulations. Nigeria accounts for a third of MTN’s annual core profit. “I don’t think it will be staying at $8.1 billion,” Emefiele said during a visit to London, adding he expected the issue to be dealt with “amicably and equitably”. “I want to believe that the figures will reduce. Whether they will be dropped completely, I honestly cannot say at this time.” Emefiele said the central bank had received documents some two weeks ago from MTN and four lenders involved in the case - Standard Chartered, Stanbic IBTC Bank, Citibank and Diamond Bank - and was in communications with all parties involved. “The central bank will be examining these, then it will be escalated up to my level,” he said, adding he expected to get the results in a couple of weeks. The two sides are locked in a court dispute over the transaction. The central bank filed a counter-claim on Friday to a court request by MTN, which is seeking to stop the bank from forcing it to bring back the money. Emefiele said the MTN case was a one-off, and the central bank was not looking at transactions involving any other companies operating in Nigeria. “We respect the sanctity of these companies,” he said. Shares in MTN lost almost 5 percent over the past week. Emefiele also said Nigeria’s central bank would continue to intervene in the foreign exchange markets, adding that he believed in a stable exchange rate regime. Nigeria has been battling to defend its currency and shore up its reserves of around $44 billion, hobbled by lower oil prices. At the same time, the oil exporter has suffered from high inflation, which edged up to 11.2 percent at its last reading - well above the central bank’s 6-9 percent target. Emefiele said Nigeria’s current stance of monetary tightening would continue.

2018-10-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to announce the lifting of a federal ban on summer sales of higher-ethanol blends of gasoline on Tuesday in Washington DC ahead of a trip to Iowa the same day, according to two sources familiar with the planning of the event.  The move, expected sometime around 3 p.m. on Tuesday, is aimed at helping Republicans in competitive elections in the nation’s farm belt. Iowa is the largest U.S. producer of ethanol. The lifting of the summer ban on so-called E15 gasoline is expected to be coupled with restrictions on trading biofuel credits that underpin the program, the sources said, but it’s unclear whether the restrictions will be detailed or left up to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to decide. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil group, opposes lifting the ban, which will eat into the industry’s market share of gasoline sales. The move also faces bipartisan opposition in congress. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires refiners to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like ethanol into the fuel pool each year, or buy credits from competitors who do. Refining companies that must buy the credits have complained about volatile prices in recent years. The summer ban was put in place as an anti-smog measure, though studies have since shown its environmental benefits are limited. Trump will direct EPA to write a rule lifting the ban, and it would have to be fast-tracked to have it finalized before the next summer driving season.

2018-10-07,"* Advanced Petrochemical posts decline in quarterly net income * Saudi petchem sector drops * Almarai’s third-quarter net profit below analysts’ forecasts * DSI rises in Dubai By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Gulf stock markets mostly slipped on Sunday, following a series of disappointing corporate results in Saudi Arabia and a slide in global stocks. The Saudi index lost 1.3 percent, with the whole petrochemicals sector in negative territory, despite a rise in oil prices late last week. Advanced Petrochemical dropped 2.8 percent after reporting a slight decline in quarterly net income to 202 million riyals ($53.86 million). This was above analysts’ median forecast of 188 million riyals, according to Refinitiv data. The company said the drop in net profit was due to an increase in feedstock costs. In a research note NCB Capital said it maintained its overweight rating on the company, adding that “high and sustainable operating efficiency and attractive dividend yield of 5.2 percent are the stock’s key strengths.” Saudi Kayan Petrochemical Co. was among the worst performers, dropping 4.4 percent. Blue-chip Saudi Basic Industries Corporation lost 1.6 percent. Shares in Almarai, the Gulf’s largest dairy company, dropped 2.6 percent after posting 634.5 million riyals ($169.19 million) in third-quarter net profits against 667 million riyals during the same period last year. Analysts had a median forecast of 654 million riyals, according to Refinitiv data. Dubai was underpinned by a 2.9 percent gain by contractor Drake and Scull International. But the index as a whole edged down almost 0.1 percent. DSI, which has faced increasing losses since 2015, said on Sunday the majority of shareholders approved the company continuing its business at a general assembly on Thursday. The meeting was called in accordance with UAE companies’ law, which states that shareholders must decide whether to dissolve a company if its losses amount to half of its issued share capital.

2018-10-07,"PORT HARCOURT (Reuters) - Atiku Abubakar won on Sunday almost half the votes cast in a primary race to become the main opposition challenger to Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari in next year’s elections, party officials said. Abubakar, 71 and a former vice president, will stand as the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate.  He scored 1,532 votes to defeat other candidates in the race, including the governor of the northwestern state of Sokoto, Aminu Tambuwal, and Nigeria’s Senate President Bukola Saraki, the officials announced. “This is a victory for all of us. The task to get Nigeria working again starts now,” Abubakar said in a tweet. At a party convention on Saturday, the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) picked Buhari, who took office in 2015, for the February vote. Political parties had until Sunday to select their candidates. Ex-minister Obiageli Ezekwesili, co-founder of a group to raise awareness about more than 200 girls kidnapped by Boko Haram in 2014, earlier announced that she will also run. The handling of the economy has already emerged as a major issue at the start of the election cycle in Africa’s top oil producer, which also plays a key role in regional wars against Islamist insurgents. Nigeria entered its first recession in 25 years in 2016, mainly caused by lower oil prices and attacks in the Niger Delta crude-producing region. It emerged from recession early last year but growth remains sluggish and inflation above the central bank’s single-digit target range.   Abubakar hopes to replicate Buhari’s 2015 feat of winning a presidential election at the fourth attempt after he left the ruling APC party in November and re-joined the PDP a month later. The ex-vice president, who is from the northeastern state of Adamawa, in May told Reuters he would privatise parts of the state oil company and allow the naira currency to float to attract foreign investment if elected as head of state. He has long enjoyed support from the business elite in Nigeria’s commercial capital Lagos for his conservative-capitalist ideals and, as vice president in a PDP administration from 1999-2007, implemented a programme of liberalisation in areas including the telecoms sector. Prior to Buhari taking office in 2015, the PDP had been the only party in power since the west African country’s transition to civilian rule in 1999.  Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation with some 190 million inhabitants from around 250 ethnic groups spread across a mostly Muslim north and mostly Christian south.  Buhari, in a speech to mark the anniversary of Nigeria’s independence on Oct. 1, sought to reassure voters that next year’s elections would be free and fair after the PDP and international observers raised concerns over the way a gubernatorial vote in the southwestern state of Osun was conducted.

2018-10-07,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) By Stephen Culp NEW YORK, Oct 5 (Reuters) - The U.S. transportation sector, which many see as a proxy indicator of the economy’s health, has retreated 3.1 percent from its Sept. 14 record, hinting to some analysts that the longest bull market on record has entered its late stages. Railways, freight carriers and package deliverers get less attention than heavy-hitting momentum stocks like Apple Inc and Amazon.com, but the sector could be showing cracks in what analysts and the U.S. Federal Reserve characterize as a robust economy. Several constituents of the Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJT) have provided disappointing guidance in recent months. As the third-quarter reporting season approaches, investors will watch to gauge whether trade, fuel and dollar risks are affecting the sector’s bottom line. The 20-company DJT has recently diverged from the broader market after a strong run since late June, suggesting these headwinds could be taking a toll. As the DJT has retreated, the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average has moved in the opposite direction. The Dow reached its most recent all-time high on Tuesday, 13 trading days after the DJT’s Sept. 14 record. Diverging highs between the two indexes can signal growing market instability. Similar divergences occurred leading into the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2009, and most recently heading into the market correction that began in late January. “The transports have been going sideways and haven’t confirmed the new highs in the industrials,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “If the transports were to break down further from these levels, if you saw them declining another 2 or 3 percent in the near future, you would call that a bearish non-confirmation.” On Friday, both indexes closed lower, with the DJT slipping 0.8 percent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping 0.7 percent. Delta Air Lines Inc is due to report on Oct. 9, a week after lackluster forecasts from the company and its peer United Continental pulled U.S. airline stocks lower . The bulk of the companies in the DJT are expected to post results in the latter half of October. FedEx Corp, the first in the group to post quarterly earnings on Sept. 17, missed Wall Street estimates as costs weighed on margins. The global package delivery company has been challenged this year by the ongoing trade disputes between the United States and its major bilateral trading partners, notably China and Europe. Although a preliminary deal to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement has boosted railway stocks, looming tariffs threaten to increase the cost of transporting goods and services, further testing other DJT constituents. “There may well be blood in the water before we actually get some kind of agreement on trade between the US and China,” said Bernard Baumohl,  managing director and chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. “It could do some serious damage in the long run as China seeks to establish new supply chain routes from other countries and rely less on the United States.” Analysts see costs of transportation fuels, which include gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, continuing to climb due to tightening supply and increasing demand. Rising fuel costs are “depressing stocks that make up the transportation index,” Baumohl added. Brent Crude prices have risen nearly 26 percent since the beginning up the year and energy analysts see the trend continuing well into 2019. “In the near-term we’ve seen prices increase as a result of Iranian sanctions reducing the supply of crude oil to the market,” said Andrew Lipow, consultant at Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. “I expect that over the next year, the price in transportation fuel is going to be increasing.” The climbing dollar could also pressure transportation companies as U.S. goods grow less affordable to foreign consumers, which might result in fewer shipments abroad. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major world currencies, has risen almost 4 percent so far this year. “The net effect is that (the strong dollar) could impact the transportation index over the course of the next 12 months,” Baumohl said. Meanwhile, investors will get a clearer picture in coming weeks of the extent to which trade jitters, fuel costs and the rising dollar may have turned transports into a warning sign. “There are a lot of wild cards out there now,” said Baumohl.
