2018-09-10,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry met with Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih on Monday in Washington, the U.S. Energy Department said, as the Trump administration encourages big oil-producing countries to keep output high ahead of Washington’s renewed sanctions on Iran’s crude exports. Perry and Falih discussed the state of world oil markets, the potential for U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear cooperation and efforts to share technologies to develop “clean fossil fuels,” the department said in a statement. The Saudi Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Perry will also meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak, on Thursday in Moscow, a U.S. source and a diplomatic source said Sunday night. High oil prices are a risk for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Nov. 6 congressional elections. Global oil prices have already risen sharply to more than $76 a barrel in recent weeks on concerns about sanctions on Iran’s oil exports that Washington will renew on Nov. 4.  Trump withdrew the United States in May from the nuclear deal with Iran, and he is pushing consuming countries to cut their purchases of Iranian oil to zero.  It is unclear what the United States may offer big oil producers in return for higher oil production.  Saudi Arabia has been seeking a civilian nuclear agreement with the United States that could allow the kingdom to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium.  Russia wants the United States to drop sanctions on Moscow. OPEC and non-OPEC officials will meet later this month to discuss proposals for sharing an oil output increase, after the groups decided in June to boost output moderately.

2018-09-10,"TRICASTIN, France (Reuters) - French nuclear group Orano on Monday inaugurated a 1.15 billion euro (1.02 billion pounds)uranium conversion plant despite huge global overcapacity for nuclear reactor fuel.  State-owned Orano’s new plant in Tricastin, southern France, will account for a quarter of the world’s 60,000-tonne annual uranium hexafluoride (UF6) production capacity when it fully ramps up in 2021 and is set to have the industry’s lowest costs, the company said. UF6, produced by combining “yellowcake” uranium ore concentrate with fluorine, is a precursor of enriched uranium, which fuels the world’s nuclear plants.  Following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, uranium prices are near decade lows as several countries reduced their reliance on nuclear energy.  In November 2017, Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) suspended UF6 production at its 15,000-tonne capacity Metropolis, Illinois plant, the only such conversion plant in the United States.  Orano, formerly called Areva, in December 2017 also halted production at its aging 15,000 ton/year capacity Comurhex conversion plant in Tricastin, and will serve utilities from its stockpiles until the new plant comes online and global overcapacity subsides.  From 2019, Orano’s new conversion facility - to be called the Philippe Coste plant - will have capacity of 7,500 tonnes and output of about 5,000 tonnes. When construction is completed early 2021, it will reach full capacity of 15,000 tonnes.  Orano Chief Executive Philippe Knoche told reporters that the new plant’s order book was full for the next 10 years, but added that profitability would remain challenging at current conversion rates.  Following the plant closures, those rates have doubled to about $10 per kilogram over the past year, but are still too low for the industry’s long-term profitability. Knoche said French utility EDF (EDF.PA) had committed to buy about one third of the new plant’s output, while the rest would be sold mainly under long-term contracts to about 70 utilities in the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and several European countries. Ten to 20 percent of the plant’s output will be sold under short-term contracts of less than three years.  The uranium will come from Areva and other companies’ mines in Niger, Kazakhstan, Canada, South Africa and Namibia.  Orano board Chairman Philippe Varin said the firm’s new conversion plant had been under development for 10 years and that Orano upgraded it as part of the modernization of its fuel facilities.  “This new facility is a long-term commitment,” he said.  Orano and Canada’s Cameco Corp (CCO.TO) each have about a quarter of global uranium conversion capacity, with Russia’s Rosatom a bit more and China’s CNNC a bit less than a quarter each, according to industry expert estimates.

2018-09-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were mixed on Monday, pulling back from an early rally after data suggested U.S. crude inventories might build, weighing on the market. Traders said weekly data from Bloomberg suggested U.S. oil inventories are rising, contradicting an earlier report from energy information provider Genscape, which forecast declining inventories.  The data put a damper on a bullish mood that had driven trading early in the session.  “This has been a Monday morning special that the Bloomberg or Genscape numbers can kill a rally,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down 21 cents at $67.54 a barrel. Brent crude oil LCOc1 rose 54 cents to $77.37 a barrel after touching a session high of $77.92 a barrel.  Earlier in the session, crude had strengthened as growth of U.S. drilling braked and investors anticipated lower supply once new U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports kick in from November. “The low rig count set the stage for us to move higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “At the end of the day you also have storms that could impact inventories for some time to come.” U.S. drillers cut two oil rigs last week, reducing the total count to 860, Baker Hughes said on Friday. Growth of the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has stalled since May, reflecting increases in well productivity but also bottlenecks and infrastructure constraints. “A higher oil price scenario is built on lower exports from Iran due to U.S. sanctions, capped U.S. shale output growth, instability in production in countries like Libya and Venezuela and no material negative impact from a U.S./China trade war on oil demand in the next 6-9 months,” said Harry Tchilinguirian, oil strategist at French bank BNP Paribas. “We see Brent trading above $80 under (that) scenario,” he told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Outside the United States, Iranian crude oil exports are declining ahead of a November deadline for the implementation of new U.S. sanctions. Although many importers of Iranian oil have said they oppose sanctions, few seem prepared to defy Washington. ""Governments can talk tough,"" said Energy consultancy FGE. ""They can say they are going to stand up to Trump and/or push for waivers. But generally the companies we speak to ... say they won't risk it,"" FGE said. ""U.S. financial penalties and the loss of shipping insurance scare everyone."" For graphic on U.S. oil rig count, click tmsnrt.rs/2N4pWMw While Washington is exerting pressure on countries to cut imports from Iran, it is also urging other producers to raise output to hold down prices. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will meet his counterparts from Saudi Arabia and Russia on Monday and Thursday respectively as the Trump administration encourages the world’s biggest producers and exporters to keep output up. Investors are concerned about the impact on oil demand of the trade dispute between the United States and other large economies, as well as the weakness of emerging markets. “Trade wars, and especially rising interest rates, can spell trouble for the emerging markets that drive (oil) demand growth,” FGE said. Despite this, the consultancy said the likelihood of much weaker oil prices was fairly low as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would probably adjust output to stabilise prices.

2018-09-10,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An index of global stock markets rose on Monday for the first time in eight trading sessions on optimism about policy from Italy to the United States, dodging anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.06 percent, but it felt fragile after a sell-off in China overnight and emerging market shares hit their lowest level in more than a year. Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. row after President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday by saying he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports to the United States. He also called on Apple Inc to make its products in the United States. Emerging market stocks lost 1.21 percent for the day. U.S. stock investors are looking to extend momentum after corporate profits hit a record high in the second quarter, while investors think an Italian debt crisis would spark a conflict with Europe that would hurt the domestic economy. Congressional Republicans plan to unveil another round of tax cuts this week ahead of the Nov. 6 elections, helping support U.S. equities.   “Markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,” said Tim Love, investment director of emerging market equities at fund manager GAM Holding AG. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.47 points, or 0.23 percent, to 25,857.07, the S&P 500 gained 5.45 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,877.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 21.62 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,924.16. [.N] Stocks in Milan rose 2.30 percent after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sunday the coalition’s more radical budget plans would be introduced gradually, reassuring investors that EU fiscal rules would be respected. The euro was up 0.36 percent to $1.1593, and the gap between yields on Italian and more creditworthy German bonds was the narrowest in a month. Shares in Stockholm and the Swedish crown strengthened after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than polls had predicted in elections on Sunday. The fresh 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently. [EMRG/FRX] (Graphic: Submerging markets: reut.rs/2CCAgGn) Some Asian economies are also vulnerable, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They noted a “concentration risk” from some of the world’s largest funds’ heavy investments in emerging market assets. The Indian rupee hit a record low and Indonesia’s rupiah neared all-time lows.  The Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese growth because Australia sells raw materials to China, was at its lowest in more than two years. Copper, an industrial metal China uses heavily, lost 0.72 percent, adding to a nearly 20 percent collapse in price this year. Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launched any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it will resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 1.2 percent at the lowest since July 2017. The potential for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike after a U.S. labor market report showed wages posting their largest annual increase in more than nine years pushed 2-year Treasury yields to 2.715 percent, the highest in 10 years.

2018-09-10,"(Reuters) - California Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday signed a bill requiring the state to source electricity from exclusively carbon-free sources by 2045, a move aimed at combating climate change that clashes with U.S. President Donald Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies. The law makes California the largest global economy to commit to 100 percent clean energy. Hawaii is the only other U.S. state to set a similar goal. “There is no understating the importance of this measure,” Brown said at a signing ceremony in Sacramento surrounded by state lawmakers. The law sends a message that California supports the global Paris agreement to fight climate change, he said. Trump withdrew from the accord last year over concerns that it would hurt the U.S. economy, making the United States the only country to do so. “We are going to meet the Paris agreement and we’re going to continue down that path to transition our economy to zero carbon emissions,” Brown said. Brown’s signing came days before he hosts a gathering of local, international and business leaders in San Francisco to highlight the urgency of addressing climate change. California has repeatedly clashed with the federal government’s policies on climate change, immigration and other issues since Trump became president. The bill received strong support from environmental activists, renewable energy companies and public health groups. The state’s biggest utilities, however, opposed the measure. Utility Pacific Gas & Electric said the law could raise customer bills and make the grid less reliable. “If it’s not affordable, it’s not sustainable,” utility spokeswoman Lynsey Paulo said in an emailed statement. The clean energy bill, known as SB 100, passed the legislature last month.  The law requires utilities to source 60 percent of their power from renewable energy by the end of 2030, up from a prior goal of 50 percent. By 2045, all of the state’s electricity must come from renewable or other zero-carbon sources. In 2017, 32 percent of California’s retail electricity sales were served by renewable energy facilities, according to the California Energy Commission.

2018-09-10,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has agreed to hand over at least seven oil fields to little-known companies that will be paid to boost output through contracts similar to ones rolled back under late socialist leader Hugo Chavez, according to two sources and an internal document. The effort signals that President Nicolas Maduro, who is struggling under a hyper-inflationary economic meltdown and fast-declining oil output, is willing to reverse the aggressive efforts of his predecessor - who died in 2013 - to expand the state’s role in the energy industry of the OPEC nation.  But the plan faces significant hurdles because most companies involved have no known experience operating oilfields, and U.S. sanctions would likely inhibit more experienced firms from getting involved with Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA. The government had already announced a vague plan to boost oil output with the help of seven companies.  The plan was described during a televised event on Aug. 28 in which representatives of those companies, during a ceremony including Maduro, signed “joint service agreements” with PDVSA. Details of the deals were not disclosed. But in a draft contract seen by Reuters, PDVSA offers to put companies in charge of the fields for six years on the condition that they boost production, finance the required investment and procure the necessary equipment. The draft was the basis for the contracts announced by Maduro, said two sources familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they are not allowed to speak publicly about the issue. Reuters was not able to obtain finalized contracts. The companies involved have not yet announced final agreements with Venezuela.  Neither PDVSA nor the companies involved responded to a request for comment. The president of PDVSA, Manuel Quevedo, said during the Aug.  28 event that the overall plan would involve $430 million in investment and a production increase of 641,000 barrels per day (bpd). The terms of the deals were not disclosed. Quevedo said the plan included 14 companies but that only seven were present that night, without mentioning the names of the other companies.  The deals involve fields including two that were operated by Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) and France’s Total (TOTF.PA). The companies that signed agreements include five Venezuelan firms: Petrokariña, Enfriadores de Venezuela C.A., Consorcio Rinoca Centauro Kariña, Well Services Cavallino, and Consorcio Petrolero Tomoporo.  Most of them appear to be involved in oil services but have no evident experience operating fields, which tends to require significantly more capital, human resources and certifications. The companies either did not respond to requests for comment or do not have sufficient publicly available contact information to make such a request.  The other two are Helios Petroleum Services, a Panamanian company that describes itself as petroleum marketer, and Shandong Kerui Holding Group, a Chinese oilfield equipment manufacturer. Neither responded to requests for comment. The draft says companies would receive a fee in compensation for the value of additional barrels they produce, and be reimbursed for the investments they make. PDVSA would have a six-month grace period, starting at the time the contractor increases output, to begin making payments. Payments would be made to the account of a trust created by the contractor, the draft says, helping ensure the contractor actually receives payment from PDVSA - which is billions of dollars behind in paying partners and providers.     The draft contract is similar to a group of 1990s-era contracts known as “operating agreements” under which PDVSA contracted out oil production to companies that were paid a fee for the crude they produced. Chavez, elected in 1998, for years lambasted this arrangement as a bad deal for Venezuela on the grounds that it was a “disguised privatization” of the oil industry that did not leave enough revenue in the hands of the state.  Former oil czar Rafael Ramirez, who oversaw Chavez’s push to boost the state’s role in the oil industry, in a 2005 speech to Congress said the arrangements were illegal because they handed over oilfields to private companies in violation of the 1970s oil industry nationalization. The legal status of the contracts signed in August was not immediately evident. Venezuela in 2005 ordered that operating agreements be converted to joint ventures in which PDVSA held a majority.  Despite a 10-year oil boom that left PDVSA flush with cash, output at those fields steadily declined as the company diverted necessary investments into social programs that kept Chavez popular. The 2014 collapse of oil prices ushered in an economic crisis that left millions unable to eat, leaving oil engineers and oilfield workers alike rushing to leave the country. Maduro says the country is victim of an “economic war” led by opposition politicians with the support of Washington, which has slapped several rounds of sanctions on his government.

2018-09-10,"(Reuters) - (This version of Sept. 7 story corrects 9th paragraph to show jury deadlocked on two water-pollution and one wildlife counts, and returned a verdict of not guilty on the death of a dolphin; original story had not guilty on additional water-pollution and wildlife counts and deadlocked on a dolphin death.) A California jury on Friday found the Houston-based Plains All American Pipeline company guilty on criminal charges of fouling state waters and harming wildlife in a major oil spill three years ago along the Pacific shoreline near Santa Barbara. The verdict closed a chapter in the state’s bid to hold Plains All American criminally responsible for an oil spill that ranked as the largest in more than four decades to hit the energy-rich but ecologically sensitive coast northwest of Los Angeles. The spill, linked to the deaths of hundreds of sea birds and marine mammals, occurred when an underground pipeline badly worn by corrosion ruptured along a coastal highway west of Santa Barbara on May 19, 2015, sending crude oil gushing onto the shore of Refugio State Beach and into the Pacific. By the company’s own estimates, as much as 3,400 barrels of crude oil escaped into the environment at the edge of a national marine sanctuary and state-designated underwater preserve teeming with whales, dolphins, sea lions and marine birds. That stands as the biggest spill since 1969’s 100,000-barrel blowout in the Santa Barbara Channel, an area that also hosts nearly two dozen offshore oil platforms. The company faces at least $1.5 million in penalties if Friday’s conviction is sustained, according to John Savrnoch, the chief deputy district attorney for Santa Barbara County.  But that sum is a small fraction of the $150 million that Plains said it had spent on spill response and cleanup costs by the time the criminal case was brought in 2016. Plains was convicted of discharging crude oil into state waters, a felony, and for eight misdemeanor offenses, including the failure to immediately report the spill, Savrnoch told Reuters. The remaining misdemeanors convictions were mostly for state wildlife code violations stemming from deaths of sea lions and brown pelicans in the spill. The jury was deadlocked on two additional water-pollution felonies and one wildlife misdemeanor, and returned a verdict of not guilty on a misdemeanor count related to a dolphin death. One of Plains’ employees, an environmental and regulatory compliance specialist, was originally charged in the case as well, but those charges, and dozens of others against the company, were dismissed before the trial. In a statement issued after the verdict, Plains said the outcome exonerated the company of “any knowing misconduct” in operating the failed pipeline. The company has maintained that its pipeline operations exceeded legal and industry standards. The U.S. Transportation Department report concluded a year after the spill that numerous lapses in safety measures, judgment and planning by Plains led to and worsened the disaster.  It specifically found the company at fault for failing to protect the pipeline from corrosion beforehand and to promptly detect and respond to the spill once it occurred. Oil industry critics seized on the spill as an example of how the aging infrastructure of America’s fossil fuels production and transport networks pose a grave threat to the environment.

2018-09-10,"SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s environmental regulator expanded its investigation into a gas poisoning incident in coastal town Quintero, bringing charges of non-compliance with environmental agreements on Monday against a gas plant. The environmental inspectorate (SMA) said Gasmar, a company that imports and sells liquefied petroleum gas and is part-owned by Chilean industrial conglomerate Copec, has 10 days to present a compliance plan or appeal the accusation that it failed to adhere to agreed levels of residual gas flaring from its chimneys.  The charge against Gasmar comes on the heels of stricter monitoring by SMA following a gas poisoning incident in August in which hundreds of people showed symptoms of gas inhalation poisoning, prompting ongoing protests over the government’s handling of the issue.  Within days, the SMA ordered the suspension of some operations by the state-owned energy company ENAP[ENAP.UL], also in the Quintero industrial zone, about 90 miles northeast of Santiago. The company has denied responsibility for the incident.  The SMA said in a statement on Monday that its audit of Gasmar’s operations had not yet detected any pollution or harm caused to people living nearby. However, it called the charge against Gasmar “serious” and said it was brought because the company failed to mitigate its potentially adverse environmental impact. Quintero has had several pollution incidents in the past, including gas and oil leaks, leading to investigations and fines against companies for non-compliance with environmental obligations.  The SMA has admitted it struggles to supervise the operations of the 15 large-scale industrial plants based in the area. Environment Minister Carolina Schmidt told local television station Canal 13 over the weekend that ENAP was not the only company responsible for polluting the area. She said the government had asked state miner Codelco and AES Gener, an electricity generation firm, to provide information about their emissions on Sept. 4 when another environmental incident left 20 people ill.

2018-09-10,"HOUSTON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - U.S. crude deliveries to South Korea are poised to reach a record in November, Thomson Reuters trade flows data show, as buyers there pull back from Iranian crude to comply with sanctions reimposed on Iran by the United States. The escalating U.S.-China trade row has also helped push U.S. crude into South Korea, with U.S. exporters seeking alternative buyers in Asia - including in South Korea, India, Japan and Taiwan - as China’s purchases fall. Only one crude tanker is scheduled to depart from the United States in September for China, previously a top U.S. crude buyer. A dozen tankers carrying more than 21 million barrels of U.S. crude are underway or scheduled to depart for South Korea between Sept. 11 and Nov. 27, more than the previous seven months combined, the data show. U.S. crude arriving in South Korea, the world’s fifth-largest crude importer, will hit a record 269,000 barrels per day (bpd) in November, up from 229,000 bpd in September and 221,000 bpd in October, the data shows. South Korea, one of Iran’s top crude customers, last month cut its Iranian crude acquisitions to zero, according to the data, while it sought waivers from the U.S. sanctions. “The U.S. needs to push out exports or it will start to build inventories at home,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultancy PetroMatrix. “Exporters need to seek alternative buyers because the U.S. still needs to maintain a high level of exports.” The C. Challenger, carrying more than 2 million barrels of Light Louisiana Sweet WTC-LLS crude, is scheduled to reach Yeosu, on South Korea’s southern coast, on Oct. 2. The Baghdad, also carrying 2 million barrels of the U.S. coastal grade, departed from the Galveston Offshore Lightering Area and is expected to reach Ulsan in southeastern South Korea on Oct. 10, the trade flows data show. Other Asian countries also are buying more U.S. crude. A record amount will flow in September to Japan, with its imports of U.S. crude are set to reach 138,000 bpd this month. Taiwan’s August purchases of U.S. oil hit a record 245,000 bpd, the data show. “Asian demand is still relatively strong, and those countries have a tendency politically to favor diversification (of crude suppliers) when you have trade wars,” Jakob said.

2018-09-10,"(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday directed the state’s Department of Environmental Conservation to promote regulations to phase out the use of climate change pollutants called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The change, to be implemented from 2020-2024, is expected to reduce such emissions by more than 20 percent of projected levels by 2030, the statement said. “The regulations would prohibit specific substances for use in new consumer products.” A group of U.S. states led by New York had, in June, sued the Environmental Protection Agency over a plan to roll back limits on the use of hydrofluorocarbons, which are used in air conditioning, refrigerants, aerosols and foam-blowing. DEC will seek input on the proposal before drafting rules, with the intent of finalizing them in 2019.

The move comes days before Brown hosts a gathering of local, international and business leaders to highlight the issue of climate change. The law, passed by the state’s legislature last month, requires the state’s utilities to source 60 percent of their power from renewable energy by the end of 2030, an increase from a prior goal of 50 percent. It also states that by 2045, all of the state’s electricity must come from renewable or other zero-carbon sources. The bill passed the state legislature last month and received strong support from environmental and public health groups. The state’s biggest utilities opposed the measure.

2018-09-10,"* MSCI global stock index tags 1st gain in 8 sessions * Italy, Sweden help deliver gains in European shares * Emerging markets under pressure (Updates throughout; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, Sept 10 (Reuters) - An index of global stock markets rose on Monday for the first time in eight trading sessions on optimism about policy from Italy to the United States, dodging anxiety about the U.S.-China trade war. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.15 percent, but it felt fragile after a sell-off in China overnight and emerging-market shares hit their lowest level in more than a year. Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. row after President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday, saying he is ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports to the United States. He also called on Apple to make its products in the United States. Emerging market stocks lost 1.19 percent for the day. U.S. stock investors are looking to extend momentum after corporate profits hit a record high in the second quarter, while investors think an Italian debt crisis would spark a conflict with Europe that would hurt the domestic economy. Congressional Republicans plan to unveil another round of tax cuts this week ahead of the Nov. 6 U.S. elections. “Markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,” said Tim Love, investment director of emerging market equities at fund manager GAM Holding AG. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 13.48 points, or 0.05 percent, to 25,903.06, the S&P 500 gained 7.53 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,879.21 and the Nasdaq Composite added 16.91 points, or 0.21 percent, to 7,919.45. Stocks in Milan jumped 2.30 percent after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said on Sunday the coalition’s more radical budget plans would be introduced gradually, reassuring investors that EU fiscal rules would be respected. The euro was up 0.45 percent to $1.1603, and the gap between yields on Italian and more creditworthy German bonds fell to the narrowest in a month. Shares in Stockholm and the Swedish crown strengthened after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than polls had predicted in elections on Sunday. The latest 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently. Some Asian economies are vulnerable, too, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They also noted a “concentration risk” from some of the world’s largest funds’ heavy investments in emerging-market assets. The Indian rupee hit a record low and Indonesia’s rupiah weakened near an all-time low. The Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese growth because of the large volume of metals Australia sells to China, hovered near its lowest in 2-1/2 years. Copper, an industrial metal China uses heavily, lost 0.53 percent, adding to a nearly 20 percent drop already this year. Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launched any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it will resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed down 1.14 percent at the lowest since July 2017. The potential for a U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike after a U.S. labor market report showed wages posting their largest annual increase in more than nine years pushed 2-year Treasury yields to 2.7109 percent, their highest in 10 years. Risk aversion supported the 30-year bond, which last rose 9/32 in price to yield 3.0883 percent. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-09-10,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - Investors took Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) to court on Monday to seek compensation for the hit to the carmaker’s share price from its diesel emissions scandal, with plaintiffs holding out hopes for billions of dollars in damages. Shareholders representing 1,670 claims are seeking 9.2 billion euros (8.21 billion pounds) in damages over the scandal, which broke in September 2015 and has cost Volkswagen (VW) 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines so far. It is likely, however, that only some of the claims will be taken into account because of the statute of limitations, presiding judge Christian Jaede told the Braunschweig higher regional court as proceedings began, without giving a figure. Andreas Tilp, a lawyer for some of the plaintiffs, said he believes that claims worth 2 billion euros of the roughly 5 billion euros he represents have a chance. “We are very confident that there will be money at the end of the day,” he said. Judge Jaede said the case was highly complicated, with many legal questions to be clarified. The court has not yet set a detailed timetable for proceedings in a case that could well end up in a higher court. The plaintiffs say VW failed in its duty to inform investors about the financial impact of the scandal, which became public only after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a “notice of violation” on Sept. 18, 2015. Had investors known about VW’s criminal activities in rigging emissions tests, they may have sold shares earlier or not made purchases, thereby avoiding losses on their holdings, the plaintiffs argue. VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars. “VW should have told the market that they cheated and generated risk worth billions,” said Tilp. “VW should have told the market no later than June 2008 that they could not make the technology that they needed in the United States.” The carmaker’s decision between 2005 and 2007 to install cheating software in diesel vehicles was illegal, but it is not clear that it was taken to keep investors in the dark, judge Jaede said. VW has admitted systematic emissions cheating, but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure. “This case is mainly about whether Volkswagen complied with its disclosure obligations to shareholders and the capital markets,” VW lawyer Markus Pfueller told the court. “We are convinced that this is the case.” A challenge of the case, according to Jaede, is that it covers many incidents stretching back to 2005, with claims before July 9, 2012 potentially invalidated by the statute of limitations, the court said in a summary of proceedings. However, the results of a study into VW diesel engines commissioned by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) and investigations by U.S. regulators from May 2014 could constitute insider information, the court said. Critical to the case, Jaede said, was the period from early 2014, when he said VW employees had learned that U.S. tests showed its diesel cars emitted far more toxic nitrogen oxide on the road than under laboratory conditions. There is also the question of who within VW knew what, and when, whether the information would actually have had an impact on the share price had it been made public, and if so, how damages should be calculated, the court added. VW’s board did not see the need to brief investors before September 2015 because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an EPA notice of violation and because VW was in talks about reaching a settlement, the carmaker said in a court filing. It added that board members at the time, including current CEO Herbert Diess and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch, did not violate disclosure rules. Plaintiffs, including fund management firm Deka, allege that managers below management board level, including divisional heads, knew early on about deliberate and systematic cheating. The company was therefore aware of criminal activity and so investors should have been warned earlier, the plaintiffs say.

2018-09-10,"ANKARA (Reuters) - A senior Iranian security official said Tehran will respond to any hostile action against the country and that the era of “hit and run” was over, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Monday.   Iran’s relations with the United States have grown tense since Washington quit a 2015 international nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed sanctions, with the U.S. administration warning it would exert “maximum pressure” on Iran. “The era of hit and run is over in the world and any hostile measure against our country will be responded to by Tehran 10-fold. We are capable of protecting ourselves in every field,” Tasnim quoted Ali Shamkhani, the Secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security council, as saying. “Iran’s recent reaction in Iraq’s Kurdistan was an example of Tehran’s responding to any threat,” he said. Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) fired seven missiles in an attack on Iraq-based Iranian Kurdish dissidents that killed at least 11 people on Saturday, Iranian media quoted the Guards as saying on Sunday. In August, Washington imposed sanctions on the acquisition of U.S. dollars by Iran, and its trade in gold and precious metals. On Nov. 4 Washington will reimpose sanctions on Iran’s oil exports and banking sector. Iran and other signatories of the nuclear deal, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have been working to find a way to salvage the agreement despite U.S. pressures. Iran has called on European powers to accelerate their efforts if they want Tehran to stay in the pact, including measures to guarantee Iranian oil sales. The United States is pushing Iran’s oil buyers to cut their purchases to zero, although it may issue some waivers. Iran’s vice president said such efforts to cut Iran’s crude exports were “nonsense”. “However, there is a possibility of Iran’s oil sales dropping,” Iran’s state TV quoted first Vice-President Eshaq Jahangiri as saying. “But despite all these pressures and hardships, the (Iranian) government is wholeheartedly looking for solutions to defuse America’s plans.” Iran’s economy largely relies on oil sales to China, Japan, South Korea, India and the EU. Several importers of Iranian crude have opposed unilateral U.S. sanctions on Iran, but some have already cut purchases of Iranian oil.

Newspapers Rzeczpospolita and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna earlier reported that JSW might dismiss CEO Daniel Ozon this week, sending shares in the European Union’s biggest coking coal producer down as much as 8.5 percent. The papers said Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski had pressed Ozon to take over construction company Polimex from other state-run companies, including gas firm PGNiG and utilities PGE, Enea and Energa , which helped rescue Polimex from collapse last year. “I was pressed many times to finance with JSW money investments which are completely unrelated with JSW operations. As the CEO, I am to take care of the company, its development and shareholders,” Rzeczpospolita quoted Ozon as saying. Dziennik Gazeta Prawna said the minister had also wanted JSW to help finance the construction of a coal-fueled power plant in Ostroleka, northeast Poland, built by Energa and Enea. “At the moment it is difficult for me to talk about the potential change of the CEO. There is an audit at JSW. At this stage I do not understand the CEO’s behaviour,” Tchorzewski told Reuters in a telephone interview, referring to Ozon’s comments to Rzeczpospolita. He declined to say whether Ozon would be fired this week, adding the agenda for the supervisory board meeting had not been agreed yet. Tchorzewski also said he was not engaged in any talks regarding JSW’s potential investment in Polimex. A JSW spokeswoman declined to comment. Trade unions at JSW sent an open letter to Tchorzewski and prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki, defending the CEO and protesting against his potential dismissal. “JSW cannot be a life ring for other companies that are not doing well,” they said in the letter. Last week, Reuters reported JSW was considering a purchase of Australia’s Prairie Mining. Poland’s ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) has made sweeping changes to the management of state-run companies since coming to power. Ozon was appointed JSW’s CEO in November 2017.

2018-09-10,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - When Austrian energy company OMV started operating its power plant in Turkey in 2013, the country’s electricity sector was the darling of foreign investors, lured by promises of market liberalization and the highest growth forecasts outside China. Five years later, OMV has sold off its Turkish plant for barely half of the 600 million euros it initially invested and Turkey’s power companies are in debt restructuring talks with banks, amid a tumbling lira and rising energy costs. With the promised liberalization only partly delivered, and state-owned plants at times undercutting market prices, private sector firms found their margins squeezed even before the lira  crisis drove up repayment costs on foreign currency loans. “Turkey no longer fits our product portfolio,” said an OMV spokesperson in Vienna. OMV also sold off its wholly owned fuel retailer Petrol Ofisi in 2017, two years after its former CEO described the Turkey investments as “a disappointment”. With their margins squeezed, many power companies are fighting to keep cash flows stable and struggling to find buyers, as the outlook darkens for the Turkish economy and for a still heavily state-regulated electricity market. “We will be seeing cash tightness more frequently. I don’t want to think of a scenario where the private sector or the state is not able to deliver on its pledges,” said an industry source who works in a power generation company. According to a report by Boston Consulting Group and Turkish business group Tusiad, a total of $95 billion of investments have been poured into the Turkish electricity market over the past 15 years, largely funded by cheap credit. Of this, around $50 billion is yet to be repaid. Several Turkish companies, including power firms, are seeking to restructure their debt after the lira lost 40 percent this year due to concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s opposition to higher interest rates and a bitter diplomatic dispute with the United States. Conglomerate Gama Holding is among the latest in talks to sell some of its assets, including a stake in its Gama Energy, which produces electricity from hydro, wind and natural gas with around 1,100 MW installed power across Turkey. Such financing issues risk clouding the outlook even for the renewables sector - a relative bright spot in Turkey’s power market. Fitch Ratings last month downgraded its near-term forecasts for Turkish solar and wind capacity as it expected fewer projects to gain financing in the short run. “It should not be a surprise for (power) companies to file for bankruptcy one after the other,” said a senior manager at a Turkish energy firm. “Many companies are really in a dire situation and they are in a panic to restructure,” he said. Turkish energy officials declined to comment for this story. Turkey has reduced the state’s role in power production through privatizations and also brought power trading onto an exchange to boost transparency. But the government still holds 25 percent of total installed power supply and often offers prices below market levels, effectively setting a ceiling that can defy market fundamentals. The natural gas market has remained largely under state control, hampering further development of the power market. More than 37 percent of the 85,200 MW electricity generation uses natural gas. As a result, power plants fed by natural gas, which have more flexible production levels than renewables and coal-fired plants, are the hardest hit. Turkey’s state pipeline operator Botas has more than doubled prices for gas supplied to power plants, to 1,700 lira per kilowatt hour (KwH) this month from 717 lira last year. But electricity sale prices for those gas-fired power plants have risen much less. The market clearing price at Turkey’s Energy Bourse (EPIAS) rose 67 percent over the same period, while household power prices only rose 33 percent. “Our margins have evaporated. There is no predictability or visibility in the market, which makes it even more difficult for restructuring. And that jeopardizes the financial stability of these companies,” said Selim Guven, Commercial Director of Acwa Power in Turkey. “When you are indirectly subsidizing the manufacturing sector and consumers with cheap electricity, you are damaging the financial sustainability, predictability and the foreign investor appetite in the power industry.” When OMV and other foreign investors flocked to Turkey, its power market looked to be the only one in Europe promising returns, with energy demand forecasts second only to China. Turkey’s overall energy demand still grew at 4.4 percent a year in the decade to 2016, more than twice the global average, BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy said. But Turkey’s recent economic woes have prompted economists to downgrade growth forecasts, and some now see prolonged economic contraction into 2019. Some government measures - including incentives for power plants to use domestic coal to help reduce a $37 billion energy import bill - have damaged price predictability. “You need predictability, consistent state policies, financial stability and access to longer term funding,” Guven said. “At the moment we are struggling in all these aspects.” Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk; Additional reporting by Can Sezer, Kirsti Knolle in Vienna, Orhan Coskun in Ankara; Editing by Gareth Jones",https://uk.reuters.com/article/turkey-currency-energy/once-darling-of-foreign-investors-turkeys-power-market-struggles-idUKL8N1VQ48E,10 Sep 2018,"When Austrian energy company

2018-09-10,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Several armed men attacked the headquarters of Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in the capital Tripoli on Monday, killing at least two staff members, a security official said. In the first attack of its kind against the top managers of Libya’s state oil industry, two of the gunmen were also killed and at least 10 NOC staff wounded, officials said. Security forces said they had regained control of the landmark glass-fronted building in the centre of the city.  The attack came less than a week after a fragile truce halted fierce clashes between rival armed groups in Tripoli, the latest eruption of violence in Libya, which has been in turmoil since a 2011 uprising toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Armed groups regularly block oilfields to make demands but the NOC headquarters had so far been spared the violence. The NOC provides the vast bulk of Libya’s state income and, along with the Tripoli-based central bank, is one of the only state institutions still functioning well amid chaos. No group immediately claimed responsibility for Monday’s attack. But the interior ministry said in a statement initial indications showed the gunmen belonged to Islamic State, which has previously carried out attacks in Tripoli and other Libyan towns and cities. Gunfire rang out in the morning as security forces allied to the Tripoli-based government arrived. “The death toll so far is two killed from NOC staff and two attackers,” said Ahmad Ben Salim, spokesman for the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), one of the most powerful factions in Tripoli. Security forces smashed windows so staff could escape and several people were hurt by shattered glass, witnesses said. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla and his office manager were seen safely leaving the building. Libya has been divided between rival governments and military factions based in the east and west of the country since 2014, causing political deadlock and an economic crisis.  However, the NOC has continued to function relatively normally across Libya, which relies on oil exports for most of its income. Oil production has been hit by attacks on oil facilities and blockades, though last year it partially recovered to around one million barrels per day. Islamist militants have sleeper cells in northern cities as well as mobile units in Libya’s southern desert, according to Libyan and Western officials.   In May, Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the national election commission offices in Tripoli. The group also claimed an attack in 2015 on the Corinthia hotel, a landmark location in Tripoli. The NOC attack came a day after the United Nations said major armed factions had agreed to freeze their positions to extend the ceasefire.

2018-09-10,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have turned bullish again towards crude and fuels, adding a significant number of new long positions in the last two weeks, after spending much of the previous four months liquidating positions. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 47 million barrels in the week to Sept. 4. Fund managers have boosted their net long position by 172 million barrels in the last two weeks, after cutting it by 508 million barrels since April 17, according to regulatory and exchange records. The most recent week saw portfolio managers add to net long positions in Brent (+28 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (+17 million), U.S. heating oil (+4 million) and European gasoil (+3 million). Only U.S. gasoline futures and options saw a small reduction in fund managers’ net long positions last week (-4 million barrels). Net long positions in Brent have jumped by 92 million barrels since Aug. 21 while net positions in WTI are up by 45 million barrels over the same period. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CF2Wia) Fund managers’ combined net long in Brent and WTI has risen to 803 million barrels, from a low of 666 million barrels just two weeks ago, and the highest since early July. During the four months from late April to late August, position changes were led by the liquidation of old long positions rather than the creation of fresh shorts. The last two weeks has seen that reversed, however, with the creation of new long positions leading the market higher. With many stale long positions now liquidated, the U.S. economy still growing strongly, signs of U.S. drilling hitting a peak, and the imminent re-imposition of Iran sanctions, the hedge fund community is becoming bullish again.

2018-09-10,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund has chosen Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Michael Klein as advisers on its planned sale of a stake in petrochemicals firm SABIC to Saudi Aramco, sources familiar with the process said. Citigroup Inc (C.N) has won the mandate to advise Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE, two of the sources said on Monday, while Reuters previously reported that JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley are advising Aramco. Goldman (GS.N), Citigroup and BAML (BAC.N) declined to comment. Michael Klein, whose firm is also known as M. Klein & Company, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. State-owned oil company Aramco plans to buy a controlling stake in SABIC, possibly taking the sovereign Public Investment Fund’s (PIF) entire 70 percent holding. The deal mandate is a major win for Goldman Sachs, which like other Western investment banks has built up its Saudi business to capitalize on the government’s plans to privatize assets and diversify the oil-dominated economy. Klein was previously picked to advise Saudi Arabia on its planned flotation of Saudi Aramco and has experience working on big chemicals deals, including acting for Dow Chemical on its $130 billion merger with DuPont in 2015. Investment banking fees in Saudi Arabia are modest compared to elsewhere, while risks are high, making the SABIC deal an especially coveted prize. Riyadh recently shelved plans to float Aramco and has postponed an airport privatization on which Goldman was advising. Goldman began operating in Riyadh in 2009 and obtained new licenses in 2014 and 2017 that have allowed it to expand. It bought a portion of Aramco’s $10 billion credit facility last year in an attempt to secure a role in the IPO.  Citigroup has also sought to rebuild its presence in Saudi Arabia after an absence of almost 13 years. In January, it won approval to begin investment banking operations there. If Aramco acquires the full SABIC stake, valued at around $70 billion, it will be the kingdom’s biggest M&A deal and provide a boost to the oil major’s downstream business.  SABIC has recently boosted its own holdings, buying a 25 percent stake in Swiss specialty chemical maker Clariant in January. That deal initially faced regulatory delays, but has now been cleared to proceed. The deal will also provide an alternative source of cash to the PIF, after an initial public offering of Aramco that was supposed to raise $100 billion was shelved. Analysts estimate the PIF has around $250 billion worth of assets under management. It said last year that it aims to increase its financial clout to around $400 billion. It already owns stakes in many companies across the kingdom and plans to beef up its overseas expansion, including pledges of $20 billion to a fund with U.S. private equity firm Blackstone and $45 billion to SoftBank’s Vision Fund. Proceeds from the sale of Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth largest petrochemicals company, are likely to help fund planned investments at home and abroad.

A 2 percent jump in Italian shares on soothing budget comments had boosted Europe and Wall Steet was set to start higher, but it felt fragile after a fresh sell-off in China overnight dragged Asia to a new 14-month low. Traders were bracing for a potential escalation in the Sino-U.S. row after U.S. President Donald Trump raised the stakes on Friday. He said he was ready to impose tariffs on virtually all Chinese imports into the United States, threatening duties on another $267 billion of goods in addition to the $200 billion already facing levies. He called on Apple to make its products in the United States. Strong U.S. jobs numbers on Friday had bolstered bets on a higher dollar, with expectations the Federal Reserve will keep raising U.S. interest rates. “It’s more of the same, markets continue to be under pressure from a whole host of headwinds,” said fund manager GAM’s Investment Director of emerging market equities, Tim Love. He pointed to the latest fall in China’s currency, the yuan, which is now down almost 9 percent versus the dollar since April. “You are back to the highly politically charged question - is this currency manipulation or not?” Europe’s resistance to the gloom was led by the jump in Milan after Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said over the weekend that the country’s upcoming budget would help push down the government’s bond market borrowing costs. Stockholm and the Swedish crown strengthened after the nationalist Sweden Democrats gained less ground than polls had predicted in elections on Sunday . The crown rose about 0.6 percent to 10.43 against the euro, while the neighbouring Norwegian crown surged after higher August inflation data cemented expectations that interest rates will go up there next week. The euro made 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.1575 after falling more than half a percent on Friday following the U.S. jobs data. Figures on Friday showed traders’ overall dollar positions making their biggest drop in nearly six months. The pullback comes after speculators had boosted net long bets on the greenback to the highest for more than 1-1/2 years, in late August. “There is an awareness that it is a very crowded trade,” said Karl Schamotta, director of global markets strategy at Cambridge Global Payments. “There are some major uncertainties about just how far U.S. growth outperformance and monetary divergence will go,” he said. The most eyecatching action was in Asia again. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.9 percent to the lowest since July 2017, extending losses from last week when it dropped 3.5 percent for its worst weekly showing since mid-March. Beijing had warned of retaliation if Washington launched any new trade measures. But it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concern it will resort to other measures, such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China. Chinese shares were battered, with the blue-chip index off 1.4 percent. Shanghai’s SSE Composite fell 1.2 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index shed 1.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.3 percent higher after revised second-quarter data showed the world’s third-biggest economy grew at its fastest pace since 2016 . Trump, who is challenging China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union on trade issues, has also expressed displeasure about the large U.S. trade deficit with Japan. The latest 14-month low for emerging-market shares came amid turbulence in Argentina, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and South Africa, where currencies have been routed recently. Some Asian economies are vulnerable, too, Nomura analysts said, with many countries burdened by high private debt. They also noted a “concentration risk” from some of the world’s largest funds’ heavy investments in emerging-market assets. The Indian rupee hit a record low of 72.50 per dollar and Indonesia’s rupiah - Asia’s second-worst performer this year - weakened 0.4 percent, near an all-time low . “Given the latest comments from Trump, investors are likely to see the potential for further depreciation in EM currencies with the trade war cranking up yet another notch,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. There were other areas of fallout from the global trade worries too. The Australian dollar, a proxy for Chinese growth because of the large volume of metals Australia sells to China, hovered near its lowest in 2-1/2 years and was last at $0.7115. Copper, which China hoovers up ferociously, tumbled 1.2 percent, after seeing a 20 percent drop already this year. Gold was lower at $1,193.01 but oil prices bucked the trend, climbing after three straight days of losses as data showed U.S. drilling stalling and with U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports looming in November. U.S. crude futures were up 44 cents at $68.20 per barrel and Brent crude futures added 52 cents to $77.35 a barrel. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney; editing by

A German court ruled last week that Frankfurt, Germany’s financial center, must ban highly-polluting, older diesel vehicles from the city center from next February as part of a plan to improve air quality. The debate over air quality and hardware retrofits has been stoked by reports of persistently high nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in Germany’s largest cities and by Volkswagen’s admission in 2015 that it had rigged diesel emissions tests in the United States with the help of engine control devices.

2018-09-10,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s state-controlled EDF power utility needs to show a new generation nuclear reactors work well, which is not for now the case, new environment minister Francois de Rugy said in remarks published on Monday. De Rugy signalled that any decision on whether to build more plants using the European pressurised reactor (EPR) design would be based on economic factors.  The French government is expected to outline in late October a plan to cut the share of nuclear energy in its electricity production to 50 percent from the current 75 percent, the highest level in the world. It has already said it could take a decade more to get there than an initial target of 2025. Whether that includes the construction of new nuclear reactors has emerged as a politically sensitive issue for President Emmanuel Macron. Last month the previous environment minister Nicolas Hulot, who was widely viewed as an impediment to the nuclear industry’s drive to remain as France’s main power supplier, resigned abruptly. De Rugy, a former Green lawmaker, told Le Monde in the interview his gut feeling was that nuclear power was not an energy source for the future, but added that there should be no “war of religions” on the issue. “The important thing is to know the economic data for both nuclear and renewable energies,” he said. Construction of the first plant in France to use an EPR reactor has run billions of euros over budget and is years behind schedule. Asked whether EDF should build another such plant after it completes the station in Normandy, De Rugy said: “EDF should demonstrate that the EPR works, which is not the case yet. Nobody is able to guarantee a date for its connection to the grid. It also needs to demonstrate the EPR is competitive in terms of costs.” De Rugy also questioned EDF’s corporate structure. “I have a few ideas on the issue,” he said. “I don’t like change for the sake of it but I think the status quo is neither in the state’s interest not that of the company.” Reporting by Brian Love and Jean-Baptiste Vey; editing by Michel Rose and David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-nuclear-edf/update-1-edf-must-prove-nuclear-reactors-viable-french-minister-says-idUKL5N1VW2CW,10 Sep 2018,"France's state-controlled EDF

2018-09-10,"(Reuters) - RPC Group (RPC.L) is in talks on a possible sale to Apollo Global Management (APO.N) and Bain Capital, with the private equity interest in the fast consolidating market lifting shares in Europe’s biggest plastics packaging maker by 25 percent. Private equity has long been drawn by reliable cashflow and growing demand from online shopping, with a spate of takeovers by bigger packaging players further spurring their interest. Apollo and Bain have until Oct. 8 to make a firm offer, Britain’s RPC said after a Bloomberg report that it was exploring options including a sale. “The European plastic packaging market is considerably less consolidated and so therefore there are opportunities to use people like RPC as a platform in order to consolidate,” Panmure Gordon analyst Adrian Kearsey said.  Kearsey added that the more than 26 percent drop in RPC’s share price in the past year provided a value opportunity for the private equity players and analysts at Peel Hunt, who have a buy rating on RPC, expect other private equity bids. Although the buy-out interest comes amid increased scrutiny of plastic waste, brokerage Jefferies said last month that possible British regulations play to RPC strengths, including its limited exposure to single use items like straws and cutlery.   RPC, which operates in 34 countries, had a market capitalisation of 2.78 billion pounds as of Friday, although this rose to 3.48 billion pounds on Monday. The world’s big packaging firms have been active in M&A with Australia’s Amcor Ltd (AMC.AX) agreeing last month to buy U.S. rival Bemis Company Inc (BMS.N) for $5.25 billion, a 25 percent premium to the Bemis’ close on Aug. 2. Among other significant sector consolidation, DS Smith Plc (SMDS.L) agreed to buy Spanish rival Europac (PYCE.MC) for 1.9 billion euros ($2.19 billion), a premium of about 8 percent from its previous day’s close on June 1.  And Ireland’s Smurfit Kappa (SKG.I) bought Dutch recycling firm Reparenco in July. Jefferies expects further bolt-on and major acquisitions in Europe, although Northern Trust Capital markets analyst Paul Moran, who has a “sell” rating on the stock, remained sceptical of RPC being acquired by private equity firms.  “Given the importance to buyout firms of cash generation and stable profit growth, our central view remains a detailed look at the cash generation at RPC will not lead to an acquisition,”  RPC, which has more than 1.1 billion pounds in net debt, has seen its free cash flow dip 4.2 percent to 229 million pounds in the year to March 31. In July RPC, which has been under investor pressure to raise cash and cut capital spending, said it would prioritise the proposed disposal of some assets as it looked to generate capital for expansion or to return money to shareholders. Last month, it said it would raise $95 million by selling its Letica food packaging business, adding that it was marketing its spirits closures business at Bridge of Allan, Scotland to interested parties. It also said then it was preparing to sell its European injection moulding automotive business.      Shares in RPC were up 17.6 percent at 804.2 pence at 1136 GMT.

2018-09-10,"WARSAW, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Poland’s energy ministry plans to fire the chief executive of state-controlled miner JSW at a supervisory board on Thursday following disagreements over strategy, a company source told Reuters on Monday. Newspapers Rzeczpospolita and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna earlier reported that JSW might dismiss CEO Daniel Ozon this week, sending shares in the European Union’s biggest coking coal producer down as much as 8 percent. The energy ministry was not immediately available to comment. A JSW spokeswoman declined to comment. The papers said energy minister Krzysztof Tchórzewski had pressed Ozon to take over construction company Polimex from other state-run companies, including gas firm PGNiG and utilities PGE, Enea and Energa , which helped rescue Polimex from collapse last year. “I was pressed many times to finance with JSW money investments which are completely unrelated with JSW operations. As the CEO, I am to take care of the company, its development and shareholders,” Rzeczpospolita quoted Ozon as saying. Dziennik Gazeta Prawna said the minister had also wanted JSW to help finance the construction of a coal-fueled power plant in Ostroleka, northeast Poland, built by Energa and Enea. Last week, Reuters reported JSW was considering a purchase of Australia’s Prairie Mining.

2018-09-10,"(Reuters) - Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd (GKP.L) is resuming spending on the Shaikan oilfield in the Iraqi region of Kurdistan, the British-listed oil producer said on Monday, while reporting record profit for the first half led by higher output and crude prices. Gulf Keystone has been actively evaluating development options to ramp up production at Shaikan, and targets output from the oilfield of 55,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) in the second half of next year. A gross investment of between $200 million and $230 million would be required to meet that target, the group said, of which it will cover $160 million to $184 million. Average output from Shaikan in the first half of 2018 was 31,861 bpd, at the top end of Gulf Keystone’s target range for 2018 of 27,000 to 32,000 bpd, which remains unchanged. “The resurgence in oil prices also played a role in the global investment community becoming increasingly positive on the prospects for the oil and gas sector,” the company said in a statement. Oil producers have been loosening their purse strings on exploration spending as crude prices have roughly tripled since the 2016 low, ending a period of aggressive cost cuts. Gulf Keystone said on Monday it expected Shaikan output to eventually reach 110,000 bpd, but declined to give any timeline ahead of a field development plan it is due to publish in the fourth quarter. Civil work for the 55,000 bpd project started last month and drilling would commence in the first quarter of 2019 depending on rig availability, the company said, adding that a tendering process for the rig is underway. Shares of Bermuda-based Gulf Keystone rose as much as 5.8 percent in early trade on the London Stock Exchange but gave up some of those gains and were up 3.1 percent at 248.61 pence by 0820 GMT.  The share price has more than doubled this year, after the company reported its first profit in 2017 since entering Kurdistan. The company said profit from operations was $26.6 million in the six months ended June 30, compared with $6.3 million a year earlier.

2018-09-10,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in northern Japan last week rose to 44, with 660 injured, the government said on Monday, as electricity supply remained short and top automaker Toyota suspended work at most of its assembly plants. The pre-dawn, 6.7-magnitude quake on Thursday temporarily paralyzed the island of Hokkaido, cutting off access by air and train and knocking out power to an island the size of Austria. About 2,500 people remain in evacuation centers, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, after landslides buried houses and rain at the weekend loosened soil in a further threat to unstable houses. Yoshihide Suga, the top government spokesman, said a team of about 40,000 Self-Defense Force troops, police, firefighters and others were working on clearing debris and other clean-up operations. There were no more missing residents, he said. Power supply has been restored to nearly all customers in Hokkaido but trade minister Hiroshige Seko called on the island’s businesses and 5.3 million residents to use about 20 percent less energy to prevent further blackouts.  “It’s very important now for all residents, businesses, the government, and electricity suppliers to work together towards this goal of 20 percent energy-saving,” Seko told a news conference late on Sunday.  The government has no plans for rolling blackouts on Monday and Tuesday despite the continued closure of a fossil fuel-fired power plant that supplies about half the island’s power, he said. With electricity restored, Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) said on Monday its parts factory in Tomakomai, Hokkaido, which builds transmissions and other components, was preparing to resume production during the night shift. However, the fallout has already spread beyond the island, with Toyota suspending production at 16 of its 18 domestic car assembly plants on Monday to assess its parts inventory. The automaker said it would gradually restore production from Tuesday, resuming work fully by Thursday.

2018-09-10,"VLADIVOSTOK, Russia, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Plans by Russia’s power company Rushydro to join a new aluminium smelter project that Rusal wants to build in Siberia, have been complicated by international sanctions, Rushydro’s head Nikolai Shulginov said on Monday. Rusal, ranked the world’s No.2 aluminium producer after China’s Hongqiao, started work on the Taishet project in 2006. The project was mothballed in 2009 due to weak aluminium prices, but dusted off last year last year as prices recovered. In April, Rushydro’s board approved the move to join the project with total investments seen at around $1 billion. The United States imposed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Rusal’s former president Oleg Deripaska, and the 12 companies they own or control in April, in response to what it termed “malign activities” by Russia. “The thing is that the situation has been changed,” Shulginov told reporters at a newly launched power station. “Several months ago, before the sanctions had been toughened, we were at the stage of taking the decision on joining the project under certain conditions.” The sanctions caused havoc in the global aluminium market, prompting several countries and companies to successfully lobby Treasury for a softening of the terms on Rusal, which last year accounted for more than 6 percent of global aluminium supplies estimated at around 63 million tonnes. “Now, taking the sanctions into account, everything has changed. We have to get back, maybe to recalculate our model: what will happen to the aluminium prices, to the electricity prices... There are lots of ‘buts’,” Shulginov said. Russia’s state development bank VEB has put financing for the construction of Taishet aluminium smelter on stand-by but has not suspended the deal. Taishet was expected to raise a total of $1 billion in financing, 30 percent of which would be granted by VEB, the organiser of a syndicate of lenders. It is designed to produce 428,500 tonnes of aluminium per year.

Chinese shares weakened, with the blue-chip index off 0.6 percent while Shanghai’s SSE Composite stumbled 0.4 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped 0.8 percent. On Friday, Wall Street stocks ended lower while world share indexes registered their biggest weekly declines in almost six months after Trump threatened tariffs on a further $267 billion worth of Chinese imports, on top of earlier promises to levy duties on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Beijing has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures, but it is running out of room to match them dollar-for-dollar, raising concerns it could resort to other measures such as weakening the yuan or taking action against U.S. companies in China. “The overall sense is that the United States will continue to escalate the pressure until China submits to U.S. demands which does not seem likely any time soon,” JPMorgan said in a note. “Overall, the impact of tariffs and high levels of uncertainty will both continue to weigh on markets into the end of the year.” Chinese trade data released on Saturday could give Trump more reason to turn up the heat. China’s trade surplus with the United States widened to a record in August. Trump, who is challenging China, Mexico, Canada and the European Union on trade issues, has now expressed displeasure about his country’s large trade deficit with Japan. Also weighing on global shares was the prospect of faster rate rises by the Federal Reserve after data on Friday showed U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years. The Fed is all but certain to raise rates a third time this year in late September. The strong employment report boosted the dollar, which held on to Friday’s gains at 95.43. The index is up 3.5 percent so far this year. “The overall trend for the U.S. economy remains positive,” said Lachlan McPherson, Senior Investment Consultant at Charles Schwab Australia. McPherson expects the U.S. equity bull market to remain intact although there were some near-term risks. “Trade uncertainty remains a significant concern for future business investment plans. That uncertainty could result in more stock market volatility as investors worry that the Fed may move too far in its normalisation campaign.” Investors will next focus on U.S. inflation for August due Thursday and a stronger number could once again send the dollar surging. The Australian dollar, a proxy for emerging market growth, hovered near its lowest in 2-1/2 years. The currency fell 1.3 percent on Friday and was last at $0.7107.

2018-09-10,"OSLO, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Global oil demand will peak in 2023 as electric vehicles (EVs) become competitive with cars fuelled by petrol and diesel, and after 2040 no new oil developments will likely be needed, quality assurance and risk management firm DNV GL said on Monday. The forecast from the Norway-headquartered firm, which offers certification and consultancy services to around 100,000 customers globally, adds to investors’ worries about some oil assets becoming stranded if demand enters into permanent decline. “Amid declining consumption in the future, we see little scope for adding capacity in high-cost areas, such as in the Arctic,” DNV GL said in its long-term forecast, highlighting such a risk. By around mid-2030s, EVs will account for half of all new light-duty vehicles sold in the world, and 10 years later half of all road transport, light and heavy, will be electric, it added. The transport sector is the main user of oil. “After 2040 we will likely enter a period where new oil fields are not required to replace depleted fields,” DNV GL said, adding that by 2050 oil demand is expected to be about a half of its peak. Demand for natural gas is expected to grow until the mid-2030s, when capital spending on non-fossil energy will overtake spending on fossil energy, DNV GL said in its report. “The attention of boardrooms and cabinets should be fixed on the dramatic energy transition that is unfolding,” said Remi Eriksen, the group’s president and chief executive. Investors are increasingly worried that some oil and gas assets could be left in the ground as a result of stricter regulations to curb carbon emissions and the fall in costs of renewable energy and car batteries. Oil majors have different views on possible oil demand peak, but all say that even if demand peaks, trillions of dollars of investments in oil and gas will still be needed to develop new barrels due to the natural decline of existing fields. Exxon Mobil, the world’s largest listed oil company, said on Feb. 2 that oil demand could fall by 25 percent to around 78 million barrels per day (mbd) from the current levels if governments choose to implement measures to limit global warming. The company, however, did not disclose how efforts to limit carbon emissions would impact its business. In a separate report it said that excluding those climate measures, oil demand is expected to grow by 20 percent by 2040, driven by commercial transport and the chemical industry. In April, Anglo-Dutch Shell said it saw little risk of having “stranded assets” in its portfolio, because four-fifths of its current oil and gas reserves would be extracted before 2030. Shell, which has been producing oil since 1907, sees the oil demand peaking as early as the end of the next decade, while its London-based peer BP sees it coming a decade later. The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises industrialized nations on energy policy, sees oil demand rising to 105 mbd by 2040 under its central New Policies scenario, based on existing legislation and announced plans.

2018-09-10,"* US rig count has stagnated since May: tmsnrt.rs/2NsKwpc * US sanctions against Iran’s oil sector tighten market -FGE By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Sept 10 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday as the number of U.S. rigs drilling for new production was cut last week and as the market is expected to tighten once U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports kick in from November. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.09 per barrel at 0055 GMT, up 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last settlement. Brent crude futures climbed 42 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $77.25 a barrel. U.S. energy companies cut two oil rigs last week, bringing the total count to 860, energy services firm Baker Hughes said on Friday. The U.S. rig count has stagnated since May, after staging a recovery since 2016, which followed a steep slump the previous year amid plummeting crude prices. Outside the United States, new U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports from November were helping push up prices. Energy consultancy FGE said several major Iran customers like India, Japan and South Korea were already cutting back on Iran crude. “Governments can talk tough. They can say they are going to stand up to Trump and/or push for waivers. But generally the companies we speak to ... say they won’t risk it,” FGE said. “U.S. financial penalties and the loss of shipping insurance scares everyone,” it said in a note to clients. With U.S. rig activity stalling and Iran sanctions looming, the oil market outlook is tightening. “Investors have largely turned positive again ... likely welcoming the return of backwardation,” said Edward Bell, commodity analyst at Emirates NBD bank. Backwardation describes a market in which prices for immediate delivery are higher than those for later dispatch. It is considered a sign of tight conditions giving traders an incentive to sell oil immediately instead of storing it. The Brent backwardation between October this year and mid-2019 is currently around $2.2 per barrel. One key question going forward is how demand develops amid the trade disputes between the United States and China as well as general emerging market weakness. NBD’s Bell said “we don’t expect that currency weakness in several emerging markets will pose a risk to oil market fundamentals as the weakness in both India and China, the two markets most vital from an oil market perspective, has been relatively contained.” Consultancy FGE, however, warned that “trade wars, and especially rising interest rates, can spell trouble for the emerging markets that drive (oil) demand growth”. Despite this, FGE said the likelihood of significantly weaker oil prices was relatively low as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would withhold output to prevent prices from plunging. “We feel confident OPEC can and will deal with slowing demand. We see $65 per barrel as a trigger for cuts,” FGE said. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-09-10,"(Adds details on oil prices, background) By Timothy Gardner and Maria Kiselyova WASHINGTON/MOSCOW, Sept 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will meet counterparts from Saudi Arabia and Russia starting on Monday, sources familiar with the matter said, as the Trump administration encourages oil-producing countries to keep output up two months before it is due to renew sanctions on Iran’s crude exports. Perry will meet Khalid al-Falih, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister, and other officials from the kingdom, the world’s largest oil exporter, in Washington on Monday morning, a U.S. government source said. The U.S. energy secretary will also meet with Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Thursday in Moscow, the U.S. source and a diplomatic source said. High oil prices are a political risk for President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans in Nov. 6 congressional elections. Global oil prices have risen to more than $76 a barrel in recent weeks on concerns about sanctions on Iran’s oil exports that Washington will renew on Nov. 4. Trump withdrew the United States in May from the nuclear deal with Iran, and he is pushing consuming countries to cut their purchases of Iranian oil to zero. The administration may issue some waivers, but some countries, including India, have already reduced purchases of the oil ahead of the sanctions. Perry will be the most senior U.S. official to visit Russia since Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July to try to improve ties that have dipped to a post-Cold War low. Moscow and Washington are at odds over U.S. accusations of Russian meddling in U.S. politics, Syria, Ukraine and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain. Officials from the United States and Russia, two of the world’s largest oil and natural gas producers, formerly met regularly to discuss energy issues. Those meetings stopped in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea. Trump has said he wants to improve ties, but his administration is considering imposing new sanctions on Moscow, as is the U.S. Congress. Novak has said the United States should not be permitted to impose such sanctions without a vote of the U.N. Security Council, of which Russia is a permanent member. Perry and Novak, who last met in June in Washington, will likely discuss Russia’s Nord Stream 2 pipeline project to carry Russian gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. Trump and former U.S. President Barack Obama have criticized the project, saying it would increase Russian influence in Europe, but Germany supports the pipeline. Perry and Novak are also expected to discuss oil market cooperation between OPEC, of which Saudi Arabia is the largest producer, and non-OPEC countries, including Russia. OPEC and non-OPEC officials will meet later this month to discuss proposals for sharing an oil output increase, after the groups decided in June to boost output moderately. Perry, al-Falih and Darren Woods, the chief executive of ExxonMobil Corp, were introduced on Saturday to the crowd at a Texas A&M University football game in College Station, Texas. All three graduated from the university.
