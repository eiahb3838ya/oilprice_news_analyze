2018-06-11,"(Reuters) - Qatar on Monday officially filed a complaint at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), also known as the World Court, arguing that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has violated the United Nations treaty that forbids racial discrimination. Qatar asked the court to grant provisional measures barring the United Arab Emirates from various actions it says discriminate against Qataris in UAE, including limiting their freedom of speech and movement, inciting hatred against them, shutting down local offices of Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera television station and blocking transmission of Qatari media outlets. bit.ly/2sNbA72 The court’s registry confirmed it has received the complaint, the first step in a dispute which the court may hear. Qatar cited violations of the 1966 International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as the basis for the court’s jurisdiction. UAE officials could not immediately be reached for comment late Monday.  The court typically will solicit opinions from both sides as to whether it has jurisdiction over a dispute before it considers the merits of a case, a process that often takes years. The ICJ is the UN’s court for resolving disputes between nations.

2018-06-11,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest pipeline operator, Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO), said on Monday it was taking steps to address complaints from oil shipper BP PLC (BP.L) about abrupt changes it made in allocating space on its Mainline system. The company announced the policy change late last month before reversing it last week, after it caused panic among shippers and dramatically increased a discount on Canadian heavy crude. Enbridge had intended to change how it verifies shippers’ oil supplies before dividing up capacity on the Mainline to prevent shippers from overestimating how much crude they had to move, a problem known as “air barrels.” In a letter to Canadian regulator the National Energy Board (NEB), Enbridge said it would not use the revised system in August, and had no plans to do so thereafter. The company also said, in response to BP’s concerns, that it would not implement any further changes during the trading period - the first three weeks of the month prior to shipment when sales and scheduling decisions are made. Enbridge said it would give shippers at least one calendar month’s notice of future changes. Enbridge said in light of its actions, there should be no need for the NEB to continue a process of receiving industry feedback on the situation.  BP could not be immediately reached.

2018-06-11,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. unit of Venezuela’s state-run oil producer PDVSA [PDVSA.UL] is increasing purchases of crude on the open market because it cannot get sufficient deliveries from its struggling parent company, traders said on Monday. Citgo Petroleum has been buying crude from multiple countries worldwide as PDVSA has been unable to comply with the contractual volume of heavy crude due to falling output and port congestion slowing deliveries, according to the traders. Declining oil production, lawsuits by creditors, shortages of spare parts for terminals and executive braindrain have all reduced PDVSA’s ability to export oil. Most recently, U.S.-based ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) actions to seize PDVSA assets to cash in on a $2 billion (£1.5 billion) arbitration award have added to the firm’s export issues. Crude exports are Venezuela’s main source of revenue, but the OPEC member has seen deliveries fall sharply in the last few months, dropping to 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) in May from 1.24 million bpd in April, according to Thomson Reuters trade flows data. Citgo in recent weeks has been buying Colombian and Ecuadorean heavy crude on the spot market, as well as Azeri Light from the Black Sea region and Arab heavy and medium crudes, according to the Reuters data and traders.       From January through April, Citgo was the customer most affected by PDVSA’s inability to fulfil its contracts, according to the Venezuelan company’s internal data. PDVSA’s oil output this year has fallen to 1.62 million bpd, a 33-year low. Citgo has a 273,000-bpd contract to import Venezuelan Merey crude from PDVSA, but PDVSA has not sent a single cargo of that grade in over a month, forcing Citgo to buy spot cargoes of diluted crude oil (DCO) from joint ventures, according to the traders and Reuters data. PDVSA has sent other grades, including Corocoro and Pedernales, but only in small volumes. “They are mainly looking for Latin American heavy grades,” said a trader who sold two spot crude cargoes to Citgo for June delivery. Citgo can process up to 749,000 bpd of crude in three U.S. refineries. In the past, PDVSA supplied as much as 40 percent of Citgo’s crude requirements, but volumes have been slowly declining for years. The subsidiary has a “contingency plan” for diversifying imports if Venezuelan supply declines further, according to a Citgo employee, who declined to be identified as the information was private. The plan has not yet been activated, the person added. As of June 11, PDVSA had 23 million barrels worth of crude to be shipped from the port of Jose and through new ship-to-ship (STS) transfers off its Paraguana Refining Center (CRP), according to Reuters vessel tracking and trade flows data. Since early June, PDVSA has been notifying customers about its need to employ STS operations. The backlog has decreased to 72 vessels this week from over 80 tankers last week, according to Reuters data, as PDVSA has focused on loading the largest vessels first and rejected nominations for receiving new tankers in June until it finishes loading those already in line. “Each STS operation is taking almost a week,” said a shipping source. “Costs are higher, special vessels are needed and PDVSA operators have to be moved from other ports. It’s a lot of work.” Large tankers chartered by Valero Energy (VLO.N), Vitol, Nayara Energy ESRO.M3 and Reliance Energy (RELI.NS) of India, and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) were waiting on Monday near Jose port for crude. ConocoPhillips’ bid to claim $2 billion from arbitration led to a tanker backlog representing nearly a month’s worth of shipments at its main terminal. GRAPHIC - PDVSA's noncompliance with oil supply contracts: tmsnrt.rs/2JqWNoI Citgo was expecting to receive about 6 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude in June, one of the traders said. Instead, it imported a 516,000-barrel cargo of DCO that discharged last week and several other cargoes of the same grade have set sail to its refineries, according to the Reuters data. The pressure for Venezuelan oil eased up slightly in early June as Citgo’s 157,500-bpd Corpus Christi refinery halted its fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) due to a fire. But declining production of upgraded crude at PDVSA’s joint ventures in the Orinoco Belt, the country’s largest producing region, has limited the barrels Citgo normally could access in place of Merey. Of four crude ventures that process up to 620,000 bpd of oil for exports, two are undergoing maintenance and a third is expected to start major maintenance later this month, according to two sources close to the projects.

2018-06-11,"(Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended slightly higher on Monday as investors shook off the weekend’s chaotic G7 summit ahead of a week packed with diplomatic events, and a pair of U.S. Treasury Department auctions met with strong demand.  Investors’ bullishness on a positive outcome from Tuesday’s scheduled summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un helped the S&P 500 rise, led by gains in utility Sempra Energy. [.N] Trump, in Singapore for the summit, said the historic meeting could “work out very nicely” as the countries try to narrow differences on how to end a nuclear standoff on the Korean peninsula.  “No one expects anything concrete to come of the meeting ... but if the tone is positive afterwards, it won’t be a headwind for stocks,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities in New York.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 5.78 points, or 0.02 percent, to 25,322.31, the S&P 500 gained 2.97 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,782 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.41 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,659.93. Sempra proved the biggest driver of the S&P’s rally, closing the day up 15.55 percent to $117.20, after two key shareholders recommended six new directors for the company’s board and urged a strategic review of its business.       U.S. Treasury yields climbed as the Treasury Department sold $54 billion in new coupon-bearing supply, and on the expectation that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates on Wednesday.  Demand was strong for the Treasury Department’s $32 billion sale of three-year notes and $22 billion sale of 10-year notes. The three-year notes sold at a high yield of 2.664 percent, just below where they traded before the auction. Indirect bidders, which include fund managers, some central banks and other investors, took their largest share of the auction since January. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 2.949 percent, up from 2.935 percent late last week. The 30-year bond last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.091 percent, up from 3.082 percent on Friday. Markets seemed willing to abide a rowdy G7 summit over the weekend in anticipation of the North Korea meeting and other diplomatic and policy events this week.  Trump upset the Group of Seven’s efforts to show a united front, choosing to back out of a previous joint communique. The action drew criticism from Germany and France, and Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.”  The Canadian dollar fell about 0.45 percent on the news to C$1.2986, while the Mexican peso shed 1.39 percent to 20.576 pesos per U.S. Dollar. By and large, though, “markets are generally overlooking negative takeaway” from the G7 meeting, said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.  Instead, they are looking ahead to a busy week. Tuesday’s North Korea summit will be followed by meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is expected to raise rates, and the European Central Bank - as well as a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament. Also helping calm markets were comments from Italy’s new coalition government that it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt.  The statements pushed Italian stocks .FTMIB up more than 3.4 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.72 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.26 percent. The prospect of Italy remaining in the euro zone also sent Italian borrowing costs down sharply, as the euro rallied 0.15 percent to $1.1784, not far off a two-week high of $1.1840.

2018-06-11,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were little changed on Monday as comments from the Iraqi oil minister cast doubt as to whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would decide to boost output at its upcoming meeting.  Global benchmark Brent crude LCOc1 was unchanged to settle at $76.46 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 rose 36 cents to settle at $66.07, its highest level since June 1. U.S. crude’s relative gains were the result of profit-taking on the wide spread between the two benchmarks, said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois. Oil had some support thanks to gains in the equities market, analysts said. All three major U.S. stock indexes were trading in positive territory on Monday, just hours ahead of the meeting in Singapore between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Prices were also weighing uncertainty on OPEC supply hikes.  For 18 months, OPEC and its allies have curbed production in the hopes of stabilizing markets and supporting prices. The group is set to meet June 22-23 in Vienna and decide how to move forward with its supply curb policy against the backdrop of tumbling Venezuelan output and looming sanctions against Iran, the third-largest OPEC producer. “Last week, we saw some news stories indicating that the Trump administration had asked OPEC to increase oil production. But the week went out and we saw those stories walk back. And now we’re seeing a number of OPEC producers who are in favour of the status quo,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow and Associates in Houston. Iraq’s Oil Minister Jabar al-Luaibi said that prices still require support and stability, and producers “should not over-exaggerate” the oil market’s need for more supplies. According to a statement, the minister also “rejects unilateral decisions by some oil producers without consulting the rest of the members” of the agreement. Top exporter Saudi Arabia told OPEC that it raised oil output to slightly more than 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, a source familiar with the matter said, but still within its agreed target. Even as OPEC trims output, production from non-OPEC members, including the United States and Russia, is rising. Russian news agency Interfax said on Saturday that the country’s production had surpassed its target, hitting 11.1 million bpd in early June.  In the United States, the number of new rigs drilling for oil rose by one last week to 862, its highest since March 2015, data from energy services company Baker Hughes showed. [RIG/U] That suggests U.S. output, already at a record 10.8 million bpd, will climb further.

2018-06-11,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bailing out nuclear and coal-fired power plants will not toughen the U.S. power grid against cyber attacks as the Trump administration claims, according to cyber experts, because hackers have a wide array of options for hitting electric infrastructure and nuclear facilities that are high-profile targets. U.S. President Donald Trump this month directed Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take emergency steps to stem a surge in coal and nuclear plant retirements in recent years, arguing that more shutdowns would leave the country less able to bounce back from disruptions caused by storms, physical attacks, and hackers. The announcement came as the National Security Council debated a Department of Energy (DOE) memo that said cyber and physical threats are “minimized” at nuclear and coal plants because they can store months of fuel on site to survive a supply cut – unlike natural gas facilities that rely on pipeline networks, or wind and solar installations that need the right weather. While the administration had been arguing for months that “fuel secure” facilities were important to America’s ability to rebound from storms and physical attacks, its efforts to link plant closures with protection from cyber attacks appeared to open a new front in its support for the coal and nuclear industries. Chris Bronk, a professor of computer and information systems at the University of Houston, said he could not endorse the idea. “I don’t see where a policy of keeping open aging infrastructure that would shut unless there was federal markets intervention keeps us any safer from cyber attacks,” he said. Bronk said coal plants, train deliveries and transmission systems are just as susceptible to hackers as gas pipelines, and added that, while nuclear facilities are tough targets, the stakes involved in a successful nuclear cyber attack are enormous - potentially involving an accident that leaks radioactivity and hits surrounding communities. Nuclear power backers stress that reactors are protected from hackers by so called “air gaps” isolating them from unsecured networks.  But Bronk said air gaps are not impervious to attackers that may seek to gain information such as worker and maintenance schedules from administrative networks over long periods of time. “Those are the control systems that frighten me to no end,” Bronk said.  Sergio Caltagirone, the director of threat intelligence at cyber security company Dragos, agreed that bailing out nuclear and coal plants offers little protection.  “I do not expect this policy shift to deliver any additional cyber security resilience based on the threats we’re actively monitoring,” Caltagirone said. A DOE official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the agency recognizes that cyber security risk permeates every energy source.  But the official said there is concern that natural gas’s role has grown too rapidly in the last decade, making the grid vulnerable to hacks on pipelines that could knock out 10 to 15 natural gas plants “in one fell swoop.” While the administration talks about gas pipelines, nuclear plants have also been attacked.  In March, the Trump administration blamed Russia for seeking to penetrate multiple types of infrastructure including nuclear, water and manufacturing.  And last July, news reports said Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp, which runs a nuclear power plant in Kansas, had been targeted by hackers. Wolf Creek said there was no operational damage and sensitive systems were separate from the corporate network.  Ben Garber, a cyber security engineer for Ultra Electronics, 3eTI, said the government should put greater focus on encouraging power utilities to strengthen security against attacks, as it has with the financial and health industries. The DOE said in February it is forming an office of cyber security to do that. Trump’s fiscal year 2019 budget included $96 million to fund it but Trump has not yet nominated a leader to run it. Cameron Camp, a researcher at Slovakian anti-virus software maker ESET said the push to subsidize coal and nuclear seemed more about saving blue collar energy jobs than boosting resiliency.  “It’s trying to kill multiple birds with one stone, rather than take a holistic view of the structural problems with the grid itself,” said Camp.

2018-06-11,"LONDON, June 11 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Keeping healthy could become more costly as climate change and water scarcity cause a huge drop in the global production of vegetables and legumes, scientists said on Monday. The amount of vegetables produced could fall by more than a third, especially in hot regions like southern Europe and swathes of Africa and South Asia, said researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. By analysing studies across 40 countries, with some dating as far back as 1975, they found that hikes in greenhouses gases, water scarcity and global temperatures lowered the amount of vegetables and legumes produced. Such drastic changes could drive up the prices of vegetables, which would affect poorer communities the most, according to the study, which was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. “If we take a ‘business as usual’ approach, environmental changes will substantially reduce the global availability of these important foods,” said Alan Dangour, a co-author of the paper, which is the first of its kind, in a statement. Scientists have warned that world temperatures are likely to rise by 2 degrees to 4.9 degrees Celsius this century compared with pre-industrial times. This could lead to dangerous weather patterns - including more frequent and powerful droughts, floods and storms - increasing the pressure on agriculture. Food production itself is a major contributor to climate change. Agriculture, forestry and changes in land use together produce nearly a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, making them the second largest emitter after the energy sector, said the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation. The volume of food transported around the world also is exacerbating global warming. The global demand for food is expected to soar as the world’s population is projected to grow to 9.8 billion people by 2050, up from 7.6 billion today, according to the U.N. Crops now take up 11 percent of the world’s land surface, and livestock grazing covers 26 percent of ice-free land, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Farming accounts for about 70 percent of all water used globally, said the OECD. Water scarcity already affects more than 40 percent of the world’s population, according to the U.N. That number is expected to rise due to global warming, with one in four people projected to face chronic or recurring shortages by 2050, the U.N. said. “Urgent action needs to be taken, including working to support the agriculture sector to increase its resilience to environmental changes,” said Dangour. “And this must be a priority for governments across the world.” Reporting by Lin Taylor @linnytayls, Editing by Jared Ferrie;

2018-06-11,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr urged Iraqis on Monday to unite rather than squabble over a possible rerun of the election his bloc won last month, a message apparently meant to defuse political tension after a ballot box storage depot caught fire. Certain parties are trying to drag Iraq into civil war, Sadr said, adding that he would not participate in one. Parliament has mandated a manual recount of the election in which a number of parties alleged fraud. A storage site holding half of Baghdad’s ballot boxes went up in flames on Sunday in what Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi denounced as a “plot to harm the nation and its democracy”. An Iraqi court ordered the arrest of four people accused of setting fire to the storage site, state television reported. Three of them were policemen and one an employee of the Independent High Elections Commission. Iraqi authorities said the ballot boxes were saved but the fire has added to fears of violence. “What Moqtada said about (Iraq) being close to some sort of armed conflict is concerning. The situation is tense and it seems to be on the brink of conflict,” said Renad Mansour, research fellow at Chatham House in London. Sadr, a Shi’ite cleric who once led violent campaigns against the U.S. occupation that ended in 2011, has emerged as a nationalist opponent of powerful Shi’ite Muslim parties allied with neighbouring Iran.  “Stop fighting for seats, posts, gains, influence, power, and rulership,” he wrote in an article published by his office. “Is it not time to stand as one for building and reconstruction, instead of burning ballot boxes or repeating elections just for one seat or two?” Sadr has in the past mobilised tens of thousands of followers to protest government policies he opposed. The election, which was the first since the defeat of Islamic State militants who seized a third of Iraq in 2014, raised hopes that Iraqis could put aside sectarian divisions to rebuild.  One of Sadr’s top aides said on Sunday the fire was intended either to force a rerun of the election or to conceal fraud. But a repeat of the election is unlikely, analysts say, as none of the top parties have endorsed this step, and many incumbent lawmakers have lost their seats and thus lack legitimacy in the eyes of the public. The Supreme Federal Court is the only entity that has the right to decide on a repeat, not the government or parliament, Abadi’s spokesman said on Monday. A spokesman for Hadi al-Amiri, whose Fatih alliance of groups linked to pro-Iran Shi’ite militias came second in the election behind Sadr’s bloc, said he did not favour a repeat. “The middle of the road solution is a manual recount,” said Karim al-Nuri, referring to the fraud allegations.  Some of Iran’s other supporters, such as former prime minister Nuri al-Maliki, whose bloc performed below expectations in the election, would benefit.  At the same time, a recount might harm Iran in other ways. Tehran is accused by some parties in two provinces of helping a Kurdish party allied with it commit election fraud. “Iran would have preferred if Fatih and (Maliki’s) State of Law (list) had done better than Sadr so any kind of redo where a different scenario comes out is better for Iran,” said Mansour. “It is not an ideal situation for Iran and they might support a redo, but actually a recount might implicate them if the allegations in the north are correct.” In the election, Iraq used an electronic vote-counting system for the first time. Some Iraqi politicians had argued that the manual recount was necessary to make sure that the electronic system did not hide fraud. Miru Systems, the Korean company that provided the electronic equipment, said there was nothing wrong with it. “We have checked our election device provided to Iraq after the fraud allegation erupted, and found out that there have been no malfunction in the device nor its system,” said a spokesman. Abadi has blamed the Independent High Elections Commission, which introduced the electronic system, for what he said were dangerous violations, and parliament voted to suspend the board of commissioners and replace them with judges. The commission opposes the recount decision and has appealed against it but the judiciary has already started implementing parliament’s measures, naming a new head for the commission from within its ranks on Monday. “There is a lack of clarity as to who is in charge, what procedure is the legal procedure. Everyone is doing their own thing. The government institutions meant to monitor this process are neither independent nor powerful,” said Mansour.

2018-06-11,"June 11 (Reuters) - Global liquefied natural gas (LNG) trade grew by 10 percent last year due primarily to growing liquefaction capacity in the Australia and the United States, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday. LNG trade reached 38.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2017, up 3.5 bcfd from 2016 and the largest annual volume increase on record, the EIA said, citing the Annual Report on LNG trade by the International Association of Liquefied Natural Gas Importers (GIIGNL). New liquefaction export capacity commissioned in Australia, the United States and Russia, collectively added 3.4 bcfd of liquefaction capacity. Russia’s new capacity only came online in December. The world’s first floating liquefaction plant, Malaysia’s 0.2-bcfd PFLNG Satu, was also commissioned in 2017, EIA said. Including additions in the United States and Australia, liquefaction projects currently under construction are projected to increase global capacity by 13.5 bcfd by 2022, EIA said. One billion cubic feet of natural gas is enough to fuel about five million U.S. homes for a day. In 2017, there were 19 LNG exporting countries and 40 importing countries. Besides Australia and the United States, EIA said several other countries also increased LNG exports in 2017, including Angola, Nigeria, Malaysia, Algeria, Russia and Brunei, which together added another 1.4 bcfd of exports. That more than offset a combined decline of 0.6 bcfd in exports from Qatar, Indonesia, Norway, Peru, the United Arab Emirates and Trinidad, the EIA said. Asian countries led growth in global LNG imports, accounting for 74 percent, or 2.6 bcfd, of the increase in 2017. Japan remained the largest LNG importer at 11.0 bcfd in 2017. China had the largest growth in LNG imports globally at 1.5 bcfd and became the world’s second-largest LNG importer at 5.2 bcfd in 2017, surpassing South Korea. LNG imports also increased in South Korea, Pakistan, Taiwan, and Thailand, which collectively added 1.0 bcfd. Europe increased its LNG imports by 1.4 bcfd, primarily in Spain, Italy, Portugal, France, and Turkey. In North America, Mexico’s LNG imports increased by 17 percent as the country continued to rely on LNG supplies amid declining domestic production and construction delays in infrastructure connecting the Mexican domestic grid to gas pipeline exports from the United States.

2018-06-11,"MAPUTO (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Mozambique said Americans should consider leaving a northeastern district close to a major gas field as imminent attacks are likely after suspected Islamist militants beheaded 10 people and killed seven others since May. Any sign of militant activity is a concern for the country’s fledgling gas industry and the area around the town of Palma near the Tanzanian border where the attacks took place is close to one of the world’s biggest untapped offshore gas fields. “We strongly advise American citizens in the district headquarters of Palma to consider departing the area immediately,” the embassy said on its website, warning of the “likelihood of imminent attacks.” More than $30 billion (£22.4 billion) is expected to be invested in Mozambique’s natural gas sector to build capacity to produce 20 million tonnes per year of LNG, with the first exports from the fields discovered seven years ago due to start after 2021.   Anadarko Petroleum is seeking to raise a record $14-$15 billion from banks and export credit agencies for its huge liquefied natural gas (LNG) project there, sources close to the matter said in May. “We take very seriously any potential threat to the safety of our employees and we continue to closely monitor the situation in the Palma area,” Anadarko said in an email reply to questions. The company declined to comment on reports it had suspended work on its massive LNG project in the war-scarred southeastern African country.  The Interfax Global Energy website, citing local sources,  said militant attacks had caused work at the LNG site in Palma to be suspended.     Six men wielding machetes killed at least seven people and injured four others this month in the predominantly Muslim region close to the Tanzanian border and 10 were beheaded last month. Mozambique has not been a focal point of Islamist militant activity in the past and police have been reluctant to ascribe the attacks to Islamists.

2018-06-11,"June 11 (Reuters) - Stocks in the U.S. and Europe edged up on Monday as investors shook off the weekend’s chaotic G7 summit ahead of a week packed with diplomatic events, while the euro neared a two-week high on reassuring news from Italy. A historic summit scheduled for Tuesday between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un helped the S&P 500 rise, helped by gains in utility Sempra Energy. Trump, in Singapore for the summit, said the meeting could “work out very nicely” as the countries try to narrow differences on how to end a nuclear stand-off on the Korean peninsula. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.85 points, or 0.19 percent, to 25,364.38, the S&P 500 gained 8.63 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,787.66 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.43 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,664.94. Sempra Energy proved the biggest driver of the S&P’s rally, surging 15.4 percent s of 11:51 a.m. ET, after two key shareholders recommended six new directors for the company’s board and urged a strategic review of its business. The North Korea summit will be followed by meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, as well as a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament. Risky assets were well supported on Monday after comments from Italy’s new coalition government, saying it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt. The statements pushed Italian stocks up more than 3.5 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.82 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.42 percent. The gains came despite a Group of Seven summit over the weekend in which Trump upset the G7’s efforts to show a united front, backing out of a previous agreement and calling Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau “very dishonest and weak.” Trump announced he was withdrawing from the joint communique hammered out at a Canadian summit on Saturday, drawing sharp criticism from Germany and France. But “markets are generally overlooking negative takeaway” from the meeting, said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York, focused instead on the week’s upcoming events as well as the news from Italy. The prospect of Italy remaining in the euro zone sent Italian borrowing costs down sharply, as the euro rallied 0.29 percent to $1.18, near a two-week high of $1.1840. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.07 percent. U.S. Treasury yields, meanwhile, rose ahead of plans by the Treasury Department to sell $54 billion in new coupon-bearing supply, and with the Federal Reserve expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.9571 percent, from 2.935 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 11/32 in price to yield 3.0984 percent, from 3.082 percent at the end of last week. Treasury will sell $32 billion in three-year notes and $22 billion in 10-year notes on Monday, to be followed by a $14 billion sale of 30-year bonds on Tuesday. In commodities, oil prices fell in early activity, pulled down by rising Russian production, before regaining momentum later. U.S. crude rose 0.73 percent to $66.22 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.63, up 0.22 percent on the day.

2018-06-11,"PARIS (Reuters) - French farmers have blocked access to oil depots and refineries with tonnes of onions, wood and rubble, as part of a three-day protest over plans to allow Total (TOTF.PA) to use imported palm oil at a biofuel plant. Farmers are concerned about the impact on locally produced oilseed crops, further souring relations between the EU’s biggest agricultural sector and the government of President Emmanuel Macron. Many welcomed Macron’s call for fairer prices for farmers as part of a food chain review last year, but they have been angered by the government’s attempt to phase out weedkiller glyphosate before other EU countries. Farm Minister Stephane Travert said on Monday the farmers’ blockades were illegal and the government would not rescind the decision to allow Total to use imported palm oil. A total of 16 sites were blocked on Monday afternoon, France’s largest farm union FNSEA (National Federation of Agricultural Holders’ Unions) said on Twitter. Total’s 253,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Gonfreville refinery and nearby oil depot, its 109,000 bpd Feyzin refinery, the 220,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Donges refinery and 102,000 bpd Grandpuits refinery were among those blocked by farmers. The oil and gas producer operates five refineries and nine petrol depots in France. It said on Monday morning the blockade by farmers had not had an impact on operations. It urged clients not to rush to petrol stations to fill their tanks, which could spark panic buying and shortages. French authorities last month gave Total permission to use palm oil as a feedstock at its La Mede biofuel refinery in southern France, infuriating farmers who grow crops such as rapeseed. Environmentalists also blame palm oil cultivation for deforestation in southeast Asia. The mostly symbolic blockade at La Mede was lifted around midday with farmers returning to work, according to a Reuters photographer on site. Organisers say the farmers’ blockades are aimed at pressuring the government into curbing palm oil use at La Mede and to address other grievances such as imports of South American meat.  “Our target is the state,” FNSEA’s Lambert said, adding Total’s decision on palm oil was “the last straw”. Widespread fuel shortages were not expected, however, given France’s network of seven refineries, 200 fuel depots, emergency fuel reserves, and the absence of sympathy action by fuel sector workers. Palm oil is cheaper than rapeseed oil as a feedstock for biodiesel. French farmers say its growing use has added to their competitive disadvantage because of high taxes and strict environmental regulations in France. Total argues its plans call for using less palm oil than allowed by the authorities, offer an outlet for local rapeseed and will develop large-scale recycling of used oil and fat. Palm oil has been criticised in Europe for environmental destruction and some lawmakers are pushing for a ban on its use in biofuel as part of new European Union energy targets. France has said it would oppose a full EU ban but junior ecology minister Sebastien Lecornu said on Monday Paris wanted to cap and progressively cut palm oil imports.     The issue of palm oil use has caused friction with Indonesia and Malaysia, the two largest palm oil producers, with Malaysian officials warning of trade repercussions that could affect a potential deal to buy French fighter jets.

2018-06-11,"LONDON (Reuters) - The government of Qatar took the United Arab Emirates to the United Nations’ International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday, accusing it of human rights violations as a result of a boycott enacted last year. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar in June 2017, severing diplomatic and transport ties with the tiny, rich state, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies that and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty. “As set forth in detail in Qatar’s application to the International Court, the UAE led these actions, which have had a devastating effect on the human rights of Qataris and residents of Qatar,” the government said in a statement. UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, in a post on Twitter, dismissed the claims as another of Doha’s “lies.” The Qatari government said the UAE enacted a series of measures that discriminate against Qataris, including expelling them from the UAE, prohibiting them from entering or passing through the UAE, ordering UAE nationals to leave Qatar, and closing UAE airspace and seaports to Qatar. Qatar said it believed the actions were in violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) - including discrimination on the basis of nationality - of which the UAE and Qatar are both signatories. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt are not signatories of the CERD convention. The complaint bit.ly/2sNbA72, filed by Qatar late on Monday, accuses the United Arab Emirates of discriminating against Qataris in UAE by limiting their freedom of speech and movement, inciting hatred against them, shutting down local offices of Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera television station and blocking transmission of Qatari media outlets. Qatar is asking the court to order the UAE to take steps to comply with its obligations under the CERD, ceasing and revoking the measures and restoring the rights of Qataris.  It also requested that the UAE make reparations, including compensation, but provided no details of the amount it might be seeking. The court’s registry confirmed late on Monday it received the complaint, the first step in a dispute which the court may hear. The court typically solicits opinions from both sides as to whether it has jurisdiction before considering the merits of a case, a process that often takes years.

With oil recently reaching $80 a barrel, the highest level since 2014, some producers are discussing the possibility of easing some of the cutbacks and will meet to set policy on June 22-23. Oil was trading above $75 a barrel on Monday. Jabar al-Luaibi said in a strongly-worded statement that oil prices still needed more support and stability, and producers “should not over-exaggerate the need of the oil market for more oil supplies for the time being, which could cause big harm to the global markets.” “This could be misinterpreted by speculators and consumers, leading to a significant fall in oil prices and this is unacceptable to us,” Luaibi said in the statement. The minister “rejects unilateral decisions by some oil producers without consulting the rest of the members” of the OPEC and non-OPEC producers who took part in the reduction agreement, according to the statement by the Iraqi oil ministry. Luaibi warned that this “could violate the agreement in one way or another and could lead to the collapse of the agreement.” The comments by OPEC’s second largest producer come after Reuters reported that the U.S. government had unofficially asked Saudi Arabia and some other oil producers to raise output a day before Washington imposed new sanctions on Tehran. OPEC and its allies, led by Russia, have cut a combined 1.8 million barrels per day of output since January 2017 and the cuts are due to expire at the end of 2018. However, Saudi Arabia and Russia have said the cuts could be eased gradually if there was a supply shortage in the market, after Riyadh received calls from consumers including the United States, China and India to support global demand. “Producers should deal wisely and with vision with the facts on the ground without being influenced by pressures and conflicting calls to pump more oil into the market, which could lead to undesirable results,” Luaibi said.

The move is aimed at reducing the use of palm oil blamed for causing deforestation in southeast Asia, he said. French farmers were blocking access to oil depots and at least three refineries using tonnes of onions, wood and rubble on Monday as part of a three-day protest over plans to allow Total to use palm oil at a biofuel plant. Separately, junior minister Brune Poirson, who reports to environment minister Nicolas Hulot, said on Twitter that “France wants to stop the rise in use from one year to the other” for both palm oil and soybean oil. Brune is in Luxembourg where European energy ministers are meeting to discuss the bloc’s energy and climate goals. It would then revise that cap depending on the conditions of forests and develop a strategy to fight deforestation, she wrote, without giving further details. Hulot had said last year France would take steps to restrict the use of palm oil in producing biofuels in order to reduce deforestation in the countries of origin, without detailing the measures. Small farmers in Malaysia, the world’s second largest palm oil producer after Indonesia, said a move to cap palm oil exports at an EU level would be discriminatory and a “betrayal”. “This proposal is a betrayal of promises made by the French Government, and others in Europe, to the people of Malaysia,” they said in a statement sent by Faces of Palm Oil lobby group. “Those promises must be honoured. Attempts to camouflage this discrimination behind technical calculations are deceitful.” French Defence Minister Florence Parly said in comments reported in the Malaysian press in January that Malaysia could “rely on France” for support against the proposed ban.

Delek and Texas-based Noble Energy are partners in the large Tamar and Leviathan natural gas fields off Israel’s coast and signed deals in February with Egyptian firm Dolphinus Holdings to sell $15 billion of gas. Delek and Noble have been negotiating to buy the rights to use EMG’s pipeline, which was built years ago as part of a now-defunct Egyptian-Israeli natural gas deal but has been out of use. Egypt used to sell gas to Israel under a 20-year agreement, which collapsed in 2012 after months of attacks on the pipeline by militants in Egypt’s remote Sinai peninsula. It has since been out of commission and EMG is suing the Egyptian government for damages. Noble and Delek now want to send gas in the other direction. Delek said in a statement to the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange that its shareholders would meet on July 1 to vote on whether the company could hold off on distributing profits in order to invest in EMG. It estimated its investment would be about $200 million, but did not provide other financial details. It said 75 percent of shareholders would need to support the deal for it to move forward.

2018-06-11,"* Big week for central banks as Fed, ECB set to tighten policy * Comments from new Italy government push bond yields lower * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Saikat Chatterjee LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - European stocks climbed on Monday, shrugging off the weekend’s fractious G7 summit as investors looked forward to a week packed with diplomatic, policy and political events while reassuring comments from Italy pushed the euro up. A summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday will be followed by meetings of the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank plus a Brexit bill vote in the British parliament. But risky assets were well supported on Monday as comments from Italy’s new coalition government saying it had no intention of leaving the euro zone and planned to cut debt levels pushed Italian stocks up more than 2 percent and a wider gauge of European stocks up 0.6 percent. “Markets are focused on the headlines from Italy and that has calmed investors as they believe the threat of confrontation with the EU has dropped significantly,” said Mike Bell, a global market strategist at JP Morgan Asset Management in London. U.S. stock index futures were flat after dropping as much as 0.3 percent in early trading, indicating a cautious start for Wall Street. The MSCI world equity index , which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.1 percent. With no top level U.S. economic data due for release on Monday, all eyes are on the summit in Singapore and the Fed, which is almost certain to raise interest rates on Wednesday. Italian Economy Minister Giovanni Tria soothed investors’ nerves on Sunday. In his first interview since taking office a week ago, Tria told the Corriere della Sera newspaper that the new coalition was committed to remaining within the single currency and wanted to boost growth through investment and structural reforms. Bond yields tumbled by 25-50 basis points across the board in Italy while the euro firmed, nearing a recent three-week high. The single currency rose nearly half a percent to $1.1821 in early trading before trimming some gains to stand 0.2 percent up on the day. Trump’s rejection of a previously signed G7 communique separates the United States from its traditional global economic allies and underlines trade tensions. However, it had little impact on global markets with investors taking the news in their stride in a week when the world’s top central banks - the Fed and the ECB - are set to tighten policy. “Though the latest headlines are definitely not positive for global trade, risk appetite is broadly firm across the board as investors are of the view it might force the ECB and the Fed to take a cautious approach,” said Neil Mellor, a senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in London. Stocks wobbled and the dollar edged higher in initial reaction to the G7, which Societe Generale termed as a “mess”. However, markets quickly recouped losses, with stocks firmer across the board on expectations that any withdrawal in policy stimulus would be very gradual against the backdrop of the rising trade tensions. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped early but was last up 0.2 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng also gained 0.3 percent while the Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.5 percent. The Fed is inching closer to a neutral policy stance, while the ECB is likely to signal on Thursday that its 2.55 trillion euro bond purchase scheme will end this year, a major move in dismantling crisis-era stimulus. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.1 percent up at 93.67. Oil prices slipped on rising Russian production and increasing U.S. drilling activity. Brent crude futures fell 1.1 percent to $75.66 a barrel and U.S. crude futures slipped more than 1 percent to $64.93 a barrel. Spot gold, which tends to do well in times of market stress, was down 0.2 percent on the day at $1,295.21 per ounce. Reporting by Saikat Chatterjee; Additional reporting by

2018-06-11,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German prosecutors on Monday widened an emissions cheating probe into Volkswagen’s luxury carmaker Audi to include the brand’s Chief Executive Rupert Stadler among the suspects accused of fraud and false advertising. Almost three years after Volkswagen admitted to falsifying U.S. diesel emissions tests, the Munich public prosecutor’s office said it was now probing 20 suspects, and had on Monday searched the apartment of Stadler and one other board member. The news came after Germany’s Bild am Sonntag reported up to a million Daimler cars had been found to contain illegal emissions devices, showing how the fallout from Volkswagen’s scandal continues to dog the industry. “Since May 30, 2018 the chairman of the board of Audi AG Prof. Rupert Stadler as well as a further member of the management board are now named suspects,” the Munich prosecutor’s office said. The probe could trigger a leadership crisis at Audi and its parent Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) where Stadler was in April elevated to the post of head of group sales. Volkswagen declined to comment. Audi said it was fully cooperating with prosecutors. Stadler was in a board meeting and unavailable for comment. Munich prosecutors said the two suspects were being investigated for suspected fraud and false advertising and for their alleged role in helping to bring cars equipped with illegal software on to the European market. Stadler has been under fire ever since Audi admitted to using cheating software in November 2015 - two months after Volkswagen - but has enjoyed backing from members of the Porsche and Piech families who control Volkswagen and Audi. Before becoming Audi CEO in 2007, Stadler was a confidant of, and former assistant to, then-Volkswagen chairman Ferdinand Piech, the scion of the group’s controlling Piech clan. Audi, the biggest contributor to Volkswagen’s profit, admitted in November 2015 its 3.0 liter V6 diesel engines were fitted with a device deemed illegal in the United States that allowed cars to evade emissions limits. In March, Audi’s 20-strong supervisory board recommended that shareholders endorse Stadler as chief executive even as prosecutors raided Audi to investigate who was involved in the use of any illicit software deployed in 80,000 VW, Audi and Porsche cars in the United States. Audi said last month it had discovered emissions-related problems with a further 60,000 cars.

2018-06-11,"* First provincial government to officially implement policy * The plan would mean consumption of 780,000 tonnes of corn (Adding background) BEIJING, June 11 (Reuters) - The Chinese city of Tianjin will use gasoline with added ethanol in most vehicles by the end of September, according to a document published on the city government’s website on Monday, as Beijing pushes for adoption of the biofuel nationwide. The central government said last year that it plans to roll out the use of gasoline blended with 10 percent added ethanol nationally by 2020, to cut corn stocks and clean up choking smog. The move by Tianjin, a port city of around 15 million people in northern China, was the first official plan by a provincial government to implement the national policy since it was announced. Tianjin is expected to use 260,000 tonnes of fuel ethanol each year if that goal is realized, the city government said. That would mean consumption of 780,000 tonnes of corn, as three tonnes of corn would be used to make one tonne of ethanol. China is currently sitting on huge stocks of corn estimated to be at about 200 million tonnes, following a now discontinued government stockpiling scheme to support farmers. China currently produces less than 2.5 million tonnes of ethanol a year, but the new policy could increase demand to 15 million tonnes a year by 2020, according to a Reuters estimate. Domestic producers were ramping up output, on cheaper corn and government subsidies, hoping to get a share in the potentially booming market.

2018-06-11,"(Deletes extraneous word in lead) LONDON, June 11 (Reuters) - The government of Qatar said Monday it was taking the United Arab Emirates to the United Nations’ International Court of Justice over what it described as human right violations. The UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt imposed a boycott on Qatar in June 2017, severing diplomatic and transport ties with the tiny, wealthy state, accusing it of supporting terrorism. Doha denies that and says the pressure is aimed at stripping it of its sovereignty. “As set forth in detail in Qatar’s application to the International Court, the UAE led these actions, which have had a devastating effect on the human rights of Qataris and residents of Qatar,” the government said in a statement. The Qatari government said the UAE enacted a series of measures that discriminate against Qataris, including expelling them from the UAE, prohibiting them from entering or passing through the UAE, ordering UAE nationals to leave Qatar, and closing UAE airspace and seaports to Qatar. Qatar said it believed the actions were in violation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD) - including discrimination on the basis of nationality - of which the UAE and Qatar are both signatories. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Egypt are not signatories of the CERD convention. Qatar requested that the court order the UAE to take steps to comply with its obligations under the CERD, ceasing and revoking the measures and restoring the rights of Qataris. It also requested that the UAE makes reparations, including compensation, but gave no details of the amount it might be seeking.

2018-06-11,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian refiner Nayara Energy, one of the country’s biggest buyers of Iranian oil, began cutting imports this month after the United States scrapped a nuclear deal with Tehran and said it would re-impose tough sanctions, three people familiar with knowledge of the matter said. Previously named Essar Oil, Nayara was bought by Russian state oil-giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and partners in a $12.9 billion (9.65 billion pounds) deal last year. It typically buys around 5.5-6 million barrels a month from Iran, according to data made available to Reuters from industry and shipping sources. The cuts by Nayara provide the latest indication that Asian buyers will cut orders from Iran after U.S. President Donald Trump last month pulled out from the 2015 accord between Iran and world powers that lifted sanctions on Tehran in exchange for curbs to its nuclear programme. “Nayara will be lifting about 40-50 percent less than the average volumes, limiting its intake of Iranian oil to about 3-4 million barrels in a month,” said one of the people. All three sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to talk to media. Iran’s oil exports hit 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, the Oil Ministry’s news agency SHANA reported earlier this month.  India, the world’s third-biggest oil consumer and importer, imports about 4.5 million bpd, according to the data from shipping and industry sources. Asked by Reuters whether Nayara plans to reduce monthly Iranian oil imports by 40-50 percent, the company said, “There are no specific cut-backs planned as of now,” adding “we are still seeking clarifications from all concerned.” The U.S. sanctions on Iran’s petroleum industry will take effect after a 180-day “wind-down period” ending on Nov. 4 but many European refiners, as well as buyers in Asia, are already winding down Iranian oil purchases. The cuts by Nayara have kicked in before similar moves by Indian peers. Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest single refining complex, plans to halt oil imports from Iran from October-November, sources said last month. Mayara’s chief executive B. Anand said last week the refiner did not expect problems in finding alternative supplies in should it reduce Iranian orders. Anand said Nayara would leverage the supply and trading network of its major stakeholders, Rosneft and Swiss commodity trader Trafigura, to replace Iranian oil. Officially, India’s oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan last week said the country has adopted a “wait and watch” policy pending clarity on the impact of U.S. sanctions.

2018-06-11,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler (DAIGn.DE) shares fell following a report that up to a million Daimler cars contained illegal defeat devices as Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche prepared to meet the transport minister on Monday. German weekly Bild am Sonntag said up to 1 million cars contained software to cheat emissions tests on diesel vehicles. Carmakers use software to manage exhaust emissions filtering and engine performance. A device can be classified as illegal if exhaust filtering systems are deactivated too early or without good reason. At 0836 GMT, Daimler shares were trading 1.76 percent lower, at 61.19 euros, underperforming the Stoxx 600 Automobile index which was 0.48 percent lower.              German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer summoned Zetsche after the country’s KBA Motor Vehicle Authority discovered “inadmissible defeat devices” in Mercedes-Benz engines, even as Daimler disputes they were illegal.   Daimler declines to comment on the 1 million vehicles figure, but said it is cooperating fully and transparently with the KBA and Germany’s Transport Ministry. Daimler, like other car manufacturers, uses urea nitrate liquids to neutralize nitrogen oxide emissions in exhaust fumes. However, Germany’s road vehicle authority, the KBA, has taken issue with the emission control features amid suspicion they allow vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. The emissions scandal has hung over the German car industry since September 2015, when Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) admitted to using software that could tell when a diesel vehicle was being tested and temporarily lower its toxic emissions to pass U.S. regulations. The “Dieselgate” scandal has cost VW about $30 billion in fines and other costs.

Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will have an unprecedented meeting on Tuesday in Singapore, possibly laying the groundwork for ending a nuclear stand-off between the old foes. Investors also got prepared for a raft of other key events. The Federal Reserve holds a two-day meeting starting on June 12, and it is widely expected to raise interest rates for the second time this year. The focus is on whether the central bank will hint at raising rates a total of four times in 2018. The European Central Bank meets on June 14, when it could signal intentions to start unwinding its massive bond purchasing programme. On Monday, the dollar slipped against the yen, which often draws demand in times of market turmoil and political tensions. The greenback was down 0.1 percent at 109.455 yen. The Canadian dollar, which has been dogged by fears Trump may scrap the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), fell 0.25 percent to C$1.2959 per dollar.

The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was 0.15 percent lower at 93.410.

2018-06-11,"* U.S. drilling activity at highest level since March, 2015 * Russian output hit 11.1 million bpd in early June -Interfax * JPMorgan expects rising non-OPEC output to weigh on crude prices By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, June 11 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday, dragged down as U.S. oil drilling activity rose to its highest level since March, 2015, while increasing output in Russia also weighed on the market. Analysts expect surging U.S. output to start offsetting efforts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to withhold production, which have been in place since 2017 and in the first half of this year pushed up prices significantly. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $76.37 per barrel at 0010 GMT, down 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $65.62 a barrel. Prices were weighed down by another rise in the number of rigs drilling for new oil production in the United States, which crept up by one to reach its highest level since March, 2015 at 862, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday. That implies that U.S. crude output, which is already at a record-high of 10.8 million barrels per day (bpd), will also rise further. “Non-OPEC supply is expected to rise sharply in 2019 led by US shale growth along with Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan,” U.S. bank JPMorgan said in its quarterly outlook published on Friday, adding that it was bearish for the oil price outlook going into the second half of the year. Going into next year, the bank said “oil fundamentals are expected to weaken in 2019 on the back of stronger than expected non-OPEC supply but also potential release of barrels from OPEC as the joint accord between OPEC and non-OPEC is unlikely to stay in place”. OPEC, together with some non-OPEC producers including Russia started withholding output in 2017 to end a global supply overhang and prop up prices. OPEC and its partners are due to meet on June 22 at the cartel’s headquarters in Vienna, Austria, to discuss policy. Meanwhile, Russian news agency Interfax reported on Saturday that Russia’s oil production, the world’s biggest, had risen to 11.1 million bpd in early June, up from slightly below 11 million bpd in most of May and well above its target production of under 11 million bpd as part of the deal.
