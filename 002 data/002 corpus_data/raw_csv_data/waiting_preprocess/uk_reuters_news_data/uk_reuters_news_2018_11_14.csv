2018-11-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - London’s low emission traffic zone has modestly reduced residents’ exposure to diesel engine pollution, but the better air quality has not brought improved lung health among the capital’s children, research found on Wednesday. The results suggest that while air pollution levels may be reduced by low emission zones that are now in place in around 200 cities across Europe, extra measures are needed to deliver air clean enough to improve health. The World Health Organization says outdoor air pollution is linked to 3.7 million premature deaths a year globally. In Europe, where more than half of new cars are diesel-fuelled, nitrogen oxide - which has been linked to asthma and impaired lung development in children - has become a major problem. Low emission zones are seen as a way to tackle traffic pollution and there are now around 200 in operation across Europe. London introduced the world’s largest citywide low emission zone in stages during 2008 and 2012, requiring diesel vehicles entering Greater London to meet certain emission standards or pay daily charges.     This study, published in The Lancet Public Health journal on Wednesday, looked at data from more than 2,000 school children aged 8 and 9 years old living in highly polluted areas of London’s low emission zone.  Between 2009-10 and 2013-2014, the children were given yearly winter health checks that included measuring lung function and size. Parents were asked to complete a medical questionnaire about the children, with information on breathing and allergic symptoms such as asthma, eczema and hay fever. The results found that despite improvements in air quality after the low emission zone was implemented, there was no evidence of a fall in the proportion of children with small lungs or asthma symptoms over the following five years. “In many areas of London, air pollution still remains a major issue,” said Chris Griffiths, a professor at Queen Mary University of London who co-led the research. He said many areas of the city are still breaching EU air pollution standards and “are unlikely to meet them without a substantial tightening of current emission controls.” London is set to introduce an ultra low emission zone early next year - a measure experts say should deliver major improvements in air quality. Ian Mudway, a professor at King’s College London who also worked on the study, said there is an urgent need to improve air quality in congested cities. But he stressed the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of policies, “not only in terms of whether they improve air quality, but more importantly, whether they deliver better health”.

2018-11-14,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose about 1 percent on Wednesday, recouping some of the previous session’s heavy sell-off, on growing prospects that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers would cut output at a meeting next month to prop up prices. After a record 12 straight days of losses and the steepest one-day loss in more than three years, the oil market reversed course after Reuters reported that OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), more than officials had mentioned previously. Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 65 cents, or 1 percent, at $66.12 a barrel, after hitting a session high of $67.63.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 rose 56 cents, or 1.01 percent, to settle at $56.25 a barrel, after sliding for 12 straight sessions to the lowest since November 2017. Prices pared gains in post-settlement trade as the American Petroleum Institute said crude inventories rose by 8.8 million barrels in the week to Nov. 9 to 440.7 million, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels.  Oil markets are being pressured by surging supply from OPEC, Russia, the Unites States and other producers and worries that a global economic slowdown could cut into energy demand. This has pushed the price of global benchmark Brent down more than 20 percent since early October, one of the biggest declines since a price collapse in 2014.   “The market has cratered over the last few weeks and the pop today is related to the chatter that producers could cut up to 1.4 million bpd in 2019,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of market research for Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Maybe some of the fears of extra supplies and reduced demand have finally been priced into the market, but I wouldn’t say that a bottom has set in yet.” As oil has crashed from its October high, natural gas futures NGc1 soared as much as 56 percent during that time to a 4-1/2 year high. Oil’s latest sell-off was exacerbated as traders unwound long oil-short natural gas trades, market participants said. The relative strength index (RSI) for both Brent and U.S. crude remained below 30, a technical level often regarded as signaling a market that has fallen too far.  Financial firms hedging the risk incurred by selling put options to oil producers generated added downward pressure when prices fell toward option strikes, Goldman Sachs said in a note.  “This market is attempting to find a price bottom following an unprecedented 12 consecutive days of decline,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “Although the supply surplus is still relatively modest, the market is focusing on the dynamic of expansion in the overhang that will need to show signs of reversal before a price bottom can be established.”  In its monthly report, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) said the implied stock build for the first half of 2019 is 2 million bpd. The IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month, but cut its forecast for non-OECD demand growth, the engine of expansion in world consumption. U.S. crude output from its seven major shale basins was expected to hit a record 7.94 million bpd in December, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday. The surge in onshore output has helped overall U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 11.6 million bpd, making the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most analysts expect U.S. output to climb above 12 million bpd in the first half of 2019. The rise in U.S. production is contributing to higher stockpiles. Storage data from the U.S. government is due on Thursday.

2018-11-14,"(Reuters) - U.S. federal energy regulators on Wednesday approved a request by TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) Columbia Gas Transmission unit to put the eastern facilities of its $900 million WB XPress natural gas pipeline into service in West Virginia and Virginia. WB XPress is one of several pipelines designed to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The 1.3-billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) WB XPress project was designed to increase gas capacity in Virginia and West Virginia. The project includes construction of 2.9 miles (4.7 km) of new pipeline, two compressor stations and replacement of 26 miles of existing pipeline. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to power about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. New pipelines built to remove gas from the Marcellus and Utica basins have enabled shale drillers to boost output in the Appalachia region to a forecast record high of around 30.4 bcfd in December from 26.9 bcfd during the same month a year earlier. That represents about 37 percent of the nation’s total dry gas output of 83.2 bcfd expected on average in 2018. A decade ago, the Appalachia region produced just 1.6 bcfd, or 3 percent of the country’s total production in 2008. Separately, TransCanada has said it plans to complete its $3 billion Mountaineer and $600 million Gulf XPress projects by the end of the year. Mountaineer is designed to increase gas capacity in West Virginia by 2-bcfd. Gulf XPress is designed to move 0.88 bcfd of gas from Appalachia to the U.S. South.

2018-11-14,"(Adds details of the contract, context) By Marcela Ayres BRASILIA, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA could receive some 30 billion reais ($7.9 billion) from the government in a renegotiation of the “transfer of rights” oil contract, a person following the process told Reuters on Wednesday. The money to pay state-controlled Petrobras, as the company is known, would come from a potential auction of excess oil from the “transfer of rights” area off the Brazilian coast, according to the source, part of the team working on the transition to a new government in Brazil. The person, who requested anonymity, said such an auction could raise 120 billion to 130 billion reais next year, if the necessary legislation clears Congress. American depositary receipts for Petrobras shares added to gains on the news, rising 2.5 percent in New York. Brazil’s Senate has fast-tracked a bill that would open the way for the auction and possibly for the payment to Petrobras. A dispute over the oil in question dates back to 2010, when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. The government received additional shares in Petrobras in return, based on oil prices at the time. But volume of oil is now estimated to be much larger, and the cash-strapped government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil in the area. The choice reserves cannot be auctioned until the government and Petrobras resolve a dispute over the 2010 transaction. Among other things, the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in 2014, which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated. The Senate bill also includes a provision allowing Petrobras to cede up to a 70 percent stake in the area to other oil firms. $1 = 3.7840 reais

2018-11-14,"BARCELONA, Nov 14 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - European cities are seeking greater recognition and support for their pioneering efforts to tackle climate change, both from national governments and the European Union, mayors leading the charge said on Wednesday. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau urged all political parties with candidates standing for the European Parliament next May to outline how they plan to help curb global warming. “The elections should be an occasion for battling against climate change, and putting this important problem on the European agenda,” said Colau, speaking at a conference on smart cities in Barcelona. The Catalan city adopted a climate plan this year, which the mayor said lays out a path to cut its planet-warming emissions 45 percent by 2030 and to become carbon-neutral by 2050. The plan also aims to protect vulnerable citizens from intensifying heatwaves, rain storms and drought. December’s U.N. climate talks in Poland are an opportunity for European cities to “remind their nations and the European Commission that we have to be leaders against climate change”, Colau added. Georgios Kaminis, mayor of Athens - which is also feeling the effects of rising heat - said the EU should provide direct funding to cities to help them act on climate change. That can be discussed as cities and the European Commission work out how to implement a U.N. plan for sustainable development of urban areas, he added. At national level, Colau called on the Spanish government to support cities by boosting investment in infrastructure for public transport and cutting subsidies for diesel immediately. The Socialist-led government on Tuesday published a draft document for a law on climate change and energy transition that it hopes to present to parliament by the end of the year. The document proposes setting a timetable to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, in line with an overall goal of decarbonising the economy, as well as a ban on sales of petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2040. Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera told the Thomson Reuters Foundation the government wanted to work with cities, as it would be impossible for them to achieve emissions reductions and build resilience to climate change impacts alone. But putting together their own plans would enable them to identify where cooperation with different institutions is needed, she said on the sidelines of the Barcelona conference. The Spanish government wants to assist, and is working on reforms to help finance flow to the municipal level, she added. Mayors stressed the urgency for all levels of government to move faster in line with a recent report from the U.N. climate science panel on ways the world can keep warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala, who is also vice chair of the C40 network of cities acting on climate change, said 72 cities worldwide had pledged to develop plans by the end of 2020 to help meet the lower 1.5C warming goal in the Paris Agreement. “We are strongly committed - the people of Milan strongly understand that if we go beyond 1.5C, it will be a disaster,” Sala said. The Italian city is taking measures on a large scale to get people out of cars and onto public transport, such as building a fifth metro line connecting the airport to the city centre, and changing its fleet of buses to run on electricity. Athens, meanwhile, is rolling out ways to protect residents from heatwaves such as an app to alert them, and directing elderly people in poorer neighbourhoods to green spaces and air-conditioned public buildings where they can cool down. And Berlin’s governing mayor, Michael Muller, said the German city had been taking back control of energy, housing and transport in the city, after many operations were privatised in the 1990s, so that it can move them onto a cleaner path faster. Colau noted that Barcelona is setting up its own power company to drive a shift towards 100 percent renewable sources. ""If a city can do this, what can a state do if they put the political will to it? It is time to be brave,"" she said. (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Zoe Tabary.

2018-11-14,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The head of the budget committee in Mexico’s lower house said lawmakers were looking at including tax changes in next year’s budget for state-run oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL] to give the company more control over its finances. Alfonso Ramirez, a member of President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s MORENA party, said in an interview on Tuesday that the incoming government wanted to strengthen Pemex’s finances. “Possibly this leads us to change its fiscal regime, to grant Pemex greater autonomy in how it operates,” Ramirez said, adding that the government needed to curb its reliance on income from Pemex. Pemex executives have long complained that the company’s heavy tax burden has prevented it from making enough investments to staunch a 14-year long decline in crude output. Ramirez declined to provide more details, and said lawmakers were still looking at whether they would include tax changes for Pemex in the 2019 budget. MORENA and its allies have a majority in both houses of Congress.  “Maybe we don’t go as far as we want in the first year, in 2019, but we will follow this trajectory,” he said. Ramirez said lawmakers were waiting to see the budget proposal of Lopez Obrador’s economic team, but that he was eyeing a fiscal surplus target between 0.5 percent and 0.9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). Lopez Obrador’s economic transition team said in late October that the budget would aim for a primary surplus of 0.8 percent of GDP. “In the range of 0.5 to 0.9 percent we are giving an adequate signal to international markets that financial discipline and fiscal discipline is guaranteed,” Ramirez said. Ramirez said that key economic budget forecasts were not finalized but lawmakers were looking at the Mexican economy growing by around 2.5 percent to 3 percent next year, an exchange rate MXN= of around 19 pesos per dollar and an average price for Mexican crude ""slightly"" above $50 per barrel.

Alexander Novak reporters on the sideline of an international conference in Singapore that long-term oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision was taken by oil producing countries. He was talking as oil markets fell again, extending losses from a 7 percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors. Novak said oil prices had averaged around $70 per barrel this year. “The market is quite volatile today. We remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way, now it is going down. We have to look into long-term development, into how the price will be stabilised,” he said. “It’s not right for market participants to react to any one-off fluctuations,” he said. Novak also said the oil market still did not fully understand the fallout from U.S. sanctions against Iran, and how buyers would behave. The United States announced the reinstatement of sanctions earlier this month against Iran over Tehran’s activities in the Middle East. Eight importing countries have been given temporary exemptions by the United States to keep buying Iranian oil, prompting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to say Washington would not be able to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero. “I think the market is volatile due to a lot of uncertainty,” Novak said. He said Russia had been cutting oil production by around 20,000 barrels per day so far in November, from the record high of 11.41 million bpd in October.

2018-11-14,"SOFIA, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s anti-monopoly regulator, under pressure from public anger over rising fuel prices, said on Wednesday it would launch checks at the main fuel retailers to see if they have complied with measures imposed last year to improve competition. Hundreds of Bulgarians protested on Sunday against higher petrol and diesel prices which officials say are mainly due to rising global oil prices. The Commission for Protection of Competition failed to prove price fixing among six fuel retailers in March 2017 but ruled they should stop any exchange of information on their price policies and adopt internal procedures to guarantee efficient market competition. It will now check whether the Bulgarian units of LUKOIL , Royal Dutch Shell, OMV, Hellenic Petroleum, Gazprom Neft and Bulgarian fuel retailer Petrol have adopted the measures. “Following the increase of fuel prices for consumers... the Commission considers it necessary to check the implementation of the approved set of measures,” the regulator said in a statement. In a bid to quell public discontent, the regulator has also started a new analysis of the fuel sector to see if there are any breaches of competition rules.

2018-11-14,"LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Global oil supply will outpace demand throughout 2019, as a “relentless” rise in output is swamps growth in consumption that is at risk from a slowing economy, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) and 1.4 million bpd, respectively, but cut its forecast for non-OECD demand growth, the engine of expansion in world oil consumption. “While slower economic growth in some countries reduces the outlook for oil demand, a significant downward revision to our price assumption is supportive,” the IEA said. Since early October, the oil price has fallen by a quarter to below $70 a barrel, its lowest in eight months. The agency raised its forecast for oil output growth from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to 2.4 million bpd this year and 1.9 million bpd next year, versus its previous estimate of 2.2 million bpd and 1.8 million bpd, respectively. The IEA also cut its forecast for demand for OPEC crude by 300,000 bpd to 31.3 million bpd in 2019.

2018-11-14,"PARADISE, Calif., Nov 14 (Reuters) - National Guard troops were due to arrive on Wednesday to help search for more victims in the charred, ash-strewn ruins where the northern California town of Paradise stood, before it was erased in the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in state history. The Guard contingent, about 100 military police trained to look for and identify human remains, will reinforce the coroner-led recovery teams, cadaver dogs and forensic anthropologists already scouring the ghostly landscape of a fire that has killed at least 48 people. The grim, painstaking search is concentrated in what little is left of Paradise, a Sierra foothills town in Butte County, California, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, that was overrun by flames and largely incinerated last Thursday. The killer blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub and fanned by fierce winds, capped a catastrophic California wildfire season that experts largely attribute to prolonged dry spells they say are symptomatic of global climate change. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has killed two people, destroyed over 400 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. The origins of both the Camp and Woolsey fires were listed as under investigation. But two utility companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, reported to regulators they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started. By late Tuesday, with the help of diminished winds and rising humidity levels, fire crews had managed to carve containment lines around more than a third of both fires, easing further the immediate threat to life and property. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and California Governor Jerry Brown were scheduled on Wednesday to pay a visit to the areas, which President Donald Trump declared a disaster areas, making federal emergency assistance more readily available. After touring some of California’s earlier wildfire zones in August, Zinke blamed “gross mismanagement of forests” because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by “environmental terrorist groups”. While prospects for suppressing the flames grew more hopeful, authorities pressed on with the task of accounting for those listed as missing. County Sheriff Kory Honea said he requested the Guard troops, along with “disaster mortuary” crew, portable military morgue teams and specialists from a private DNA laboratory to speed the detection and identification of additional remains. “We want to cover as much ground as we can,” Honea said at a Tuesday evening news conference where he announced that the six latest sets of remains had been recovered in Paradise earlier in the day. The fatality count of 48 already far exceeds the previous record for the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire in California history - 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933. Honea said that in some cases victims were burned beyond recognition, or even beyond the use of fingerprint IDs. Dental records will be needed to positively identify some, but “dental records might not be available if the dentist office burned to the ground”, he said. “We’re finding remains in various states,” he told reporters. “People have been badly burned. Some of them, I assume, have been consumed.” He said it was possible that some remains might turn up only once residents with homes still intact are able to return. More than 50,000 remained under evacuation orders. Honea had previously said 228 people were listed as missing. However, he said on Tuesday night those numbers were highly fluid and that his office planned to publish a new list of missing persons soon and would ask the public to help account for them. He said it remained unclear how many individuals whose whereabouts were unknown had perished or fallen out of touch in chaotic evacuations. Wind-driven flames roared through Paradise so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives with little or no warning. Bodies of some victims were found in and around the burned-out wreckage of vehicles engulfed in the firestorm as evacuation traffic ground to a half in deadly knots of gridlock hours after the fire erupted. By late Tuesday, the Camp Fire had blackened 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares) in all. The Woolsey fire by comparison has scorched 96,000 acres (39,000 hectares) of chaparral-covered rolling hills and canyons spanning Ventura and Los Angeles counties, an area roughly the size of Denver. On Tuesday, white-clad forensic teams fanned out to pick through the barren, fire-scorched lots in a town once home to 27,000 people. On a residential street in Paradise lined with obliterated houses, a 10-member search crew wearing white protective suits and red helmets used a dog to scour the debris. “Look for skulls, the big bones,” one forensics worker said to others as they used metal poles and their hands to sift through ruins. At a nearby community swimming pool, recovery workers stirred green, darkened waters with long poles to probe for bodies. Additional reporting by Noel Randewich and Sharon Bernstein in

2018-11-14,"SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said long-term oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision is taken by oil-producing countries and no emergency action to stem a decline in oil prices is warranted. He was talking as oil markets fell again on Wednesday, extending losses from a 7 percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors. Novak said oil prices have averaged around $70 per barrel this year. “The market is quite volatile today. We remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way, now it is going down.

2018-11-14,"* Airline ramping up U.S. capacity with non-stop flights * A350-900ULR seats 67 in business, 94 in premium economy * Premium economy fares to New York as low as S$1,698 return By Jamie Freed SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd is facing no problem selling business class tickets on its ultra-long non-stop flights to the United States but is having to price premium economy seats very attractively, a senior executive said on Wednesday. The carrier last month resumed after five years the world’s longest commercial flight, a near-19 hour non-stop journey from Singapore to New York. The airline ordered seven new ultra-long range twin-engine Airbus SE A350-900ULRs fitted with just 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats for those flights and for non-stop services to Los Angeles and San Francisco. These flights have no economy class seats. It represents a major expansion in the U.S. market for Singapore Airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the 20 percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for ultra-long non-stop services due to their popularity with time-sensitive business travellers. Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Mak Swee Wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up. For premium economy, however, he said some markets were not “entirely familiar” with the product, which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class. “I think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product, initially with very attractive pricing, but eventually I think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight,” he said at an analyst and media briefing. His comments came after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday an 81 percent plunge in second-quarter net profit, hurt by higher fuel prices, lower airfares and non-cash losses at its part-owned Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. Yields, a proxy for ticket prices, fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, failing to help offset the impact of a 24 percent rise in fuel prices. Singapore Airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as S$1,698 ($1,230.17) return from Singapore to New York for weekday travel over part of the peak Christmas travel period, according to its website. That is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Dubai-based Emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time, according to a Reuters search on Expedia. Mak declined to comment on whether Singapore Airlines could consider changing the configuration of the plane to include more business class seats. When it previously flew to New York and Los Angeles non-stop on four-engined A340-500 jets that used more fuel, it had initially offered both “executive economy” and business class but later switched to an all-business class configuration. Those flights were abandoned in 2013 when high fuel prices made them uneconomic.

2018-11-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Wednesday announced a 500 million euros ($564 million) plan to help motorists with the lowest incomes, in a bid to defuse a wave of nationwide protests against a tax increase on fuels.

The government will also increase other aids granted to motorists, as well as an existing special aid for low income families who use diesel fuel to heat their homes. Philippe said the new plans would overall represent an extra 500 million euro cost for the government.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE losing 0.4 percent, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.3 percent and France’s CAC  shedding 0.5 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dived 7 percent the previous day, suffering their biggest one-day loss in more than three years. The contracts last stood at $55.30 per barrel for a loss of 0.7 percent, following a descent to a one-year low of $54.75 overnight. Brent crude was down 0.35 percent at $65.24 per barrel after tanking 6.8 percent on Tuesday and set an eight-month trough of $64.61. Brent had soared to a four-year high of $86.74 early in October as the market braced for U.S. sanctions on Iran, but prices have sunk roughly 25 percent since then. Concerns about global growth pushed MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.55 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.9 percent. Australian stocks fell 1.75 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.16 percent. The Dow and S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Tuesday as lower oil prices took a toll on energy shares, offsetting a small gain in technology stocks and renewed hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade talks. “While the plunge in WTI will no doubt act as a relief for emerging markets and the global consumer, U.S. real rates continue to climb, underwriting the dollar’s strength,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “The competition for capital is coinciding with a sharp slowdown in China and emerging markets, putting pressure on 2019 earnings.” Riskier assets have come under strong selling pressure over the past two months as worries about a peak in earnings growth added to international trade tensions and signs of slowing in global investment and growth. The oil plunge underlined cracks in the global economy. In Japan, data confirmed the world’s third-largest economy contracted in the third quarter, adding to growing signs of weakness globally, with China and Europe losing momentum. Germany is expected to report later in the day that its economy also shrank last quarter. “The markets would have reacted more positively to U.S.-China trade and Brexit-related headlines a few months ago,” said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “But currently there is more focus on the possibility of both the U.S. and Chinese leaders maintaining their tough stance, with a compromise eluding them, and Brexit bogging down. Market sentiment is clearly cooling down.” The United Kingdom and European Union agreed on the text for a Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday. Prime Minister Theresa May will present the draft withdrawal agreement to her senior ministers on Wednesday for discussion and then decide on the next steps. Lifted by the latest hopes for a Brexit deal, the pound extended overnight gains and was last 0.1 percent higher at $1.2986. Brexit hopes also supported the euro. The single currency was up 0.05 percent at $1.1292, pulling back from a 17-month trough of $1.1216 brushed on Monday. The euro’s gains, however, were tempered by concerns over Italy’s budget proposals. The European Commission rejected Italy’s plan last month and has threatened to impose penalties if it is not revised to conform with EU regulations - something Rome has indicated it is unwilling to do. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against six major currencies, lost 0.15 percent to 97.138. The index had steadily climbed to a 16-month peak of 97.693 on Monday amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep gradually raising interest rates. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) warned on Tuesday that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. OPEC member states rely on high oil prices to finance government budgets and they have been watching the increase in supply and the corresponding price slump with concern. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, OPEC has been making increasingly frequent public statements that it would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices. “OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels, which is a decision that we expect to be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6,” said Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Such a stance, however, has caused friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, who supports low oil prices and has called on OPEC not to cut production.

2018-11-14,"ABU DHABI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) will remain wholly owned by the Abu Dhabi government and has no plan to go public, but the firm aspires to compete with Big Oil by expanding in refining and gas, ADNOC’s CEO told Reuters. ADNOC, which announced two gas deals with France’s Total and Italy’s Eni this week, will strike more agreements in that sector and seek investment opportunities abroad in liquefied natural gas (LNG), Sultan al-Jaber said. “ADNOC will continue to be wholly owned by one and only one shareholder, and that is the Abu Dhabi government,” al-Jaber said. But the company will continue to “unlock the potential” of its other subsidiaries and assets as it works to gain access to new markets abroad and expand its share in oil and gas, he said. “There will be more initiative (gas) plans,” al-Jaber said in an interview in Abu Dhabi. “We are not going to expand beyond our borders in upstream. We don’t need to. We have access to vast, vast oil and gas reserves,” he said. “Our expansion ... is going to be in downstream, whether refining or petrochemicals,” he added. On Sunday, ADNOC said it had signed an agreement with Total granting the French company a 40 percent stake in the Ruwais Diyab unconventional gas concession. ADNOC aims to reach 1 billion cubic feet per day of unconventional gas production before 2030. “This is untapped. No one is doing this at this scale in this region,” he said of the tight-gas project with Total. On Tuesday ADNOC signed a deal with Eni, awarding the Italian company a 25 percent stake in an offshore ultra-sour gas project. A day earlier the Abu Dhabi producer also signed a framework agreement with national energy company Saudi Aramco to explore investment opportunities in natural gas and LNG. As the diplomatic alliance between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi grows closer, cooperation between the two state-run firms is also increasing. The two companies are to invest jointly in an oil refinery and petrochemicals complex in India. Aramco and ADNOC working together is “a powerhouse”, al-Jaber said. “We are going to be soon looking and exploring LNG business opportunities together with Aramco,” he said. ADNOC, the top national energy company of the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about 3 million barrels of oil and 10.5 billion cubic feet of raw gas a day. Last week, it announced plans to increase its oil production capacity to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of 2020 and 5 million bpd by 2030 after unveiling new oil and gas finds. The UAE wants to achieve gas self-sufficiency and possibly become a net gas exporter. The UAE holds the seventh-largest proven reserves of natural gas in the world, at slightly more than 215 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Despite that, the UAE became a net gas importer in 2008 due to growing demand for power and as it needed gas to reinject into its oilfields to enhance crude production. The UAE has been importing gas from Qatar via the Dolphin Gas pipeline. ADNOC, founded in 1971, has undergone major change since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, part of wider economic reforms led by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Al-Jaber has embarked on privatising its services businesses, ventured into oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors. ADNOC sold 10 percent of fuel retail unit ADNOC Distribution in an initial public offering last year. ADNOC needs to accept that business as usual will no longer allow the company to excel, al-Jaber said. “We want ADNOC ... to operate like an international oil company,” he said. “This is how I view a progressive ADNOC.” (Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dale Hudson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/emirates-oil-adnoc/uaes-adnoc-wants-to-rival-oil-majors-as-it-expands-in-refining-gas-idUKL8N1XO1W0,14 Nov 2018,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Co

2018-11-14,"MUMBAI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Shares in India’s top three oil marketing companies surged on Wednesday, as investors cheered the slump in global crude oil prices that bode well for the profitability of Indian refiners. India’s biggest state-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp was up 7.81 percent on the National Stock Exchange, while Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp rose 7.44 percent and 8.57 percent, respectively. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures struggle to claw back after plunging 7 percent on Tuesday, over concerns of a potential supply glut in 2019. The sharp drop came after the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said late Tuesday that crude oil output from seven major shale basins in the country was expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December. This coincided with a monthly report from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that the market would see a lower demand than expected in 2019. A low crude oil price is a boost to India’s state-owned oil marketing companies and the economy in general which imports 80 percent of its crude oil requirement. The three public sector companies were forced to take a price cut last month hurting their margins as the government wanted to cushion the impact of high crude oil price on the public. Shares in Indian airline companies InterGlobe Aviation Ltd , Jet Airways Ltd and SpiceJet Ltd also rallied on Wednesday, as the surge in oil prices earlier this year had pushed them into losses.

2018-11-14,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s fish and chips, one of the nation’s favourite staples, is under threat from the deluge of plastic waste that is choking seas and endangering marine life, a leading environmental charity warned on Wednesday. To highlight the risk, Plastic Oceans UK teamed up with a “chippie” in the northern city of Blackburn to serve hungry customers battered deep-fried fish-shaped plastic instead of the usual cod with their chips. “The amount of plastic reaching the ocean threatens not only the future of fish, but our future, too. If we continue at this rate, not only will our beloved national dish be a thing of the past, but we’ll be facing other catastrophic problems for our planet,” said Geoff Brighty, technical director of Plastic Oceans UK. Plastic Oceans’ FutureFishandChips campaign is the latest in a string of global efforts by environmental groups and the United Nations to pare back single-plastic use that is also clogging landfills. Big brands from Coke to Kellogs have also pledged to cut all plastic waste from their operations as public pressure mounts for manufacturers and retailers. “When you look at how much plastic is now believed to be entering into the environment - it’s somewhere between four and 12 million tons every year and it’s projected to grow to over 20 million tons by 2030 which is a considerable amount of material to go into the oceans and we can already see it’s causing impacts on beaches and in fisheries,” Brighty said.  “So it’s not too much of a stretch of imagination to think that if we don’t stop this it will start to impact on fish populations and fish stocks.”  The hungry customers served up battered plastic were initially irate but appreciated the stunt when it was explained to them. “You watch television and you see the oceans and go on social media and see all these bottles all over the place but then until it’s actually served on a plate to you it’s just kind of ... it’s a bit of an eye opener when you find out what it’s really about,” one of the customers said.

2018-11-14,"(Reuters) - Shares of utility PG&E Corp (PCG.N) fell 18 percent on Wednesday after the company warned of liquidity concerns if its equipment was found responsible for starting the Camp wildfire currently raging in California. The company said liabilities related to the wildfires could exceed its recently renewed insurance cover, adding to the severe financial pressure it is already facing. The utility has already withdrawn $3 billion from its credit line in anticipation of fire-related liabilities, leaving it with no additional money available under its credit agreements, it said in a filing. The Camp wildfire, which has killed nearly 48 people, is being investigated, and PG&E told regulators it experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started. NBC said in a report nbcnews.to/2K4tvNZ on Tuesday that a day before the fire started, PG&E emailed a local landowner about ""problems with sparks"" and the need for workers to enter her property and work on the high-power lines. The company, however, was unable to address the issue as the landowner was out of town, the report said. The company said in the filing it had renewed liability insurance coverage for wildfire events of about $1.4 billion for the period from Aug. 1 through July 31, 2019. PG&E did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

2018-11-14,"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC and its partners are discussing a proposal to cut oil output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd), three sources familiar with the issue said, although Russia may not be on board for such a large reduction. Worried by a drop in oil prices due to slowing demand and record supply from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is talking about a U-turn just months after increasing production.  Such a shift could anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who urged OPEC on Monday not to cut supply. It also risks handing market share to the United States, while the sources said Russia might not be willing to back such a move. A steep slide in prices has surprised many oil market participants. Brent crude has fallen from a four-year high of $86 a barrel in early October to $66 on Wednesday. Just weeks ago, some trading firms were talking of $100 oil. The sources, who declined to be identified by name as the talks are confidential, said a cut of 1.4 million bpd - equal to 1.4 percent of world demand - was one option discussed by energy ministers from Saudi Arabia, non-OPEC Russia and other nations in Abu Dhabi on Sunday. “I believe a cut of 1.4 million bpd is more reasonable than above it or below it,” one of the sources said. OPEC and a group of non-OPEC nations, led by Russia, have been cooperating to limit oil supply since the start of 2017. They partially unwound their reduction in June after pressure from Trump to lower prices. The OPEC-led deal got rid of a glut that built up in 2014 as supply from the United States and other countries outside the group soared. OPEC production rose too, after the then Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi blocked an OPEC curb on supplies to preserve market share. This time, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih has publicly spoken of a need to lower supplies by 1 million bpd, showing price support is trumping market share. OPEC meets on Dec. 6 to set policy for 2019. A new round of OPEC-led supply cuts in 2019 would further support U.S. shale oil production, potentially repeating the cycle that played out in 2014. Oil prices LCOc1 rose on Wednesday, after Tuesday’s 6.6 percent drop, the largest one-day loss since July.  With three weeks to go until the Dec. 6 meeting in Vienna, OPEC and its partners have not settled on a final figure for a new supply cut, the sources said.  One of the three sources said a minimum cut of 1 million bpd was being considered and it could be larger than 1.4 million bpd. Another source, an OPEC delegate, agreed that a larger cut than 1.4 million bpd was possible, depending on the market. Nigeria and Libya, which are exempt from the current supply limiting accord, could be included in a new agreement, two of the sources familiar with the matter said.  “We are talking about a cut from everyone, including Nigeria and Libya because their production has exceeded the cap in recent months,” one source said. While Nigeria and Libyan output has risen, another OPEC member Iran is facing lower exports due to U.S. sanctions that started this month. Tehran might not be called upon to deliver a voluntary cut, another of the three sources said. Iran, which was angered by higher Saudi and Russian  production in response to pressure from Trump, will welcome supply cuts by those producers. OPEC officials were not sure whether Russia will join another round of supply cuts. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Wednesday no emergency action was warranted to stem the decline in prices. “The market is quite volatile today. We remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way, now it is going down. We have to look into long-term development, into how the price will be stabilised,” he said in Singapore. But OPEC officials hope Moscow will come round eventually. One of the three sources said any cut for Russia could be gradual, citing the example of the 2017 output reduction deal when Moscow delivered its share of the cuts in phases. “There are a few challenges to the proposal and Russia is one of them,” another source said.

2018-11-14,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QHeLqG By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas prices have leapt to the highest level for more than four years as the market tries to conserve scarce gas stocks in the face of unusually cold weather settling across much of the country. Futures prices for gas delivered at Henry Hub in January 2019 have surged to more than $4.50 per million British thermal units, up from just $3.28 at the start of the month, and the highest since July 2014. Gas stocks are at the lowest seasonal level for 15 years and around 15-16 percent lower than at the same point last year and the five-year average, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. While most forecasters have been predicting a relatively mild winter across the northern United States because of the El Niño developing over the Pacific, temperatures have recently fallen far below the seasonal average. Until the end of the first week in November, temperatures had been slightly milder than the long-run average and in line with the start of winter in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Since then, however, temperatures have plunged well below normal across most of the lower 48 states pushing cumulative heating demand up sharply (tmsnrt.rs/2QHeLqG). Colder than average weather is expected to persist across most northern and eastern population centres for the next week according to the U.S. government’s Climate Prediction Center. If the forecast is correct, this will be the first colder than average start for over three years and increase the pressure on already-stretched gas supplies. The confluence of unusually cold weather with very low gas stocks has sent near-term gas prices surging as the market tries to limit consumption as much as possible. Rising prices should encourage gas-fired power producers to limit the number of hours they run in the next few weeks to conserve stocks, while price differentials should result in maximum switching to coal generation. If benchmark gas prices rise high enough, they could also discourage LNG exports. But low inventories have left the market very vulnerable with price spikes likely to recur later in the winter to cope with any extended periods of cold weather. As a result, hedge fund managers have a clear bullish bias on prices this winter, with long positions still outnumbering short ones by a ratio of more than 4:1 last week, only slightly below the multi-year peak of 5:1 set in mid-October.

European shares hit a two-week low after data showed the German economy contracted for the first time since 2015, tracking similar losses in Asia where data in Japan and China underscored worries about weaker growth. They later pared some losses after Reuters reported that OPEC and its partners were discussing a proposal to cut output, helping oil prices reverse opening losses and putting an end to their longest losing streak in decades. The MSCI’s world equity index remained on track for its fifth day of losses in a row, but reduced its decline to 0.1 percent by 1243 GMT. The pan-European STOXX benchmark index was down 0.2 percent, while U.S. stock index futures pointed to a flat open. Sterling fell from the 7-month high versus the euro EURGBP= D3 and eased below $1.30 in volatile trading after being boosted from news that Britain and the European Union agreed on the text of a Brexit divorce deal. “After 873 days of bickering, point scoring, intransigence on both sides, and seemingly irreconcilable differences, we finally have a deal,” said Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid. “Now this easy part is out of the way along comes the hard part of selling it to a divided Parliament full of vested interests and factions,” he added in a note. Before seeking UK parliamentary approval before exiting the bloc on March 29, 2019, May will try to persuade senior ministers to accept the deal that opponents said would imperil her own government and threaten national unity. The British cabinet is due to meet at 1400 GMT. Although sterling softened from peaks hit in the previous session, investors were anticipating wild swings ahead for the British currency. Sterling/dollar implied overnight volatility jumped to 23 percent, its highest since a general election in June 2017. “We are cognisant that the recent provisional deal is only a step in the right direction and if it does not pass the meaningful vote the opposite scenario is likely to play out,” said Richard Larner, Head of Research at Brooks Macdonald. “In this event, investors will begin to price a no-deal situation into investment markets,” he added. Meanwhile, oil attempted to rebound after plunging around 7 percent the previous session, with surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scaring off investors. The growing prospect of OPEC and allied producers cutting output at a meeting next month however propped up the market, helping U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures trade 0.3 percent at $55.9 a barrel and reverse opening losses. According to three sources familiar with the issue, OPEC and its partners are discussing a proposal to cut oil output by up to 1.4 million barrels per day for 2019, to avert an oversupply that would weaken prices. In the previous session, U.S. crude futures suffered 12 straight sessions of losses. “We went through our archives yesterday and found a bit more daily data back to 1977, and we still can’t find a losing run of this magnitude,” said Deutsche Bank’s Reid. Brent crude oil futures also bounced, up 0.9 percent, at $66.05 per barrel. In the previous session they hit an eight month low following a 25 percent slide from the four-year high reached early in October. Energy stocks in Europe also recovered ground but remained in negative territory, down 0.4 percent. The oil plunge underlined cracks in the global economy. The German economy shrank 0.2 percent in the third quarter as global trade disputes and problems in the auto industry threw the traditional export growth engine into reverse. Earlier in the day, data from Japan confirmed the world’s third-largest economy contracted in the third quarter. Still in currency markets, the euro struggled below $1.13 as Italy re-submitted its draft budget for next year to the European Commission with the same growth and deficit assumptions that had been rejected by Brussels. “While boosting its privatisation plan and committing to mitigate spending overshoots, the Italian government did not change its deficit targets. This will likely lead the European Commission to recommend an infringement procedure,” said Morgan Stanley analysts. Concerns over the Italian budget also spread to debt markets with yields on Italian government bonds hitting three-week highs, widening the gap over top-rated German peers, while shares in Italian banks fell 1.3 percent. In commodities, base metals eased slightly as weak retail sales data from top consumer China took the shine off upbeat industrial output and investment figures in the country.

2018-11-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - France set out plans on Wednesday to tackle deforestation around the world, saying it would look to curb imports of products such as palm oil, soy, and beef which it said contributed to the problem of forest areas disappearing. Palm oil, a type of vegetable oil used in confectionery and other goods, is controversial because of the environmental impact of clearing forests to make way for plantations. The majority of the world’s palm oil comes from Malaysia and Indonesia, where deforestation has threatened orangutan populations. In a joint statement, five French ministries said that in between 1990 and 2015, the world’s forest area fell by 129 million hectares (319 million acres) — eight times the size of France’s mainland forest.  “(This lead) to an 11 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions and significant consequences in terms of preserving biodiversity and natural habitats,” they said. “European countries bear an important responsibility, since a third of this deforestation is due to the consumption of agricultural products by the countries of the European Union.” Companies and governments - including the European Union - made multiple pledges to halt deforestation in recent years but progress in dealing with the issue has been slow. France proposed 17 measures aimed at putting a halt by 2030 to deforestation caused by imports of non-sustainable forest or agricultural products.  These include financial aid to encourage developing countries to respect non-deforestation criteria, the launch of a “zero deforestation” label for consumers by 2020 and a push next year for a European policy on imports posing a risk for forests.  As part of a renewable energy bill adopted on Tuesday, the EU said it would phase out biofuels containing feedstock that contribute to deforestation by 2030. France echoed this measure on Wednesday. In May, France had allowed a limited use of palm oil at Total’s planned La Mede biofuel refinery, a move that prompted an outcry from environment activists and farmers who said the palm oil would be imported. Former environment minister Nicolas Hulot said soon after his appointment last year he would limit the use of palm oil in biofuels in France to reduce deforestation in the countries of origin, raising outcry from Indonesia and Malaysia, but he took no concrete measures to do so.

The sources are a senior government official and a member of Iraq’s ministerial energy committee. “The American deadline of 45 days to stop importing Iranian gas is not enough at all for Iraq to find an alternative source,” the first official said. “Stopping Iranian gas after the deadline will create a real power crisis.

Alexander Novak reporters on the sideline of an international conference in Singapore that long-term oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision was taken by oil producing countries. He was talking as oil markets fell again, extending losses from a 7 percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors. Novak said oil prices had averaged around $70 per barrel this year. “The market is quite volatile today. We remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way, now it is going down. We have to look into long-term development, into how the price will be stabilised,” he said. “It’s not right for market participants to react to any one-off fluctuations,” he said. Novak also said the oil market still did not fully understand the fallout from U.S. sanctions against Iran, and how buyers would behave. The United States announced the reinstatement of sanctions earlier this month against Iran over Tehran’s activities in the Middle East. Eight importing countries have been given temporary exemptions by the United States to keep buying Iranian oil, prompting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to say Washington would not be able to cut Iran’s oil exports to zero. “I think the market is volatile due to a lot of uncertainty,” Novak said.

2018-11-14,"LONDON, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Global oil supply will outpace demand throughout 2019, as a “relentless” rise in output is swamps growth in consumption that is at risk from a slowing economy, the International Energy Agency said on Wednesday. In its monthly oil market report, the Paris-based IEA left its forecast for global demand growth for 2018 and 2019 unchanged from last month at 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) and 1.4 million bpd, respectively, but cut its forecast for non-OECD demand growth, the engine of expansion in world oil consumption. “While slower economic growth in some countries reduces the outlook for oil demand, a significant downward revision to our price assumption is supportive,” the IEA said. Since early October, the oil price has fallen by a quarter to below $70 a barrel, its lowest in eight months. The agency raised its forecast for oil output growth from countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to 2.4 million bpd this year and 1.9 million bpd next year, versus its previous estimate of 2.2 million bpd and 1.8 million bpd, respectively. The IEA also cut its forecast for demand for OPEC crude by 300,000 bpd to 31.3 million bpd in 2019.

2018-11-14,"PARADISE, Calif., Nov 14 (Reuters) - National Guard troops were due to arrive on Wednesday to help search for more victims in the charred, ash-strewn ruins where the northern California town of Paradise stood, before it was erased in the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in state history. The Guard contingent, about 100 military police trained to look for and identify human remains, will reinforce the coroner-led recovery teams, cadaver dogs and forensic anthropologists already scouring the ghostly landscape of a fire that has killed at least 48 people. The grim, painstaking search is concentrated in what little is left of Paradise, a Sierra foothills town in Butte County, California, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco, that was overrun by flames and largely incinerated last Thursday. The killer blaze, fueled by thick, drought-desiccated scrub and fanned by fierce winds, capped a catastrophic California wildfire season that experts largely attribute to prolonged dry spells they say are symptomatic of global climate change. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has killed two people, destroyed over 400 structures and displaced about 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. The origins of both the Camp and Woolsey fires were listed as under investigation. But two utility companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, reported to regulators they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started. By late Tuesday, with the help of diminished winds and rising humidity levels, fire crews had managed to carve containment lines around more than a third of both fires, easing further the immediate threat to life and property. U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and California Governor Jerry Brown were scheduled on Wednesday to pay a visit to the areas, which President Donald Trump declared a disaster areas, making federal emergency assistance more readily available. After touring some of California’s earlier wildfire zones in August, Zinke blamed “gross mismanagement of forests” because of timber harvest restrictions that he said were supported by “environmental terrorist groups”. While prospects for suppressing the flames grew more hopeful, authorities pressed on with the task of accounting for those listed as missing. County Sheriff Kory Honea said he requested the Guard troops, along with “disaster mortuary” crew, portable military morgue teams and specialists from a private DNA laboratory to speed the detection and identification of additional remains. “We want to cover as much ground as we can,” Honea said at a Tuesday evening news conference where he announced that the six latest sets of remains had been recovered in Paradise earlier in the day. The fatality count of 48 already far exceeds the previous record for the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire in California history - 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933. Honea said that in some cases victims were burned beyond recognition, or even beyond the use of fingerprint IDs. Dental records will be needed to positively identify some, but “dental records might not be available if the dentist office burned to the ground”, he said. “We’re finding remains in various states,” he told reporters. “People have been badly burned. Some of them, I assume, have been consumed.” He said it was possible that some remains might turn up only once residents with homes still intact are able to return. More than 50,000 remained under evacuation orders. Honea had previously said 228 people were listed as missing. However, he said on Tuesday night those numbers were highly fluid and that his office planned to publish a new list of missing persons soon and would ask the public to help account for them. He said it remained unclear how many individuals whose whereabouts were unknown had perished or fallen out of touch in chaotic evacuations. Wind-driven flames roared through Paradise so swiftly that residents were forced to flee for their lives with little or no warning. Bodies of some victims were found in and around the burned-out wreckage of vehicles engulfed in the firestorm as evacuation traffic ground to a half in deadly knots of gridlock hours after the fire erupted. By late Tuesday, the Camp Fire had blackened 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares) in all. The Woolsey fire by comparison has scorched 96,000 acres (39,000 hectares) of chaparral-covered rolling hills and canyons spanning Ventura and Los Angeles counties, an area roughly the size of Denver. On Tuesday, white-clad forensic teams fanned out to pick through the barren, fire-scorched lots in a town once home to 27,000 people. On a residential street in Paradise lined with obliterated houses, a 10-member search crew wearing white protective suits and red helmets used a dog to scour the debris. “Look for skulls, the big bones,” one forensics worker said to others as they used metal poles and their hands to sift through ruins. At a nearby community swimming pool, recovery workers stirred green, darkened waters with long poles to probe for bodies. Additional reporting by Noel Randewich and Sharon Bernstein in

2018-11-14,"SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said long-term oil prices should be taken into consideration when any decision is taken by oil-producing countries and no emergency action to stem a decline in oil prices is warranted. He was talking as oil markets fell again on Wednesday, extending losses from a 7 percent plunge the previous session as surging supply and the spectre of faltering demand scared off investors. Novak said oil prices have averaged around $70 per barrel this year. “The market is quite volatile today. We remember that the oil price was sharply rising in the same way, now it is going down. We have to look into long-term development, into how the price will be stabilised,” he told reporters on the sideline of an international conference in Singapore. “It’s not right for market participants to react to any one-off fluctuations,” he said. He also said that the oil market still does not fully understand the fallout from the U.S. sanctions against Iran and how buyers will behave. He said that Russia has been cutting oil production by around 20,000 barrels per day so far in November.

2018-11-14,"* Airline ramping up U.S. capacity with non-stop flights * A350-900ULR seats 67 in business, 94 in premium economy * Premium economy fares to New York as low as S$1,698 return By Jamie Freed SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Singapore Airlines Ltd is facing no problem selling business class tickets on its ultra-long non-stop flights to the United States but is having to price premium economy seats very attractively, a senior executive said on Wednesday. The carrier last month resumed after five years the world’s longest commercial flight, a near-19 hour non-stop journey from Singapore to New York. The airline ordered seven new ultra-long range twin-engine Airbus SE A350-900ULRs fitted with just 67 business class and 94 premium economy seats for those flights and for non-stop services to Los Angeles and San Francisco. These flights have no economy class seats. It represents a major expansion in the U.S. market for Singapore Airlines and a test of whether the carrier can charge the 20 percent price premium that travel industry data shows is typical for ultra-long non-stop services due to their popularity with time-sensitive business travellers. Singapore Airlines Executive Vice President Commercial Mak Swee Wah said there was existing demand for business class which he expected would continue to pick up. For premium economy, however, he said some markets were not “entirely familiar” with the product, which offers more leg room and other amenities than economy class. “I think we need to continue to stimulate and encourage the market to consider this product, initially with very attractive pricing, but eventually I think people will see that even at prices which we offer it is a good product to purchase because it is a very long flight,” he said at an analyst and media briefing. His comments came after Singapore Airlines reported on Tuesday an 81 percent plunge in second-quarter net profit, hurt by higher fuel prices, lower airfares and non-cash losses at its part-owned Virgin Australia Holdings Ltd. Yields, a proxy for ticket prices, fell 2.2 percent in the second quarter compared with a year earlier, failing to help offset the impact of a 24 percent rise in fuel prices. Singapore Airlines is offering premium economy fares as low as S$1,698 ($1,230.17) return from Singapore to New York for weekday travel over part of the peak Christmas travel period, according to its website. That is in line with economy class fares from premium rivals like Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and Dubai-based Emirates that require a stop and a longer travel time, according to a Reuters search on Expedia. Mak declined to comment on whether Singapore Airlines could consider changing the configuration of the plane to include more business class seats. When it previously flew to New York and Los Angeles non-stop on four-engined A340-500 jets that used more fuel, it had initially offered both “executive economy” and business class but later switched to an all-business class configuration. Those flights were abandoned in 2013 when high fuel prices made them uneconomic.

2018-11-14,"PARIS (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Wednesday announced a 500 million euros ($564 million) plan to help motorists with the lowest incomes, in a bid to defuse a wave of nationwide protests against a tax increase on fuels. The government will double the current 2,000 euro bonus granted to motorists on low incomes who change old-model cars seen as contributing to pollution for more recent and cleaner ones, Philippe told RTL radio on Wednesday. The government will also increase other aids granted to motorists, as well as an existing special aid for low income families who use diesel fuel to heat their homes. Philippe said the new plans would overall represent an extra 500 million euro cost for the government.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open lower, with Britain’s FTSE losing 0.4 percent, Germany’s DAX slipping 0.3 percent and France’s CAC  shedding 0.5 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dived 7 percent the previous day, suffering their biggest one-day loss in more than three years. The contracts last stood at $55.30 per barrel for a loss of 0.7 percent, following a descent to a one-year low of $54.75 overnight. Brent crude was down 0.35 percent at $65.24 per barrel after tanking 6.8 percent on Tuesday and set an eight-month trough of $64.61. Brent had soared to a four-year high of $86.74 early in October as the market braced for U.S. sanctions on Iran, but prices have sunk roughly 25 percent since then. Concerns about global growth pushed MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 0.55 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index retreated 0.9 percent. Australian stocks fell 1.75 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.3 percent and Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.16 percent. The Dow and S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Tuesday as lower oil prices took a toll on energy shares, offsetting a small gain in technology stocks and renewed hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade talks. “While the plunge in WTI will no doubt act as a relief for emerging markets and the global consumer, U.S. real rates continue to climb, underwriting the dollar’s strength,” wrote Sean Darby, chief global equity strategist at Jefferies. “The competition for capital is coinciding with a sharp slowdown in China and emerging markets, putting pressure on 2019 earnings.” Riskier assets have come under strong selling pressure over the past two months as worries about a peak in earnings growth added to international trade tensions and signs of slowing in global investment and growth. The oil plunge underlined cracks in the global economy. In Japan, data confirmed the world’s third-largest economy contracted in the third quarter, adding to growing signs of weakness globally, with China and Europe losing momentum. Germany is expected to report later in the day that its economy also shrank last quarter. “The markets would have reacted more positively to U.S.-China trade and Brexit-related headlines a few months ago,” said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “But currently there is more focus on the possibility of both the U.S. and Chinese leaders maintaining their tough stance, with a compromise eluding them, and Brexit bogging down. Market sentiment is clearly cooling down.” The United Kingdom and European Union agreed on the text for a Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday. Prime Minister Theresa May will present the draft withdrawal agreement to her senior ministers on Wednesday for discussion and then decide on the next steps. Lifted by the latest hopes for a Brexit deal, the pound extended overnight gains and was last 0.1 percent higher at $1.2986. Brexit hopes also supported the euro. The single currency was up 0.05 percent at $1.1292, pulling back from a 17-month trough of $1.1216 brushed on Monday. The euro’s gains, however, were tempered by concerns over Italy’s budget proposals. The European Commission rejected Italy’s plan last month and has threatened to impose penalties if it is not revised to conform with EU regulations - something Rome has indicated it is unwilling to do. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against six major currencies, lost 0.15 percent to 97.138. The index had steadily climbed to a 16-month peak of 97.693 on Monday amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep gradually raising interest rates. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) warned on Tuesday that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. OPEC member states rely on high oil prices to finance government budgets and they have been watching the increase in supply and the corresponding price slump with concern. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, OPEC has been making increasingly frequent public statements that it would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices. “OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels, which is a decision that we expect to be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6,” said Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Such a stance, however, has caused friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, who supports low oil prices and has called on OPEC not to cut production.

2018-11-14,"ABU DHABI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) will remain wholly owned by the Abu Dhabi government and has no plan to go public, but the firm aspires to compete with Big Oil by expanding in refining and gas, ADNOC’s CEO told Reuters. ADNOC, which announced two gas deals with France’s Total and Italy’s Eni this week, will strike more agreements in that sector and seek investment opportunities abroad in liquefied natural gas (LNG), Sultan al-Jaber said. “ADNOC will continue to be wholly owned by one and only one shareholder, and that is the Abu Dhabi government,” al-Jaber said. But the company will continue to “unlock the potential” of its other subsidiaries and assets as it works to gain access to new markets abroad and expand its share in oil and gas, he said. “There will be more initiative (gas) plans,” al-Jaber said in an interview in Abu Dhabi. “We are not going to expand beyond our borders in upstream. We don’t need to. We have access to vast, vast oil and gas reserves,” he said. “Our expansion ... is going to be in downstream, whether refining or petrochemicals,” he added. On Sunday, ADNOC said it had signed an agreement with Total granting the French company a 40 percent stake in the Ruwais Diyab unconventional gas concession. ADNOC aims to reach 1 billion cubic feet per day of unconventional gas production before 2030. “This is untapped. No one is doing this at this scale in this region,” he said of the tight-gas project with Total. On Tuesday ADNOC signed a deal with Eni, awarding the Italian company a 25 percent stake in an offshore ultra-sour gas project. A day earlier the Abu Dhabi producer also signed a framework agreement with national energy company Saudi Aramco to explore investment opportunities in natural gas and LNG. As the diplomatic alliance between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi grows closer, cooperation between the two state-run firms is also increasing. The two companies are to invest jointly in an oil refinery and petrochemicals complex in India. Aramco and ADNOC working together is “a powerhouse”, al-Jaber said. “We are going to be soon looking and exploring LNG business opportunities together with Aramco,” he said. ADNOC, the top national energy company of the United Arab Emirates, a key member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about 3 million barrels of oil and 10.5 billion cubic feet of raw gas a day. Last week, it announced plans to increase its oil production capacity to 4 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of 2020 and 5 million bpd by 2030 after unveiling new oil and gas finds. The UAE wants to achieve gas self-sufficiency and possibly become a net gas exporter. The UAE holds the seventh-largest proven reserves of natural gas in the world, at slightly more than 215 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Despite that, the UAE became a net gas importer in 2008 due to growing demand for power and as it needed gas to reinject into its oilfields to enhance crude production. The UAE has been importing gas from Qatar via the Dolphin Gas pipeline. ADNOC, founded in 1971, has undergone major change since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, part of wider economic reforms led by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Al-Jaber has embarked on privatising its services businesses, ventured into oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors. ADNOC sold 10 percent of fuel retail unit ADNOC Distribution in an initial public offering last year. ADNOC needs to accept that business as usual will no longer allow the company to excel, al-Jaber said. “We want ADNOC ... to operate like an international oil company,” he said. “This is how I view a progressive ADNOC.” (Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Dale Hudson)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/emirates-oil-adnoc/uaes-adnoc-wants-to-rival-oil-majors-as-it-expands-in-refining-gas-idUKL8N1XO1W0,14 Nov 2018,"Abu Dhabi National Oil Co

2018-11-14,"MUMBAI, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Shares in India’s top three oil marketing companies surged on Wednesday, as investors cheered the slump in global crude oil prices that bode well for the profitability of Indian refiners. India’s biggest state-owned refiner Indian Oil Corp was up 7.81 percent on the National Stock Exchange, while Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp rose 7.44 percent and 8.57 percent, respectively. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures struggle to claw back after plunging 7 percent on Tuesday, over concerns of a potential supply glut in 2019. The sharp drop came after the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said late Tuesday that crude oil output from seven major shale basins in the country was expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December. This coincided with a monthly report from the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) that the market would see a lower demand than expected in 2019. A low crude oil price is a boost to India’s state-owned oil marketing companies and the economy in general which imports 80 percent of its crude oil requirement. The three public sector companies were forced to take a price cut last month hurting their margins as the government wanted to cushion the impact of high crude oil price on the public. Shares in Indian airline companies InterGlobe Aviation Ltd , Jet Airways Ltd and SpiceJet Ltd also rallied on Wednesday, as the surge in oil prices earlier this year had pushed them into losses.

2018-11-14,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil traders’ worries over record supplies arriving in Asia just as the outlook for its key growth economies weakens have pulled down global crude benchmarks by a quarter since early October. Ship-tracking data shows a record of more than 22 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil hitting Asia’s main markets in November, up around 15 percent since January 2017, and an increase of nearly 5 percent since the start of this year.  Much of this oil was ordered ahead of U.S. sanctions against Iran that were imposed this month, as refiners prepared for a sudden drop in supply. But with unexpectedly broad exemptions granted by Washington that allow Asia’s main oil consumers to continue buying crude from Iran, the overall supply drop has not materialised. Global supply has instead surged, led by soaring output from the world’s three-biggest producers - the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia - who in October broke through joint output of 33 million bpd for the first time, meeting more than a third of total oil consumption. That surge has so far been met by healthy demand, not only in Asia’s main emerging economies of China and India, but also in the mature markets of Japan and South Korea. Now, though, the rising supplies are threatening to turn into a glut, triggering a 25 percent sell-off in spot crude contracts since early October as financial traders pulled money out of oil markets. Analysts warn the situation may get worse, with increasing signs of a slowdown across Asia’s biggest economies. “Momentum still appears to be slowing across the region, reflecting a combination of tighter financial conditions and slowing global trade,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of economic research for Asia at HSBC in Hong Kong. ECONOMIC U-TURN China, Asia’s biggest economy, may see its first fall in car sales on record in 2018 as consumption is stifled amid a trade war between Washington and Beijing. In Japan, the economy contracted in the third quarter, hit by natural disasters but also by a decline in exports amid the rising protectionism that is starting to take its toll on global trade. And in India, a plunging rupee has resulted in surging import costs, including for oil, stifling purchases in one of Asia’s biggest emerging markets. India’s car sales are also set to register a fall this year. “While over the past few months, the focus was on the Iran embargo and Venezuela’s output struggles, i.e. the risks of too little supply, the market now increasingly looks concerned about the prospects of too much supply,” said Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss bank Julius Baer. “Hedge funds and other speculative money have swiftly changed from the long to the short side,” he said.  As recently as September and October, leading oil traders and analysts were forecasting oil prices of $90 or even $100 a barrel by year-end. Since then, there has been a dramatic shift in sentiment that has turned the entire forward curve for crude oil upside down. Spot prices in September were significantly higher than those for forward deliveries, a structure known as backwardation that implies a tight market as it is unattractive to put oil into storage. By this week, the curve had flipped into contango, when crude prices for immediate buys are cheaper than those for later dispatch. That implies an oversupplied market in which it is attractive to store oil for later sale. HSBC’s Neumann said the outlook heading into 2019 remained downcast: “Economic activity continues to decelerate, which likely curtails underlying energy demand growth for a while.” GRAPHIC: Brent curve in Sept vs Nov, https://tmsnrt.rs/2QALtKe Reporting by Henning Gloystein; Editing by Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/asia-oil-demand/refile-graphic-asias-weakening-economies-record-supply-threaten-to-create-oil-glut-idUKL8N1XP0C0,14 Nov 2018,* Top-3 oil producers see output surge: https://tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8,"REFILE-GRAPHIC-Asia's weakening economies, record supply threaten to create oil glut"
2018-11-14,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - The remains of six more fire victims were found on Tuesday in a northern California town overrun by flames last week, raising the death toll to 48 in the most lethal and destructive wildfire in California’s history. The latest fatality count was announced by Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea after forensic teams with cadaver dogs spent the day combing through a ghostly landscape strewn with ash and charred debris in what was left of the Sierra foothills hamlet of Paradise, about 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. Honea said 100 National Guard troops were being sent in at his request to assist the search for additional human remains left by the so-called Camp Fire. The intensified effort to locate victims came on the sixth day of a blaze that has incinerated more than 8,800 homes and other buildings, including most of Paradise, a town once home to 27,000 people that was largely erased hours after the fire began on Thursday. More than 50,000 area residents remained under evacuation orders. The killer blaze had blackened 130,000 acres (52,600 hectares) of drought-parched scrub by Tuesday but crews had carved containment lines around a third of the fire’s expanding perimeter, helped by diminished winds and high humidity. The news was likewise more upbeat on the southern end of California’s wildfire front, where a blaze called the Woolsey Fire has killed two people, destroyed more than 400 structures and displaced some 200,000 people in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. That blaze has scorched 96,000 acres (39,000 hectares) of chaparral-covered rolling hills and canyons spanning Ventura and Los Angeles counties, an area roughly the size of Denver.  Beyond the loss of homes, Los Angeles County Sheriff Jim McDonnell said the fire had destroyed “deep infrastructure” - power lines, water lines, sewers, roads, and lights - “and other things that make a city a city.” However, containment of the fire grew to 35 percent on Tuesday as several communities previously under evacuation orders were reopened to residents, a sign firefighters were gaining the upper hand, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Daryl Osby said. The causes of the Camp and Woolsey fires were under investigation. Two utility companies, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, reported to regulators they experienced problems with transmission lines or substations in areas around the time the blazes were reported to have started. The battle against the Camp Fire on Tuesday was waged most intensely in steep, thickly wooded canyons filled with desiccated brush along the southern flank of the blaze. “The fuel is so dry that if we get any wind, the fire is going to move,” fire Captain Bill Murphy, a spokesman for the incident command, told Reuters. While prospects for suppressing the fire grew more hopeful, authorities stepped up the grim task of sifting through rubble of homes obliterated in wind-driven flames that roared through Paradise, sending residents fleeing for their lives. The bodies of some victims were found in and around the burned-out wreckage of vehicles engulfed in the firestorm as evacuation traffic halted in deadly knots of gridlock hours after the fire erupted. “The fire was so rapid, we couldn’t keep ahead of it,” Honea said. The latest tally of 48 dead far surpasses the previous record for the greatest loss of life from a single wildfire in California history when 29 people killed by the Griffith Park fire in Los Angeles in 1933.  Honea said, in some cases, victims were burned beyond recognition, or even beyond the use of fingerprint identification. “We’re finding remains in various states,” he told reporters. “People have been badly burned. Some of them, I assume, have been consumed.” Honea had previously said 228 people were listed as missing. However, he said on Tuesday night those numbers were highly fluid and that his office planned to publish a new list of missing persons soon and would ask the public to help account for them. He said it remained unclear how many individuals whose whereabouts were unknown had perished or fallen out of touch in chaotic evacuations. Teams of workers wielding chainsaws cleared downed power lines and other obstacles from Paradise streets while forensics investigators picked through barren, fire-scorched lots. A 10-member forensics search team wearing white protective suits and red helmets used a dog to scour the debris on one residential street in Paradise lined with razed houses. “Look for skulls, the big bones,” one forensics worker said to others as they used metal poles and their hands to sift through ruins. Recovery workers stirred green, darkened waters with long poles to probe for bodies at a nearby community swimming pool. Honea said 150 additional search personnel were due to arrive in the area, reinforcing 13 coroner-led recovery teams. He has requested portable morgue teams from the U.S. military, as well as a disaster mortuary crew, additional cadaver dogs and forensic anthropology units. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster from the California wildfires on Monday night, making federal emergency funds more readily available in the stricken counties. California has endured two of its worst wildfire seasons in recorded history in the past two years, which experts attribute in large part to prolonged drought across the western United States.

The single currency was up 0.15 percent at $1.1302, pulling back from a 17-month trough of $1.1216 brushed on Monday. The euro’s gains, however, were tempered by concerns over Italy’s budget proposals. The European Commission rejected Italy’s plan last month and has threatened to impose penalties if it is not revised to conform with EU regulations - something Rome has indicated it is unwilling to do. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against six major currencies, lost 0.25 percent to 97.051. The index had steadily climbed to a 16-month peak of 97.693 on Monday amid the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep gradually raising interest rates. Also weighing on the dollar, U.S. Treasury yields slid to more than one-week lows overnight as the sharp drop in oil prices suggested a more subdued inflation outlook. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) warned on Tuesday that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. OPEC member states rely on high oil prices to finance government budgets and they have been watching the increase in supply and the corresponding price slump with concern. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, OPEC has been making increasingly frequent public statements that it would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices. “OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels, which is a decision that we expect to be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6,” said Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. Such a stance, however, has caused friction with U.S. President Donald Trump, who supports low oil prices and has called on OPEC not to cut production.

2018-11-14,"(Repeats column that ran on Tuesday, with no changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QEVR3A By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 13 (Reuters) - Oil prices have fallen sharply since passing a cyclical peak at the start of October, amid surging production and mounting concerns about the state of the global economy and the outlook for consumption growth in 2019. Front-month Brent futures prices have dropped by more than $17 per barrel (20 percent) over the last five weeks while WTI futures prices have declined for a record 11 days in a row. OPEC and its allies, who were talking about increasing production as recently as October to offset the impact of sanctions on Iran, are now openly discussing the need for output cuts to avert a build-up in stocks. Some commentators have expressed surprise at the rapid turn round in the market outlook for under- to oversupply but in fact such shifts have been fairly common. The prospective reimposition of sanctions on Iran masked a big shift in the market outlook in recent months as non-OPEC oil production accelerated while consumption growth showed signs of slowing. Once the threat of severe sanctions was lifted, at least for the time being, the market refocused on the deteriorating supply-demand background and prices have adjusted downwards. The reimposition of sanctions on Iran played the same role in 2018 as the disruption of Libya’s oil exports and advance of Islamist fighters across northern Iraq played in 2014. The initial risk of tough sanctions on Iran kept oil prices elevated even as surging U.S. shale production and sluggish growth in oil consumption pointed towards an emerging surplus. In the event, the United States offered more generous waivers to enable Iran’s customers to continue purchasing crude, backing away from an earlier strategy of cutting Iran’s exports to zero. Much the same thing happened in June 2014, when Islamist fighters failed to capture the oilfields around Kirkuk and Iraqi Kurdistan or advance towards the oilfields in the south, contrary to earlier fears. With the resumption of oil exports from Libya and the continuation of shipments from Iraq, oil traders turned their attention to the accelerating shale production and fading consumption growth in the second half of 2014. U.S. crude and condensates production surged by 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 12 months to August 2018, even more than the 1.5 million bpd increase in the 12 months to June 2014. OPEC is again forecasting that non-OPEC production increases will outstrip global consumption growth in 2019, reducing the need for its own oil, a re-run of conditions in the middle of 2014. Faced with accelerating production and decelerating consumption, OPEC and its allies face the same dilemma as in June 2014: cut output to support prices, or allow prices to fall to protect market share. In 2014, OPEC opted to leave output unchanged and allow prices to fall in a bid to curb surging U.S. shale production, a strategy that proved successful ultimately but ravaged the finances of its members. OPEC ministers must decide whether to pursue a similar course in 2018, or cut their own output, at the risk of prolonging the U.S. shale boom and sacrificing more market share. The oil market is a complex adaptive system which exhibits highly non-linear dynamics and regularly cycles between periods of under- and oversupply (tmsnrt.rs/2QEVR3A). Like other complex systems, the market can shift from one phase (undersupply) to another (oversupply) very rapidly and with little warning (“Cyclical behaviour of the oil market”, Reuters, June 2018). So the switch from fears about prospective undersupply in August and September to concerns about emerging oversupply in October and November should not really come as a surprise. There have been strong indications for some time that the oil market was nearing a cyclical peak based on accelerating production and decelerating consumption trends. Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positions in crude to close to the lowest level for two years in a sign that sentiment has shifted decisively. The critical question is whether the price surge will now be followed by a period of consolidation just below the recent peak (as in 2003-2004, 2006-2007 and 2011-2014) or a deep slump (2008-2009 and 2014-2016). At this point, it is impossible to determine which outcome is more likely, but it will most likely depend on the interplay between four main factors: * OPEC and Russia’s decision on whether to focus on protecting prices or market share * U.S. shale production’s responsiveness to moderately lower prices * The White House’s decision on whether to toughen Iran sanctions * The depth and duration of any slowdown in the global economy in 2019 Related presentations: - A brief history of the oil crash (Reuters, Jan. 16, 2015)(tmsnrt.rs/2QEztrc) Related columns: - Hedge funds enforce correction to oil market’s course (Reuters, Nov. 12) - Oil market passes cyclical peak (Reuters, Nov. 2) - Oil prices fall as economic outlook deteriorates (Reuters, Oct. 30) - Oil market hears echoes of 2007 (Reuters, Sept. 24) (Editing by Susan Fenton)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-prices-kemp/rpt-column-oil-prices-tumble-as-traders-look-beyond-iran-kemp-idUKL8N1XO6H7,14 Nov 2018,"Oil prices have fallen sharply

U.S. crude futures dived 7 percent the previous day, suffering their biggest one-day loss in more than three years. The contracts last stood at $55.72 per barrel following a descent to $54.75 overnight, their lowest since November 2017. OPEC warned on Tuesday that a supply glut could emerge in 2019 as the world economy slows and rivals increase production more quickly than expected. The concerns about global growth pushed MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.07 percent. Australian stocks fell 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI lost 0.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei added 0.3 percent. The Dow and S&P 500 ended slightly lower on Tuesday as lower oil prices took a toll on energy shares, offsetting a small gain in technology stocks and renewed hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade talks. The Nasdaq managed to end essentially flat on Tuesday as a rebound in technology stocks kept the index out of negative territory. Riskier assets have been under intense selling pressure over the past two months as worries about a peak in earnings growth added to international trade tensions and signs of slowing in global investment and growth. “The markets would have reacted more positively to U.S.-China trade and Brexit-related headlines a few months ago,” said Makoto Noji, chief currency and foreign bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “But currently there is more focus on the possibility of both the U.S. and Chinese leaders maintaining their tough stance, with a compromise eluding them, and Brexit bogging down. Market sentiment is clearly cooling down.” The United Kingdom and European Union agreed on the text for a Brexit divorce deal on Tuesday. Prime Minister Theresa May will present the draft withdrawal agreement to her senior ministers on Wednesday for discussion and then decide on the next steps.

2018-11-14,"* Oil prices fell by 7 percent the previous day * Crude has lost a quarter of its value since early October * Jump in supply comes as demand outlook weakens * Top-3 oil producers see output surge: tmsnrt.rs/2Rua0R8 By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Oil markets remained on a weak footing on Wednesday after a 7 percent slump the previous session, with surging supply and expectations of faltering demand pressuring crude prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $55.66 per barrel at 0043 GMT, down 3 cents from their last settlement. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Markets fell by more than 7 percent the previous day. They have lost over a quarter of their value since early October in what has become one of the biggest declines since prices collapsed in 2014. Oil markets are being pressured from two sides: a surge in supply and increasing concerns about an economic slowdown. The wave of supply is mostly fuelled by soaring production in the United States. U.S. crude oil output from its seven major shale basins is expected to hit a record of 7.94 million barrels per day (bpd) in December, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday. That surge in onshore output has helped overall U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA hit a record 11.6 million bpd, making the United States the world’s biggest oil producer ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. Most analysts expect U.S. output to climb above 12 million bpd within the first half of 2019. “This will, in our view, cap any upside above $85 per barrel (for oil prices),” said Jon Andersson, head of commodities at Vontobel Asset Management. The surge in U.S. production is contributing to rising stockpiles. U.S. crude stocks rose by 7.8 million barrels in the week ending Nov. 2 to 432 million, as refineries cut output, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. The producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), whose member states rely on high oil prices to finance government budgets, has been watching the jump in supply and price slump with concern. Led by top exporter Saudi Arabia, OPEC has been making increasingly frequent public statements that it would start withholding crude in 2019 to tighten supply and prop up prices. “OPEC and Russia are under pressure to reduce current production levels, which is a decision that we expect to be taken at the next OPEC meeting on Dec. 6,” said Andersson. That puts OPEC and Saudi Arabia on a collision course with U.S. President Donald Trump, who publicly supports low oil prices and who has called on OPEC not to cut production.

2018-11-14,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union’s trade commissioner, Cecilia Malmstrom, said on Tuesday she assumes the United States will not slap auto tariffs on the EU while the two sides are negotiating on trade, even as the Trump administration considers options to shield the U.S. auto industry from imports. Malmstrom told an audience at the German Marshall Fund in Washington that any move by the United States to impose auto tariffs would not apply to the EU due to an agreement in July between President Donald Trump and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. “We assume that if that (U.S. auto tariffs) were to happen, that would not be for the European Union,” she said. Senior Trump administration officials on Tuesday discussed the U.S. Commerce Department’s draft recommendations on its “Section 232” national security probe into the autos sector, which have been submitted to the White House and are being reviewed by various federal agencies.   Two administration officials said no decisions were made at the meeting on Tuesday and no announcement is planned. The contents of the recommendations have not been disclosed. The advancement of Commerce’s autos report, which Trump has said could lead to tariffs on imported cars and parts of up to 25 percent, was seen as a way to ramp up pressure for better trade terms with the EU and Japan, one administration official told Reuters on Monday. Malmstrom, who is meeting with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Wednesday to pursue more regulatory cooperation and discuss what future trade negotiations might cover, said she would be willing to include autos, but made clear that any U.S.-EU trade deal would be limited in scope, covering industrial goods.  “It would be limited, and let me state and be very clear, it will not include agriculture,” she said. Any deal on regulatory cooperation to facilitate more trade or on EU purchases of U.S. soybeans and liquefied natural gas would be done outside of the trade negotiations, as a voluntary arrangement, Malmstrom said. These areas were outlined during the Trump-Juncker meeting in July. Malmstrom said she would need a mandate from EU governments to launch formal negotiations with the United States, and many EU members, notably France, are opposed to including agriculture in the talks. Lighthizer is now consulting with Congress on EU negotiations, which cannot begin until a 90-day “fast track” notification period expires in January.
