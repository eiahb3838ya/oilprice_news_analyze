2018-04-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal court in New York on Monday blocked the Trump administration’s decision to delay a rule that would raise penalties for automakers who do not meet federal fuel efficiency requirements. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order vacating the July 2017 decision of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to suspend a 2016 Obama administration regulation.  The regulation, set to take effect in September, would more than double penalties. Automakers protested the hike, saying it could increase industry compliance costs by $1 billion annually. Congress ordered federal agencies in 2015 to adjust civil penalties to account for inflation. In response, NHTSA proposed raising fines for every gallon of fuel that new cars and trucks consume in excess of required standards under the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) program, but delayed the effective date to September 2018. NHTSA said in a statement on Monday it “is aware of the order issued today by the Second Circuit and will review the Court’s opinion once it is available.” Last month, NHTSA said it was proposing to cancel the planned Obama administration hike in penalties for automakers whose vehicles fail to meet minimum fuel-economy standards - a move that could eventually make Monday’s court ruling moot. Vera Pardee, senior counsel at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the groups that sued, said the decision means “NHTSA must justify decreasing it – despite the Inflation Adjustment Act’s clear command to prevent inflation-caused erosion of enforcement.” New York, California and three other U.S. states in September had sued the federal government in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for delaying the rollout of the higher penalties, as did several environmental groups. NHTSA said previously the increases would potentially result in an additional $30 million in annual civil penalties. Automakers say the increases would dramatically raise costs since they would also boost the value of fuel economy credits used to meet requirements. Some automakers historically have opted to pay fines instead of meeting fuel efficiency requirements. Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, and Daimler AG, which makes Mercedes-Benz vehicles, paid the most in fines in recent years. NHTSA said last July that many automakers were falling behind current fuel standards and face “the possibility of paying larger CAFE penalties over the next several years.” Reporting by David Shepardson; editing by Jonathan Oatis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions/court-blocks-trump-administration-order-delaying-boost-in-fuel-penalties-idUKL1N1S01RF,23 Apr 2018,"A federal court in New York

2018-04-23,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp hopes to launch a new “flow” battery made of inexpensive, nontoxic materials that can help utilities save money and use more renewable energy, company officials said on Monday. “You open up a chance not only to make renewables more marketable and more useful, you might even change the structure of at least a portion of the utility market,” Leo Mackay, a senior vice president for sustainability and ethics at Lockheed, told reporters at the company’s Global Vision Center in Virginia.  Lockheed did not have an exact date for introduction of the battery or a cost, but Frank Armijo, vice president for energy initiatives, said the company hopes to introduce it in a “little more than a year.” Flow batteries, which use chemicals dissolved in water, last longer than lithium ion batteries, which are usually solid. That means they can help utilities meet consumer needs for longer periods during so-called peak demand times such as evenings, when residents use lights, televisions and kitchen appliances. A report in the utility industry press early this year said Lockheed hoped to introduce a flow battery by the end of 2018, but there were no details on what kind of materials it would be made of.   Unlike natural gas or coal, which can be burned anytime to generate power, wind and solar power are sometimes most active when consumer demand is down. Affordable storage of power from renewables could help the industry grow faster, but has long been elusive.  Armijo said the company is developing a so-called flow battery using proprietary electrolyte chemistry that combines low cost earth metals with chemicals that are also inexpensive. “The challenge with existing flow batteries is that they lean heavily on materials like vanadium and zinc bromide which are extremely expensive and toxic,” Armijo said. “Ours is neither of that.” Armijo said flow batteries can last six to 10 hours compared to about two to four hours for lithium ion batteries. In addition, flow batteries do not have rapid degradation issues that lithium ion has.  Lockheed, which has been developing advanced battery technologies for its space program for decades, is competing with other companies in the race to develop batteries for grid storage including Tesla Inc and LG Chem Ltd. Utilities have always had to rely on large power plants for generating electricity during peak hours. Mackay said flow batteries could eventually help utilities become less centralized and more site specific.

2018-04-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global equity markets declined on Monday as U.S. bond yields moved closer to the 3 percent level that has unsettled investors in recent months, while a fall in commodity prices pressured materials stocks. U.S. bond prices fell, with the 10-year yield hitting its highest in over four years at 2.998 percent. Investors are worrying about the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as oil and commodity prices have been rising in recent weeks. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.9752 percent, from 2.951 percent late on Friday. “That three percent on the ten-year is hugely important and many very bright people have thought of three percent as the tipping point, so to speak, in terms of providing an alternative to equities and also providing a shift in the narrative,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York.  Commodities sold off after the United States hinted it might relieve sanctions on Russia’s biggest aluminium producer United Company Rusal Plc (OKSAI.MM). Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange CMAL3, which hit a seven-year high on Thursday, was last down 8.7 percent at $2,254.50 a tonne. Shares of aluminium company Alcoa (AA.N) tumbled 13.51 percent. Spot gold XAU= dropped 0.8 percent to $1,324.66 an ounce. In equity markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 rose 0.35 percent. MSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.29 percent. The climb in debt yields helped push the U.S. dollar to a seven-week high, putting additional pressure on commodities and sending the euro and yen lower.  The dollar index .DXY rose 0.67 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.65 percent to $1.2206. The Japanese yen weakened 0.97 percent versus the greenback at 108.70 per dollar.  Oil prices were volatile, with crude recovering from earlier losses. Investors juggled downward pressure after Iran squashed hopes that OPEC would extend its production cap pact with support on fears U.S. sanctions could dampen Iran’s output. U.S. crude CLcv1 settled up 0.35 percent at $68.64 per barrel and Brent LCOcv1 was last at $74.71, up 0.88 percent.  U.S. stocks were little changed ahead of earnings from some big names in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors this week, with Amazon.com (AMZN.O) -0.6 percent and Microsoft (MSFT.O) flat.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 14.05 points, or 0.06 percent, to 24,448.89, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.14 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,670.28 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 17.53 points, or 0.25 percent, to 7,128.60. All eyes are on U.S. earnings, with more than 180 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results this week. They include Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Facebook (FB.O), Boeing (BA.N) and Chevron (CVX.N). They are expected to report their strongest first-quarter profit gains in seven years, at around 20 percent. Of the 92 companies that have reported through Monday morning, 77 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2018-04-23,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s President Nicolas Maduro kicked off his presidential campaign giving away trash trucks and tractors while challenger Henri Falcon laid out plans to de-politicize state oil company PDVSA and dollarise an ailing economy. Turnout at the May 20 election is expected to be low given Venezuelans’ depression over an unprecedented economic meltdown and a boycott by the mainstream opposition which views the poll as a farce intended to legitimize autocracy. Though some polls have put him level or even ahead of Maduro, abstention would hit the 56-year-old former soldier and governor Falcon harder than the socialist incumbent. More than 80 executives at PDVSA, or Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., and its suppliers have been jailed in recent months for alleged corruption. Tensions between PDVSA, which provides Venezuela with some 95 percent of export revenue, and foreign oil companies has risen as military officers who have little or no oil industry experience are given senior roles. Falcon and Wall Street heavyweight Francisco Rodriguez, his chief economic adviser, laid out plans to reform PDVSA, separating it from the oil ministry, asking the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to raise quotas and strengthening the role of foreign partners. Underlining the difficulty of Falcon’s task, other opposition activists were organising rallies this week to promote abstention at next month’s vote. Unlike past campaigns, rallies on both sides have so far been poorly attended. “There are many difficulties, yes, but who is going to overcome them? The oligarchy, Donald Trump, or us?” said Maduro, 55, speaking in the city of San Felix, in the southern state of Bolivar, where he gave vehicles to local authorities. Maduro, the successor to Hugo Chavez, has roughly 20 percent core support and is expected to win given the state’s formidable election apparatus, a political ban on the opposition’s two top leaders, a compliant election board, and the poor’s dependence on welfare policies including food handouts. Millions earn the equivalent of barely $2 a month, suffer shortages of basic food and medicine, and face annual inflation in the thousands of percent. Falcon described the crisis as the worst in Latin American history, as he was flanked by Rodriguez. The pair plan to dollarise Venezuela’s economy, replacing the bolivar, which has weakened over 99 percent against the dollar since Maduro came to power. Some independent economists, however, see that as unfeasible. “Hunger is Venezuelans’ biggest day-to-day problem,” Falcon said, lambasting Maduro for incompetence. Various foreign government have threatened to not recognise May’s election given democratic shortcomings, and the United States is considering oil sanctions against Venezuela afterwards. “Venezuela doesn’t work and that’s what we want to change,” said Rodriguez.

2018-04-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded from an early slide to finish higher and strengthen further in post-settlement trade, as investors feared U.S. sanctions could dampen Iran’s output. “It’s tweet by tweet,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group, saying the market is swinging in response to posturing from the United States and OPEC members.  Oil prices tumbled early on fears that oversupply could return. Iran’s oil minister Bijan Zanganeh said there would be no need to extend a pact between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC producers if oil prices strengthened, the ministry’s official website SHANA reported.  Flynn said the market recovered on conviction U.S. sanctions could dampen Iran’s output, even if the nation produces above its OPEC quota.  Also supporting prices, energy information provider Genscape showed a decline in inventories at the Cushing, Oklahoma storage hub for U.S. crude.  Brent crude futures settled up 65 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $74.71 a barrel, after falling as low as $73.13. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 24 cents to $68.64 a barrel, rebounding from a session low of $67.14. The difference between the two benchmarks was at its widest since Jan. 8.. In post-settlement trading, Brent kept edging higher to $75.08 a barrel.  Since early 2017, OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC crude producers have curbed output to reduce a global oil glut. The pact runs until the end of 2018. “We continue to watch whether the fundamental picture continues to tighten,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy.  In early trade, oil fell along with other raw materials after the United States gave American customers of Russia’s biggest aluminum producer Rusal  more time to comply with sanctions. This month, oil has risen to its highest since late 2014. Prices have been supported by U.S. sanctions on Russian companies and individuals and by fears Washington may take new measures against struggling Venezuela and especially OPEC member Iran.  “Added price pressure comes from U.S. sanctions against the key oil exporting nations of Venezuela, Russia and Iran,” said Kerry Craig, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management. “Stay long oil,” JPMorgan said in a separate note.  The United States has until May 12 to decide whether it will leave a nuclear deal with Iran and impose new sanctions against Tehran. “The uncertainty of the administration makes things very difficult,” McGillian said, cautioning that sanctions against Iran or Venezuela could also cause market swings.

2018-04-23,"(Clarifies role of U.N. food agency FAO) By Ulf Laessing TRIPOLI, April 23 (Reuters) - Libya will have to cover its 2018 grain consumption needs of around 1.2 million tonnes almost entirely by imports but hopes to boost production from the next harvest, a senior official said. Abdelmoneim Mohamed Shihab ad-Din, the top official in the agricultural ministry in a U.N.-backed government in Tripoli, said the oil producing nation could meet at least half of its cereal needs in future, if security and power supply improved. To ramp up output, Libya will invest $120 million into its farming sector, of which more than $10 million will go on seeds, he said. The funds come after an emergency project with the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) which raised the awareness of the government to the importance of food security, FAO officials said. “This year it will be the same (with imports meeting consumption) but if the security improves a bit then output will improve the next (2018) season,” ad-Din said in an interview. “Electricity supply has improved. We can reach 50 percent (of 1.2 million tonnes of grain consumption),” he said, when asked where output could be in the next two years. According to the ministry, 1,200 farmers will be supplied with the seeds. He said last year’s crop output was around 100,000 tonnes, though no exact figures exist due to the dysfunctional Libyan state, in turmoil since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Farmers have been struggling to get seeds as a fall in oil revenues since 2011 has hit the supply of foreign exchange needed to fund imports. Improving output would not just lower the import bill of a country suffering from economic meltdown but also provide an income in poor rural areas, often cut off from state support due to poor security, and African migrants working as farmhands. But much will depend on whether security improves. The focus of the plan is on the main farming regions deep in the south in Ubari and Sebha, which were hit by tribal fighting and lack of power supply, as well as Benghazi in the east. Libya, a country of six million, was once home to large-scale farming schemes built by Italian colonial rulers, but has neglected the sector since oil exports started in the 1960s. Still, the country produced up to 450,000 tonnes of cereal until 2011, officials said. Since then, crop output has been hovering around 100,000 tonnes. An FAO study showed seeds and modern equipment had become unavailable in many parts of Libya. Development has also been hampered by a split between two governments - the Tripoli one and an eastern rival, though ad-Din said his ministry was cooperating on a technical level with the east, allowing it to ship seeds to Benghazi. Libya also produces some 120,000 tonnes of dates, some of which still get exported despite the chaos, alongside cooking oil and strawberries grown in the more stable north of the country, officials said. “It’s a difficult situation but we are more optimistic now,” ad-Din said. “But we need more foreign assistance.” (Editing by Mark Potter)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/libya-wheat/update-1-libya-to-cover-2018-grain-needs-with-imports-eyes-higher-harvest-idUKL8N1S069L,23 Apr 2018,"Libya will have to cover its

2018-04-23,"HOUSTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - Two Chevron Corp. employees detained in Venezuela last week could be charged with treason for refusing to sign a parts contract for a joint venture with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to two sources familiar with draft charges against the U.S. firm’s executives. The arrests, by national intelligence agents, marked the first at a Western oil firm in Venezuela and represent a dramatic escalation of growing tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts, the sources told Reuters. The widening dispute could worsen operational chaos that has caused the OPEC nation’s oil output to plunge by 23 percent, or 450,000 barrels per day, since October. “These detentions are going to accelerate the operational crisis,” another source with knowledge of Chevron’s operations told Reuters. “Procurement could end up in paralysis if nobody wants to take the risk of signing or authorizing anything.” The draft treason charges - seen by Chevron lawyers last week, the two sources said - raised concern that the oil major could get caught in the crossfire between Washington and Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who accuses the U.S. government of sabotaging the economy to topple his administration. The United States has imposed sanctions on senior members of Maduro’s government and PDVSA. The two Chevron employees were jailed when they refused to sign a supply contract written by PDVSA executives under an emergency decree - which skips the competitive bidding process, according to a half dozen sources close to the case. Such decrees have been cited by Venezuela prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent PDVSA corruption cases. The Chevron employees balked when the parts were listed at more than double their market price in a contract worth several million dollars, one of the sources told Reuters. The workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil upgrading project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron to transform Orinoco Belt’s extra heavy crude into an exportable product. Venezuela’s national intelligence service, Sebin, arrested the Chevron workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, in front of stunned co-workers in a raid of Chevron’s office in Puerto La Cruz and the upgrader on April 16.  Venezuelan authorities have yet to comment on the arrest of the men, both Venezuelans, and no charges against them have been made public. The Venezuela public prosecutor’s office declined to comment, and PDVSA did not respond to several requests for comment. The arrests follow a purge that has seen more than 80 executives at PDVSA and its suppliers jailed for alleged corruption as the state firm’s new chief, Major General Manuel Quevedo, has sought to stamp his authority on the sector - the financial lifeblood of Venezuela’s unravelling socialist government. Tensions between PDVSA and foreign oil companies have steadily risen since Quevedo took charge in November and appointed military officers who had little or no oil industry experience to senior jobs. Foreign firms have pushed for a greater say in procurement to combat inefficiencies and graft, oil industry sources said, but disputes over governance standards have caused operational delays, raising tensions over Venezuela’s falling oil output. In February, the Petropiar upgrader had been temporarily halted because of problems scheduling its exports, and PDVSA executives were concerned it could be forced to stop again due to lack of spare parts, one of the sources said. When the imported furnace parts did not arrive on time, PDVSA executives blamed the Chevron employees for the delays, according to the two sources familiar with the draft charges. The men are being represented by Chevron lawyers. The charges against them have not been formalised and could change, the two sources said. A spokesman for Chevron declined to comment. Venezuela defines treason as conspiring with foreign enemies against the state and proscribes punishment of up to 30 years in prison. Defendants are not entitled to due process protections afforded to those accused of other crimes, according to the statute. As of Sunday, the two men were being held in the offices of the intelligence services in the coastal city of Barcelona, according to the two sources with knowledge of the draft charges. The detentions highlight the growing difficulties for foreign oil firms amid a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela, allegations of rampant corruption, a power struggle within PDVSA and an increasingly authoritarian government. Reuters reported earlier this month that Maduro had granted extra powers to Quevedo to “create, annul or modify” deals involving state energy company PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Foreign oil firms, at a meeting in Caracas this month to discuss how to tackle production problems at joint ventures, expressed their concerns over procurement and governance to Quevedo, according to documents seen by Reuters. PDVSA has a minimum 60 percent stake in joint ventures and has been slow to share operational control, despite large-scale staff resignations in recent months.  About 25,000 PDVSA workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018, out of a workforce last officially reported at 146,000, Reuters reported last week. The resignations - including high-level professionals that are now almost impossible to replace - have only accelerated since Quevedo arrived, two dozen industry sources told Reuters. Oil majors such as Chevron and Eni SpA, Total SA and Repsol SA still operate in Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves. Although no foreign workers have been detained in the purge of the sector until last week, some companies have previously withdrawn expatriate workers over security concerns. Many foreign workers’ families are reluctant to stay in Venezuela for long periods, one executive from a company operating in the Orinoco Belt told Reuters. “We no longer have any guarantee that expatriates will not be sent to jail,” the executive said.

Such decrees have been cited by Venezuela prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent PDVSA corruption cases. The Chevron employees balked when the parts were listed at more than double their market price in a contract worth several million dollars, one of the sources told Reuters. The workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil upgrading project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron to transform Orinoco Belt’s extra heavy crude into an exportable product. Venezuela’s national intelligence service, Sebin, arrested the Chevron workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, in front of stunned co-workers in a raid of Chevron’s office in Puerto La Cruz and the upgrader on April 16.  Venezuelan authorities have yet to comment on the arrest of the men, both Venezuelans, and no charges against them have been made public. The Venezuela public prosecutor’s office declined to comment, and PDVSA did not respond to several requests for comment. The arrests follow a purge that has seen more than 80 executives at PDVSA and its suppliers jailed for alleged corruption as the state firm’s new chief, Major General Manuel Quevedo, has sought to stamp his authority on the sector - the financial lifeblood of Venezuela’s unravelling socialist government. Tensions between PDVSA and foreign oil companies have steadily risen since Quevedo took charge in November and appointed military officers who had little or no oil industry experience to senior jobs. Foreign firms have pushed for a greater say in procurement to combat inefficiencies and graft, oil industry sources said, but disputes over governance standards have caused operational delays, raising tensions over Venezuela’s falling oil output. In February, the Petropiar upgrader had been temporarily halted because of problems scheduling its exports, and PDVSA executives were concerned it could be forced to stop again due to lack of spare parts, one of the sources said. When the imported furnace parts did not arrive on time, PDVSA executives blamed the Chevron employees for the delays, according to the two sources familiar with the draft charges. The men are being represented by Chevron lawyers. The charges against them have not been formalised and could change, the two sources said. A spokesman for Chevron declined to comment. Venezuela defines treason as conspiring with foreign enemies against the state and proscribes punishment of up to 30 years in prison. Defendants are not entitled to due process protections afforded to those accused of other crimes, according to the statute. As of Sunday, the two men were being held in the offices of the intelligence services in the coastal city of Barcelona, according to the two sources with knowledge of the draft charges. The detentions highlight the growing difficulties for foreign oil firms amid a deepening economic crisis in Venezuela, allegations of rampant corruption, a power struggle within PDVSA and an increasingly authoritarian government. Reuters reported earlier this month that Maduro had granted extra powers to Quevedo to “create, annul or modify” deals involving state energy company PDVSA and its subsidiaries. Foreign oil firms, at a meeting in Caracas this month to discuss how to tackle production problems at joint ventures, expressed their concerns over procurement and governance to Quevedo, according to documents seen by Reuters. PDVSA has a minimum 60 percent stake in joint ventures and has been slow to share operational control, despite large-scale staff resignations in recent months.  About 25,000 PDVSA workers resigned between the start of January 2017 and the end of January 2018, out of a workforce last officially reported at 146,000, Reuters reported last week. The resignations - including high-level professionals that are now almost impossible to replace - have only accelerated since Quevedo arrived, two dozen industry sources told Reuters. Oil majors such as Chevron and Eni SpA, Total SA and Repsol SA still operate in Venezuela, home to the world’s largest oil reserves. Although no foreign workers have been detained in the purge of the sector until last week, some companies have previously withdrawn expatriate workers over security concerns. Many foreign workers’ families are reluctant to stay in Venezuela for long periods, one executive from a company operating in the Orinoco Belt told Reuters. “We no longer have any guarantee that expatriates will not be sent to jail,” the executive said.

2018-04-23,"YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenian Prime Minister Serzh Sarksyan resigned on Monday after almost two weeks of mass street protests that have plunged the  ex-Soviet republic into political crisis.   Sarksyan, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had served as Armenia’s president for a decade until this month and had faced accusations of clinging to power when parliament elected him as prime minister last week. Under a revised constitution, the prime minister now holds most power in the southern Caucasus nation, while the presidency has become largely ceremonial. Pressure on the 63-year-old to quit had increased sharply on Monday when unarmed soldiers in the capital Yerevan joined the anti-government protests, which first erupted on April 13. Though peaceful, the tumult has threatened to destabilise Armenia, a Russian ally in a volatile region riven by its decades-long, low-level conflict with Azerbaijan. Moscow, which has two military bases in Armenia, was closely watching events. “I got it wrong,” Sarksyan said in a statement. “In the current situation there are several solutions, but I won’t choose any of them. It’s not my style. I am quitting the country’s leadership and the post of prime minister of Armenia.”  He said he was bowing to protesters’ demands and wanted his country to remain peaceful. Former Armenian prime minister Karen Karapetyan, an ally of Sarksyan from his ruling pro-Russian Republican Party, was named as acting prime minister, the government said in a statement. President Armen Sarkissian accepted the prime minister’s and the government’s resignation. Armenia’s political parties in parliament now have seven days to put forward the name of a new prime minister. Sarksyan’s allies remain in key positions in the government and it remains unclear whether his resignation will herald any real change.    Protesters loudly celebrated Sarksyan’s resignation. Some hugged policemen in the street amid cheers, others beeped car horns, and some danced and drank. “It’s the happiest day in my life,” said 20-year-old student Karine Stepanyan. “We showed to the entire world that our country’s destiny is in hands of Armenian people.” Tens of thousands filled the capital’s central Republic Square, waving national flags, blowing vuvuzelas and chanting:”Victory!” “The first stage of our revolution is over - prime minister has resigned,” Nikol Pashinyan, a lawmaker regarded as the main opposition leader, said to loud applause from the crowd. On Sunday police had detained him, two other opposition leaders and nearly 200 protesters, drawing a rebuke from the European Union. Police released Pashinyan and others on Monday.  Pashinyan said he would hold talks with Karapetyan to discuss what happens next. “We are ready to continue talks with acting prime minister Karen Karapetyan on Wednesday to ensure a transfer of power to the people,” Pashinyan told tens of thousands of supporters. “I hope that the high echelons of the (ruling) Republican Party will unequivocally recognise the popular velvet and non-violent revolution,” he said. Early parliamentary elections should be held, he said. The protests which toppled Sarksyan lasted for 11 days and saw tens of thousands of protesters march through Yerevan and other towns, blocking streets and staging sit-ins that disrupted daily life.     Asked about the crisis on Monday before Sarksyan’s resignation, the Kremlin called Armenia an “extraordinarily important country” for Russia, but dismissed the idea it might intervene, calling the crisis a domestic matter. Last week Putin rang Sarksyan to congratulate him on becoming premier. As president, Sarksyan took Armenia, a country of about three million people, into a Russia-backed economic bloc and bought weapons from Moscow. The protesters’ complaints were mainly domestic and focussed on pervasive corruption and poverty in a country that won independence from Moscow in 1991 but has been hampered by its conflict with Azerbaijan over the breakaway region of Nagorno-Karabakh and other issues.  But critics have also accused Sarkasyan of moving landlocked Armenia too close to Russia at the expense of better ties with the West and increased prosperity, and it was unclear whether his political demise could lead to a change in foreign policy. Armenia’s 2025 dollar-denominated bond fell 0.83 cents after  Sarksyan said he would resign, hitting a one-year low.

2018-04-23,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Jeffrey Gundlach on Monday said investors should consider betting against Facebook Inc because the prospect of regulation still hangs over the social media company’s stock. Speaking at the Sohn Investment Conference in New York, the closely-watched DoubleLine Capital LP chief executive officer recommended a pair trade of shorting, or betting against, Facebook while betting on gains in an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks oil-and-gas explorers and producers who could benefit from rising inflation. Facebook shares are down nearly 10 percent since the New York Times and London’s Observer newspaper reported in mid-March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked on U.S. President Donald Trump’s campaign, gained inappropriate access to data on tens of millions of the social media company’s users. Gundlach said the worst likely is not over for Facebook, saying it is not unprecedented for equity bubbles being ended by regulation. Facebook’s strengths are being redefined as weaknesses, he said.     “We hear the good things about Facebook, which is 2.2 billion users,” said Gundlach, known as Wall Street’s “Bond King.”   “I hear 2.2 billion compliance breaches.” Facebook shares were down 0.3 percent on Monday, giving up earlier gains. Meanwhile, inflation is perking up and will likely continue to rise even if the U.S. economy is headed for a pullback, Gundlach said. That can be a boon for companies like those held in SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production ETF, which Gundlach recommended buying in conjunction with the Facebook short. Short-sellers aim to profit by selling borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price and pocketing the difference. Gundlach’s presentation revealed an investor preparing for the later stages of an economic expansion that has featured both low inflation and skyrocketing stock prices. But rising interest rates and the unwinding of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet - what Gundlach characterizes as “Quantitative Tightening” - are changing the investment backdrop.   Last May, Gundlach, speaking at the same conference,  recommended a comparable late-cycle trade of buying emerging market stocks and shorting the technology-led U.S. S&P 500 benchmark. Emerging markets from China to Brazil are heavily, though not uniformly, influenced by commodity prices; as riskier assets, they tend to do better as economic growth cycles age. U.S. stocks and emerging markets both rose over the last year, but equities in developing markets led. In addition to flashes of inflation building in economic statistics, oil prices have been among the best-performing major assets in 2018, with the major crude-futures benchmarks up more than 11 percent. Trump on Friday accused the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries of “artificially” boosting oil prices, drawing rebukes from some of the world’s top energy exporters.

U.S. bond prices fell, with the 10-year yield hitting its highest in over four years amid worries about the growing supply of government debt and accelerating inflation as oil and commodity prices have been rising in recent weeks. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.977 percent, from 2.951 percent late on Friday. “There are supply concerns. The auction sizes are getting bigger,” said Larry Milstein, head of agency and government trading at R.W. Pressprich & Co. in New York. Commodities came under pressure after the U.S. mulled sanctions relief for United Company Rusal Plc as it weighed the potential impact of such measures on American allies and partners. Three-month aluminium on the London Metal Exchange, which hit a seven-year high on Thursday, were last down 8.7 percent at $2,254.50 a tonne. Shares of aluminum company Alcoa tumbled 14.01 percent. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,323.79 an ounce. In equity markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.35 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.35 percent. The climb in debt yields helped push the U.S. dollar to a seven-week high to put additional pressure on commodities and sent the euro and yen lower. The dollar index rose 0.68 percent, with the euro down 0.66 percent to $1.2205. The Japanese yen weakened 0.89 percent versus the greenback at 108.64 per dollar. Oil prices were volatile, as crude recovered from earlier losses as investors juggled downward pressure after Iran squashed hopes that OPEC would extend its production cap pact and support on fears U.S. sanctions could dampen Iran’s output. U.S. crude rose 0.09 percent to $68.46 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.52, up 0.62 percent on the day. U.S. stocks were flat ahead of earnings from some big names in the technology sector this week, with Amazon.com down 0.3 percent and Microsoft flat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 54.63 points, or 0.22 percent, to 24,408.31, the S&P 500 lost 3.14 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,667 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 22.32 points, or 0.31 percent, to 7,123.80. All eyes are on U.S. earnings, with more than 180 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results this week. Other names expected to report include Alphabet and Facebook as well as Boeing and Chevron. S&P 500 companies are expected to report their strongest first-quarter profit gains in seven years.

2018-04-23,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will compensate some Caribbean immigrants who have lived legally in Britain for decades and have wrongly been labelled illegal immigrants because of trouble documenting their status, interior minister Amber Rudd said on Monday. The government will also waive fees associated with becoming a citizen and ensure these long-term British residents do not have to pass Britain’s citizenship test, Rudd told parliament. Instead, she said individuals would be assigned a case worker who would decide on nationality, and the burden of proof has been shifted so the government would take a more lenient approach. “The state has let these people down,” Rudd said. “None of this can undo the pain already endured, but I hope it demonstrates the government’s commitment to put these wrongs right going forward.” Thousands of people from the “Windrush generation” were invited to Britain to plug labour shortfalls between 1948 and 1971, but some of them and their descendants have been caught out by tighter immigration rules. Some of these migrants have been asked to provide documentary evidence of their life in Britain they had never previously been required to keep, and in some cases denied rights, detained and threatened with deportation. The crisis has cast Britain in an unsympathetic light and raised awkward questions about how the aggressive pursuit of lower immigration sits alongside the desire to be an outward-looking global economy. Windrush-era migrants who have already returned to their country of origin, but want to come back as British citizens will be helped to do so, Rudd said. Rudd emphasised her commitment to tackling illegal immigration but conceded that successive governments bore responsibility for the policies that had an ‘unintended and sometimes devastating’ impact on people. “These people worked here for decades, in many cases they helped establish the National Health Services, they paid their taxes... they are British in all but legal status, and this should never have been allowed to happen, Rudd said. Rudd said all interior ministry records dating back to 2002 would be checked to see if anyone had been wrongly deported, but no cases had been identified so far with about half of the documents verified. The shadow interior minister Diane Abbott welcomed the measures and said the compensation should be more than more than just a “token” amount. “The home secretary has to understand that ultimately the buck stops with her,” Abbott said. “The home secretary said the situation should never have been allowed to happen. She was the home secretary. She should never have allowed them to happen.” Reporting By Andrew MacAskill, editing by David Milliken, William Maclean",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-windrush/update-1-britain-to-set-up-compensation-scheme-for-windrush-migrants-idUKL8N1S05PF,23 Apr 2018,"Britain will compensate some

2018-04-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - Offshore oil services firm Subsea 7 (SUBC.OL) has made an unsolicited offer worth about $2 billion for U.S. rival McDermott (MDR.N), potentially breaking up the U.S. company’s agreed deal with onshore engineering firm Chicago Bridge & Iron (CB&I) CBI.N. The deal could make Oslo-listed Subsea 7 the market leader in supplying and installing subsea equipment for oil and gas firms with a combined market share of 24 percent, followed by TechnipFMC with 20 percent and Saipem with 15 percent, an Oslo-based consultancy, Rystad Energy, said. The flurry of M&A activity comes as oil prices have risen to more than $70 a barrel, lifting the need for offshore services and the appetite for offshore investments. It follows a tough period when the oil services industry was hit by a fall in oil prices and spending cuts by major oil companies. Subsea 7 said combining the two companies would make them better equipped to handle large offshore engineering contracts for the oil industry. Jean Cahuzac, chief executive of Subsea 7, said the potential deal could provide growth opportunities in the Middle East where McDermott has a strong position. Subsea 7 has offered McDermott $7 per share, either in cash or up to 50 percent in stock, representing a premium of 16 percent over McDermott’s closing share price on Friday of $6.05. Subsea said McDermott’s board had rejected its proposal on April 20 but also said it could raise its offer if the U.S. company agreed to talks. McDermott said in a separate statement its board had concluded that Subsea 7’s proposal “significantly undervalued” the company and was not an attractive alternative to the proposed combination with CB&I.  McDermott’s shares were up by around 13.2 percent, while CB&I shares were down around 12 percent by 1555 GMT. Subsea 7 shares closed up 0.8 percent. Offshore-focused McDermott announced last December it would buy onshore-based CB&I in an all-stock deal worth $1.86 billion to create an integrated construction and engineering services provider. Shareholders of McDermott and CB&I are set to vote on May 2 on whether to approve McDermott’s offer for CB&I. Subsea 7 said its bid proposal was subject to the termination of McDermott’s deal with CB&I. If that deal falls through, McDermott might have to pay a $60 million termination fee, the company has said.  Two proxy advisory firms, Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co., LLC have recommended that CB&I shareholders vote for the McDermott offer.  Some of McDermott’s shareholders, however, have opposed the deal, citing CB&I’s latest performance. BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, is the top shareholder in McDermott with a 12 percent stake.  “It’s a very well played offer from Subsea 7. Timing wise, it gives enough time for McDermott management to consider alternatives before the May 2 vote,” Carnegie analyst Frederik Lunde said. Subsea 7’s biggest shareholder and chairman, Norwegian billionaire Kristian Siem, has long called for the industry to consolidate as a means to cope with cost-cutting by oil companies. Siem said on Monday the company had decided to make the offer for McDermott after some of the U.S. company’s shareholders and one board member voiced opposition to the proposal to buy CB&I. Cahuzac said on Monday the company could revise its offer if McDermott’s board decides to start talks and provides more information about its business. Subsea 7 said combining the two companies would help them to handle large offshore engineering contracts for the oil industry, known as EPCI projects, with Subsea 7’s strengths in Brazil, the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea complementing McDermott’s strengths in the Middle East, India and Australia. “Geographically speaking, Subsea 7 and McDermott are a perfect match,” Rystad Energy’s Audun Martinsen said. The Middle East and Asia regions represents more than 90 percent of McDermott’s upstream revenues, Rystad Energy said.  “The train is about to leave the station. McDermott is the only acquisition target that could make Subsea 7 the market leader in the SURF (subsea umbilicals, risers and flowlines) sector,” Martinsen said.

2018-04-23,"ZAGREB, April 23 (Reuters) - Croatia has moved to late June the second round of bidding to use capacity in a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the northern Adriatic, the company that manages the project said on Monday. Previously, the process for submitting binding bids was planned to start in May. “Taking into account that in the first round we received requests to extend the period for preparing bids and that potential users of the terminal are still studying the local gas market regulations, we decided to move the opening of the second round to June 22,” LNG Hrvatska said. Local media reported this month that few bids were submitted in the first round of bidding, although LNG Hrvatska has not given any official figures. In the meantime, Barbara Doric, who previously ran the state agency for gas and oil exploration, has replaced Goran Francic as head of LNG Hrvatska. The level of demand is likely to determine whether the project for the terminal on the island of Krk will go ahead. LNG Hrvatska is preparing to build the floating terminal, which Croatia hopes will start operations in 2020. With a projected capacity of 2.6 billion cubic metres of gas a year, the terminal is part of European Union efforts to diversify away from Russian energy imports, most notably for countries in central Europe. The EU has said it would finance 28 percent of the terminal’s value, or 101.4 million euros ($123.8 million). $1 = 0.8189 euros

Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent to $1,323.08 an ounce. In equity markets, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.32 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.03 percent. The climb in debt yields helped push the U.S. dollar to a seven-week high to put additional pressure on commodities and sent the euro and yen lower. The dollar index rose 0.62 percent, with the euro down 0.6 percent to $1.2212. The Japanese yen weakened 0.85 percent versus the greenback at 108.59 per dollar. Oil prices were also hampered by comments from Iran’s oil minister, who said there would be no need to extend a deal on supply restraint if crude prices rose further. U.S. crude fell 0.72 percent to $67.91 per barrel and Brent was last at $73.97, down 0.12 percent on the day. U.S. stocks were higher, however, boosted by gains in the technology and consumer discretionary sectors ahead of earnings from some big names in the sectors this week, including Amazon.com, up 0.7 percent and Microsoft, up 1.0 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.32 points, or 0.15 percent, to 24,500.26, the S&P 500 gained 9.94 points, or 0.37 percent, to 2,680.08 and the Nasdaq Composite added 39.28 points, or 0.55 percent, to 7,185.40. All eyes are on U.S. earnings, with more than 180 companies in the S&P 500 reporting results this week. Names expected to report include Alphabet and Facebook as well as Boeing and Chevron. S&P 500 companies are expected to report their strongest first-quarter profit gains in seven years. Of the 87 companies that have reported so far, 79.3 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2018-04-23,"(adds details, background) RIYADH, April 23 (Reuters) - Yemen’s armed Houthi movement fired two ballistic missiles at a Saudi Aramco facility in the southern city of Jizan on Monday, but Saudi state media said both projectiles were destroyed. The Houthis’ al-Masirah TV said they had targeted a port belonging to the Saudi state oil giant. The Saudi state news agency quoted the spokesman for the Saudi-led coalition that intervened against the Houthis in Yemen’s war in 2015 as saying the two missiles were intercepted over Jizan and their debris fell on residential neighbourhoods. “There were no casualties or damages recorded as of the time of (our) statement,” Colonel Turki al-Maliki said. Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company is building a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Jizan, part of a new economic city on the Red Sea, and it is expected to become fully operational in 2019. The Houthis say their missile attacks on the kingdom are in retaliation for air raids on Yemen by the Western-backed coalition. Saudi Arabia and an alliance of Muslim states intervened in Yemen’s civil war to try and push back the Houthis after they drove the internationally-recognised government into exile in Riyadh. Air strikes by the coalition killed at least 20 people attending a wedding in a village in northwestern Yemen late on Sunday, residents and medical sources said. The coalition has carried out thousands of air strikes in Yemen that have hit schools, markets and hospitals, killing hundreds of people - though it says it does not target civilians. The United Nations says 10,000 people have died in the three-year-old war, and three out of four Yemenis — 22 million civilians — need relief aid. The coalition says the Houthis are armed and supported by Saudi arch-adversary Iran - charges the group and Tehran deny. Reporting by Marwa Rashad and Sarah Dadouch; Editing by

2018-04-23,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co (HAL.N) reported a 34 percent jump in first-quarter revenue on Monday as North American companies boosted oil and gas production amid rising oil prices.  The jump in revenue came despite a $312 million writedown on Halliburton’s remaining assets in Venezuela, and a hit to earnings related to the impact of cold weather earlier in the quarter. Halliburton expects normalized margins of around 20 percent in North America by the end of this year, supported by ongoing tightness in the hydraulic fracturing market, Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on Monday.   “We believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied and will remain tight,” Miller said, pointing to high fracking equipment utilization rates and service intensity that is degrading existing equipment. Some 3.3 million of additional hydraulic horsepower is expected to be added to the U.S. pressure pumping fleet this year, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. The additions have stoked concerns among investors that companies could overbuild equipment.  Halliburton’s revenue from North America jumped nearly 58 percent to $3.52 billion in the three months ended March 31, while revenue from international operations rose 9 percent.   Total revenue jumped to $5.74 billion from $4.28 billion. Its shares were trading at roughly $51.13 on Monday morning, off about 1.6 percent as part of a broader decline in energy stocks. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading around $67.40, down about 1.45 percent.  Adjusting for items, Halliburton posted a profit of 41 cents per share in the latest reported quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton in February warned it expected a 10 cents per share hit to first-quarter earnings due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking. Net income attributable to Halliburton shareholders was $46 million, or 5 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. The company posted a loss of $32 million, or 4 cents per share to shareholders, in the same quarter a year earlier.     The company said it continues to see tightness in the U.S. labor market, and in supply chain segments such as rail and trucking. Higher prices will be needed to absorb the impacts of wage inflation, Miller said during the company’s earnings call on Monday.  Halliburton on Monday also said it would remain in Venezuela, which has been plagued with political and economic turmoil, but carefully manage its exposure in the OPEC-member country.

2018-04-23,"OSLO (Reuters) - California will suffer more volatile weather this century with a “whiplash” from drought to rain and mounting risks a repeat of the devastating “Great Flood” of 1862, scientists said on Monday. Climate change, driven by man-made greenhouse gas emissions, would drive more extreme shifts between hot and dry summers and wet winters in the most populous U.S. state, they wrote in the journal Nature Climate Change. Global warming is making California and other regions with similar Mediterranean-style climates, from southern Europe to parts of Australia, drier and warmer in summer, said lead author Daniel Swain of the University of California, Los Angeles. In California in winter “an opposing trend toward a strong Pacific jet stream is projected to locally enhance precipitation during the core months of the ‘rainy season’,” he told Reuters. “Natural precipitation variability in this region is already large, and projected future whiplash increases would amplify existing swings between dry and wet years,” the authors wrote. They projected “a 25 percent to 100 percent increase in extreme dry-to-wet precipitation events” this century. California had its worst drought in recorded history from 2010–2016, followed by severe rains and flooding that culminated with evacuation orders for almost 200,000 residents as a precaution near the Oroville Dam last year. The study said that major urban centers, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, were “more likely than not” to suffer a freak series of storms by 2060 similar to ones in 1861-62 that led to the “Great Flood”.  The storms swamped the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys, flooding an area 300 miles (500 km) long and 20 miles wide. Storms washed away bridges, inundated mines and wrecked farms. A repeat “would probably lead to considerable loss of life and economic damages approaching a trillion dollars”, the study said.  As part of planning, Swain said the state should expand use of floodplains that can be deliberately flooded to soak up rains, such as the Yolo Bypass which protects the city of Sacramento. The study assumes, however, that global greenhouse gas emissions will keep rising, at odds with the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement under which almost 200 nations agreed to cut emissions to net zero between 2050 and 2100. “Such a future can be partially, but not completely, avoided” if the world takes tougher action, Swain said. He noted that existing government pledges to limit warming fall well short of the Paris goals. U.S. President Donald Trump, who doubts mainstream findings that greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause of warming, plans to quit the deal, saying he wants to promote the U.S. fossil fuel industry.

2018-04-23,"TASHKENT, April 23 (Reuters) - Uzbekistan plans to join an $8 billion project to build a natural gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to India, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said on Monday, although it was unclear whether Tashkent might eventually ship gas through it. Turkmenistan, which sits on the world’s fourth-biggest gas reserves and borders Afghanistan, started this year laying the Afghan section of the pipeline which will also cross Pakistan, seeing it as key to diversifying exports away from China. Uzbekistan also exports gas, mainly to China and Russia, although its export volumes are much lower than the Turkmen ones due to higher domestic consumption. “We have agreed that Uzbekistan will also take part in this project,” Mirziyoyev told reporters after meeting his Turkmen counterpart Kurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who visited Uzbekistan. He provided no details, but said Uzbek experts would travel to Turkmenistan to discuss Tashkent’s role in the pipeline. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, both ex-Soviet Central Asian republics, each produce more than 60 billion cubic metres of gas a year. China dominates Turkmen exports while Uzbek gas sales are split roughly equally between China and Russia.

2018-04-23,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian oil pipeline monopoly Transneft has rejected a proposal from its rival Summa Group to complete a deal to buy a Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port (NCSP) (NMTP.MM), a Transneft spokesman said on Monday. If the deal goes ahead it will allow Transneft to take control of Russia’s largest port operator. But Transneft said earlier this month it had suspended talks on the deal after the authorities arrested the co-owner of Summa, Ziyavudin Magomedov, on charges of embezzling more than $35 million.                                                                Magomedov denied the charges at a pre-trial hearing, where a judge ordered that he be held in custody until May 30. “We believe it is inappropriate to complete the deal taking into account the circumstances in which Summa has found itself,” Transneft spokesman, Igor Dyomin told Reuters.  Transneft’s move to acquire control in NCSP by purchasing a stake from Summa was initially approved by Russia’s anti-monopoly regulator. The potential value of the deal has not been disclosed. “Last week, a Summa representative has offered to complete the deal on NCSP,” Dyomin told Reuters. Dyomin also said that Summa had told Transneft that Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft (ROSN.MM) had expressed an interest in Summa’s NCSP stake.   Rosneft denied this on Monday. “We have not and are not going to hold talks with individuals who are under investigation,” Rosneft said in a statement. Summa declined to comment NCSP controls Russia’s Novorossiysk port on the Black Sea, and the port at Primorsk on the Baltic. Both are major terminals for exports of oil and oil products to world markets. Summa and Transneft jointly control Novoport Holding company, which owns 50.1 percent of NCSP. Transneft also has 10.5 percent in NCSP, while the Russian state property fund controls 20 percent. Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin.

2018-04-23,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister said there would be no need to extend a pact between OPEC and non-OPEC producers aimed at bolstering oil prices if the crude price continued to rise, the ministry’s official website SHANA reported on Monday.  “There will be no decision on this in OPEC’s next meeting ... if oil prices continue to increase, there will be no need to extend the deal,” Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by SHANA. Since early 2017, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other non-OPEC crude producers have curbed output with the aim of eliminating a global oil glut.  The pact runs until the end of 2018. Participants wlil discuss at an OPEC meeting in Vienna in June whether to extend the deal.  U.S. President Donald Trump accused OPEC on Friday of “artificially” boosting oil prices. “Looks like OPEC is at it again.

2018-04-23,"MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - As OPEC’s efforts to balance the oil market bear fruit, U.S. producers are reaping the benefits - and flooding Europe with a record amount of crude.  Russia paired with the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year in cutting oil output jointly by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), a deal they say has largely rebalanced the market and one that has helped elevate benchmark Brent prices LCOc1 close to four-year highs. Now, the relatively high prices brought about by that pact, coupled with surging U.S. output, are making it harder to sell Russian, Nigerian and other oil grades in Europe, traders said. “U.S. oil is on offer everywhere,” said a trader with a Mediterranean refiner, who regularly buys Russian and Caspian Sea crude and has recently started purchasing U.S. oil. “It puts local grades under a lot of pressure.” U.S. oil output is expected to hit 10.7 million bpd this year, rivaling that of top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia. In April, U.S. supplies to Europe are set to reach an all-time high of roughly 550,000 bpd (around 2.2 million tonnes), according to the Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows monitor.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supply to Europe - reut.rs/2F8xk0k)  In January-April, U.S. supplies jumped four-fold year-on-year to 6.8 million tonnes, or 68 large Aframax tankers, according to the same data. Trade sources said U.S. flows to Europe would keep rising, with U.S. barrels increasingly finding homes in foreign refineries, often at the expense of oil from OPEC or Russia.    In 2017, Europe took roughly 7 percent of U.S. crude exports, Reuters data showed, but the proportion has already risen to roughly 12 percent this year. Top destinations include Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, with traders pointing to large imports by BP, Exxon Mobil and Valero.  (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil and condensate supplies to Europe in 2017-2018 by destination - reut.rs/2F9lWRO)  Polish refiners PKN Orlen and Grupa Lotos and Norway’s Statoil are sampling U.S. grades, while other new buyers are likely, David Wech of Vienna-based JBC Energy consultancy said. “There are a number of customers who still may test U.S. crude oil,” Wech said.  The gains for U.S. suppliers could come as a welcome development for U.S. President Donald Trump, who accused OPEC on Friday of “artificially” boosting oil prices. “Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea. Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!” Trump wrote on Twitter. While the United States lifted its oil export ban in late 2015, the move took time to gain traction among Europe’s traditional refineries, which were slow to diversify away from crude from the North Sea, West Africa and the Caspian. “European refiners started experimenting with U.S. crude last year,” said Ehsan Ul-Haq, director of London-based consultancy Resource Economics. “Now, they know more than enough to process this crude.” U.S. oil gained in popularity, sources said, in part because of the wide gap between West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, and dated Brent, which is more expensive and sets the price for most of the world’s crude grades. This gap, known as the Brent/WTI spread, has averaged $4.46 per barrel this year, nearly twice as high as the year-earlier figure, Reuters data showed.  Wech of JBC Energy said the spread would likely persist in the near future. The most popular U.S. grades in Europe are WTI, Light Louisiana Sweet, Eagle Ford, Bakken and Mars.  Prices for alternative local grades have been slashed as a result. CPC Blend differentials recently hit a six-year low versus dated Brent at minus $2 a barrel. Russia’s Urals also came under pressure despite the end of seasonal refinery maintenance. BFO-CPC BFO-URL-E BFO-URL-NWE WTI was available at 80-90 cent premiums delivered to Italy’s Augusta, well below offers of Azeri BTC at a premium of $1.60 a barrel, according to trading sources.  U.S. oil is even edging out North Sea Forties, which is produced in the backyard of the continent’s refineries.  Cargoes of WTI were offered in Rotterdam at premiums of around 50-60 cents a barrel above dated Brent, cheaper than Forties’ premium of 75 cents to dated.

2018-04-23," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers have never seemed so convinced that oil prices are set to rise rather than fall in the near term, according to the latest positioning data published by regulators and exchanges. Fund managers remain super-bullish even though benchmark Brent prices have almost tripled over the last two years and are now trading at the highest level since November 2014. Hedge funds and other money managers raised their net bullish position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to the price of crude and fuels by 45 million barrels in the week to April 20. The net bullish position was equivalent to 1.411 billion barrels of crude and fuels - enough to satisfy global oil consumption for more than two weeks. The net long position was still below the record 1.484 billion barrels set back on Jan. 23. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2Jfts03) But hedge fund managers have never been so overwhelmingly convinced prices are set to rise further rather than fall back. Across the six major contracts, portfolio managers hold almost 14 long positions for every short one, compared with a ratio of less than 12:1 back on Jan. 23. In total, funds hold 1.520 billion barrels of long positions across Brent, NYMEX and ICE WTI, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil. The number of short positions has fallen to just 109 million barrels, down from 141 million in January, and the lowest number for at least five years. There are plenty of reasons to be bullish about oil, including rapid growth in global oil consumption, continued supply restraint by OPEC, falling output in Venezuela and the possible re-imposition of sanctions on Iran. OECD oil inventories have fallen back in line with the five-year average and are now below the average if adjusted for increased consumption. Senior OPEC leaders have indicated they see room for prices to rise further and have no intention of boosting output before the end of 2018. Nonetheless, the hedge fund community’s positioning has become exceptionally lopsided, which could herald a sharp correction in prices if and when fund managers try to close some of their open positions. Portfolio managers now have record or near-record ratios of long to short positions in WTI (11:1), Brent (15:1), U.S. gasoline (24:1) and European gasoil (45:1). In the past, such lopsided positioning has often heralded a sharp reversal in prices when fund managers have attempted to exit from their positions. But this time around few portfolio managers seem to be worried. Most seem convinced fundamentals will drive prices higher and eventually allow them to liquidate their long positions into a rising rather than a falling market. The calculation could be right, but there are still reasons to be concerned by the sheer concentration of long positions. Rising oil prices are filtering through into more drilling activity in the United States, which will support even faster growth in production by the end of 2018. The number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States has risen in each of the last three weeks, in response to rising prices, after hitting a plateau during the previous seven weeks. With oil prices now above the long-term average, oil consumption is no longer getting a boost from low prices and is increasingly reliant on strong economic growth around the world. But the economic outlook is clouded by rising trade tensions, as well as late-cycle increases in interest rates in the United States and the other major economies. Hedge fund managers have gambled everything on a goldilocks scenario in which oil prices rise without damaging demand or spurring too much shale drilling. They also need the global economic expansion to continue without interruption throughout the rest of 2018 and 2019 to continue boosting oil consumption at record rates. Perhaps this Panglossian scenario will come to pass, but if it does not, lopsided hedge fund positioning could be setting the oil market up for some sharp price movements ahead.

2018-04-23,"* U.S. earnings season heats up with major tech names due * PMI surveys to help judge if Q1 slowdown was temporary * Treasury yields near 3 pct rattle stocks, underpin dollar * Oil prices just off peaks, lift inflation expectations * Aluminium rally resumes, jumping as much as 2.2 percent (Updates prices, changes quotes) By Marc Jones LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - Global equities slipped on Monday as U.S. bond yields approached the 3 percent level that has triggered market spasms in the past and investors awaited earnings results from some of the world’s biggest firms. Wall Street looked set to open flat to weaker, S&P500 futures indicated. Equity markets which have risen for the past two weeks, have come under pressure as oil’s latest moves higher have fuelled inflation worries and pushed up government bond yields — the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.99 percent. That drove the gap - or spread - with German bonds to the widest in 29 years while lifting the dollar almost half a percent. “Brent crude is now close to $75 (a barrel) and that has had a knock on effect on government bonds,” said DZ Bank analyst Rene Albrecht. “With pressure from oil, and also aluminium and steel prices, the inflation topic has made a kind of comeback after being derailed by the trade dispute headlines.” Oil prices edged down but stayed near their highest since late-2014, with futures around $74 per barrel. Aluminium prices leapt again, though, to add to this month’s 25 percent surge following U.S. sanctions on Russia’s producer-giant Rusal. On the economic front, a global round of economic surveys should show if economic softness in the first quarter was a passing phase linked to wintry weather and Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. Readings from Japan, France and Germany were all relatively reassuring “It’s a good reading, it’s still encouraging,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, of the combined euro zone numbers, which he said pointed to quarterly GDP growth of 0.6 percent. On the geopolitical front too, there was plenty to digest. North Korea said on Saturday it would suspend nuclear and missile tests and scrap its nuclear test site. Talk of a trip by the U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to China also fuelled hopes that trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies may be thawing. But the rise in bond yields overshadowed these positives. MSCI’s world index fell 0.25 percent after Asia shed 0.5 percent, while European bourses also slipped, after results from Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, disappointed. UBS shares fell 4 percent at one point. All eyes are now on U.S. earnings, with more than 180 companies in the S&P500 reporting results this week. These include tech giants Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, as well as Boeing and Chevron. S&P 500 companies are expected to report their strongest first-quarter profit gains in seven years. Of the 87 companies that have reported so far, 79.3 percent have topped profit expectations, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fears are the rise in bond yields could further derail world stocks which stand some 7 percent off end-January peaks. When U.S. 10-year yields neared the 3 percent mark in 2013, it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. It also came shortly before oil’s 75 percent price tumble. “Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater currency and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin. While the dollar traditionally has a slight negative correlation with oil, Ruskin said higher 10-year yields would be “mildly dollar-positive”. Indeed, dealers cited yield differentials for the dollar’s latest rally, as the gap with German bonds touched the widest in almost three decades. The greenback rose strongly against the yen and euro. The latter slumped 0.5 percent to 108.21, the weakest since Feb. 13, weighed down also by easing risks around North Korea. The euro too fell half a percent to around $1.2232. It could gain direction from the European Central Bank meeting on Thursday, especially if policymakers signal it may be too early to announce a timetable for winding down bond-buying. ECB chief Mario Draghi said on Friday that while the inflation outlook had picked up, uncertainties “warrant patience, persistence and prudence”.

2018-04-23,"(Adds Zanganeh’s quote, detail) ANKARA, April 23 (Reuters) - Iran’s crude and condensate exports have recovered from a fall in March and currently stand at 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd), state TV on Monday reported Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh as saying. “The decline in March was a temporary issue. It has increased now and currently all together we export 2.5 million barrels of oil and gas condensates,” Zanganeh told state TV. March liftings from Iran, the third-biggest producer among the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), were down 26 percent year on year. Iran has been working to regain market share after Western sanctions over its disputed nuclear program were lifted in 2016 under a deal between the country and six major powers. But U.S. President Donald Trump has warned European signatories of the accord to fix “the disastrous flaws” in the pact or face a U.S. exit. On May 12, Trump will decide whether to restore U.S. economic sanctions on Tehran, which would be a severe blow to the pact. “We have to wait for Trump’s decision. But Iran will use all its capacity and experience to protect the country against the consequences of Trump’s decision,” Zanganeh said. Iran has been striving to retain customers for its oil in Asia, hoping concessions will boost the appeal of its crude compared with other Middle Eastern suppliers, even as the threat looms of potential further U.S. sanctions on the country. Zanganeh said Iran might offer discounts on oil sales, as the OPEC member is keen to preserve its market share. “Iran will take all the necessary measures to keep its oil market share because of the political atmosphere and the American president’s decision on the deal,” Zanganeh said when asked about rumours on offering discounts to India on oil sales. “We have not given a special discount to India but it is possible to make changes in our prices.” Iran used to be the second-biggest oil supplier to India before crippling oil-related sanctions were imposed by the United States and the European Union on Tehran in 2012. Tehran is gradually raising its market share in the world’s third-biggest oil consuming nation.

2018-04-23,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 23 (Reuters) - China’s decision to impose fresh restrictions on imports of coal at some ports appears to have caused a sharp fall in inbound shipments of the polluting fuel. The measures, announced on April 16, included banning the unloading of imported coal at some ports and tightening customs clearances. While it’s still too early to discern a definitive trend, China’s seaborne coal imports slumped to 3.45 million tonnes in the week ended April 21, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This was down almost 30 percent on the 4.92 million tonne weekly average that was recorded from Jan. 1 to April 15. It’s also lower than the weekly average of 4.45 million tonnes for seaborne imports in 2017. It is possible that there are other factors at play in the slump in seaborne imports last week, including lower demand in the usually softer period between the northern winter and summer peaks. But a decline of the magnitude seen last week suggests that the import restrictions had an immediate and profound impact. It’s believed the authorities in Beijing took the steps to crimp some imports as part of efforts to boost domestic thermal coal prices and production. Certainly, domestic thermal coal prices have benefited, with futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange jumping 9.8 percent last week to finish at 588.2 yuan ($93.51) a tonne on April 20, a three-week high. Prices for seaborne thermal coal were more subdued, with Argus Media’s assessment of the 5,500 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) grade at Australia’s Newcastle port dropping fractionally over the week to end at $69.65 a tonne on April 20. This grade of coal is generally preferred by Chinese buyers, because of its discount to the higher-quality 6,000 kcal/kg coal, which is more usually sought by utilities in Japan and South Korea. Since peaking this year at $86.74 a tonne in early February, cargoes of the 5,500 kcal/kg grade have dropped 19.7 percent, while those for the 6,000 kcal/kg are down by a more modest 12.4 percent from the peak in late February. It would be logical to expect the discount of 5,500 kcal/kg supplies to widen further if China does continue to restrict imports of coal in coming months. Falling prices would help open up India to Australia’s thermal coal supplies, although there is little sign yet that this is happening. The bulk of coal supplied to India from Australia is higher-quality coking coal, used to make steel. Australian thermal coal cargoes generally struggle to find buyers in India given the higher price and transport costs when competing against supplies from the region’s other major exporters, Indonesia and South Africa. But the recent price decline for Australian 5,500 kcal/kg cargoes may make them competitive against similar grade coal from South Africa. Argus assessed 5,500 kcal/kg coal at South Africa’s Richards Bay port at $79.30 a tonne, well above the $69.65 for coal at Australia’s Newcastle port. Some of the difference will be eaten up by the longer sea journey from Australia’s east coast to India, but the likelihood is that Indian buyers may well be open to picking up any Australian cargoes that become distressed because of the recent Chinese restrictions. However, coal prices may still be too high to attract significant Indian interest, given the South Asian nation generally is highly price sensitive and cuts back on imports when prices are strong, as they have been in recent months. Vessel-tracking and port data show that India imported 44.8 million tonnes of all grades of coal in the first quarter, a monthly rate of 14.9 million tonnes. This is below the monthly rate of 15.3 million tonnes for 2017, showing that while imported coal may well be needed in India, it’s probably still too expensive to be attractive.

2018-04-23,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The European signatories of Iran’s nuclear deal with major powers should convince U.S. President Donald Trump not to exit the accord as there is no “plan B” for the agreement, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday. “It is either all or nothing. European leaders should encourage Trump not just to stay in the nuclear deal, but more important to begin implementing his part of the bargain in good faith,” Zarif wrote on his Twitter account.  Under Iran’s settlement with the United States, France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program to satisfy the powers that it could not be used to develop atomic bombs. In exchange, Iran received relief from sanctions, most of which were lifted in January 2016. Trump has given the European signatories a May 12 deadline to “fix the terrible flaws” of the 2015 nuclear deal, or he will refuse to extend U.S. sanctions relief on Iran. French President Emmanuel Macron said in a Fox News Sunday interview he has no “plan B” for the deal and the United States should stay in the agreement as long as there is no better option. “President Macron is correct in saying there is no “plan B” on JCPOA,” Zarif Tweeted. The JCPOA or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, is the formal name of the accord.   Iran has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other parties respect it, but will “shred” the deal if Washington pulls out.

2018-04-23,"(Adds context) BAGHDAD, April 23 (Reuters) - Iraq will hold an auction to award exploration and development contracts to international energy companies on Thursday, the oil ministry said in a statement. Iraq is offering 11 new blocks for exploration in border areas with Iran and Kuwait and in offshore Gulf waters. Fourteen companies have expressed interest in the bidding round, the oil ministry said on April 14. Oil companies’ offers will be received at a ceremony at the oil ministry starting at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Thursday and the auction results will be announced later in the day, the ministry said in its statement on Monday. It is the third time the auction date has been changed. The blocks were initially to be auctioned in June, but the date was brought forward to April 15, then postponed to April 25 to give bidders more time, the oil ministry said at the time. Last month the ministry announced measures to reduce the fees paid to oil companies in the contracts to be auctioned. The new contracts will exclude oil by-products from the companies’ revenue, establish a link between prevailing oil prices and their remuneration, and introduce a royalty element. Oil companies operating in Iraq currently receive a fee from the government linked to production increases, which include crude and oil by-products such as liquefied petroleum gas. OPEC’s second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, Iraq decided to change the contracts after a glut caused oil prices to crash in 2014, reducing Baghdad’s ability to pay such fees. Companies including BP, Exxon Mobil, Eni , Total, Royal Dutch Shell and Lukoil have helped Iraq expand production in the past decade by over 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) to about 4.7 million bpd. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government produces oil and gas from fields it controls in northern Iraq under a production-sharing model that is more profitable to companies. The new contracts offered by Baghdad will also set a time limit for companies to end gas flaring from oilfields they develop. Iraq continues to flare some of the gas extracted alongside crude oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel. Iraq hopes to end gas flaring by 2021. Flaring costs the government nearly $2.5 billion in lost revenue each year and could meet most of its unmet needs for gas‐fired power, according to the World Bank.

2018-04-23,"YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia April 23 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A ustralia is confident of not only meeting, but beating, its carbon emissions targets agreed to under the Paris climate agreement, the country’s environment minister said on Monday. Australia has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. But a United Nations Environment Programme report late last year included Australia in a list of 10 nations and regions that need to take further action to meet their Paris goals. “Yes, we have work to do,” Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “I’m confident of not just meeting it, but of beating it,” he said on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Rainforest Summit in Yogyakarta, on the Indonesian island of Java. Based on its current energy mix and growth projections, Australia’s emissions in 2030 are estimated to be about 57 percent higher than its target of 290 million tonnes under the Paris climate accord, government research showed last year. That could change if the government is able to push through its National Energy Guarantee, a power plan that would also include emissions cuts. Political disagreements have held back climate policy in Australia for many years, but broad support emerged last week for the national power plan. “We’ve come a long way,” he said. “Where we have been very effective is in seeking emissions reduction in different aspects of the economy.” Frydenberg cited contracts issued under the country’s Emission Reduction Fund, which sees big emitters paid to cut carbon levels. He also mentioned work already underway in the transport sector to reduce vehicle emissions and a national energy productivity plan to boost efficiency by 40 percent by 2030. “When it comes to the electricity sector, in the last two quarters, emissions have come down as renewables have gone up,” he said. Frydenberg told summit delegates that Australia would help fund the development by the Coral Triangle Center, a non-profit foundation, of a learning module on protecting coastal ecosystems. Such ecosystems, which include sea grasses, mangrove forests and salt marshes, capture carbon emmissions that would otherwise be released into the atmosphere. Frydenberg also said that private sector investment in forests needs to be ramped up. “While investments to support green environments is growing rapidly, less than 1 percent is flowing to forestry and agricultural activities,” he said. ""To leverage private sector investment, countries across the region need to develop enabling environments that meet the requirements of the private sector.""

2018-04-23,"* U.S. earnings season heats up with major tech names due * PMI surveys to help judge if Q1 slowdown was temporary * Treasury yields near 3 pct rattle stocks, underpin dollar * Oil prices just off peaks, lift inflation expectations * Aluminium rally resumes, jumping as much as 2.2 percent By Marc Jones LONDON, April 23 (Reuters) - World stocks slipped on Monday ahead of a blizzard of earnings from the world’s biggest firms and as wary investors watched U.S. bond yields approach peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.99 percent, pushing the gap - or spread - to German bonds to the widest in 29 years and the dollar higher in the process. Traders were also getting a global round of economic surveys that should show in the coming days if economic softness in the first quarter was just a passing phase linked to wintery weather and the Lunar New Year holidays in Asia. Readings from Japan, France and Germany were all relatively reassuring. Japan’s PMI data firmed as output and domestic demand picked up, France got help from its services sector, while Germany came in above forecast despite weaker new orders numbers. “It’s a good reading, it’s still encouraging,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, of the combined euro zone numbers, which he said pointed to quarterly GDP growth of 0.6 percent. On the geopolitical front, there was plenty to digest too. North Korea said on Saturday that it would immediately suspend nuclear and missile tests, scrap its nuclear test site and instead pursue peace and economic growth. Talk of a trip by the U.S. Treasury Secretary to China also fuelled hopes that the recent trade tensions between the world’s two biggest economies may be thawing. Oil prices edged down in the cross-currents but were not far from their highest since late 2014. The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied. Brent crude oil futures were off 20 cents at $73.83 per barrel, U.S. crude eased to $68.16. Aluminium prices leapt up again, though, to add to this month’s 25 percent surge following U.S. sanctions on Russia’s producer-giant Rusal. “Underlying (oil market) sentiment is bullish,” Saxo Bank senior manager Ole Hansen. “And we have OPEC potentially trying to ‘overtighten’ the market.” In stock markets, MSCI’s world index fell 0.25 percent after Asia had shed 0.5 percent overnight and Europe then slipped 0.2 percent as results from Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, disappointed and the rise in yields added pressure generally. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were also pointing to a lower start for Wall Street later. More than 180 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report results this week, including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Boeing and Chevron. Of particular concern for U.S. analysts will be executives’ views about their exposure to China, amid the recent worries about a trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he might travel to Beijing, a move that could ease tensions between the two supersized economies. “A trip is under consideration,” Mnuchin said at a news conference during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. “I did meet with the Chinese here. The discussions were really more around the governor’s actions at the PBOC (People’s Bank of China) and certain actions they’ve announced in terms of opening some of their markets, which we very much encourage and appreciate.” Back in commodity markets, the spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields. Yields on 10-year Treasuries are at the highest now since early 2014 and again threatening the hugely important 3 percent bulwark. The last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. It also came shortly before oil prices went on a mighty 75 percent tumble. “Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin. Traditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added. “If oil helps push the 10-year yield into new terrain for this cycle, this will play at least mildly USD positive in a change of correlation.” Indeed, dealers cited widening yield differentials for the dollar’s broad rally. The gap with German bonds has touched the widest in almost three decades. On a spot basis shorter-term U.S. 2-year yields are testing 2.5 percent, which is the highest since 2008. The greenback was last at 108.215 having broken through major resistance in the 107.90/108.00 zone, which has held solid since mid-February. The dollar index powered up to 90.69, and further away from last week’s low at 89.229. The euro was easier at $1.2232, having repeatedly failed to break above $1.2400 in the last couple of weeks. Investors are awaiting the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday amid talk that policymakers feel it is still too early to announce a timetable for winding down its bond buying. ECB chief Mario Draghi said on Friday he was confident that the inflation outlook has picked up, but uncertainties “warrant patience, persistence and prudence”.

2018-04-23,"TUNIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Libya is considering whether to intervene in a $450 million deal that French major Total (TOTF.PA) announced last month to buy a Marathon Oil (MRO.N) stake in the country’s Waha concessions, several sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Officials were considering a range of options ranging from pushing for better terms - after some in the oil industry and the media said the price was too low - to a counter-offer from the state National Oil Corporation (NOC), the sources said.  “The NOC wants to buy the Total part,” one source from the leadership of Libya’s internationally recognized government, the Presidency Council (PC), said. He added that officials were examining the value of the 16.33 percent Waha share with a view to possibly raising funds for a counter offer with money from Libya’s $67 billion sovereign wealth fund, the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA). “They think of the LIA as a potential financier ... LIA is exploring it, the process is just starting,” the source said Libya had not given the required formal approval to the Total-Marathon deal, meaning it could be blocked, the source added.     NOC confirmed in a statement on Monday that it was “discussing arrangements” over Marathon’s “planned sale” with the PC. “Any transaction of this nature must have the approval of NOC and the Libyan authorities,” it said in a statement. The Libyan Investment Authority did not immediately provide a response. Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne told reporters at an industry event in Paris on Thursday that the deal was all but settled. “The transaction is closed,” Pouyanne said. “There are some discussions on some fiscal issues with the government, but it will be done.”   A spokeswoman for Marathon Oil said the company had already received payment for the sale of its share. A Libyan oil source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that at least some within the NOC found the price Total was paying too low. The deal was “still under consideration and negotiations between many parties here in Tripoli”, a second oil Libyan oil source said. NOC holds a 59.18 percent stake in Waha Oil Co. Other stakeholders are ConocoPhillips (COP.N) with 16.33 percent and Hess (HES.N) with 8.16 percent. Waha’s output of 300,000 boe/d is expected to rise to 400,000 boe/d by the end of the decade, according to production figures given by Total when it announced the deal in early March. Total said the deal would give it access to reserves and resources in excess of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe), with immediate production of around 50,000 boe/d (per day) and “significant exploration potential” in concessions in the Sirte Basin. The stake carries production risks - a Waha pipeline has been hit twice in the past four months by suspected attacks, most recently on Saturday. But it also gives Total a presence at fields in eastern Libya, where most of the country’s oil resources lie. Total already had stakes in the giant southwestern Sharara field, and the offshore Al Jurf field along the Tunisian border. Libya has been split between rival military factions and governments based in the west and east of the country since 2014. The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) has allowed the NOC in Tripoli to operate facilities on LNA territory, while opposing the internationally recognized government in the capital.  The Waha concessions, granted decades ago, are governed by a law that stipulates that Libya’s oil ministry must approve the deal, the Presidency Council source said. Since the oil ministry is not currently operational, that power falls to the Presidency Council, he said, though the NOC has previously disputed the Council’s attempts to take over oil ministry powers. Any acquisition should deliver the “best possible outcome for all the Libyan people, taking into account Libya’s security situation, fiscal position and external investment requirements”, the NOC said.

2018-04-23,"BEIJING (Reuters) - State-run Chinese conglomerate CITIC Group is conducting due diligence on CEFC China Energy’s stake in onshore oil fields in Abu Dhabi as CITIC prepares, under the Chinese government’s direction, to possibly take over CEFC’s energy business, said two sources with knowledge of the matter.  CITIC is examining CEFC Energy’s 4 percent holding in onshore oil fields operated by Abu Dhabi National Oil Co that it paid $900 million for in 2017, said a source briefed on the matter. A CEFC company source confirmed that the due diligence was being carried out.  A Chinese government official who was briefed on the discussions told Reuters earlier this month that CITIC was approached by the government to examine and possibly take over CEFC’s energy assets.  CEFC is looking to sell assets to raise cash as concerns about its financial position were raised after its Chairman Ye Jianming was revealed in March to be under investigation for suspected economic crimes. Following the revelations of the investigation, CEFC was found to have nearly $7 billion of short-term debt coming due in the first-half of this year. Additionally, Reuters reported in March that the company sought short-term financing with interest rates of up to 36 percent a year from shadow lenders to bolster its finances.     CEFC purchased the Abu Dhabi stake as part of a spree to expand its energy assets that also included an agreement to buy a 14.16 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft (ROSN.MM) for $9.1 billion.  The Abu Dhabi stake is for onshore oil fields that produce about 1.4 million barrels per day of crude and CEFC’s share gives it the right to market about 2 million barrels a month of Murban crude that is highly sought by Asian oil refiners.  “CITIC is interested in the Abu Dhabi asset. They consider that as a good asset,” said one of the sources briefed on the matter. CITIC and CEFC did not respond to requests for comment.   “CITIC is doing early due diligence on the Abu Dhabi asset,” said the second source, adding that CITIC was not interested in a 35 percent stake in oil and gas blocks in Chad that CEFC bought in September 2016 from Taiwan’s Chinese Petroleum Corp for about $110 million.  “The Chad asset was considered risky, with lots of issues,” said the second source, without elaborating. A deal to buy one of CEFC’s most prized energy assets would be the latest effort by the government to restructure the embattled energy company. State-controlled China Huarong Asset Management Co has taken a 36.2 percent stake in CEFC Hainan International, the unit that is acquiring the Rosneft stake.     Last week, CITIC signed a memorandum of understanding to form a joint venture with CEFC Europe, the Czech Republic-based unit of CEFC, a month after Reuters reported that CITIC was in talks with CEFC to hold a 49 percent stake in the proposed venture. It is unclear if CITIC will take over any of CEFC’s domestic oil and gas business or take a role in the acquisition of the Rosneft stake.

The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries hit its highest level since January 2014 at 2.9790 percent in early European trade, as the spread over the German equivalent briefly touched its widest level in 29 years. Traders were also getting a global round of economic surveys that should show if economic softness in the first quarter was just a passing phase linked to wintery weather and the Lunar New Year holidays. Readings from Japan, France and Germany were all relatively reassuring. Japan’s PMI firmed as output and domestic demand picked up, France was helped by its services sector, while Germany was also above forecast despite weaker new orders numbers. “It’s a good reading, it’s still encouraging,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, of the combined euro zone numbers, which he said pointed to quarterly GDP growth of 0.6 percent. On the geopolitical front, there was plenty to digest too. Signs that U.S.-China relations may be thawing were offset somewhat as President Donald Trump cautioned the North Korean nuclear crisis was a long way from being resolved, a day after the North pledged to end its nuclear tests. Oil prices edged down in early trade but were not far from their highest since late 2014. The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied. Brent crude oil futures were off 20 cents at $73.83 per barrel, while U.S. crude eased to $68.16. In stock markets, MSCI’s world index fell 0.2 percent after Asia shed 0.5 percent overnight and Europe then slipped 0.3 percent as results from Switzerland’s biggest bank, UBS, disappointed and the rise in yields put pressure on bond-proxy sectors. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were also pointing to lower start for Wall Street later. More than 180 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report results this week including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Boeing and Chevron. Of particular concern for U..S. analysts will be executives’ views about their exposure to China, the world’s No. 2 economy and an important market for many U.S. companies amid the recent worries about a trade war. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday he may travel to China, a move that could ease tensions between the two supersized economies. “A trip is under consideration,” Mnuchin said at a news conference during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank spring meetings in Washington. “I did meet with the Chinese here. The discussions were really more around the governor’s actions at the PBOC (People’s Bank of China) and certain actions they’ve announced in terms of opening some of their markets, which we very much encourage and appreciate.” Back in commodity markets, the spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields. Yields on 10-year Treasuries are at the highest now since early 2014 at 2.977 percent and again threatening the hugely important 3 percent bulwark. The last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding.

Order intake rose 20.9 percent in the first quarter as Rotork’s energy sector customers spent more on maintenance and upgrades to compensate for the lack of investment over the previous few years. Rotork, which makes valve-control systems for the oil and gas markets, said investment in larger projects improved towards the end of the quarter. “In oil and gas, we saw growth in upstream and the improvement that we saw in downstream in the last quarter of 2017 continued,” the company said. Rotork said it experienced stronger-than-anticipated order intake in the first quarter and now expects mid-to-high single-digit growth in full-year revenue.

To produce LNG, natural gas is cooled down to around minus 160 degrees Celsius, so facilities must be chilled before production can begin, typically by using fuel from other sites. Taking such a step indicates the plant, in northern Australia’s Darwin, is getting closer to starting output. The LNG tanker ‘Pacific Breeze’ is currently in the Java Sea and expected to reach Darwin on April 26, with a draft of 93 percent, suggesting it is almost full, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data. The ship has the capacity to carry up to 182,000 cubic metres of LNG, according to Inpex. A spokesman for Inpex said the vessel had been chartered to transport LNG bought from another LNG project with the objective of cooling the onshore Ichthys LNG plant ahead of the project’s start-up. He added the vessel’s LNG could also possibly be used as a first export cargo should Ichthys experience further delays in production, but stressed this had not yet been decided. The more than $37 billion Ichthys project has seen several delays and cost overruns of billions of dollars due to technical difficulties. Inpex, Japan’s top oil and gas producer, said in March it had postponed its latest planned start-up to April or May. The start was originally slated for 2016. The newly-built Pacific Breeze is contracted to supply 1.75 million tonnes a year of LNG from Ichthys to Taiwan’s CPC Corp. CPC did not respond to queries for comment. The vessel loaded a cargo in Singapore in late March after conducting sea trials. Once the Central Processing Facility is commissioned at Ichthys, it will produce condensate - an ultra-light form of crude oil - before LNG, Inpex has said without giving a specific timeframe. Taiwan’s CPC, the biggest customer of Ichthys, is scheduled to take delivery of its first LNG cargo in the second half of this year, a source familiar with the matter said, declining to be identified. Other customers of the project mainly include Japanese utilities. Inpex holds 62.245 percent of Ichthys, France’s Total 30 percent, with the rest spread amongst Taiwan’s CPC Corp and Japanese utilities Tokyo Gas, Osaka Gas, Kansai Electric, JERA Corp and Toho Gas . Exports from new LNG projects including Ichthys are expected to help Australia overtake Qatar to become the world’s largest exporter of the super-chilled fuel by 2019.

2018-04-23,"* U.S. earnings season heats up with major tech names due * PMI surveys to help judge if Q1 slowdown was temporary * Treasury yields near 3 pct rattle stocks, underpin dollar * Oil prices just off peaks, lift inflation expectations By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, April 23 (Reuters) - Asian stocks dipped on Monday as investors braced for a bevy of earnings from the world’s largest corporations, while keeping a wary eye on U.S. bond yields as they approach peaks that have triggered market spasms in the past. Traders were also anxiously awaiting surveys on global manufacturing for April to see if economic softness in the first quarter was just a passing phase linked to poor weather and the Lunar New Year holidays. The first reading from Japan was tentatively upbeat with its PMI firming to 53.3 in April as output and domestic demand picked up. On the geopolitical front, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the North Korean nuclear crisis was a long way from being resolved, striking a cautious note a day after the North pledged to end its nuclear tests. Oil prices edged down in early trade but were not far from their highest since late 2014. The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied. Brent crude oil futures were off 3 cents at $74.03 per barrel, while U.S. crude eased 10 cents to $68.30. In stock markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent, with South Korea off 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei eased 0.3 percent and China blue chips 0.6 percent as tech stocks continued to struggle with a warning on waning demand for mobile phones. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 went the other way to edge up 0.24 percent. FTSE futures added 0.2 percent. Rising bond yields had pressured Wall Street on Friday, though the S&P 500 still managed to end the week with a slight gain. More than 180 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report results this week including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Boeing and Chevron. The spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields. Yields on 10-year Treasuries are at the highest since early 2014 at 2.977 percent and again threatening the hugely important 3 percent bulwark. The last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. “Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin. Traditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added. “If oil helps push the 10-year yield into new terrain for this cycle, this will play at least mildly USD positive in a change of correlation.” Indeed, dealers cited widening yield differentials for the dollar’s broad rally on Friday. The currency was last at 107.79 yen and testing major resistance in the 107.90/108.00 zone which has held solid since mid-February. The dollar index edged up to 90.403, and further away from last week’s low at 89.229. The euro was easier at $1.2272, having repeatedly failed to break above $1.2400 in the last couple of weeks. Investors are awaiting the European Central Bank’s policy meeting on Thursday amid talk policymakers feel it is still too early to announce a timetable for winding down its bond buying. ECB chief Mario Draghi on Friday said he was confident that the inflation outlook has picked up, but uncertainties “warrant patience, persistence and prudence.” Editing by Sam Holmes and Kim Coghill",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-asia-stocks-struggle-as-u-s-yields-near-3-pct-oil-stays-high-idUKL3N1S01PM,23 Apr 2018,"Asian stocks dipped on Monday

2018-04-23,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, April 23 (Reuters) - China’s decision to impose fresh restrictions on imports of coal at some ports appears to have caused a sharp fall in inbound shipments of the polluting fuel. The measures, announced on April 16, included banning the unloading of imported coal at some ports and tightening customs clearances. While it’s still too early to discern a definitive trend, China’s seaborne coal imports slumped to 3.45 million tonnes in the week ended April 21, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. This was down almost 30 percent on the 4.92 million tonne weekly average that was recorded from Jan. 1 to April 15. It’s also lower than the weekly average of 4.45 million tonnes for seaborne imports in 2017. It is possible that there are other factors at play in the slump in seaborne imports last week, including lower demand in the usually softer period between the northern winter and summer peaks. But a decline of the magnitude seen last week suggests that the import restrictions had an immediate and profound impact. It’s believed the authorities in Beijing took the steps to crimp some imports as part of efforts to boost domestic thermal coal prices and production. Certainly, domestic thermal coal prices have benefited, with futures on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange jumping 9.8 percent last week to finish at 588.2 yuan ($93.51) a tonne on April 20, a three-week high. Prices for seaborne thermal coal were more subdued, with Argus Media’s assessment of the 5,500 kilocalorie per kilogram (kcal/kg) grade at Australia’s Newcastle port dropping fractionally over the week to end at $69.65 a tonne on April 20. This grade of coal is generally preferred by Chinese buyers, because of its discount to the higher-quality 6,000 kcal/kg coal, which is more usually sought by utilities in Japan and South Korea. Since peaking this year at $86.74 a tonne in early February, cargoes of the 5,500 kcal/kg grade have dropped 19.7 percent, while those for the 6,000 kcal/kg are down by a more modest 12.4 percent from the peak in late February. It would be logical to expect the discount of 5,500 kcal/kg supplies to widen further if China does continue to restrict imports of coal in coming months. Falling prices would help open up India to Australia’s thermal coal supplies, although there is little sign yet that this is happening. The bulk of coal supplied to India from Australia is higher-quality coking coal, used to make steel. Australian thermal coal cargoes generally struggle to find buyers in India given the higher price and transport costs when competing against supplies from the region’s other major exporters, Indonesia and South Africa. But the recent price decline for Australian 5,500 kcal/kg cargoes may make them competitive against similar grade coal from South Africa. Argus assessed 5,500 kcal/kg coal at South Africa’s Richards Bay port at $79.30 a tonne, well above the $69.65 for coal at Australia’s Newcastle port. Some of the difference will be eaten up by the longer sea journey from Australia’s east coast to India, but the likelihood is that Indian buyers may well be open to picking up any Australian cargoes that become distressed because of the recent Chinese restrictions. However, coal prices may still be too high to attract significant Indian interest, given the South Asian nation generally is highly price sensitive and cuts back on imports when prices are strong, as they have been in recent months. Vessel-tracking and port data show that India imported 44.8 million tonnes of all grades of coal in the first quarter, a monthly rate of 14.9 million tonnes. This is below the monthly rate of 15.3 million tonnes for 2017, showing that while imported coal may well be needed in India, it’s probably still too expensive to be attractive.

2018-04-23,"* Coke prices rose after producers meet to discuss capacity cut * Prices also supported by new environmental crackdown on heavy industry * Coke market still in oversupply due to falling demand from steel mills (Adds quotes and details) BEIJING, April 23 (Reuters) - Chinese coke futures prices rallied more than 4 percent to their highest in five weeks on Monday, as a source said a group of small producers is considering slashing output to revive prices. The most-active coke futures for delivery in September on the Dalian Commodity Exchange were up 4.3 percent at 1,938.5 yuan ($308.02) per tonne at the midday close, after rising to as much as 1,940 yuan, the highest since March 16, earlier in the session. The gains demonstrate that the potential cut from coke producers has offset concerns of falling demand for coke and other industrial commodities. Cities in China’s polluted northern regions are starting to limit operations at some heavy manufacturing plants following the launch of fresh environmental inspections under the country’s war on smog. The city of Handan in Hebei province, one of the most polluted cities in the north, the Shandong Coke Association and the China Coke Association held a meeting last Wednesday of about 40 small coke producers based in Hebei and Shandong province, according to a source briefed on the gathering. The source declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. At the meeting, the factories considered reducing output by at least 15 percent but did not reach a final agreement, the source said. The two associations and the city authorities declined to comment on the meeting. The extension of the curtailments on heavy industry that were enacted during the winter has also supported prices since they also apply to coke manufacturers. Coke is a fuel that is rich in carbon and is used to smelt steel and make cement. For example, Xuzhou in the eastern province of Jiangsu has started new inspections this month of industrial producers, including coke plants and steel mills. Coke supplies are falling. Inventories at the port of Lianyungang, in Jiangsu, have dropped by 40 percent since the beginning of April to 93,500 tonnes as of April 23, data from Steel Home showed. SH-LYN-COKEINV However, market participants said the rebound in coke could be short-lived. Bigger producers like Yancoal were still operating at full utilization rate, a coke plant manager with the company said. Also, three coke traders said demand from steel mills has dropped because of the production curbs. “The market is still in oversupply. Coke plants have been operating at a utilization of 77 to 78 percent as of April, up from only 60 percent in January,” said Zhang Min, coal analyst with China Sublime Information Group. $1 = 6.2935 Chinese yuan renminbi

2018-04-23,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - At an Alberta oil loading terminal, a convoy of big rigs are gearing up to haul Canadian crude oil hundreds of miles through bone dry fields across the U.S. border into Montana, where the oil will be transferred to pipelines and rail cars headed south and west. Trucks loaded with crude are an increasingly common sight at the border. Production has risen in the world’s fifth largest producer but full pipelines and a rail car shortage have made it difficult for drillers to ship oil out of Canada. Some oil producers are feeling the pressure from customers. Alberta-based Gear Energy Ltd pumps about 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and recently had an Asian customer walk away from an agreement to buy crude after failing to secure a way to ship oil to the West Coast.  “We’ve never had more inbound calls looking for heavy oil,” said Gear Chief Executive Officer Ingram Gillmore. “And we have never had more challenges actually getting it to them. It is very frustrating.” Production in Canada rose 8 percent in the last year to a record 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) and is forecast to keep rising. Over the next five years, OPEC production is expected to only grow modestly, leaving the bulk of forecasted global supply increases to the United States and Canada.  But Canada’s oil industry faces significant challenges, not the least of which are high production costs, remote oil fields and, perhaps most pressing, the shipping bottlenecks. So significant are the problems that a number of oil majors have withdrawn from Canada.   No easy solution is on the horizon. Plans for new export pipelines are running into opposition from environmentalists, Aboriginal groups and rival provinces. Most recently, Kinder Morgan Canada hit the brakes on its Trans Mountain expansion, and TransCanada Corp has not yet fully committed to its Keystone XL project. Frustrated and fearful of missing out on the rebound in prices, drillers are increasingly relying on trucks to move oil to the market. Crude exports from Canada by road nearly tripled from 2015 to 2017, and continued to rise in the first two months of 2018, according to StatsCan data provided to Reuters.  (For graphic, see tmsnrt.rs/2qDogMD) However, a truck can only carry 200 barrels of oil, compared with 60,000 barrels in one unit train, or nearly 600,000 per day on the Keystone Pipeline - the equivalent of 3,000 trucks. Each one of those trucks needs a driver and enough fuel to carry crude over long distances. Moving crude by truck is at least 10 times more expensive on a mile-for-mile basis compared with rail or pipeline. “We have demand for 50,000 bpd and we can move about a fifth of that,” said Jarrett Zielinski, chief executive of Torq Energy Logistics, an Alberta company that owns rail loading facilities and 275 trucks.  Rising opposition to pipelines is hitting Alberta, the landlocked province where most Canadian oil is produced. The fight over the Trans Mountain expansion, which would nearly triple the capacity of the 1,150-kilometre (715 mile) line from Alberta to a British Columbia port, has engulfed two provinces and the government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.  British Columbia is opposed to the project, which prompted Kinder Morgan to suspend work on the line. Alberta’s premier threatened to cut fuel deliveries to its neighboring province in retaliation. As for trains, during certain months, rail operators face political pressure to prioritize movement of agricultural products. Rail operators want long-term deals from shippers, but oil companies prefer to have the flexibility to shift to pipelines if space becomes available. Exports by road rose from just over 17,000 barrels per month in 2015 to more than 51,000 in 2017, according to data Statistics Canada provided to Reuters. In the first two months of 2018, road exports surged to an average of 180,000 a month. By contrast, rail exports averaged 4 million barrels a month in 2017.  Using trucks allows producers to reach northern U.S. rail loading sites, where there is more capacity and rates are cheaper, Zielinski said. Monthly demand fluctuates based on the discount for western Canadian crude versus the U.S. benchmark. When the discount is above $20, oil producers will pay to haul crude up to five hours, more than twice as far as usually makes economic sense, Zielinski said. However, the trucking industry’s capacity to move more crude is limited by a severe driver shortage in Western Canada, said Andrew Barnes, director of compliance and regulatory affairs at Alberta Motor Transportation Association. This is not unique to Canada. Booming production in west Texas has strained pipeline capacity, increasing reliance on trucks to deliver to injection points. But ongoing pipeline construction in Texas should alleviate the glut in the next year, while Canada’s future in less clear. The uptick in truck transport also raises safety questions. There were 205 road accidents involving crude tanker trucks in Canada from 2010 through 2016, which killed 10 people, according to Transport Canada data. There were nine accidents involving crude trains, though one was the Lac Megantic, Quebec disaster in 2013, where a train hauling 72-crude cars derailed and exploded, killing 47. When the Canadian oil discount hit a four-year high at $31 in January, Alberta oil companies started calling Ceres Global Ag Corp, a grain and fertilizer handling facility on the Canada-U.S. border at Northgate, Saskatchewan. Desperate for access, companies were pushing Ceres to accelerate long-term plans to add crude hauling, starting with a C$1 million ($795 million) facility to transfer crude from trucks to rail and onto the BNSF system. “Every day they have fewer options of where to take it,” said Ceres CEO Robert Day, who said his company is working to get to the point where they can load oil. “We’re going to work real hard to make that happen in 2018.” The bottlenecks are frustrating for Canadian oil producers because heavy crude is in great demand from U.S. Gulf of Mexico refineries, which are designed to process it, and have faced shortages of Venezuelan and Mexican heavy crude.  Large producers tend to store oil until they have enough volume to fill a train, but for smaller producers who cannot shut production and lack storage capacity, trucks may be the only option, said a Calgary trader.  “At the end of the day, you cannot put it back in the ground - it has to go somewhere,” he said. “If your alternative is a camel or a donkey, then that’s the alternative you have to go with.” Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg and Julie Gordon in Vancouver; Editing by David Gaffen and Paul Thomasch",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-crude-trucks/insight-facing-shipping-constraints-canada-moving-oil-one-truckload-at-a-time-idUKL1N1QX1GB,23 Apr 2018,"At an

Exports by road rose from just over 17,000 barrels per month in 2015 to more than 51,000 in 2017, according to data Statistics Canada provided to Reuters. In the first two months of 2018, road exports surged to an average of 180,000 a month. By contrast, rail exports averaged 4 million barrels a month in 2017. Using trucks allows producers to reach northern U.S. rail loading sites, where there is more capacity and rates are cheaper, Zielinski said. Monthly demand fluctuates based on the discount for western Canadian crude versus the U.S. benchmark. When the discount is above $20, oil producers will pay to haul crude up to five hours, more than twice as far as usually makes economic sense, Zielinski said. However, the trucking industry’s capacity to move more crude is limited by a severe driver shortage in Western Canada, said Andrew Barnes, director of compliance and regulatory affairs at Alberta Motor Transportation Association. This is not unique to Canada. Booming production in west Texas has strained pipeline capacity, increasing reliance on trucks to deliver to injection points. But ongoing pipeline construction in Texas should alleviate the glut in the next year, while Canada’s future in less clear. The uptick in truck transport also raises safety questions. There were 205 road accidents involving crude tanker trucks in Canada from 2010 through 2016, which killed 10 people, according to Transport Canada data. There were nine accidents involving crude trains, though one was the Lac Megantic, Quebec disaster in 2013, where a train hauling 72-crude cars derailed and exploded, killing 47. When the Canadian oil discount hit a four-year high at $31 in January, Alberta oil companies started calling Ceres Global Ag Corp, a grain and fertilizer handling facility on the Canada-U.S. border at Northgate, Saskatchewan. Desperate for access, companies were pushing Ceres to accelerate long-term plans to add crude hauling, starting with a C$1 million ($795 million) facility to transfer crude from trucks to rail and onto the BNSF system. “Every day they have fewer options of where to take it,” said Ceres CEO Robert Day, who said his company is working to get to the point where they can load oil. “We’re going to work real hard to make that happen in 2018.” The bottlenecks are frustrating for Canadian oil producers because heavy crude is in great demand from U.S. Gulf of Mexico refineries, which are designed to process it, and have faced shortages of Venezuelan and Mexican heavy crude. Large producers tend to store oil until they have enough volume to fill a train, but for smaller producers who cannot shut production and lack storage capacity, trucks may be the only option, said a Calgary trader. “At the end of the day, you cannot put it back in the ground - it has to go somewhere,” he said. “If your alternative is a camel or a donkey, then that’s the alternative you have to go with.” Reporting by Rod Nickel in Winnipeg and Julie Gordon in

Traders were also anxiously awaiting surveys on global manufacturing for April to see if economic softness in the first quarter was just a passing phase linked to poor weather and the Lunar New Year holidays. The first reading from Japan was tentatively upbeat with its PMI firming to 53.3 in April as output and domestic demand picked up. On the geopolitical front, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday the North Korean nuclear crisis was a long way from being resolved, striking a cautious note a day after the North pledged to end its nuclear tests. Oil prices edged down in early trade but were not far from their highest since late 2014. The market had wobbled on Friday when Trump tweeted criticism of OPEC’s role in pushing up global prices, but quickly steadied. Brent crude oil futures were off 9 cents at $73.97 per barrel, while U.S. crude eased 19 cents to $68.21. In stock markets, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4 percent, with South Korea off 0.3 percent. Japan’s Nikkei also eased 0.3 percent as tech stocks continued to struggle with a warning on waning demand for mobile phones. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 went the other way, edging up 0.1 percent. Rising bond yields had pressured Wall Street on Friday, though the S&P 500 still managed to end the week with a slight gain. More than 180 companies in the S&P 500 are due to report results this week including Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Boeing and Chevron. The spike in oil has driven up both market expectations of future inflation and long-term bond yields. Yields on 10-year Treasuries finished last week at the highest since early 2014 and at 2.966 percent were again challenging the hugely important 3 percent barrier. The last time yields neared this number in 2013 it rocked risk appetite and sent stocks sliding. “Another $5/barrel increase in oil will be enough for U.S. 10-year yields to threaten 3 percent. Oil is now at the cusp of levels where higher prices will spark greater FX and broader asset market volatility,” said Deutsche Bank’s macro strategist, Alan Ruskin. Traditionally the dollar had a slight negative correlation with oil, mostly because the dominant causation goes from dollar weakness to rising oil prices, he added. “If oil helps push the 10 year yield into new terrain for this cycle, this will play at least mildly USD positive in a change of correlation.” Indeed, dealers cited widening yield differentials for the dollar’s broad rally on Friday.

2018-04-23,"* U.S. rig count rises to 820, highest since March, 2015 * But strong demand, OPEC cuts still support prices overall By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, April 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped early on Monday as a rising U.S. rig count pointed to further increases in the country’s output, underlining one of only a few factors holding back crude markets in an otherwise bullish environment. Brent crude oil futures were at $73.87 per barrel at 0031 GMT, down 19 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 23 cents, or 0.30 percent, at $68.17 a barrel. U.S. drillers added five oil rigs drilling for new production in the week ending April 20, bringing the total count to 820, the highest since March, 2015, according to General Electric’s Baker Hughes energy services firm. The rising rig count points to further increases in U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA, which has already climbed by a quarter since mid-2016 to a record 10.54 million barrels per day (bpd). Only Russia currently produces more, at almost 11 million bpd. Despite the dips in crude oil prices on Monday, overall markets remain well supported by strong demand, especially in Asia, and Brent prices are up by 20 percent from their 2018 lows in February. Providing further support have been supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) introduced in 2017 with the aim of propping up prices, as well as by the potential of renewed U.S. sanctions against Tehran. The United States has until May 12 to decide whether it will leave the Iran nuclear deal, which would further tighten global supplies. “Stay long oil,” U.S. bank J.P.

2018-04-23,"(Repeats item with no changes to text) * Canal LNG volumes to hit 11 mln T this year, 20 mln T in 2019 * Rise from 2017’s 6 mln T driven by U.S. expansion, Asia demand * Authority already starting to look at adding 4th set of locks By Osamu Tsukimori TOKYO, April 20 (Reuters) - The Panama Canal may carry five times as much liquefied natural gas (LNG) in 2020 as it did last year as production of the fuel expands in the United States and Asian import demand rises, the head of the canal’s governing agency told Reuters. LNG volumes traversing the Canal could hit 30 million tonnes a year before the end of 2020, said Jorge Quijano, who leads the Panama Canal Authority, up from 6 million tonnes last year. Demand for LNG has risen significantly in the last three years as the increase of supply, especially from onshore shale fields in the United States and offshore reserves in Australia, has made it more competitive. Many countries including China have also been switching to gas more rapidly than expected, away from dirtier coal, for environmental reasons. The United States has only one LNG export facility, at Sabine Pass in Louisiana, which exports via the Panama Canal mostly to North Asia and the Pacific coast of Latin America. But shipments are expected to surge over the next few years as several U.S. LNG projects are under construction, with total U.S. capacity slated to reach nearly 70 million tonnes a year, up from 18 million tonnes in 2017. “Right now on average, we’re running six (LNG) vessels per week, but in the very near future, you will have several plants exporting and that starts to add up,” Quijano said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. U.S. LNG exports through the canal are set to rise to as much as 11 million tonnes this year and to around 20 million tonnes in 2019, he said. Reflecting a quickening in traffic, three gas tankers transited the Canal in a single day for the first time on April 17. And since June 2017, there have been 15 days in which two LNG ships passed through the Canal in a 24-hour period. Shipments of LNG through the Panama Canal began to rise after a third set of locks was added in 2016, Quijano said, and the authority projects growing demand for the supercooled fuel will boost such transits through the early part of the 2020s. The Canal is already looking beyond the next few years to adding a fourth set of locks, which would serve a new generation of even bigger ships, Quijano said.

Most analysts have pointed to escalating Middle East conflicts, a crisis in Venezuela, and the supply cuts of Saudi Arabia and other producers as the main drivers taking global benchmark Brent and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures this week to their highest since late 2014 at almost $75 and $70 a barrel, respectively. Yet a much more fundamental reason has also sparked oil’s bull run: Asian demand, which Goldman Sachs said this week points to an average price of $80 a barrel in 2018. “Rising tensions in the Middle East have likely played a role in oil price strength, but we believe a tight physical market is the key driver,” U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday in a note to clients. Trade data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows seaborne imports of crude oil by Asia’s main buyers will hit a record this month, a big portion going to slake China’s voracious thirst. By end-April, China will likely have taken in more than 9 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, its most ever. That’s nearly 10 percent of global consumption and more than a third of Asia’s overall demand. At $75 a barrel, it implies monthly import costs for China of more than $20 billion. The record comes despite maintenance season, which usually dents imports at this time of year, and indicates that China’s oil requirement is bigger than expected. “Chinese demand points to strong growth,” said U.S. bank Goldman Sachs in a note to clients, adding that it may be “higher than currently estimated”. RE-STOCKING, TEAPOTS, RESERVES Michal Meidan of consultancy Energy Aspects said Chinese buyers were re-stocking after running down inventories late last year. Much of China’s new demand also comes from the advent of non-state refiners - often called teapots - as crude importers, resulting in record refining throughput. “A number of teapots are starting new Crude Distillation Unites (CDUs) and secondary units, pulling in more crude,” Meidan said, adding that there may also be some purchases of Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPRs). Beyond re-stocking and teapots, analysts said China’s economic performance has also been stronger than expected. “Chinese growth of 6.8 percent in Q1 is higher than its target of 6.5 percent for the year. The supportive growth environment in China is one key reason for a supported oil demand story in general,” said Barnabas Gan, analyst at Singapore’s OCBC Bank. Suresh Sivanandam of energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said he expected China’s overall oil demand to grow by 370,000 bpd this year to 12.78 million bpd. Adding in other regions, Goldman said global oil demand in the first quarter of 2018 is likely to post the strongest year-on-year growth since the last quarter of 2010. A tighter market is also showing up in rising costs for crude deliveries to Asia as Middle East producers raise their official selling prices (OSPs). The OSPs for Abu Dhabi’s Murban and Saudi Arabia’s Light crudes are currently showing their highest premiums to Dubai since 2014. With demand growing all around, some analysts say there is little reason to expect anything but further price increases. Standard Chartered Bank said this week there were “no bears left in this oil town”. So far, refineries in Asia are still operating at high levels to meet strong demand, despite rising crude feedstock prices eating into profit margins. “Refiners are not likely to reduce imports or trim down run rates despite the price increase,” said Lee Dal-seok, senior research fellow at state-run think tank Korea Energy Economics Institute. Still, some dark clouds loom. China’s Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, plans deep cuts to its May crude imports as its biggest refinery - the 460,000 bpd Zhenhai Refining and Chemical Company - goes into major overhaul. Several traders said more such outages are due in May and June, likely reducing China’s crude imports in coming months. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week also released its World Economic Outlook in which it warned that rising U.S.-China trade restrictions threatened global growth. “The prospect of trade restrictions and counter-restrictions threatens to ... derail growth prematurely,” said IMF Chief Economist Maurice Obstfeld. Goldman Sachs does not share the IMF’s concerns. Worries about “trade wars and fears that higher oil prices will start to weigh on demand growth ... are overdone,” it said.
