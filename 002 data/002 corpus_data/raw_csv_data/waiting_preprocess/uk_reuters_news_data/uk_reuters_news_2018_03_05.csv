2018-03-05,"(Adds Zinke quote) By Valerie Volcovici WASHINGTON, March 5 (Reuters) - U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said on Monday he has postponed a second federal oil and gas lease sale planned for March in less than a week in response to local opposition to the possibility of drilling near national parks and monuments. Zinke said the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will remove 17,300 acres out of the planned March 13 sale of 63,496 acres of federal land for oil and gas leases near the tourist city of Livingston, Montana, which is a gateway to the Yellowstone National Park. “I’ve always said there are places where it is appropriate to develop and where it’s not. This area certainly deserves more study, and appropriately we have decided to defer the sale,” Zinke said in a statement. The remaining 83 parcels, which cover over 46,000 acres, will be offered for lease via an online auction as planned. The leases last for 10 years. Zinke’s announcement came just four days after he made a similar surprise statement to the Albuquerque Journal, postponing an oil and gas lease sale planned for March 8 near New Mexico’s Chaco Canyon, a UNESCO world heritage site which contains numerous Anasazi ruins. “We’re going to defer those leases until we do some cultural consultation,” Zinke told the newspaper. BLM, which oversees federal oil and gas leases, received over 120 protests about the sale and said it will complete an analysis of over 5,000 cultural sites before it proceeds. In just over a year in office, the Trump administration has taken numerous steps to expand and speed up energy development on federal land. The BLM last month quietly removed Obama-era reforms to the leasing of federal land for oil and gas drilling in a move to “simplify and streamline” the process to speed up permitting of new lease sales. The move removed a policy aimed at including input from environmentalists and local tourist industry groups in the process of leasing federal land for drilling, which the oil and gas industry said was time-consuming and redundant. Environmentalists said the change in policy means that places such as Livingston need to rely on lawyers to help them win a last-minute pardon. “The Trump Administration could have avoided this debacle if they hadn’t eliminated policies that guarantee local communities a voice in where drilling should and shouldn’t happen,” said Kate Kelly, public lands director at the Center for American Progress. In southeastern Utah, local environmental and archaeological groups have protested a March 20 auction of around 57,000 acres near the former boundaries of the Bears Ears National Monument - reduced by 85 percent last year by President Donald Trump - that is known to contain significant cultural sites. Zinke has not yet signaled whether he plans to delay that sale. Kathleen Sgamma, president of industry group the Western Energy Alliance, said Zinke likely felt pressure from communities that “aren’t used to development - how it’s done responsibly to protect the environment while coexisting with recreation.” (Reporting by Valerie Volcovici Editing by Susan Thomas and James Dalgleish)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-interior-oil/update-2-u-s-interior-chief-holds-off-on-federal-oil-lease-sale-after-outcry-idUKL2N1QN1V6,05 Mar 2018,"U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan

2018-03-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The world’s largest oil producers appealed to U.S. shale producers to join their efforts to hold global prices at their current level at a major energy conference Monday, as the boom in shale is continuing to undermine OPEC’s production curbs. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo said Monday at the CERAWeek conference in Houston that there is a “common understanding” between oil-producing nations and U.S. shale producers that “we all belong to this industry,” even as U.S. exports have eroded OPEC’s market share over the last year. This year’s CERAWeek conference continues outreach between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and shale producers. Members of OPEC will meet with shale producers on Monday evening at a dinner for the second year in a row, though Barkindo said that price levels and production will not be discussed. However, shale’s surge in the last year was heavy on the minds at the Houston conference, particularly as U.S. production surged to an all-time record late last year.  Nigeria’s oil minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu was more explicit than Barkindo, saying that oil majors operating in both shale fields and in OPEC members should bear some responsibility for prices.  “We need to begin to look at companies that are very active in these areas and begin to get them to take some responsibilities in terms of stability of oil prices,” Kachikwu told Reuters on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, though he did not name any specific companies.      “Some of the same companies that are working in shale are the same companies working in OPEC (member countries).”  The price of oil CLc1 LCOc1 rose steadily throughout 2017 in the wake an agreement between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-members including Russia, to cut production by 1.8 million barrels a day beginning last year.  That surge in prices, however, boosted U.S. production sharply, which hit a record in November 2017 at more than 10 million barrels a day and is expected to surpass 11 million barrels a day later this year.  Going forward, Fatih Birol, head of the Paris-based International Energy Agency said here in Houston that shale growth may continue to rise regardless of OPEC policies - warning that larger producers may need to reconsider their future growth given “huge growth” in shale.  Rising prices have U.S. shale producers pumping more, while OPEC has maintained its price cuts, with output from members at a 10-month low.  The cartel’s leaders have even expressed interest in keeping some production curbs in place through 2019, though Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the United Arab Emirates oil minister, said OPEC has not “at this stage” discussed extending cuts into next year.     Kachikwu said that the rapid growth in shale supply is “not just a problem for OPEC, it’s a problem for the entire oil industry.”     “I don’t think it requires pressure. I think the oil companies would be the first to tell you that stability in the oil price is important to them,” he said. U.S. oil majors, however, cannot engage in supply restrictions to affect the price as the OPEC cartel does, and some ministers on Monday played down the idea that the growth of shale could not be handled.  Ecuador’s oil minister Carlos Perez noted that shale fields tend to have lower total oil recovery than conventional fields. “It has an impact but not the impact we expected. Recovery factors are still low, so right now (there is) no additional impact,” Perez said.

2018-03-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Colombia’s Ecopetrol SA will look for assets to buy this year, and bid in oil auctions in the United States and Latin America, after emerging from a period of deep budget cutbacks, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon told Reuters on Monday. Low crude oil prices had forced Ecopetrol and other oil companies in Latin America to tighten their belts in recent years, cutting exploration investment or delaying key projects, and severely hitting output and refining. Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol halted production at 12 oilfields as it reduced spending. But its operations started expanding again last year, when it reached a $2.2-billion net profit, the highest in the last four years. Last year “was a very good year for us. Analysts were expecting a lower profit,” Bayon said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. The company expects its oil and gas production to remain flat or to rise slightly this year to 725,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), under an investment budget of $4 billion almost completely focused on exploration and production. Part of that spending will go to projects aimed at replenishing the firm’s energy reserves, including a pilot program to explore unconventional resources at the Magdalena Medio basin, where Ecopetrol estimates there could be up to 7.4 billion barrels, more than triple Colombia’s proven reserves. Another part of the investment plan could go to bidding rounds in the U.S. Gulf, where it currently participates in two blocks, as well as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina, which plan oil and gas auctions this year. One of Ecopetrol’s main refineries - the recently expanded Cartagena - has increased crude processing to 154,000 barrels per day (bpd), while reducing the proportion of imported oil it needs to 30 percent versus 55 to 60 percent a year ago, Bayon said. The cost of Cartagena’s modernization doubled to $8 billion compared with the $4 billion originally planned, but it has made the company less dependent on imports while leaving a small fuel surplus for export. Ecopetrol is also reducing the volume of imported naphtha it needs to dilute its heavy crude output by making changes at its transportation system, according to Bayon. Using alternative transport has allowed it to avoid frequent declarations of force majeure on its crude exports when its Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline is attacked by rebels, which has happened 17 times this year alone. Bayon also said that tighter controls by the Colombian government at the Venezuelan border had cut gasoline imports, increasing the domestic need for gasoline and other fuels in about 20,000 bpd. Ecopetrol’s Barrancabermeja refinery, where workers recently went on strike due to a salary dispute, is expected to restart its cracking unit in seven to 10 days after completing maintenance work, he said.

2018-03-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-run oil company Pemex [PEMX.UL] plans to reach out to existing partners to form new joint ventures for a pair of deepwater blocks it won in a January auction, the company’s chief told Reuters on Monday. Pemex is running out of time to find partners for key oil and gas projects as the government looks to show progress from its energy agenda ahead of a July presidential election. The oil company is relying on foreign capital to reverse declining output and refining amid an ambitious energy reform.  Finding partners willing to take part in the ventures “has indeed taken more time than planned, but we are moving forward,” Pemex Director Carlos Trevino said in an interview with Reuters. The search for partners will start next year, after completing its exploration programs.  The company has streamlined its processes and bundling of assets to speed up the farmout process, which requires foreign companies to buy into existing Pemex projects.  “We have reduced internal approval times to 30 days and formed clusters of blocks to configure projects,” he said.  The company will start talks with oil companies, including Chevron Corp, Japan’s Inpex Corp and Australia’s BHP Billiton Ltd, which are its partners in other oil and gas projects, Trevino said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference.  Pemex also expects to find companies this year to invest in its Nobilis-Maximino and Ayin-Batsil projects in Mexico’s Gulf under more flexible terms, after failing to land partners for those developments in 2017.  Mexico blames the lack of interest in the projects on competition from Brazil’s offshore offerings, low oil prices and costs Pemex previously incurred that would be transferred to the partners. Pemex this year will offer eight onshore projects, including 29 oil blocks for partnerships in an auction that is expected to be decided in September-October. Trevino also said the company, whose reserves slightly declined in 2017, intends to participate in Mexico’s coming auction of unconventional blocks at the border with the United States. It would like to operate the blocks if it wins, but it could look for partners, he said.  Mexico enacted a wide-ranging reform in 2013-2014 to encourage foreign investment and end a multiyear slide in oil output. The reform ended Pemex’s 75-year monopoly over the energy sector, a key revenue generator for the government. Around 90 exploration and production contracts have been signed so far with companies including Chevron and Italy’s Eni SpA.

2018-03-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied on Monday and stocks across the globe also rose as investors saw tariff threats as a U.S. negotiating tactic and not a done deal, while concern ebbed over an inconclusive Italian election. Stocks rose after four days of declines, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 higher and Europe closing near session highs as pressure grew on U.S. President Donald Trump to back off from planned tariffs on steel and aluminum. “We have at least a bit of a rethink regarding the prospects of trade war,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York, of the midday swing to higher stock prices. He said the Trump administration “sees the stock market as a report card for success and markets have so far said this trade war is not a good idea.” Trump’s hard talk regarding steel and aluminum tariffs “sounds like we’re shifting back to posturing to get a better NAFTA deal,” Hogan added. Trump said on Monday that Canada and Mexico could avoid being caught in his planned hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if they ceded ground to Washington in trilateral talks on a new North American trade deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 336.7 points, or 1.37 percent, to 24,874.76, the S&P 500 gained 29.69 points, or 1.10 percent, to 2,720.94 and the Nasdaq Composite added 72.84 points, or 1 percent, to 7,330.71. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.64 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.34 percent, weighed lower overnight by Asia. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.99 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.66 percent, but U.S.-traded Nikkei futures rose more than 1 percent. The euro, which earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar, edged higher against most major peers, including the greenback. The common currency was whiplashed by weekend elections, as Germany’s Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, while results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government. Taken together, the election outcomes did not alter investors’ view on the strength of the euro zone economy, although the Italian results put political risks in the region back on the radar. “All in all, they are neutral to slightly positive for the euro,” said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index rose 0.09 percent, with the euro up 0.14 percent to $1.2334. The Japanese yen weakened 0.40 percent versus the greenback at 106.16 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3843, up 0.30 percent on the day. The Mexican peso gained 0.02 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.79 and the Canadian dollar was down 0.85 percent against the greenback at 1.30 per dollar. Crude prices rose on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity. U.S. crude rose 2.19 percent to $62.59 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.54, up 1.82 percent on the day. Treasury yields turned higher as stocks surged pointing to more risk tolerance in markets. “The bottom line is trade wars are not good… A trade war on steel and aluminum is going to help a small number of people and it’s going to hurt a lot more and drive up prices,” said Mary Ann Hurley, vice president, fixed income trading at D.A. Davidson in Seattle. Prices were also pressured by this week’s heavy supply led by an expected CVS deal for more than $40 billion to finance its purchase of Aetna. “There are thoughts there is going to be rate-lock selling. The supply on the corporate end is a factor that’s really hurting Treasuries,” Hurley said. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.8789 percent, from 2.857 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 12/32 in price to yield 3.1514 percent, from 3.132 percent late on Friday. Spot gold dropped 0.1 percent to $1,320.37 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.17 percent to $1,321.20 an ounce. Copper rose 0.39 percent to $6,925.00 a ton.

2018-03-05,"GAZA (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell is giving up its stake in an undeveloped natural gas field off the Gaza Strip, sending the Palestinians looking for a new foreign group to replace it, Palestinian officials said on Monday.     Cabinet ministers from the Palestinian Authority said in a statement they had been informed that the energy giant was pulling out of the project and were now in the process of “trying to attract a global company” to take its place. Shell had been struggling to find a buyer for its 55 percent stake in the Gaza Marine field, which it took over during its acquisition of BG Group in 2016. A Shell spokesman said: “We confirm we have been in discussions with various parties about the future of the Gaza Marine project. As of now, Shell continues to holds its equity in the Gaza Marine asset.” Gaza Marine, located about 30 km (20 miles) off the Gaza coast, has long been seen as a golden opportunity for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority to join the Mediterranean gas bonanza, providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid. Plans to develop the field - estimated to hold over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the equivalent of Spain’s consumption in 2016 - were put off several times over the past decade.  The delays were due to internal Palestinian rivalry and conflict with Israel, as well as economic reasons. With Shell’s exit, the Palestine Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund, remains the sole stakeholder. A Palestinian official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that once a potential buyer is located they will discuss options of how much control of the project could be acquired.

Judge Sergio Moro found Ferraz guilty of paying $868,450 to Petrobras’ ex-director of refining and supply, Paulo Roberto Costa, to renew at inflated prices contracts Decal do Brasil had with Petrobras to provide tanking and docking services at the Port of Suape in northeastern Brazil. Moro ruled that Ferraz could remain free on appeal. The office of Ferraz’s lawyer said they had no comment. Group Decal, an Italian company that set up Decal do Brasil together with Ferraz, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Decal do Brasil first signed contracts with Petrobras in 2006, according to prosecutors, and by 2012 had signed several other contracts worth a total of 423 million reais ($130.29 million). Ferraz was arrested in Brazil in late October 2016 but freed on 3 million reais bond about two weeks later. At the time of his arrest, Ferraz was also working at Swiss trading company Trafigura as a board member and the key executive for business development in Brazil and Africa. Trafigura was not a party to any contracts between Petrobras and Decal and had no business relationship with Decal. $1 = 3.2465 reais

2018-03-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Monday along with the U.S. stock market on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns that output from OPEC producers would grow at a much slower pace in coming years. Brent futures LCOc1 gained $1.17, or 1.8 percent, to settle at $65.54 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures CLc1 gained $1.32, or 2.2 percent, to settle at $62.57. Oil prices, which were flat earlier in the day, started rising along with U.S. stocks. The S&P 500 Index .SPX was up over 1 percent shortly before the close of trading. “Today’s spike in the equities was a large driver behind today’s (oil) price recovery,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Chicago-based energy advisory firm Ritterbusch & Associates, said in a report. Analysts also said prices were propped up by “bullish comments” from ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other global industry players at the CERAWeek conference in Houston, the largest energy conference, on Monday. Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London, said comments about “Venezuela’s deteriorating oil-production profile, together with prospects for strong compliance with the OPEC-led output-cut agreement, (were) supportive of oil prices.” Ecuador’s oil minister Carlos Perez said Venezuela’s oil production was running 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) short of its historic output. Speaking on the sidelines of the CERAWeek conference, he noted it was something that the country must address itself. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo and other OPEC officials are expected to hold a dinner on Monday with U.S. shale firms on the sidelines of the conference. Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the United Arab Emirates oil minister and OPEC’s current president, said on Sunday that the  cartel had not discussed rolling over production cuts next year. “We feel there is still market overhang,” Al Mazrouei said, adding “there are no talks about (extending cuts into 2019) at this stage.” OPEC and other major producers agreed to cut combined output by about 1.8 million bpd to drain a global oil glut. The agreement began in January 2017 and runs through the end of this year. Also on Monday, the International Energy Agency, which advises industrialized nations on energy policies, said it expected annual global oil demand growth to average a fairly robust 1.1 percent to 2023 and noted that OPEC would fail to significantly increase its production capacity. To meet growing demand, IEA said U.S. shale oil output was set to surge over the next five years, stealing market share from OPEC producers and moving the United States, once the world’s top oil importer, closer to self sufficiency.

Stocks rose after four days of declines, with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 higher and Europe closing near session highs as pressure grew on U.S. President Donald Trump to back off from planned tariffs on steel and aluminum. “We have at least a bit of a rethink regarding the prospects of trade war,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York, of the midday swing to higher stock prices. He said the Trump administration “sees the stock market as a report card for success and markets have so far said this trade war is not a good idea.” Trump’s hard talk regarding steel and aluminum tariffs “sounds like we’re shifting back to posturing to get a better NAFTA deal,” Hogan added. Trump said on Monday that Canada and Mexico could avoid being caught in his planned hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if they ceded ground to Washington in trilateral talks on a new North American trade deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 367.52 points, or 1.5 percent, to 24,905.58, the S&P 500 gained 32.15 points, or 1.19 percent, to 2,723.4 and the Nasdaq Composite added 81.30 points, or 1.12 percent, to 7,339.17. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.67 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.43 percent, weighed lower by Asia overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.03 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei lost 0.66 percent, but Nikkei futures rose nearly 1 percent. The euro, which earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar, edged higher against most major peers, including the greenback. The common currency was whiplashed by weekend elections, as Germany’s Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, while results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government. Taken together, the election outcomes did not alter investors’ view on the strength of the euro zone economy, although the Italian results put political risks in the region back on the radar. “All in all, they are neutral to slightly positive for the euro,” said Nick Bennenbroek, head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. The dollar index rose 0.16 percent, with the euro up 0.05 percent to $1.2323. The Japanese yen weakened 0.44 percent versus the greenback at 106.22 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3831, up 0.21 percent on the day. The Mexican peso lost 0.28 percent versus the U.S. dollar at 18.85 and the Canadian dollar was down 0.88 percent against the greenback at 1.30 per dollar. Crude prices rose on forecasts for robust oil demand growth and concerns OPEC will not be able to increase its production capacity. U.S. crude rose 2.27 percent to $62.64 per barrel and Brent was last at $65.60, up 1.91 percent on the day. Treasury yields turned higher as stocks surged pointing to more risk tolerance in markets.

2018-03-05,"TORONTO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is exploring options including the sale of a minority stake in its Canadian liquefied natural gas (LNG) project as it pushes ahead, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Among the parties in talks with Chevron for a possible stake in Kitimat LNG are Petroliam Nasional Bhd [PETR.UL], or Petronas, which scrapped its own $36 billion LNG project in British Columbia last year due to challenging market conditions, two of the people said.  Reuters spoke over the past week to the sources, who said there is no certainty that Chevron would proceed with the stake sale. The persons spoke on condition of anonymity because the process is private. Chevron declined to comment, and Petronas did not respond to a request for comment. Chevron is also considering selling a stake in the project to a financial investor such as a Canadian pension fund or a private equity firm, the people added. Canadian companies Seven Generations Energy Ltd (VII.TO) and Tourmaline Oil Corp (TOU.TO) are in discussions to supply natural gas to Chevron’s project, the people said. Seven Generations may also consider buying a stake in the project by partnering with other gas producers, the people said. While any possible deal with a financial investor would be strictly a cash infusion to help support the cost of building the project, a deal with a producer could be structured as a commitment to supply natural gas to the plant for a period of 20 to 25 years, the people said. Canadian pension funds have a huge appetite for infrastructure-style assets that offer stable cash flows over a long period, and pipeline investments tend to have those attributes. The project in British Columbia, a 50/50 joint venture with Australia’s Woodside Petroleum Ltd (WPL.AX), has a 20-year, 10 million-metric-tonne-per-year export license for LNG and is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars to build. Kitimat could become one of the largest capital investments in a Canadian energy project, Chevron says on its website. Taking such a substantial investment decision has been difficult for the duo, given concerns over a global LNG supply glut for the last three years. Fierce political opposition in Western Canada to building pipelines and other energy infrastructure has also escalated in the last several years. However, surging gas demand from China and Southeast Asia is reassuring export project developers that the market cycle is finally beginning to turn. Seven Generations declined to comment, and Tourmaline did not respond to a request for comment. Located about 1,400 kilometers north of Vancouver, the Kitimat project was earmarked to utilize shale gas extracted in the northern part of British Columbia and export LNG to energy-hungry markets in Asia. San Ramon, California-based Chevron acquired its 50 percent stake in Kitimat in early 2013 from EOG Resources Inc (EOG.N) and Encana Corp (ECA.TO).

2018-03-05,"* Ecopetrol to start pilot project for unconventional reserves * Output to remain flat or rise in 2018 (Adds quotes, context, details) By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - Colombia’s Ecopetrol will go hunting for assets to buy this year, and bid in oil auctions in the United States and Latin America, after emerging from a period of deep budget cutbacks, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon told Reuters on Monday. Low crude oil prices had forced Ecopetrol and other oil companies in Latin America to tighten their belts in recent years, cutting exploration investment or delaying key projects, and severely hitting output and refining. Colombia’s state-run Ecopetrol halted production at 12 oilfields as it reduced spending. Last week, it reported a net profit of $2.2 billion in 2017, the highest in the last four years. Last year “was a very good year for us. Analysts were expecting a lower profit,” Bayon said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. The company expects its oil and gas production to remain flat or to rise slightly this year to 725,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), under an investment budget of $4 billion almost completely focused on exploration and production. Part of that spending will go to projects aimed at replenishing the firm’s energy reserves, including a pilot program to explore unconventional resources at the Magdalena Medio basin, where Ecopetrol estimates there could be up to 7.4 billion barrels, more than triple Colombia’s proven reserves. Ecopetrol last year was part of a team that won an offshore block in the Gulf of Mexico. Latin American countries holding oil auctions this year include Ecuador, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina. Ecopetrol’s main refinery - the recently expanded Cartagena - has increased crude processing to 154,000 barrels per day, while reducing the proportion of imported crude it needs to 30 percent versus 55 to 60 percent a year ago, Bayon said. The cost of Cartagena’s modernization doubled to $8 billion compared with the $4 billion originally planned, but it has made the company less dependent on imports while leaving a small fuel surplus for export. Ecopetrol is also reducing the volume of imported naphtha it needs to dilute its heavy crude output by making changes at its transportation system, according to Bayon. Using alternative transport has allowed it to avoid problems at the closed Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which has been the target of frequent rebel attacks. Bayon also said that tighter controls by the Colombian government at the Venezuelan border had cut illegal gasoline imports, increasing the domestic need for gasoline and other fuels. Ecopetrol’s Barrancabermeja refinery, where workers recently went on strike due to a salary dispute, is expected to restart in seven to 10 days after completing maintenance work, he said.

Staunchly anti-nuclear Austria, which shares a border with Hungary, has said it would file a suit against the EU executive with Europe’s top court. “We are going to actively support Austria’s claim,” Luxemburg’s environment minister Carole Dieschbourg told reporters in Brussels.  “It is important that no public funds be invested in nuclear power. It is definitely the wrong way.”  Hungary’s plan to build two new reactors at its Paks nuclear site with the help of Russia’s Rosatom had been approved by EU state aid regulators in March. The regulators said that Hungarian authorities had agreed to several measures to ensure fair competition. The European Commission has said it will defend its decision in court.

2018-03-05,"SAO PAULO, March 5 (Reuters) - Brazil’s ethanol demand reached 1.37 billion liters in January, 55 percent more than in the same month a year earlier, cane industry group Unica said on Monday, as car owners switched from gasoline to the biofuel due to a large price difference at the pump. The Unica report, based on data from oil and fuels regulator ANP, showed that ethanol consumption was the largest for any January. Strong ethanol demand and low international sugar prices are expected to prompt mills to produce as much of the biofuel as possible in the new crushing season officially starting in April. That would result in falling sugar output, with most analysts expecting a reduction of around 4 million or 5 million tonnes in the center-south. The global sugar market has a large surplus. The current price difference between gasoline and ethanol is among the largest on record, Unica said, with some places in Brazil showing a gap as large as 1.21 real per liter ($1.4 per gallon). Almost all of Brazil’s cars can run on either fuel.

2018-03-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Burst water mains caused by a thaw in Britain’s freezing temperatures closed a Jaguar Land Rover car plant in central England on Monday and left tens of thousands of people without water.  London’s mayor Sadiq Khan said it was “unacceptable” that thousands across the British capital had no water, as utility companies struggled to maintain water supplies. The worst snowstorms in Britain for nearly 30 years froze water in pipes last week, water suppliers said, during a blast of Siberian cold dubbed “the Beast from the East” which ground planes, stopped trains, blocked roads and shut schools. Carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) halted production at its Solihull car plant near Birmingham, as water firm Severn Trent said it was targeting its supplies to keep schools and hospitals in central England open. “Due to a water shortage caused by a burst water main, we have had to stop production this afternoon,” a spokeswoman for JLR said. Severn Trent said that it was working with other big businesses in the area on limiting water consumption. Production at Mondelez-owned chocolate company Cadbury’s Bournville plant was also halted, the BBC said. At least 23,800 households, including 12,000 households in London, were left without water when pipes burst after temperatures rose and snow thawed, prompting suppliers to advise customers not to waste water. “It is unacceptable that thousands of Londoners remain without water this morning,” Khan said on Twitter. “I have sought assurances from Thames Water that they are doing everything possible to fix the problems and get the supply switched back on for everyone.” At a supermarket in Balham, south London, Thames Water employees distributed crates of bottled water to a waiting queue of people, while in Hampstead to the north of the capital, they ferried crates to residential streets in their own cars. Suppliers warned disruption would continue as they worked to fix leaks and refill pipes and Thames Water advised its 15 million customers to cut their usage.  “Where possible, take short showers rather than baths, do not leave taps running unnecessarily and only run washing machines and dish washers when you have a full load,” the company said in a statement on its website.  Severn Trent, a supplier of water to 4.3 million homes and businesses in the middle of England, said the number of burst pipes was up 4000 percent, while in Wales, Welsh Water said “unprecedented challenges” had affected 4,500 homes.     Farther north, Scottish Water said there was no significant impact on its customers because Scotland had not suffered the same rapid thaw.

2018-03-05,"TEHRAN (Reuters) - France’s foreign minister visited Iran on Monday on a delicate mission to reaffirm Europe’s support for a nuclear deal that opened Iran’s economy, while echoing U.S. concern about Tehran’s missile programme and role in regional conflicts. Jean-Yves Le Drian’s visit reflected French efforts to safeguard Iran’s 2015 accord with major powers. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out unless three European signatories help “fix” the deal by forcing Iran to limit its sway in the Middle East and rein in its missile programme.  Iran’s clerical rulers believe that even if it were to do so, as called for by Western leaders, the United States is bent on “regime change” in the Islamic Republic and therefore any concessions would be futile.  After a day of tough talks with senior Iranian officials, who all repeated that Tehran would not bow to Western pressure to scrap its ballistic missile tests, Le Drian said there remained “much work to do” with Iran.  “We’re not going to be Donald Trump’s envoys or Iran’s defence lawyers,” said a French diplomatic source. “We have our own concerns and will talk to the different sensibilities of the Iranian system to get our point across.” Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps, which answers only to its ultimate political authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, runs the missile programme. “Our missile work is... in line with our defensive policy, which poses no threat to any country,” the secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, Ali Shamkhani, told Le Drian, according to state TV. To send a message to France, Iranian media said, Shamkhani appeared in military uniform in his meeting with Le Drian.     Earlier, the semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted an Iranian armed forces spokesman as saying Iran’s missile development would “continue non-stop and foreign powers have no right to intervene on this issue”. Hardline Iranian media reacted angrily to Le Drian’s visit with headlines like “The Rude Guest” and “Weapons of mass seduction”. Fars news agency said a group of hardliners gathered at Tehran’s International Mehrabad Airport and in front of Iran’s Foreign Ministry to protest at Le Drian’s visit.  The deal with France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the United States gave Iran relief from economic sanctions in return for curbs on its disputed nuclear activity, allowing Tehran to talk trade with Europe for the first time in years. But so far the deal, pragmatist President Hassan Rouhani’s headline achievement, has yet to deliver the economic benefits many Iranians yearn for. That has impeded efforts by Rouhani efforts to engage with the West, an approach opposed by hardline allies of Khamenei in the clerical and security establishment. France has been quick to restore trade ties. Planemaker Airbus, oil major Total and automobile manufacturers Peugeot and Renault have signed deals, all at risk if Trump walks out of the accord. In an effort to keep him on board, French President Emmanuel Macron has criticised Iran’s missile programme and raised the possibility of new sanctions. On the eve of Le Drian’s visit, Macron told Rouhani by phone that France expects Iran to make a “constructive contribution” to solving crises in the region. Tehran supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels, including groups backed by the West, and also backs Israel’s enemy Hezbollah in Lebanon. “France will continue discussions with Iran...but must find a way to restore stability in the region,” Le Drian told reporters, adding that Iranian leaders voiced extreme concern over Syria’s humanitarian disaster after seven years of war.  Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Le Drian that the European signatories of the nuclear deal “should play a more active role to keep the accord alive. “Supporting the accord verbally is not enough ... If the EU is trying to salvage the accord..., they should try to keep Iran, not the U.S., in the accord,” he said, state TV reported.  Le Drian also met with Rouhani, who told the French minister that Tehran would not be the first to violate the nuclear accord, according to state television. U.N. nuclear inspectors have repeatedly verified Iranian compliance with the agreement.  France says Iran has been committed to the terms of the deal, but argues that Tehran may be violating part of the U.N. resolution enshrining the accord. The resolution calls on Tehran to refrain from work on missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads, although this is not in the accord itself. “On the ballistics, the Iranian programme is not compatible with (the resolution) and we have a particular concern on the transfer of know-how of ballistic capacity to regional actors, and by that we mean Hezbollah,” the diplomatic source said. In a warning to Trump, the head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency in Vienna on Monday that a collapse of the nuclear deal would be a “great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism”.

Trump said on Monday that Canada and Mexico could avoid being caught in his planned hefty tariffs on steel and aluminum imports if they ceded ground to Washington in trilateral talks on a new North American trade deal. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 191.66 points, or 0.78 percent, to 24,729.72, the S&P 500 gained 21.58 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,712.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.00 points, or 0.79 percent, to 7,314.87.

The euro, which earlier fell as much as 0.4 percent versus the U.S. dollar, edged higher against most major peers, including the greenback. The common currency was whiplashed by weekend elections, as Germany’s Social Democrats voted to re-enter a grand coalition with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, while results from Italy pointed to a messier outcome than expected - a strong showing for anti-establishment parties and no group able to form a stable government.

2018-03-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia expects to sign agreements with Britain covering a range of issues during Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s visit to London this week, Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Monday. Britain’s planned exit from the European Union did not reduce its attractiveness as an investment destination, the minister told reporters, and he said he expected the crown prince’s visit to take bilateral relations to a higher level. “Our relationship is so strong that the talks will be broad and wide ranging. There will be agreements and memorandums of understanding signed in a number of areas involving a broad range of issues,” he said during a media briefing at the Saudi embassy. Al-Jubeir provided no further details on the agreements nor on the precise agenda for the crown prince’s visit. He declined to comment on any progress in plans to list giant oil firm Saudi Aramco and whether that might happen in London or New York. Asked whether Britain’s departure from the EU, scheduled for March 2019, would affect Riyadh’s view of how attractive Britain is as an investment destination, al-Jubeir said: “We don’t think so. We think that Britain is one of the great powers.  “British ingenuity and British technology and British know-how is not going to change whether you’re part of the EU or not part of the EU.” Asked about potential protests during the visit over issues such as the conflict in Yemen, British arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the kingdom’s human rights record, al-Jubeir said his country should not be the target of demonstrations. “We are moving our country forward, we are trying to stabilise our region, we are working for peace and security. People should be protesting in support, not in opposition,” he said.

2018-03-05,"HOUSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil output is set to surge over the next five years, stealing market share from OPEC producers and moving the United States, once the world’s top oil importer, closer to self sufficiency, the International Energy Agency said on Monday. A landmark deal in 2017 between OPEC and rivals including Russia to curb output to reduce global oversupply improved the outlook for other producers as prices rose sharply throughout the year, the IEA said in Oil 2018, an annual report looking at the next five years. With U.S. supply surging, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will see demand for its crude fall below current production in 2019 and 2020, the report forecast, suggesting a return to oversupply if OPEC output keeps steady. U.S. oil output hit a record late last year, and is expected to rise by 2.7 million barrels per day (bpd) to 12.1 million bpd by 2023, as growth from shale fields more than offsets declines in conventional supply.  Last year, the IEA forecast U.S. shale production to grow by 1.4 million bpd by 2022 with oil prices of up to $60 a barrel and by up to 3 million barrels with oil at $80 a barrel. Natural gas liquids will add another 1 million bpd to U.S. supply to reach 4.7 million bpd by 2023.  “The United States is set to put its stamp on global oil markets for the next five years,” said Fatih Birol, the IEA’s executive director, in a statement.  Birol, speaking at a media briefing at the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston, said U.S. output forecasts could be revised upward if oil remains above $60 a barrel. He said he expects shale output to keep rising, regardless of OPEC policies, and said OPEC and other established oil producers need to reconsider their future growth plans in light of “huge growth” from U.S. shale. He also said he expects U.S. export capacity to double over the next five years.  With total U.S. liquids production set to reach nearly 17 million bpd in 2023, up from 13.2 million in 2017, the United States will be by far the world’s top oil liquids producer. Oil production growth from the United States, Brazil, Canada and Norway will more than meet global oil demand growth through 2020, the IEA said, adding that more investment would be needed to boost output after that. Non-OPEC production is set to rise by 5.2 million bpd by 2023 to 63.3 million bpd with the United States alone accounting for nearly 60 percent of global supply growth.  Production in 2017 rose by 670,000 bpd as drillers added 200 rigs, “beating all expectations”, the IEA said. Output from OPEC producers will grow at a much slower pace, the IEA said, adding it expected Venezuelan production declines to accelerate, offsetting gains in Iraq. Birol said Venezuela’s production outlook may need to be cut in coming years as well. As a result, OPEC’s crude oil capacity will grow by just 750,000 bpd by 2023, the IEA said. With shale and other non-OPEC supply rising, demand for OPEC crude plus withdrawals from inventories will average 31.8 million bpd in 2019, the IEA said, 1.8 million bpd less than its last medium-term forecast.  This is lower than demand of 32.3 million bpd expected in 2018 and below the IEA’s latest estimate of OPEC’s production of 32.16 million bpd. With forecast capacity of 36.3 million bpd, OPEC will be supplying less than 35 percent of global demand by 2023 compared to its historic share around 40 percent. Boosted by economic growth in Asia and a resurgent U.S. petrochemicals industry, global oil demand will increase by 6.9 million bpd by 2023 to 104.7 million, according to the IEA.  Despite steep non-OPEC oil production gains, the IEA warned that a decline in mature fields meant more investment was needed across the globe after 2020. “Upstream investment shows little sign of recovering from its plunge in 2015-2016, which raises concerns about whether adequate supply will be available to offset natural field declines and meet robust demand growth after 2020,” it said.

2018-03-05,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France called on other EU nations to adopt a regional carbon price floor for power generators to promote a shift away from coal to more climate-friendly fuels. At a conference hosted by France on Monday to debate the issue, French ecology minister Brune Poirson called for a price floor of from 25 to 30 euros per ton in power generation to help accelerate the shift from coal to gas and renewables. Power generation accounts for about a fifth of the bloc’s total emissions.  “The prices are often too weak to push real changes in behavior and yet this is what we need if we are going to accelerate the fight against climate change,” Poirson said. The conference in Brussels brought together officials from France, Germany, Britain, Finland, the Netherlands and Sweden to discuss how to send a strong market signal toward meeting the bloc’s goals of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent by 2030. Carbon prices under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS), which charges more than 11,000 companies for each ton of carbon dioxide they emit, have suffered from a glut of permits, prompting reforms agreed this year. Benchmark prices in the EU’s cap-and-trade system hit 10.32 euros/ton on Monday. Analysts expect prices to continue rising as measures designed to curb supply from 2019 get closer. “It’s true we have reformed the European trading scheme but with the expected price levels for emission permits, coal will remain the most competitive fossil fuel for years to come,” Poirson said. Such a regional initiative could bring additional emission reductions, revenues for national budgets and reduce the need to subsidize renewables, she argued.  Traders, however, said there is little expectation a Europe-wide floor price would ever materialize in the EU’s trading system. “It’s really not realistic,” one carbon trader said. “And I don’t see what the point would be. They’ve just passed very ambitious market reforms which will lead to higher prices.” Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel @AdeCar; Additional reporting by Susanna Twidale in London; Editing by Susan Fenton",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-carbon/france-calls-on-eu-nations-to-adopt-carbon-price-floor-idUKL5N1QN3NO,05 Mar 2018,"France called on other EU

2018-03-05,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Total (TOTF.PA) and Repsol (REP.MC) are among members of two consortia that have submitted bids to explore for oil and gas off Greece. Greece’s oil and gas resources management company (HHRM) said on Monday that Exxon and Total, each with 40 percent stakes, and Hellenic Petroleum had jointly bid to explore off Crete, while Spain’s Repsol and Hellenic Petroleum had submitted a joint bid for a block in the Ionian Sea. Greece launched the tenders last year after expressions of interest by the Exxon-led consortium for the two sites off Crete and by Greece’s Energean for the Ionian block, although Energean has since withdrawn. HHRM said it would quickly evaluate the offers, while the final approval lies with the Energy Ministry. Encouraged by large gas finds in the eastern Mediterranean, Greece is eager to attract investment in its energy sector as it tries to emerge from years of economic crisis. Energy Minister George Stathakis said the interest shown by major oil exploration companies in the tenders was “a vote of confidence in the prospects of the Greek economy and the country’s role as a stabilizing factor in the southeast Mediterranean region.” Western Greece is an underexplored area and very little data exists on its hydrocarbon potential. HHRM has described the areas off Crete as “high risk-high reward.” Exxon and Total are currently exploring off Cyprus.   Hellenic plans the first test drilling in the Patraikos Gulf off the Peloponnese peninsula in 2019. It has also been awarded licences for another two onshore blocks in western Greece.

2018-03-05,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Two of Libya’s largest oilfields with combined production of nearly 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) have suffered shutdowns in quick succession, casting fresh doubt on a partial recovery in the OPEC member’s oil output. Libya’s national output has been sustained at about one million bpd for months, and most recent closures have been quickly resolved. A shutdown that began on Sunday at El Sharara, Libya’s biggest field, lasted less than 24 hours. (For a graphic on Libya's oil facilities click tmsnrt.rs/2b9ZdLO)  But the latest disruptions - caused by guards at El Feel field complaining about pay and benefits, and by a property owner who said he wanted rubbish cleared from his land - highlight continuing risks to output in a country without centralized security forces or political control.  Libya has the largest proven reserves of oil in Africa, and has been a key supplier of light, sweet crude to Europe.   Around 1970 it produced more than 3 million bpd, and before the NATO-backed uprising in which Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed seven years ago, it was pumping more than 1.6 million bpd. Last year the state-owned National Oil Corporation (NOC) outlined plans that would raise production to 2.2 million bpd by 2023, but said this would need around $18 billion of investment. Foreign oil companies including Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), Total (TOTF.PA) of France and U.S. firms ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess (HES.N) have production stakes through joint ventures with the NOC. Since Libya’s 2011 uprising, power in the sparsely populated nation has fragmented and local groups have used oil facilities as bargaining chips to press financial and political demands. Armed factions across the country have cut off production at key fields and ports, including a long blockade of terminals in Libya’s eastern oil crescent from 2014-2016. Prolonged and haphazard shutdowns have reduced pressure at oil wells. As Libya’s revenue fell due to production disruptions and lower oil prices, demands for salaries, local development and jobs that feed into blockades became more widespread. Islamic State militants attacked oilfields and ports in 2015-2016 before being driven back by local forces. Their destruction of storage tanks at two of Libya’s biggest terminals, Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, has yet to be repaired. Fields including Mabruk and Ghani remain closed.     After disputed elections in 2014 led to rival governments being set up in Tripoli and the east, eastern-based factions tried to sell oil independently. They failed, but the split added to uncertainty in Libya’s oil sector. The causes of recent shutdowns include economic protests by guards, armed groups pushing for the release of jailed members, and apparent political maneuvering in the east. Sometimes shutdowns are triggered in remote fields or at terminals, sometimes by people with access to gearboxes that control pipeline valves. Production at the key Sharara field has repeatedly been cut on the long pipeline leading to the coast by groups near Zintan, a western town that became militarily powerful in the 2011 uprising. The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, which lacks authority over armed groups even in the capital, often has little means of ending blockades.   Oil installations are meant to be protected by the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG). But as with other parts of Libya’s security forces, their official status is effectively self-declared and their actions are governed by local interests rather than any central authority. Even as longer blockades ended from mid-2016, financial constraints have been an underlying drag on Libya’s production rebound. The NOC has had rocky relations with the GNA, and has complained repeatedly that budget allocations have been held up. The GNA says its own resources are limited.  A bigger political risk also looms. Factions in the east, where most of Libya’s oil wealth is located, are opposed to the GNA and say it has not disbursed sufficient oil income to eastern regions. Some eastern hardliners have threatened to cut oil production although for now the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which has good relations with the NOC in Tripoli, has kept fields and ports open.  Security is still volatile. In December an explosion at a pipeline in eastern Libya caused an outage of up to 100,000 bpd, though it was quickly repaired. International companies are working offshore but still have a limited presence onshore, keeping exploration and development programs mostly on hold.  Along with Nigeria, Libya has been exempted from OPEC-led production cuts that seek to bolster crude prices and have been extended until the end of 2018. Despite speculation that the two troubled nations would be pressured into joining the output-curbing deal, both have signaled their intention to raise production.

2018-03-05,"TEHRAN (Reuters) - After a day of tough talking in Tehran on Monday, France’s foreign minister and one of Iran’s vice presidents ambled through the halls of the National Museum of Iran to admire a collection of artworks on loan from the Louvre in Paris. Relations between Iran and France have grown fraught of late, rattled by the uncertain future of the Iran nuclear accord and French concerns over Tehran’s ballistic missile tests and military activities in the Middle East.     But President Emmanuel Macron’s government hopes the soft power of cultural diplomacy can help strengthen bilateral ties. “In the turbulent ocean of international diplomacy, cultural diplomacy is a beacon we must keep alight,” French Foreign Minister Yves Le Drian told a large audience at an event sponsored by French oil giant Total.  A French diplomat was more blunt: “Whatever disagreements we may have with Iran we want to keep and develop a cultural relationship with Iranian society.”  The Louvre exhibition in Tehran is the first by a major Western cultural institution and was agreed upon during a visit to Paris by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2016, when Francois Hollande was France’s leader. In a statement, the Louvre said its international strategy was directly influenced by French diplomatic priorities.     The four-month exhibition will display some 50 works from the Louvre, including a sphinx statue and other artefacts linked to Greek, Egyptian and Mesopotamian culture, as well as objects from ancient Iran. France has historically had a less fractious relationship with Iran than either Britain or the United States. While Britain explored for Iranian oil in the 20th century, France undertook archaeological digs. “I think our archaeological past in Iran has at least left a positive imprint,” the French diplomat said.  In an ironic twist, the Louvre in late 2017 opened its first overseas branch in Abu Dhabi, capital of the United Arab Emirates which accuses Iran of destabilising the Middle East and has broken off diplomatic relations.  The future of Iran’s nuclear deal with world powers is shrouded in doubt after U.S. President Donald Trump pronounced it “flawed” and gave Europeans until May 12 to fix it.   Le Drian on Monday delivered a message to Tehran that Europe wanted to keep alive the accord that eased economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, while echoing U.S. concerns about Iran’s missile programme and role in regional wars.  The brick building of the National Museum of Iran, which opened in 1937, was designed by two French architects influenced by Iran’s Sassanian heritage.

2018-03-05,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil production is running 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) short of its historic output but it is something that the country must address itself, Ecuador oil minister Carlos Perez said on Monday. The South American country should address the shortfall on its own, he said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference, adding: “It is up to (Venezuela) to decide what to do.”  The United Arab Emirates oil minister said on Sunday that OPEC last year discussed member Venezuela’s falling production and offered technical aid to help restore the South American country’s output.  Venezuela’s oil production fell 13 percent in 2017 to a 28-year low of about 2.072 million bpd.  OPEC believes Venezuela will be able to rebuild its production, UAE oil minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei said.     Ecuador’s Perez also downplayed the impact of U.S. shale production on global crude markets, noting that shale fields tend to have lower total oil recovery than conventional fields.  “It has an impact but not the impact we expected. Recovery factors are still low, so right now (there is) no additional impact,” Perez said.  Ecuador’s 110,000-barrel-per-day Esmeraldas oil refinery is operating at top capacity, he said, and will undergo maintenance shutdowns this month for 15 days and again in May for 54 days. He did not specify the shutdown dates. Perez also said the country’s coming auction of oil and gas blocks will be launched on March 13, and about 40 companies have signed up to bid on minor fields recently included in the offer.  “Expectations are high,” he said.

2018-03-05,"(Adds details, comments on U.S. shale output) HOUSTON, March 5 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil production is running 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) short of its historic output but it is something that the country must address itself, Ecuador oil minister Carlos Perez said on Monday. The South American country should address the shortfall on its own, he said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference, adding: “It is up to (Venezuela) to decide what to do.” The United Arab Emirates oil minister said on Sunday that OPEC last year discussed member Venezuela’s falling production and offered technical aid to help restore the South American country’s output. Venezuela’s oil production fell 13 percent in 2017 to a 28-year low of about 2.072 million bpd. OPEC believes Venezuela will be able to rebuild its production, UAE oil minister Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei said. Ecuador’s Perez also downplayed the impact of U.S. shale production on global crude markets, noting that shale fields tend to have lower total oil recovery than conventional fields. “It has an impact but not the impact we expected. Recovery factors are still low, so right now (there is) no additional impact,” Perez said.

2018-03-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s efforts to attract the stock market listing of oil firm Saudi Aramco could cost London its reputation for good corporate governance, the head of an influential committee said on Monday ahead of a visit by the Saudi crown prince. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, heir apparent to the Saudi throne, will spend three days in London this week as part of a tour designed to reassure allies about his domestic reforms, and ease investor concerns about a corruption crackdown. The overseas trip, Crown Prince Mohammed’s first since he in effect took over the day-to-day running of the country last year, will be followed by talks in the United States, making it the latest staging ground for an international tug of war over the Aramco public offering. Both Britain and the United States are keen to secure the listing, which could be the largest ever. Britain’s financial regulators are considering a relaxation of rules that would allow sovereign-controlled companies like Aramco to list on the stock market in London. But that move has prompted concern among some in Britain’s parliament. “The UK currently has strict corporate governance rules and it’s vital that they aren’t watered down to secure the listing of Saudi Aramco, sending a message which risks our reputation and which may ultimately damage our attractiveness to foreign investment,” said Rachel Reeves, chair of the influential Business Energy and Industrial Strategy committee. Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokesman did not immediately have a comment when asked about the type of concerns raised by Reeves.  Crown Prince Mohammed is not due to meet financial regulators during his visit, but the topic is likely to feature in talks with May, who has previously said the London Stock Exchange has made a strong case to host the listing. Reeves, a member of the opposition Labour Party, also questioned the value of winning the listing to the wider British economy outside the City of London financial district. “The City and highly-remunerated advisors may stand to benefit from the LSE landing Saudi Aramco but what does this potential listing offer in terms of investment or jobs in the UK?” she said.

2018-03-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Strong global demand for oil and gas will shift in the next five years toward petrochemicals and away from motor fuels gasoline and diesel, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday.      Demand for products ranging from fertilisers to plastics and beauty products will drive roughly a quarter of the expected oil demand growth to 2023, the IEA said in its five-year outlook. The shift represents a major challenge to the oil industry, as many of the petrochemicals will be produced using gas, cutting out refineries. At the same time, growth in gasoline and diesel usage will be held back by fuel efficiency improvements and declining consumption in the developed world, the IEA said.  World oil demand is expected to rise by 6.9 million barrels per day (bpd) to 2023, it said, with a quarter of this growth, or 1.7 million bpd, coming from demand for petrochemical feedstocks ethane and naphtha.  “Global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services,” the IEA said. “A large group of chemicals derived from oil and natural gas are crucial to the manufacture of many products that satisfy this rising demand,” it added. Naphtha is made by oil refineries processing crude, but other petrochemical feedstocks - ethane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - are processed outside traditional oil refineries.  “Ethane, liquefied petroleum gases and naphtha, pose a bigger threat to the refiners’ market share than electric vehicles and gas-powered transportation combined,” the IEA said, estimating refiners would see just 4.8 million bpd of the demand growth to 2023, missing out on 30 percent of it.   The boom in U.S. shale oil has dramatically expanded the availability of ethane, and a string of new projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast are underway to process it. In total, the world is expected to add 1.4 million bpd in new petrochemical-producing steam crackers to 2023, the IEA said.  Demand for ethane will expand at the fastest pace in the next five years, rising by 885,000 bpd, followed by naphtha with growth of 495,000 bpd and LPG with growth of 40,000 bpd, it forecast.  Jet fuel, supported by growing demand for air travel, will grow by 1.2 percent to 2023, the IEA added. But it said demand for gasoline and diesel would rise by just 0.7 percent each, with expansion slowed by fuel efficiency standards that now cover two thirds of the world’s top car markets. More than 80 percent of global car sales are now in markets covered by efficiency standards, including China, India the United States and Europe. The IEA said this “will impact strongly on future oil demand.” Partially as a result, the IEA warned that refinery additions totaling 7.7 million bpd would outstrip growth in demand for refined products by 2023 by some 3 million bpd.  “The gap between refinery capacity growth and refined product demand growth has never been so large in recent history,” the IEA said.

2018-03-05,"GAZA, March 5 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell has given up its stake in an undeveloped natural gas field off the Gaza Strip, sending the Palestinians looking for a new foreign group to replace it, Palestinian officials said on Monday. Cabinet ministers from the Palestinian Authority said in a statement they had been informed that the energy giant was pulling out of the project and were now in the process of “trying to attract a global company” to take its place. Shell had been struggling to find a buyer for its 55 percent stake in the Gaza Marine field, which it took over during its acquisition of BG Group in 2016. The company did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Gaza Marine, located about 30 km (20 miles) off the Gaza coast, has long been seen as a golden opportunity for the cash-strapped Palestinian Authority to join the Mediterranean gas bonanza, providing a major source of income to reduce its reliance on foreign aid. Plans to develop the field - estimated to hold over 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, the equivalent of Spain’s consumption in 2016 - were put off several times over the past decade. The delays were due to internal Palestinian rivalry and conflict with Israel, as well as economic reasons. With Shell’s exit, the Palestine Investment Fund, a sovereign wealth fund, remains the sole stakeholder. A Palestinian official familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that once a potential buyer is located they will discuss options of how much control of the project could be acquired.

2018-03-05,"VIENNA (Reuters) - A collapse of the Iran nuclear deal would be a “great loss”, the U.N. atomic watchdog’s chief warned U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, giving a wide-ranging defence of the accord and his agency’s work under it. Trump has threatened to withdraw the United States from the accord between Tehran and six world powers, signed in 2015 before he took office, unless Congress and European allies help “fix” it with a follow-up pact. Trump does not like the deal’s limited duration, among other things. Iran has stayed within the deal’s restrictions since Trump took office but has fired diplomatic warning shots at Washington in recent weeks. It said on Monday that it could rapidly enrich uranium to a higher degree of purity if the deal collapsed. “If the JCPOA were to fail, it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism,” International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) chief Yukiya Amano said in a speech to his agency’s 35-nation Board of Governors, using the deal’s official name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Amano, whose agency polices the deal’s nuclear restrictions, later gave his most wide-ranging defence of the accord to date, listing numbers of buildings inspected, images captured and even seals placed on equipment since the accord was put into effect. “The IAEA now has the world’s most robust verification regime in place in Iran. We have had access to all locations that we needed to visit,” the veteran Japanese diplomat told a news conference after his speech. Amano declined to comment on the position of the United States or any other country, but his remarks were clearly a response to Trump’s threat to scupper the accord, which also lifted painful economic sanctions against Iran. “We have carried out more than 60 complementary accesses and visited more than 190 buildings since JCPOA Implementation Day,” he said, referring to a specific type of inspection under the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, which Iran is implementing under the deal. Washington is telling European allies it wants a follow-on agreement that “ensures strong IAEA inspections”, according to a State Department cable obtained by Reuters last month. That suggests that, from Washington’s standpoint, there is something deficient about the current inspection system. Trump and his ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, have made similar comments. But diplomats familiar with the IAEA’s thinking have said the Trump administration’s view arises from a poor understanding of how the IAEA does its work in Iran.  Iran said on Monday it could produce higher enriched uranium within two days if it were no longer bound by the deal.  “If America pulls out of the deal ... Iran could resume its 20 percent uranium enrichment in less than 48 hours,” Behrouz Kamalvandi, spokesman for the Atomic Energy Organisation of Iran, told state-run Arabic language al-Alam TV. Iran is not allowed to enrich uranium beyond 3.67 percent fissile purity under the deal, a level that is suitable for fuelling some civilian nuclear power stations and far short of the 80-90 percent that is considered weapons grade. Kamalvandi, reiterating Tehran’s official stance, said the nuclear deal is not re-negotiable. The other countries that signed the deal - Germany, Britain, France, Russia and China - are committed to preserving it. As mentioned in a quarterly IAEA report on Iran last month, Amano said in his speech that the agency had requested clarification from Iran about its plans for nuclear-powered naval vessels, suggesting the IAEA has still not heard back from the Islamic Republic.  Iran has long said publicly that it intends to develop nuclear propulsion for naval vessels, though analysts and diplomats say that remains a distant prospect. It formally notified the IAEA of that intention in January in what was widely seen as a rebuff to pressure from Trump.

2018-03-05,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Activists accused South Sudan’s government on Monday of funnelling cash from the state oil company to militias responsible for atrocities and attacks on civilians. South Sudan dismissed the report by The Sentry, a group co-founded by actor George Clooney. “The oil money did not even ... buy a knife. It is being used for paying the salaries of the civil servants,” said presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny. The Sentry said it had found documents, including payment logs from state oil operator Nilepet, suggesting that cash from the company had been used to fund fighters caught up in the country’s civil war. Nilepet was not immediately available for comment. “The documents appear to describe how top officials used Nilepet funds to support a group of (ethnic) Padang Dinka militias active in northeastern Upper Nile state and implicated in widespread attacks against civilians and other atrocities,” the Washington D.C.-based group said in a statement.  South Sudan has been racked by an ethnically charged civil war since late 2013, pitting forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, a member of the Dinka group, against rebels linked to former vice president Riek Machar, a Nuer. The Sentry said it had also received a log kept by South Sudan’s Ministry of Petroleum and Mining detailing $80 million worth of security-related payments made by Nilepet.  It did not publish any of the documents and Reuters was not able to verify the accusations independently. The ministry of petroleum had funded food, fuel and satellite phone airtime and sent money to militias accused of attacking civilians, The Sentry said. “They have used the country’s oil to buy weapons, fund deadly militias, and hire companies owned by political insiders to support military operations that have resulted in horrific atrocities and war crimes,” J.R. Mailey, who leads special investigations at The Sentry, said in a statement. The government dismissed the accusations as a fabrication designed to damage its image.  “South Sudan is not looking for guns now, South Sudan is at peace. I don’t know why The Sentry is putting wrong stories against South Sudan,” Ateny told Reuters. The United States and other powers have been stepping up pressure on South Sudan to stop the war, which erupted less than two years after the country declared independence from Sudan. Last month the U.S. imposed an arms embargo, following sanctions on some South Sudan leaders late last year. U.N. investigators last month said they had identified more than 40 South Sudanese military officers who may be responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Their report detailed mutilations, sexual crimes and killings of civilians.  The war has forced more than 4 million South Sudanese to flee their homes, creating Africa’s largest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

2018-03-05,"(Repeats to fix formating) * Wealth fund urges companies to report climate, water risks * Two Norwegian firms on global “A” list for reporting * Statoil got an “F” for water reporting, “A minus” on climate By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent OSLO, March 5 (Reuters) - Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation’s $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018. The world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. In Norway, just two firms - DNB bank and property firm Entra - were on a CDP list of 160 “A” rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show. Norway’s state-controlled oil group Statoil got an “F” grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey. On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong “A minus”. “It’s not our responsibility” to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L’Oreal, Walmart and Toyota rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains. “If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,” said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP. Norway’s fund, built from the nation’s oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonised data to compare risks. Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide. Yngve Slyngstad, the fund’s CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to “strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP”. Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said. Statoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm’s operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States. “Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,” he said. Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway’s deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry “welcomes efforts to standardise climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles.” The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said “obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally”. He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the centre-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting. Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group Telenor got an “A minus” for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminium producer Hydro and fertiliser-maker Yara International, in which the state owns just over a third, got “C”s. Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities. “When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,” it said in an e-mail. Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013. “We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,” she said. Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc and Nestle - both got “A” grades from CDP for climate change reporting. On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included Total and Neste Oy.

2018-03-05,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - An EU legal opinion has rejected a European Commission proposal to extend the bloc’s internal energy market rules to regulate Russia’s planned Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. The opinion is a blow to the EU executive’s push to stall Russia’s plan to double the gas it could pump under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing traditional routes via Ukraine. The Commission fears the pipeline would undercut efforts to reduce dependence on Moscow and its support for Kiev.  The opinion, seen by Reuters, from the legal service of the Council of the European Union, the body where EU ministers meet, said applying EU rules to offshore pipelines may breach U.N. law regulating the seas. The Commission last year proposed the changes to its gas directive to make all import pipelines subject to rules that require they not be owned directly by gas suppliers, apply non-discriminatory tariffs and make capacity available to third parties. The Nord Stream 2 project, fully owned by Russia’s gas export monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM), is far from complying with the so-called third energy package rules. The opinion, dated March 1, said the Commission’s proposal “lacks any reasoning on the regulatory power of the Union over offshore pipelines” crossing an EU nation’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ). “The Union does not have jurisdiction to apply energy law ... which is unrelated to the economic exploitation of the EEZ, to pipelines crossing the EEZ of Member States,” the Council’s legal service said. Doing so would run counter to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as interpreted by the European Court of Justice, the document says, adding that additional analysis is needed on the matter. The Commission’s moves to regulate Nord Stream 2, including by seeking a mandate from member states to negotiate directly with the Russian government, challenges big member states, who have companies invested in the project. Five European energy firms are financing the 1,225 km (760 mile) pipeline to carry 55 billion cubic metres of gas per year: German energy groups Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Anglo-Dutch group Shell (RDSa.L), Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI) and France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA).

2018-03-05,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - As U.S. influence in Islamabad wanes, Pakistan’s former adversary Russia is building military, diplomatic and economic ties that could upend historic alliances in the region and open up a fast-growing gas market for Moscow’s energy companies. Russia’s embrace of Pakistan comes at a time when relations between the United States and its historical ally are unravelling over the war in Afghanistan, a remarkable turnaround from the 1980s, when Pakistan helped funnel weapons and U.S. spies across the border to aid Afghan fighters battling Soviet troops.    Though the Moscow-Islamabad rapprochement is in its infancy, and it is neighbour China that is filling the growing void left by the United States in Pakistan, a slew of energy deals and growing military cooperation promise to spark life into the Russia-Pakistan relationship that was dead for many decades.  “It is an opening,” Khurram Dastgir Khan, Pakistan’s defence minister, told Reuters. “Both countries have to work through the past to open the door to the future.” The cosier diplomatic ties have so far focused on Afghanistan, where Russia has cultivated ties to the Afghan Taliban militants who are fighting U.S. troops and have historic links to Islamabad. Moscow says it is encouraging peace negotiations.  Both Russia and Pakistan are also alarmed by the presence of Islamic State (IS) inside Afghanistan, with Moscow concerned the group’s fighters could spread towards central Asia and closer to home. In Pakistan, IS has already carried out major attacks. “We have common ground on most issues at diplomatic levels,” Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told Reuters. “It’s a relationship that will grow substantially in the future.” During a trip to Moscow last month by Pakistan’s foreign minister, Khawaja Asif, the two countries announced plans to establish a commission on military cooperation to combat the threat of IS in the region. They also agreed to continue annual military training exercises that began in 2016 and followed the sale of four Russian attack helicopters to Pakistan, as well as the purchase of Russian engines for the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 fighter jets that Pakistan’s military assembles on its own soil. The detente has been watched with suspicion by Pakistan’s neighbour and arch-foe India, which broadly stood in the Soviet camp during the Cold War era. In the last two decades, the close Russia-India relationship has been underpinned by huge arms sales by Moscow to a country it calls a “strategic partner”. “If the Russians start backing the Pakistanis in a big way at the political level, then it creates a problem for us,” said Sushant Sareen, a leading expert on India’s relations to Pakistan and Afghanistan with New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. India’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on Russia’s ties with Pakistan, but has previously said that its own relations with Moscow have stood the test of time, and that the two nations are building up defence and energy relations, including collaboration on nuclear reactors in India.  Russian overtures to Pakistan offer a badly needed diplomatic lifeline for the South Asian nation as it faces growing friction with Western powers over its alleged links to militants. At U.S. urging, and with backing from Britain, France and Germany, a global financial watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), last month decided to place Pakistan back on its watchlist of countries with inadequate terrorist-financing controls, potentially hurting Pakistan’s fragile economy. The U.S. move, which Islamabad angrily dismissed as an effort to “embarrass” Pakistan, followed Washington’s announcement in January to suspend $2 billion in military assistance. Asif, Pakistan’s foreign minister, said his nation made a historical error by “tilting 100 percent” to the West and was now eager build alliances closer to home with the likes of China, Russia and Turkey. “We want to correct the imbalance of our foreign policy over 70 years,” Asif told Reuters. “We are not divorcing that relationship (with the West). But we want to have a balance in our relationships, we want to be closer to our friends in our region.” Defence minister Khan said Pakistan’s military, which has historically been heavily reliant on U.S. weapons and aircraft, may have no choice but to ramp up purchases from the likes of Russia. The cooling relationship with Washington is already pushing Islamabad closer to China, which is investing about $60 billion in infrastructure in Pakistan. But analysts say Pakistan is wary of becoming overly dependent diplomatically on Beijing. Pakistan is among several nations that have been courted by Moscow after falling out with Washington, including the Philippines and Qatar, but Russia’s long-term aims for the Pakistan relationship are unclear, according to Petr Topychkanov, a senior researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.  “It’s not very transparent, even in Russia,” he said. “There is no serious public debate, there is no detailed explanation to the Russian public about what Russia wants in Pakistan.” Russia’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Moscow’s increasingly close relations with Pakistan. Russia and Pakistan are negotiating potential energy deals worth in excess of $10 billion, according to Pakistani energy officials.  Asif said four to five huge power projects “will cement our relationship further”. Russia last month appointed an honorary council in the Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pukhtunkhwa province, where its companies are in talks to build an oil refinery and a power station. But the biggest deals focus on gas supply and infrastructure to Pakistan, one of the world’s fastest growing liquefied natural gas (LNG) import markets. “On a strategic basis, Russia is coming in very fast on the energy side,” said a senior Pakistani energy official. In October, Pakistan and Russia signed an inter-governmental agreement (IGA) on energy, paving the way for Russian state-giant Gazprom to enter negotiations to supply LNG to Pakistan. The talks are expected to conclude within three months and Gazprom is considered “one of the front-runners” to clinch a long-term supply deal, according to the Pakistani official. Based on two monthly LNG cargo deliveries, that deal would be worth about $9 billion over 15 years, he added. There is also growing confidence that a gas pipeline due to be built by Russia, stretching 1,100 km (680 miles) from Lahore to the port city of Karachi, will go ahead. U.S. sanctions against Russian state conglomerate Rostec, as well as a dispute over North-South pipeline transport fees, have held up the $2 billion project since it was signed in 2015. The North-South pipeline would be the biggest infrastructure deal by Russia since early 1970s, when Soviet engineers constructed the Pakistan Steel Mills industrial complex. A Russian company, according to defence minister Khan, is eying up a deal to take over the disused Soviet-built steel mills.

2018-03-05," LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds rediscovered some of their confidence in the oil market in the final week of February, as OPEC reiterated its commitment to output restraint and benchmark prices stabilised above $60 per barrel. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 68 million barrels in the week to Feb. 27. Portfolio managers boosted their net long position for the first time after reducing it by a total of 263 million barrels over the previous four weeks, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. Net length increased in Brent (+21 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (+18 million barrels), European gasoil (+15 million barrels), U.S. gasoline (+9 million barrels) and U.S. heating oil (+5 million barrels). The mild bout of liquidation that occurred between mid-January and the middle of February appears to have run its course without making much of a dent in hedge fund long positions (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2D1lwfo). Fund managers still hold more than 11 long futures and options positions for every short across the petroleum complex, not far off the record set at the end of January. Bullish positions in crude and refined fuels remain at levels that had never been recorded before the start of this year, with fund managers holding long positions amounting to more than 1,400 million barrels. Yet few dare express a contrary bearish view. Short positions actually declined by 11 million barrels in the most recent week to just 126 million, the lowest level since June 2014, when Islamist militants were threatening the oilfields of northern Iraq. Lopsided hedge fund positioning remains an important source of downside risk to oil prices if and when fund managers try to realise some of their profits. For the time being, however, most portfolio managers seem convinced prices will rise further before the eventual correction. Global growth remains strong and oil consumption is set to increase by more than 1.5 million barrels per day for the fourth year running in 2018. Most of the excess inventories that accumulated between 2014 and 2016 have been eliminated, with oil stocks in industrialised countries now reduced close to the five-year average. Production from U.S. shale plays is rising strongly but OPEC’s willingness to sacrifice market share to support prices has convinced many investors that downside risk is limited in the near term. For now, the oil market remains locked in a bullish phase (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex systems”, Sornette, 2003). The bull market has survived its first test of resolve, but there will be others.  The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

2018-03-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel does not want Germany’s national anthem to be changed, her spokesman said after a member of the chancellor’s Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partner said words such as “fatherland” and “brotherland” should be made gender neutral.  The SPD’s Kristin Rose-Moehring, equality commissioner for Germany since 2001, wrote to family ministry staff to suggest striking male-specific references in the “Song of Germany”, which has been Germany’s national anthem since 1922, media reported on Sunday. The reports surfaced shortly before the SPD announced that two-thirds of its members had voted in favour of joining an alliance with Merkel’s conservatives, with whom they have been in power since 2013. That paves the way for a new government under Merkel to start work in mid-March. Rose-Moehring proposed replacing “Vaterland” (fatherland) in the anthem with “Heimatland” (homeland) and ditching “brotherly with heart and hand” in favour of “courageously with heart and hand”.  But Merkel deems any such tweaks unnecessary. “The chancellor is very happy with our nice national anthem as it is in its traditional form and doesn’t see any need for change,” spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference on Monday. A spokesman for the family ministry said Rose-Moehring’s letter had been a personal proposal and he could not comment on it, especially as it was an internal letter to employees at the family ministry. The first stanza of the anthem, which declares “Germany, Germany above all else” - reflecting efforts to unify Germany in the 19th century - and the second, with its refrain of “German women, German loyalty, German wine and German song” were officially dropped in 1991 following reunification.

2018-03-05,"LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - The British government has delayed a decision on whether to allow a new open cast coal mine to be built in northeastern England, the developers of the project said on Monday. Northumberland County Council agreed last year that developer The Banks Group could extract 3 million tonnes of coal by cutting an open cast, or surface mine, near Druridge Bay, Highthorn but the minister for local government, Sajid Javid, called for a public enquiry. The minister was due to issue a final verdict on Monday, but The Banks Group said in a statement this had been delayed, without giving a new deadline. “We remain keen to progress our investment and job creation plans at Highthorn as soon as possible, and are therefore extremely disappointed at this further delay,” Jeannie Kielty, the group’s community relations manager, said in the statement. Officials at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government were immediately available to comment on whether the decision had been postponed. Britain plans to phase-out coal use at its power stations by 2025, and has led an international charge for other countries to do the same. Environmentalist have criticised the plans for a new mine in Britain, saying it would destroy an area of natural beauty and that extracting more coal is at odds with international pledges to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Paris climate pact. Proponents of the project argue it could bring much needed jobs to an economically deprived part of the country. The Banks Group says Highthorn will employ 100 people and generate almost 50 million pounds ($69 million) in related contracts and other benefits to the community. $1 = 0.7235 pounds

2018-03-05,"* Emerging and Italian equities lead downturn * Trump’s tariff threat met with warnings of retaliation * Italian voters deliver a hung parliament * Euro falls versus yen, dollar (Updates prices, adds quotes) By Sujata Rao LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - World shares slipped for the fifth straight day on Monday and emerging markets weakened sharply, hit by the prospect of a global trade war and political instability in Europe after Italy’s inconclusive weekend election. While most markets stabilised after sharp losses early in the day, assets considered low-risk - including gold, the yen and German bonds - remained in demand, with yields on the latter at the lowest in a month. Recent events have again put equity markets, barely recovered from their February selloff, under a cloud. The European Union, Canada and China are among those threatening to retaliate with tit-for-tat duties if U.S. President Donald Trump proceeds with hefty tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Such a full-blown trade war could significantly damage company profits, equity returns and economic growth, all of which have benefited from the trade upswing of recent years. World shares have risen around 50 percent since early-2016. Jitters grew further after Sunday’s Italian election, where voters delivered a hung parliament, flocking to anti-immigrant and eurosceptic parties in record numbers, potentially endangering stability and wider European integration. “There is nothing in the global set-up that’s positive for equities at the moment especially as (share) prices are still out of whack with latest developments,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Managers. Wall Street, where the Dow Jones index fell 3 percent last week, was set to open weaker, futures indicated While Italian stocks remained 1 percent lower at six-month lows, broader European markets reversed opening losses to rise 0.5 percent. That left MSCI’s all-country equity index marginally in the red, though emerging equities fell 0.7 percent , near three-week lows. Ahmed said developments in Italy represented a “a medium-to-small shock” with implications for asset prices, while the risk of trade wars was a far bigger issue. “Markets are not priced for trade wars and now you are also seeing a negative reaction to the U.S. moves from Europe and Canada,” he said. “The major vulnerability is in emerging markets,” he added, referring to the developing world’s reliance on trade. Most emerging currencies weakened around 0.3-0.5 percent to the dollar  . Export-reliant Asian bourses such as Hong Kong and Seoul closed 1-2 percent lower The growth concerns pushed investors towards Bunds, with 10-year German yields falling to nearly six-week lows . Gold likewise benefited from the turbulence, rising to one-week lows. Yields on 10-year Italian government bonds jumped 10 basis points at the open, reversing some of the gains they had enjoyed in the run-up to the election but they later clawed back some losses to trade 6.5 bps higher. Yields on other lower-rated European bonds from Spain and Portugal also were up on the day . Investors noted Italy had overshadowed positive news from Germany where Social Democrats on Sunday decisively backed forming a coalition government with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, ending a five-month stalemate. Also, unlike past crises as in 2012, Europe’s robustly growing economy was seen mitigating some political risks. “Investors still believe that politics appear less likely to upset the apple cart than only a year ago and Eurozone growth could be hitting three percent this year,” said John Taylor, fixed income portfolio manager at Alliance Bernstein in London. The euro which earlier in the day fell 0.7 percent to six-month lows versus the yen, erased some losses to stand 0.2 percent lower by 1200 GMT while against the dollar too, it rose to trade flat. The dollar meanwhile rose slightly off one-week lows against a basket of currencies and stayed a touch off November 2016 lows plumbed versus the yen immediately after Trump’s trade threats last week. Dollar traders might hold fire, however, until this Friday’s U.S. jobs data, the very dataset which triggered a selloff at the end of January by stoking expectations of faster rate rises by the Federal Reserve.

2018-03-05,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 5 (Reuters) - At times when fear and loathing are amped-up it often pays to take a more dispassionate look at what is likely to happen, as opposed to what is feared will happen. The planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium certainly had the effect of raising political and economic temperatures across the world amid fears that President Donald Trump is taking the first step in a global trade war that will end in a 1930s-style depression. However, there is still a long road to travel from the imposition of tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium to a collapse of the post-World War II global economic order, even if you believe Trump has opened that door and is preparing to charge through it. Much will depend on what the rest of the world does in response to the U.S. moves. The smart play is probably to condemn vociferously in public but to do very little in terms of retaliation, while at the same time reaching out to the Trump administration in the hope of toning down its anti-trade rhetoric and actions. Assuming Trump’s measures don’t spark an ongoing tit-for-tat trade war, it will likely become clear that the tariffs are likely to have only a small impact on global commodities, and are effectively an own-goal for the United States. That’s a big assumption, and one not yet in evidence given Trump has seemingly doubled-down on his anti-trade views, saying in a tweet that “trade wars are good, and easy to win,” a phrase that may yet become his political epitaph. But the extent of the poor reaction to the planned tariffs, especially from industries Trump has counted among his supporters, such as oil and gas, coupled with the negative reaction of equity markets may yet give his administration pause for thought. At any rate, assuming a global trade war can be avoided, the effect of the U.S. tariffs should be to make steel and aluminium more expensive inside the country, while making it relatively cheaper elsewhere in the world. If countries that export to the United States find they can no longer ship the same volumes, they can either find new markets or cut production. Given that China, the world’s top steel producer, only ships a fraction of its exports to the United States, it’s likely to be the least affected among Asia’s steel makers. Japan and South Korea may find the going tougher, but if those countries do end up with steel gluts, it will likely lower costs for their significant automotive industries, thus improving their export competitiveness. Aluminium is also a major input into car manufacturing, as well as in other manufactured goods that are commonly imported by the United States. Canada, Brazil and Mexico, the first-, second- and fourth-largest steel exporters to the United States respectively, will find it tough to compete in Asian markets, and are therefore most at risk from Trump’s planned tariffs. At the margin, lower Brazilian steel exports may free up some iron ore for increased exports, but it seems likely at this stage that seaborne iron ore is unlikely to suffer much change to either demand or supply from the U.S. tariffs. Looking at other commodities, it’s likely that a similar pattern emerges - namely that the United States hurts itself more than others. While steel tariffs won’t directly increase the cost of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal in the United States, it will deliver an indirect impost, given these industries use steel as an input. Pipelines, import and export terminals, railroads and mines are all significant steel consumers, and higher costs for U.S. producers of oil, LNG and coal will serve to erode their margins against competitors elsewhere in the world. Again, much of this is at the margin, with higher steel costs likely to make only a tiny difference to actual costs for producing the commodities that the United States exports. Far more important is the likely hit to sentiment, which is two-pronged. Firstly, U.S. commodity exporters that are currently enjoying good times in crude, LNG and coal, are likely to be somewhat more cautious in planning capital expenditure. Secondly, buyers of U.S. commodity exports, while still largely driven by price, may subtly change their buying patterns in favour of other suppliers given the increasing view in the rest of the world that Trump’s America isn’t a friendly place to do business with. For example, a South Korean buyer of LNG or coal may choose to buy from Australia instead of the United States, if the price differential is small, as a subtle way of getting back at Trump for hurting South Korea’s steel industry. Again, none of this is certain and behavioural economics are far from an exact science. “I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened,” American writer and humorist Mark Twain wrote. Trump’s proposed tariffs have certainly increased the world’s worries, but if the response is mature and considered, the worst fears may not be realised.

2018-03-05,"* Petrochemicals to account for a quarter of growth * Fuel efficiency drive to slow motor fuel growth * Rising middle class hikes consumer product demand By Libby George LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Strong global demand for oil and gas will shift in the next five years towards petrochemicals and away from motor fuels gasoline and diesel, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Monday. Demand for products ranging from fertilisers to plastics and beauty products would drive roughly a quarter of the expected oil demand growth to 2023, the IEA said in its five-year outlook. This would bolster more anaemic growth in gasoline and diesel, also known as gasoil, as fuel efficiency and declining developed world consumption takes its toll, it said. World oil demand is expected to rise by 6.9 million barrels per day (bpd) to 2023, or 1.2 million bpd per year, it said, with a quarter of this growth, or 1.7 million bpd, coming from demand for petrochemical feedstocks ethane and naphtha. “Global economic growth is lifting more people into the middle class in developing countries and higher incomes mean sharply rising demand for consumer goods and services,” the IEA said. “A large group of chemicals derived from oil and natural gas are crucial to the manufacture of many products that satisfy this rising demand,” it added. Naphtha is made by oil refineries processing crude, but other petrochemical feedstocks - ethane or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) - largely bypass the refining industry. The boom in U.S. shale oil boom has dramatically expanded the availability of ethane, and a string of new projects on the U.S. Gulf Coast are underway to process it. In total, the world is expected to add 1.4 million bpd in new petrochemical-producing steam crackers to 2023, the IEA said. Demand for ethane would expand the fastest pace in the next five years, rising by 885,000 bpd, followed by naphtha with growth of 495,000 bpd and LPG with growth of 40,000 bpd, it said. Jet fuel, supported by growing demand for air travel, would grow by a 1.2 percent to 2023, the IEA said. But it said demand for gasoline and diesel would rise by 0.7 percent each, with expansion slowed by fuel efficiency standards that now cover two thirds of the world’s top car markets. More than 80 percent of global car sales are now in markets covered by efficiency standards, including China, India the United States and Europe. The IEA said this “will impact strongly on future oil demand.” Reporting By Libby George

2018-03-05,"ERBIL, Iraq/LONDON (Reuters) - Russian state oil company Rosneft has emerged with an important role in talks between Iraq’s government and Iraqi Kurdistan on resuming full oil exports from the semi-autonomous region, two industry sources said. The central government took charge of half of the oil fields that were under Iraqi Kurdistan’s control last October, soon after the northern region voted for independence in a referendum opposed by Baghdad. Exports, via Turkey, were halved.  Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Feb. 27 that an agreement had been reached at talks with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), based in the city of Erbil, for full oil exports to resume soon. But he gave no more detail of when exports would resume and said some differences would have to be resolved later. The two sides are at odds over payment of Iraqi Kurdistan’s debts and the transfer of funds to the region from the national budget.  The two industry sources, who are involved in the talks, said the KRG has told Baghdad it is ready to resume full exports and transfer the funds raised to the Iraqi government on two conditions - that some oil is kept for local refining and Baghdad pays pumping tariffs to Rosneft. The Russian oil major took over ownership of the region’s  export oil and gas pipelines last year and agreed to provide it with over $2 billion in loans, but the deal is not recognised by Baghdad, which says independent Kurdish oil exports are illegal. “Erbil offered a quick-fix solution and has written to Baghdad but has yet to hear a final answer,” one of the sources said, requesting anonymity because the talks are not public. “In the long run, we need to agree on budget transfers and debts to find a long-lasting compromise over exports,” the  source added.  Rosneft declined to comment. Moscow did not oppose the referendum, which the United Sates and the European Union urged the KRG to postpone.  Rosneft’s role in the talks underlines its growing international clout under chief executive Igor Sechin, an ally of President Vladimir Putin, despite Western sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine conflict.  Rosneft’s role was discussed by one of the company’s vice presidents, Didier Casimiro, during a visit to Baghdad in February and by Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jafari in talks in Moscow last month, the industry sources said. Jafari said Iraq was not closing the door on any foreign oil company, and Iraq’s oil minister has said Baghdad has no problem with Rosneft operating in the Kurdistan region. KRG spokesman Safeen Dizayee said no “concrete agreement” was in place yet but he was hopeful Baghdad would agree to the KRG-proposed plan, which included proposals on Rosneft and local refining. He declined further comment. Sources in Iraqi Kurdistan say Baghdad’s takeover of half the oilfields near the Kirkuk area had cost the region nearly $3 billion in lost revenues. The KRG also says Baghdad owes it billions of dollars in unpaid transfers from the state budget. Since the fall of dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003, Kurdistan has traditionally been allocated 17 percent of the federal budget after sovereign expenses but the regional government says it has not been receiving that amount. The federal government says it stopped the transfer of funds after Iraqi Kurdistan began independent oil exports which Baghdad says are illegal.  The dispute has been complicated by the 2018 budget, approved by the national parliament on Saturday in a vote boycotted by Kurdish parties. Iraqi Kurdistan’s will now receive a budget allocation after sovereign expenses which reflects its share of the Iraqi population, which Abadi says is 12.67 percent.  Industry and political sources in Baghdad and Erbil said differences were still too big to reach a lasting deal on oil exports before Iraq holds a parliamentary election on May 12. “Erbil will not commit to a deal with Abadi until he gets re-elected. And Abadi doesn’t seem to be willing to commit to a deal that could weaken his position before the election,” a source involved in talks in Erbil told Reuters. An ally of Abadi who is taking part in the talks said: “Both sides are betting on time. We are in election season, and faces might change... But any delay in solving the Kurdistan problem is not helpful to either side.”     Debts have piled up over the years as the Iraqi Kurds borrowed money from Turkey, trading houses such as Glencore (GLEN.L) and Vitol, and Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to pay state salaries and develop the infrastructure of its pipelines and oilfields. Baghdad says only SOMO has the right to export Iraqi crude. “This is a massive problem. Their (the Kurds’) view is if they are to hand over exports to SOMO then the Iraqi government should take on that debt,” said the Baghdad negotiator. “Baghdad will pay salaries for oil but will not take on the KRG’s debts.” Before the independence referendum last September, Iraqi Kurdistan was hoping to raise oil exports above 1 million barrels per day from around 600,000 bpd, becoming one of the world’s fastest growing oil regions. But after Iraqi troops took control of the Kirkuk oil fields with the help of pro-Iranian militias, KRG’s exports have been running at around 300,000 bpd. Another 300,000 bpd, worth $18 million a day at current prices, are trapped under the ground.

2018-03-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest pension funds have been asked by lawmakers to explain how they are managing the impact of climate change risks on their investments. “We want to know what pension funds are doing to safeguard people’s pensions from the financial risks of climate change,” Mary Creagh, Chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, said. The request follows growing pressure from policy-makers across the world for investors to do more to manage and mitigate the risks of environmental change. The 25 largest schemes, which collectively manage more than 550 billion pounds in assets, include those managing retirement savings for the country’s universities as well as staff at BT and HSBC. Pension fund investments in insurance companies could be at risk as insurers face higher pay-outs and investments in energy companies relying on fossil fuels could lose value as the world seeks to meet commitments to keep global warming, Creagh said in a statement. Creagh asked in the letter if climate change risk was being considered by pension schemes at board level and what investment strategy changes they schemes were making. In a separate letter, also published on Monday, the Department for Work and Pensions said there was still “widespread misunderstanding” on the part of pension scheme trustees on their duty in relation to environmental risks. Luke Hildyard, policy lead for stewardship and corporate governance at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association, said the threat to pension fund investments from the economic impact of climate change was “definitely an issue that trustees should be making time to discuss and seeking advice on”.

2018-03-05,"VIENNA, March 5 (Reuters) - Any collapse of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and major powers would be a “great loss”, the head of the U.N. atomic agency policing the accord said on Monday, alluding to a U.S. threat to pull out of it. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to pull out of the deal unless Congress and European allies help “fix” it with a follow-up agreement. International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano, whose agency is monitoring Iranian compliance with curbs on its disputed nuclear activity imposed by the agreement, has long called the deal a “net gain” for nuclear verification, since it has provided the IAEA with more thorough oversight of Iran. But in a speech on Monday to a quarterly meeting of the IAEA’s Board of Governors, he went further, evoking the possibility of the deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), unravelling. “The JCPOA represents a significant gain for verification,” Amano said, according to a text of his speech published by his agency. “If the JCPOA were to fail, it would be a great loss for nuclear verification and for multilateralism.” Amano said Iran was implementing its commitments under the deal, which also lifted painful economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic. He confirmed the findings of a quarterly, confidential IAEA report on Iran issued last month. As mentioned in the report, the IAEA has requested clarification from Iran about its plans to develop nuclear marine propulsion, Amano said, suggesting the IAEA has still not heard back from the Islamic Republic. “The agency has requested Iran to provide further clarifications regarding its plans relevant to the development of the nuclear fuel cycle related to naval nuclear propulsion,” Amano told the closed-door meeting of 35 member states. Iran has long said publicly that it plans to develop nuclear propulsion for naval vessels but analysts and diplomats say remains a distant prospect. It formally notified the IAEA of that intention in January in what was widely seen as a diplomatic warning shot aimed at the Trump administration, which reversed a policy of detente with Iran introduced by his predecessor Barack Obama. But the move prompted the IAEA to ask what exactly Iran’s plans are. France’s foreign minister visited Iran on Monday on a delicate mission to affirm European support for the nuclear deal that opened up Iran’s economy, while echoing U.S. concern about Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and role in Middle East conflicts.

Spokesman Steffen Seibert told a regular news conference that the two companies should comply with a Stockholm arbitration court’s award of more than $2.5 billion to Naftogaz, which prompted Gazprom to cut supplies to Ukraine. “It is in the interest of Germany and the European Union, and of Russia and Ukraine, that both these countries show themselves to be reliable partners in European gas supply and guarantee continuous supplies,” Seibert said. He repeated the German government’s view that a planned new gas pipeline through the Baltic Sea was a “purely commercial project”, but added that, even though the new pipeline will bypass Ukraine, “it is in the interest of Germany and Europe that Ukraine continues to play a role as a transit country for Russian gas.” (Reporting by Thomas Escritt Editing by Michael Nienaber)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-ukraine-germany/germany-calls-on-gazprom-ukraines-naftogaz-to-settle-dispute-idUKS8N1QC01L,05 Mar 2018,"Germany is concerned at reports

A second LNG tanker, which left Japan last month for Port Moresby, has also flagged it is now looking for a cargo, while a third remains in Papua New Guinea’s Kumul Marine Terminal zone after arriving on Feb. 24, the data showed. The destination change reflects the disruption from the Feb. 26 quake, with PNG LNG project operator ExxonMobil saying on Monday it would take about eight weeks to restore production, while Asian LNG spot prices have risen. The Gigira Leiteboj, which left Yung An, Taiwan on Feb. 26 for arrival in Papua New Guinea on March 6, changed its destination to Singapore on March 3, the shipping data showed. The Yung-An LNG terminal in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung county is operated by CPC Corp, a long-term buyers of PNG LNG. The Pacific Arcadia, an LNG tanker which left Japan’s Sodeshi LNG terminal on Feb. 21, changed its status to “for orders” on March 2. The Velikiy Novgorod is still in Papua New Guinea after arriving on Feb. 24 from China’s Qingdao LNG terminal in Shandong. The Qingdao LNG terminal is owned by Sinopec, also a long-term buyer of PNG LNG. Taiwan’s CPC last week purchased a spot LNG cargo for delivery in April at higher than market rates, traders said. The company is also in the spot market to buy a cargo for first half of May, they said.

2018-03-05,"(Repeats MARCH 4 story. No change to text) * Wealth fund urges companies to report climate, water risks * Two Norwegian firms on global “A” list for reporting * Statoil got an “F” for water reporting, “A-“ on climate By Alister Doyle Environment Correspondent OSLO, March 5 (Reuters) - Many Norwegian companies lag high standards for reporting their impact on the environment that the Nordic nation’s $1 trillion wealth fund is championing abroad in 2018. The world’s biggest sovereign wealth fund, which is barred by the Norwegian government from investing at home, wants the 9,100 companies in which it holds stakes to submit data on issues such as water use and climate effects to London-based non-profit group CDP, formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project. In Norway, just two firms - DNB bank and property firm Entra - were on a CDP list of 160 “A” rated performers worldwide for disclosure in 2017. That was comparable to other Nordic nations but not exemplary, CDP data show. Norway’s state-controlled oil group Statoil got an “F” grade for disclosure of fresh water use - a core focus area for the fund abroad - after it declined to take part in the CDP survey. On climate change reporting, including tracking greenhouse gas emissions, Statoil got a strong “A-“. “It’s not our responsibility” to ensure that Norwegian firms comply, central bank governor Oeystein Olsen told Reuters when asked if Oslo was pressing higher standards abroad than at home. The wealth fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. CDP said there were no Norwegian firms, for instance, among almost 100 companies including L’Oreal, Walmart and Toyota rated as leaders in tracking greenhouse gas emissions in their supply chains. “If Norwegian companies want to take a leadership role on climate change they should be engaging with their suppliers on these issues,” said Sonya Bhonsle, head of supply chain at CDP. Norway’s fund, built from the nation’s oil and gas revenues, says global warming is stoking downpours, droughts and rising sea levels that threaten long-term earnings. It says investors need harmonised data to compare risks. Its policies, such as restricting investments in coal companies, have huge influence for companies and investors because it owns on average 1.4 percent of all listed shares worldwide. Yngve Slyngstad, the fund’s CEO, said it encouraged companies abroad to “strengthen their reporting in general, directly to the investors, but also indirectly through the CDP”. Few companies are doing enough on climate change, he said. Statoil spokesman Erik Haaland said the company did not take part in the CDP fresh water survey because most of the firm’s operations are offshore, using abundant sea water. Statoil has water-intensive shale oil and gas in the United States. “Also, the questionnaire is quite extensive, and since the issue is less material for our operations we made the decision to not take part,” he said. Asked if the government had a double standard, Norway’s deputy Finance Minister Geir Olsen wrote in an e-mail that the ministry “welcomes efforts to standardise climate reporting according to internationally agreed principles.” The finance ministry oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Martin Skancke, a consultant on the design of sovereign wealth funds, said “obviously there is a reasonable expectation that when the government promotes these standards through the fund in foreign markets that it also promotes them internally”. He said that, from his own experience on boards of Norwegian companies, the centre-right government does urge companies to disclose environmental data. He said it was hard to estimate the extra costs of such reporting. Among other Norwegian companies, state-controlled telecoms group Telenor got an “A-“ for climate change reporting in 2017, while aluminium producer Hydro and fertiliser-maker Yara International, in which the state owns just over a third, got “C”s. Hydro said it had reported to the CDP since 2004 but lost marks on technicalities. “When filling in the CDP questionnaire, we are more occupied about reporting quality information requested by important stakeholders, than exactly following the CDP format,” it said in an e-mail. Yara spokeswoman Kristin Nordal said the company halved its greenhouse gas emissions between 2004 and 2013. “We will certainly not claim to have all the answers in place on issues such as climate and water, and we are presently going through a strategic process to further improve our response to sustainability matters,” she said. Abroad, the companies in which the fund has the biggest holdings - Apple Inc and Nestle - both got “A” grades from CDP for climate change reporting. On fresh water use, most big foreign energy companies joined Statoil in declining to take part in the CDP water survey. Exceptions included Total and Neste Oy.

2018-03-05,"BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN (Reuters) - On a tiny island off Brunei’s northern tip on the South China  Sea, thousands of Chinese workers are building a refinery and petrochemical complex, along with a bridge connecting it to the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. When completed, the first phase of the $3.4 billion complex on Muara Besar island, run by China’s Hengyi Group, will be Brunei’s largest-ever foreign investment project, and comes at a time when the oil-dependent country needs it the most.  Brunei’s oil and gas reserves are expected to run out within two decades. As production falls, oil firms won’t be investing much into existing facilities, further hampering output, oil analysts say. As a result, the country’s oil revenues, which provide virtually all of Brunei’s government spending, are in steady decline. With youth unemployment rising, Brunei’s ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, is trying to quickly reform the economy and diversify its sources of income, while fighting graft and cracking down on dissent. Brunei’s changing fortunes have been reflected in its financial industry. HSBC pulled out of Brunei last year, while Citibank exited in 2014 after 41 years. Bank of China, meanwhile, opened its first branch in the sultanate in December 2016.  The Muara Besar project is promising over 10,000 jobs, at least half of which would go to fresh graduates, media reports in Brunei said. But claims that thousands of Chinese workers have been shipped in to build the complex has angered some local residents. “There are no jobs for us, so why create some for the Chinese?” asked one shopkeeper in the capital city.      Hengyi Industries, the local company building the refinery,  did not respond to requests for comment. The company, founded in 2011 and based in Bandar Seri Begawan, expects to complete the first phase of the refinery and petrochemical complex on Muara Besar by the end of the year, according to its website. A $12 billion second phase will expand the refinery capacity to 281,150 barrels per day, and build units to produce 1.5 million tonnes per year (tpy) of ethylene and 2 million tpy of  paraxylene, the company said last month. Total Chinese investment in Brunei is now estimated at $4.1 billion, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global investment tracker.  That will almost certainly rise as China ramps its “Belt and Road” initiative. Sometimes called the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road, it envisages linking China with Southeast Asia, Africa and Eurasia through a complex network of ports, roads, railways and industrial parks. “Brunei is an important country along the 21st century Maritime Silk Road,” China’s Ambassador to Brunei Yang Jian said at the opening ceremony in February 2017 for a joint venture, running Brunei’s largest container terminal. Accumulated U.S. foreign investment in Brunei, by contrast, was just $116 million in 2012, the latest figures available, according to the U.S. State Department. China has invested about $205 billion in East Asia between 2010 and 2017, according to the China Global investment tracker. It’s been increasing those investments while tussling with four other Southeast Asian nations, including Brunei, over competing claims to islets and atolls in the South China Sea  “Building good relations and offering big investments are part of China’s strategy to split Southeast Asian nations to ensure there is no consensus on South China Sea matters,” said Jatswan Singh, associate professor at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, who has authored four books on Brunei.  “The Sultanate is hard-pressed for investments to diversify its economy, and in this sense the Chinese investments are important to (Brunei),” he said. Brunei has not commented publicly about its territorial claims in the South China Sea. There was a time not so long ago, with oil prices over $100 a barrel, when Brunei citizens could care less about jobs at a refinery.  Squeezed between two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo, Brunei provided cradle-to-grave benefits for its 420,000 citizens, including zero taxes, subsidised housing and free education and health care. But the sultan has had to whittle back some of those benefits — Brunei has been in recession for three straight years — and tighten up the ship of state. The 71-year-old Bolkiah, the world’s second-longest reigning monarch, reshuffled his cabinet again last month, replacing six top ministers — just over a couple of years after they were appointed. No explanation was given. Sources close to the government and foreign diplomats say Bolkiah wanted to weed out corruption, and address grumbling among the Malay-Muslim majority who are unhappy with the pullback in welfare programs, budget cuts and unemployment. In the last available official report in 2014, the unemployment rate was put at 6.9 percent. Unofficial figures suggest youth unemployment could be as high as 15 percent. “A majority in Brunei expect a job in the government, state linked firms or in the oil and gas sector. But all three have been hit pretty hard,” said one Western diplomat.  Bolkiah, who is also the Prime Minister, controls the key portfolios of defence, finance and foreign affairs.  The Sultan’s office did not respond to a request for comment to this story. At the annual parliamentary session on Monday, Bolkiah said the government must cut its dependence on oil and gas, and explore other avenues of economic growth. “Although global demand has risen and oil prices are rebounding, economic growth remains at a low level,” he said in a speech to cabinet ministers and parliamentarians. “Therefore we still need to control the fiscal balance of the country in the short and long term.” The Sultan is still popular in Brunei and marked 50 years in power last October, with a glittering procession through the capital on a gilded chariot, cheered by well-wishers. But in the long run, an economy based on dwindling single source of income could erode the relationship between the ruler and his subjects, said Maung Zarni, democracy advocate and a former research fellow at the London School of Economics.  “That doesn’t mean that will translate into street protests. But Bruneians know things are not as rosy as they appear in the Sultan’s newspapers and TV channels,” said Zarni, who quit the University Brunei Darussalam in 2013 over what he said was a lack of academic freedom.

2018-03-05,"LONDON, March 5 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of households across Britain suffered water supply problems on Monday after pipes burst when snow thawed and normal weather conditions returned to the country. The worst snowstorms in nearly 30 years had frozen water in pipes last week, water suppliers said, during a blast of Siberian cold dubbed “the Beast from the East”, which ground planes, stopped trains, blocked roads and shut schools. Leaking pipes in London left 12,000 households without water or suffering from very low pressure on Monday, said Thames Water which was providing bottled water to customers at two locations. In nearby Kent, 5,000 households supplied by Southern Water had problems. Severn Trent, a supplier of water to 4.3 million homes and businesses in the middle of England, said the number of burst pipes was up 4000 percent, while in Wales, Welsh Water said between 3,000 and 6,000 homes were being affected. Suppliers warned that water supplies would continue to face disruption on Monday as they worked to fix leaks and refill pipes. Thames Water advised its 15 million customers to only use water where essential. “Where possible, take short showers rather than baths, do not leave taps running unnecessarily and only run washing machines and dish washers when you have a full load,” the company said in a statement on its website.

Three aftershocks of magnitude greater than 5 shook the mountainous Southern Highlands, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby early on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, including a shallow magnitude 6 quake. “We haven’t slept. It’s been shaking all through the night,”  William Bando, provincial administrator of Hela Province, said by telephone from Tari, about 40 km (25 miles) from the site of the shocks. “What we experienced this morning could have caused more damage, but we don’t know ... it almost threw me out of bed.” The region had already been badly damaged on Feb. 26, when the largest quake to hit the seismically-active highlands in nearly a century flattened buildings, triggered landslides, and closed oil and gas operations.     The toll on Monday stood at 55 killed, said James Justin, a research officer at the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy in Port Moresby, as news of more deaths arrived in the capital by shortwave radio. Most of the confirmed fatalities were in and around the provincial capital of Mendi and the township of Tari, he said, where landslides buried homes and buildings collapsed on families. “People are in great fear of their lives as the quakes are continuing ever since it started,” he said. “They actually want to know when it will stop.”  While the region has no major urban centres, around 670,000 people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the epicentre, according to the Red Cross. (Graphic: Papua New Guinea quake, tmsnrt.rs/2ow1YLR) The quake has been felt on global natural gas markets, with ExxonMobil Corp declaring force majeure on exports from Papua New Guinea, according to an industry source, pushing Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices 5 percent higher. The company declined to comment on the force majeure, but said production would be knocked out for about 8 weeks. [nL4N1QM0PD] Aid agencies have said nearly 150,000 people remain in urgent need of emergency supplies. Australia, New Zealand and the Red Cross have all pledged aid, though reaching the remote area has proven challenging as forbidding terrain, bad weather, as well as damaged roads and runways have delayed aid efforts. “The only way for people to go out is by chopper, and it’s slow for information to come through”, said Martin Mose, director of Papua New Guinea’s National Disaster Centre, which has yet to complete a full assessment of damage.

2018-03-05,"(Repeats to change slug to BRUNEI-CHINA/ for media clients) * Chinese firm building $15 billion refinery complex offshore * China is by far Brunei’s largest foreign investor * Brunei, China have competing claims in South China Sea * Sultan trying to diversify economy with unemployment rising * Reshuffles Cabinet after three yeas of recession By Praveen Menon BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, March 5 (Reuters) - On a tiny island off Brunei’s northern tip on the South China  Sea, thousands of Chinese workers are building a refinery and petrochemical complex, along with a bridge connecting it to the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan. When completed, the first phase of the $3.4 billion complex on Muara Besar island, run by China’s Hengyi Group, will be Brunei’s largest-ever foreign investment project, and comes at a time when the oil-dependent country needs it the most. Brunei’s oil and gas reserves are expected to run out within two decades. As production falls, oil firms won’t be investing much into existing facilities, further hampering output, oil analysts say. As a result, the country’s oil revenues, which provide virtually all of Brunei’s government spending, are in steady decline. With youth unemployment rising, Brunei’s ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, is trying to quickly reform the economy and diversify its sources of income, while fighting graft and cracking down on dissent. Brunei’s changing fortunes have been reflected its financial industry. HSBC pulled out of Brunei last year, while Citibank exited in 2014 after 41 years. Bank of China, meanwhile, opened its first branch in the sultanate in December 2016. The Muara Besar project is promising over 10,000 jobs, at least half of which would go to fresh graduates, media reports in Brunei said. But claims that thousands of Chinese workers have been shipped in to build the complex has angered some local residents. “There are no jobs for us, so why create some for the Chinese?” asked one shopkeeper in the capital city. Hengyi Industries, the local company building the refinery, did not respond to requests for comment. The company, founded in 2011 and based in Bandar Seri Begawan, expects to complete the first phase of the refinery and petrochemical complex on Muara Besar by the end of the year, according to its website. A $12 billion second phase will expand the refinery capacity to 281,150 barrels per day, and build units to produce 1.5 million tonnes per year (tpy) of ethylene and 2 million tpy of paraxylene, the company said last month. Total Chinese investment in Brunei is now estimated at $4.1 billion, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global investment tracker. That will almost certainly rise as China ramps its “Belt and Road” initiative. Sometimes called the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road, it envisages linking China with Southeast Asia, Africa and Eurasia through a complex network of ports, roads, railways and industrial parks. “Brunei is an important country along the 21st century Maritime Silk Road,” China’s Ambassador to Brunei Yang Jian said at the opening ceremony in February 2017 for a joint venture, running Brunei’s largest container terminal. Accumulated U.S. foreign investment in Brunei, by contrast, was just $116 million in 2012, the latest figures available, according to the U.S. State Department. China has invested about $205 billion in East Asia between 2010 and 2017, according to the China Global investment tracker. It’s been increasing those investments while tussling with four other Southeast Asian nations, including Brunei, over competing claims to islets and atolls in the South China Sea “Building good relations and offering big investments are part of China’s strategy to split Southeast Asian nations to ensure there is no consensus on South China Sea matters,” said Jatswan Singh, associate professor at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, who has authored four books on Brunei. “The Sultanate is hard-pressed for investments to diversify its economy, and in this sense the Chinese investments are important to (Brunei),” he said. Brunei has not commented publicly about its territorial claims in the South China Sea. There was a time not so long ago, with oil prices over $100 a barrel, when Brunei citizens could care less about jobs at a refinery. Squeezed between two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo, Brunei provided cradle-to-grave benefits for its 420,000 citizens, including zero taxes, subsidised housing and free education and health care. But the sultan has had to whittle back some of those benefits — Brunei has been in recession for three straight years — and tighten up the ship of state. The 71-year-old Bolkiah, the world’s second-longest reigning monarch, reshuffled his cabinet again last month, replacing six top ministers — just over a couple of years after they were appointed. No explanation was given. Sources close to the government and foreign diplomats say Bolkiah wanted to weed out corruption, and address grumbling among the Malay-Muslim majority who are unhappy with the pullback in welfare programs, budget cuts and unemployment. In the last available official report in 2014, the unemployment rate was put at 6.9 percent. Unofficial figures suggest youth unemployment could be as high as 15 percent. “A majority in Brunei expect a job in the government, state linked firms or in the oil and gas sector. But all three have been hit pretty hard,” said one Western diplomat. Bolkiah, who is also the Prime Minister, controls the key portfolios of defence, finance and foreign affairs. The Sultan’s office did not respond to a request for comment and newly appointed ministers refused to comment during national day celebrations last week. The Sultan, however, is still popular. He marked 50 years in power last October, with a glittering procession through the capital on a gilded chariot, cheered by well-wishers. But in the long run, an economy based on dwindling single source of income could erode the relationship between the ruler and his subjects, said Muang Zarni, democracy advocate and a former research fellow at the London School of Economics. “That doesn’t mean that will translate into street protests. But Bruneians know things are not as rosy as they appear in the Sultan’s newspapers and TV channels,” said Zarni, who quit the University Brunei Darussalam in 2013 over what he said was a lack of academic freedom.

2018-03-05,"* Japan betting heavily on ‘hydrogen society’ * Fuelling stations needed to boost vehicle take-up * New venture will nearly double number of stations (Adds comment, details) TOKYO, March 5 (Reuters) - An alliance of 11 Japanese firms, including automakers and energy firms, has pledged to build 80 fuelling stations for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles by 2022 to help accelerate take-up of the next-generation fuel technology. Japan H2 Mobility LLC, whose backers include Toyota Motor Corp and JXTG Nippon Oil & Energy, said on Monday it would oversee the construction and operation of the new fuelling stations, nearly doubling the number at present. As countries seek low emissions energy sources to power vehicles, homes and industry, Japan is betting heavily on becoming a “hydrogen society” despite the high costs and technical difficulties of a process that creates electricity from a chemical reaction of fuel and oxygen. JXTG Nippon Oil Senior Vice President Yutaka Kuwahara said on Monday that a lack of users and high costs to build and operate fuelling stations had slowed construction in Japan, delaying a government target to build 100 stations by March 2016. Japan currently has about 90 stations, with at least 40 operated by JXTG Nippon Oil, and another 10 are in the planning or construction stage. “We must lower costs, which will remove many of the bottlenecks to developing more stations,” he told reporters at a briefing. By about 2020, the Japanese government aims to roughly halve the cost of building a hydrogen fuelling station, which is currently about 400 million yen to 500 million yen ($3.8 million-$4.7 million), well above 100 million yen for a gasoline station. The path to adopting hydrogen has been dogged by the difficulty in driving widespread take-up given high costs of fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), limited production capabilities and low numbers of fuelling stations. Only a handful of automakers currently market FCVs, including Toyota, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co . Toyota has sold only 5,300 units of its Mirai FCV since its launch in 2015, while it has sold a total of around 11.5 million gasoline hybrids since launching the Prius 20 years ago. Japan wants to have 160 hydrogen stations and 40,000 FCVs on the country’s roads by March 2021. By 2030, it aims to have 900 stations to service some 800,000 FCVs, buses and forklifts. By then, it expects the price of hydrogen to fall to around 30 yen per normal cubic meter, from up to 100 yen now. Other companies involved in Japan H2 Mobility include Honda, Nissan Motor, Idemitsu Kosan, Iwatani Corp , Tokyo Gas, Toho Gas, Air Liquide Japan Ltd, Toyota Tsusho. $1 = 105.5000 yen

2018-03-05,"* Palm exports to the Middle East seen rising for Ramadan * But full-year Middle East demand seen flat * SE Asia demand also lukewarm without govt policy action By Emily Chow KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 (Reuters) - A push by palm oil producers to cultivate new markets in Southeast Asia and the Middle East is unlikely to move the dial on exports this year, traders and analysts say, as customers favour cheaper rival oils while holding out for palm price cuts. The impetus for Indonesia and Malaysia, the number 1 and 2 palm oil suppliers respectively, to seek out new buyers comes from the European Union’s move to curb palm oil use in biofuels as part of broader climate change goals. The EU is the second largest buyer of the top two producers’ palm oil. But while buying in regions outside traditional markets could pick up ahead of the Ramadan Muslim fasting season, which begins mid-May, full-year demand for the product used in everything from soap to cooking oil is set to remain unchanged, market watchers told Reuters. The new market quest is set to be a theme at a key industry conference in Kuala Lumpur next week. “Demand in the Middle East won’t pick up unless the economy is really growing, or we see big names invest in refineries there. This region is not a major demand driver,” said William Simadiputra, an analyst at DBS Vickers. “Demand during Ramadan usually picks up but for a full-year basis we don’t expect much change (from last year),” he said. Demand rises during Ramadan, known for its communal feasting, when the oil is used to prepare meals to break day-long fasts. Egypt, one of the key Middle East consumers, is seen importing 1.25 million tonnes of palm oil in 2017/18, down from 1.32 million tonnes the previous year, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture data. Data from the Iranian Vegetable Oil Industry Association showed the country’s palm oil imports ranged between 300,000-400,000 tonnes from 2013 to 2015. “Palm oil usage will stagnate at 400,000-420,000 tonnes a year,” said Saeid Vaygani, an association representative. “Soyoil is widely used in Iran.” Traders say buyers are holding off purchases in hopes of prices falling to the 2,300-2,400 ringgit a tonne range. Palm oil production this year is widely expected to rise this year, recovering after being hit by the El Nino weather pattern and likely bringing lower prices. Benchmark prices was trading around 2,489 ringgit ($636.08) on Friday afternoon. In Southeast Asia, industry players don’t see significant uptakes of palm oil without government policy action to promote it, or a reduction in other edible oil supplies. The Philippines, one of the region’s most populated countries, relies on coconut oil, and while Myanmar is seeing some pick-up in palm oil demand the gains are not significant, said David Ng, a derivatives specialist at Phillip Futures. “This is not a major market for palm. It needs promotional effort before we see contributions from these countries getting higher.” $1 = 3.9130 ringgit

Italian voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, flocking to anti-establishment and far-right parties in record numbers and casting the euro zone’s third-largest economy into a political gridlock that could take months to clear. The euro traded choppily around $1.2320, easing from a two-week high of $1.2365 as the eurosceptic 5-Star Movement saw its support soar to become the largest single party, according to projections based on early vote-counting. In the United States, President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, a pledge that met with warnings of retaliation from the rest of the world over the weekend. The spectre of a global trade war hit risk appetite, sending MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan down 0.8 percent to the lowest since mid-February. U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.6 percent and Dow futures off 0.4 percent. “The messy Italian election result adds a bit to the nervousness to global equity markets at present,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP. “The Italian election...does run the risk of making Italy’s public finances worse than they already are with no progress in addressing Italy’s long-term competitiveness problems.” The euro still found support after Germany’s Social Democrat party decisively backed the renewal of an alliance with Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives, allowing her to form a new government more than five months since the country’s inconclusive election. The single currency also got a lift from some safe-haven flows, as did the Japanese yen. The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to trade around 105.52 yen, but was slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016. “Nothing’s happened over the weekend to soften concerns about trade wars or retaliatory actions by other countries,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. “There is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start.” Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. China said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests, warning that policies based on “mistaken assumptions” will damage bilateral relations. Investors fear the current momentum in the global economy could be lost if Trump starts a trade war. Asian markets were a sea of red with Japan’s Nikkei and South Korea’s KOSPI both down about 1 percent, while Chinese shares eased too after starting on a positive note. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index slipped 1.4 percent. “Frustration with a lack of market access and a lack of fair trade are understandable,” said Peter Jolly, global head of research for National Australia Bank. “If this escalation draws that into focus with some improvement, that would be positive. But retaliatory tit-for-tat measures would weigh against market access, a cost to growth with increases in trade prices, costs, and inflation.” Investors will keep an eye on a deluge of data this week, culminating in the U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. The annual opening of the National People’s Congress in China was another focus for investors. China’s parliament has kept the economy’s growth target at 6.5 percent for this year. In commodities, oil prices climbed ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global glut. Brent crude was up 25 cents at $64.63 a barrel while U.S. light crude added 23 cents to $61.48. Spot gold climbed 0.3 percent to $1,326.46.

A second LNG tanker, which left Japan last month for Port Moresby, has also flagged it is now looking for a cargo, while a third remains in Papua New Guinea’s Kumul Marine Terminal zone after arriving on Feb. 24, the data showed. The destination change reflects the disruption from the Feb. 26 quake, with PNG LNG project operator ExxonMobil saying on Monday it would take about eight weeks to restore production, while Asian LNG spot prices have risen. The Gigira Leiteboj, which left Yung An, Taiwan on Feb. 26 for arrival in Papua New Guinea on March 6, changed its destination to Singapore on March 3, the shipping data showed. The Yung-An LNG terminal in Taiwan’s Kaohsiung county is operated by CPC Corp, a long-term buyers of PNG LNG. The Pacific Arcadia, an LNG tanker which left Japan’s Sodeshi LNG terminal on Feb. 21, changed its status to “for orders” on March 2. The Velikiy Novgorod is still in Papua New Guinea after arriving on Feb. 24 from China’s Qingdao LNG terminal in Shandong. The Qingdao LNG terminal is owned by Sinopec, also a long-term buyer of PNG LNG. Taiwan’s CPC last week purchased a spot LNG cargo for delivery in April at higher than market rates, traders said. The company is also in the spot market to buy a cargo for first half of May, they said. PNG LNG’s other long-term buyers include Japan’s Osaka Gas and JERA, which is a fuel joint venture between Tokyo Electric Power and Chubu Electric Power.

2018-03-05,"MANILA, March 5 (Reuters) - Any deal between the Philippines and a Chinese firm to jointly explore for gas in the Reed Bank of the South China Sea will be illegal unless China recognises the southeast Asian nation’s sovereign rights there, a Philippine judge said on Monday. Manila has identified two areas in the crowded waterway suitable for joint exploration and the two countries seek a way to tackle the diplomatic and legal headache of jointly exploring in the waters, but without addressing the issue of sovereignty. The Reed Bank is claimed by both sides, but international law says it falls within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of the Philippines. China says it falls within the so-called nine-dash line on maps recording its historic rights in the area. Antonio Carpio, the acting top judge of the Supreme Court, said it was legal for the Philippines’ energy ministry to talk to state-owned China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) as a possible sub-contractor. “There’s no problem as long as CNOOC will recognize that that is our exclusive economic zone,” he told news channel ANC in an interview. “But that is the problem, because CNOOC will not recognise (Philippine jurisdiction).” Carpio was speaking as an expert on international law and staunch advocate for the Philippines to assert its maritime sovereignty claims. He was among the lawyers involved in the Philippines’ legal challenge against China, which Manila brought to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague in 2013. The tribunal, in its 2016 ruling, invalidated China’s nine-dash line, making clear that the Reed Bank fell within the Philippines’ EEZ, and that Manila had sovereign rights to resources there. China is a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) but it does not recognise the Hague court ruling. “The stumbling block has always been the insistence of China that we recognise their sovereign rights,” Carpio said. “We cannot do that anymore because there’s already a ruling. And the (Philippine) constitution says the state shall protect its marine wealth in its exclusive economic zone, it’s very specific.” The Reed Bank was the site of exploration by the Philippines’ PXP Energy Corp to evaluate the block’s gas reserves, until the energy ministry suspended activities there in late 2014 because of the arbitration case. PXP has had talks with CNOOC for possible joint exploration and development, but the arbitration halted negotiations. Carpio said who should collect taxes was also an issue between the two companies. Last week, Philippine presidential spokesman Harry Roque, said any potential deals between Manila and Beijing should be agreed with a company and not the Chinese government. On Monday, he said the Philippines and China would have to sign a treaty to enter into joint exploration and development in the Reed Bank. “That’s on the assumption that (the Reed Bank) is contested territory,” he told reporters. “We have no treaty on joint exploration as of yet.” (Reporting by Enrico dela Cruz Editing by Clarence Fernandez)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/philippines-china-southchinasea-energy/philippine-judge-rules-out-any-china-gas-deal-without-sovereignty-recognition-idUKL4N1QN1D1,05 Mar 2018,"Any deal between the Philippines

2018-03-05,"PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen on Monday turned down an offer of talks from former opposition leader Sam Rainsy to end a crisis caused by the dissolution of the main opposition party ahead of general elections set for July 29.  The Supreme Court last November dissolved the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), at the request of the government of Hun Sen, which said it had been plotting to take power with the help of the United States. The CNRP, and the United States embassy, have denied the allegation. In a speech on Monday Hun Sen, who has held power since 1985, said he was not willing to talk to Sam Rainsy, citing the latter’s criminal convictions. “I open my heart to hold talks on politics but it must be clearly stated that people who are involved in legal cases have no right to hold talks with Hun Sen,” he said, referring to himself in the third person. In a message on Twitter on Sunday, Sam Rainsy said, “I am always open to meeting with Hun Sen’s government in order to find a peaceful solution to this unprecedented crisis, a solution that would be acceptable to both sides with international guarantees.” Sam Rainsy’s comments were his first remarks on the matter since the opposition ban. The dissolution of the opposition party followed the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha, also accused of plotting to take power with U.S. help. That charge was made because of the threat the CNRP posed at the July elections, Kem Sokha has said. Sam Rainsy resigned as president of the CNRP in 2017 but remains one of the government’s most visible critics. He had previously served as finance minister in an ill-fated coalition set up when Hun Sen refused to give up power after losing a U.N.-organised election in 1993. He has lived in France since 2015 to avoid a series of convictions he says are politically motivated.      Western countries have criticised Hun Sen over the CNRP’s dissolution and the arrest of Kem Sokha ahead of the general election. Hun Sen’s government and its allies have targeted non-government bodies, opposition lawmakers and some independent media in a crackdown. On Friday, Hun Sen had said he was open to holding talks to end the crisis but would not negotiate a change to criminal convictions brought against opposition figures. On Sunday, a spokesman for Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party said Sam Rainsy was not serious about holding talks. “He has no way out,” Sok Eysan told Reuters. “The culture of dialogue is dead and he has to face prison for crimes he has committed.” Editing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre and Clarence Fernandez",https://uk.reuters.com/article/cambodia-politics/update-1-cambodian-prime-minister-turns-down-offer-of-talks-from-former-opposition-leader-idUKL4N1QN1W3,05 Mar 2018,"* Former opposition leader Sam Rainsy says open to talks

When completed, the first phase of the $3.4 billion complex on Muara Besar island, run by China’s Hengyi Group, will be Brunei’s largest-ever foreign investment project, and comes at a time when the oil-dependent country needs it the most. Brunei’s oil and gas reserves are expected to run out within two decades. As production falls, oil firms won’t be investing much into existing facilities, further hampering output, oil analysts say. As a result, the country’s oil revenues, which provide virtually all of Brunei’s government spending, are in steady decline. With youth unemployment rising, Brunei’s ruler, Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, is trying to quickly reform the economy and diversify its sources of income, while fighting graft and cracking down on dissent. Brunei’s changing fortunes have been reflected its financial industry. HSBC pulled out of Brunei last year, while Citibank exited in 2014 after 41 years. Bank of China, meanwhile, opened its first branch in the sultanate in December 2016. The Muara Besar project is promising over 10,000 jobs, at least half of which would go to fresh graduates, media reports in Brunei said. But claims that thousands of Chinese workers have been shipped in to build the complex has angered some local residents. “There are no jobs for us, so why create some for the Chinese?” asked one shopkeeper in the capital city. Hengyi Industries, the local company building the refinery, did not respond to requests for comment. The company, founded in 2011 and based in Bandar Seri Begawan, expects to complete the first phase of the refinery and petrochemical complex on Muara Besar by the end of the year, according to its website. A $12 billion second phase will expand the refinery capacity to 281,150 barrels per day, and build units to produce 1.5 million tonnes per year (tpy) of ethylene and 2 million tpy of paraxylene, the company said last month. Total Chinese investment in Brunei is now estimated at $4.1 billion, according to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global investment tracker. That will almost certainly rise as China ramps its “Belt and Road” initiative. Sometimes called the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road, it envisages linking China with Southeast Asia, Africa and Eurasia through a complex network of ports, roads, railways and industrial parks. “Brunei is an important country along the 21st century Maritime Silk Road,” China’s Ambassador to Brunei Yang Jian said at the opening ceremony in February 2017 for a joint venture, running Brunei’s largest container terminal. Accumulated U.S. foreign investment in Brunei, by contrast, was just $116 million in 2012, the latest figures available, according to the U.S. State Department. China has invested about $205 billion in East Asia between 2010 and 2017, according to the China Global investment tracker. It’s been increasing those investments while tussling with four other Southeast Asian nations, including Brunei, over competing claims to islets and atolls in the South China Sea “Building good relations and offering big investments are part of China’s strategy to split Southeast Asian nations to ensure there is no consensus on South China Sea matters,” said Jatswan Singh, associate professor at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, who has authored four books on Brunei. “The Sultanate is hard-pressed for investments to diversify its economy, and in this sense the Chinese investments are important to (Brunei),” he said. Brunei has not commented publicly about its territorial claims in the South China Sea. There was a time not so long ago, with oil prices over $100 a barrel, when Brunei citizens could care less about jobs at a refinery. Squeezed between two Malaysian states on the island of Borneo, Brunei provided cradle-to-grave benefits for its 420,000 citizens, including zero taxes, subsidised housing and free education and health care. But the sultan has had to whittle back some of those benefits — Brunei has been in recession for three straight years — and tighten up the ship of state. The 71-year-old Bolkiah, the world’s second-longest reigning monarch, reshuffled his cabinet again last month, replacing six top ministers — just over a couple of years after they were appointed. No explanation was given. Sources close to the government and foreign diplomats say Bolkiah wanted to weed out corruption, and address grumbling among the Malay-Muslim majority who are unhappy with the pullback in welfare programs, budget cuts and unemployment. In the last available official report in 2014, the unemployment rate was put at 6.9 percent. Unofficial figures suggest youth unemployment could be as high as 15 percent. “A majority in Brunei expect a job in the government, state linked firms or in the oil and gas sector. But all three have been hit pretty hard,” said one Western diplomat. Bolkiah, who is also the Prime Minister, controls the key portfolios of defence, finance and foreign affairs. The Sultan’s office did not respond to a request for comment and newly appointed ministers refused to comment during national day celebrations last week. The Sultan, however, is still popular. He marked 50 years in power last October, with a glittering procession through the capital on a gilded chariot, cheered by well-wishers. But in the long run, an economy based on dwindling single source of income could erode the relationship between the ruler and his subjects, said Muang Zarni, democracy advocate and a former research fellow at the London School of Economics. “That doesn’t mean that will translate into street protests. But Bruneians know things are not as rosy as they appear in the Sultan’s newspapers and TV channels,” said Zarni, who quit the University Brunei Darussalam in 2013 over what he said was a lack of academic freedom.

2018-03-05,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 5 (Reuters) - At times when fear and loathing are amped-up it often pays to take a more dispassionate look at what is likely to happen, as opposed to what is feared will happen. The planned U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium certainly had the effect of raising political and economic temperatures across the world amid fears that President Donald Trump is taking the first step in a global trade war that will end in a 1930s-style depression. However, there is still a long road to travel from the imposition of tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium to a collapse of the post-World War II global economic order, even if you believe Trump has opened that door and is preparing to charge through it. Much will depend on what the rest of the world does in response to the U.S. moves. The smart play is probably to condemn vociferously in public but to do very little in terms of retaliation, while at the same time reaching out to the Trump administration in the hope of toning down its anti-trade rhetoric and actions. Assuming Trump’s measures don’t spark an ongoing tit-for-tat trade war, it will likely become clear that the tariffs are likely to have only a small impact on global commodities, and are effectively an own-goal for the United States. That’s a big assumption, and one not yet in evidence given Trump has seemingly doubled-down on his anti-trade views, saying in a tweet that “trade wars are good, and easy to win,” a phrase that may yet become his political epitaph. But the extent of the poor reaction to the planned tariffs, especially from industries Trump has counted among his supporters, such as oil and gas, coupled with the negative reaction of equity markets may yet give his administration pause for thought. At any rate, assuming a global trade war can be avoided, the effect of the U.S. tariffs should be to make steel and aluminium more expensive inside the country, while making it relatively cheaper elsewhere in the world. If countries that export to the United States find they can no longer ship the same volumes, they can either find new markets or cut production. Given that China, the world’s top steel producer, only ships a fraction of its exports to the United States, it’s likely to be the least affected among Asia’s steel makers. Japan and South Korea may find the going tougher, but if those countries do end up with steel gluts, it will likely lower costs for their significant automotive industries, thus improving their export competitiveness. Aluminium is also a major input into car manufacturing, as well as in other manufactured goods that are commonly imported by the United States. Canada, Brazil and Mexico, the first-, second- and fourth-largest steel exporters to the United States respectively, will find it tough to compete in Asian markets, and are therefore most at risk from Trump’s planned tariffs. At the margin, lower Brazilian steel exports may free up some iron ore for increased exports, but it seems likely at this stage that seaborne iron ore is unlikely to suffer much change to either demand or supply from the U.S. tariffs. Looking at other commodities, it’s likely that a similar pattern emerges - namely that the United States hurts itself more than others. While steel tariffs won’t directly increase the cost of crude oil, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and coal in the United States, it will deliver an indirect impost, given these industries use steel as an input. Pipelines, import and export terminals, railroads and mines are all significant steel consumers, and higher costs for U.S. producers of oil, LNG and coal will serve to erode their margins against competitors elsewhere in the world. Again, much of this is at the margin, with higher steel costs likely to make only a tiny difference to actual costs for producing the commodities that the United States exports. Far more important is the likely hit to sentiment, which is two-pronged. Firstly, U.S. commodity exporters that are currently enjoying good times in crude, LNG and coal, are likely to be somewhat more cautious in planning capital expenditure. Secondly, buyers of U.S. commodity exports, while still largely driven by price, may subtly change their buying patterns in favour of other suppliers given the increasing view in the rest of the world that Trump’s America isn’t a friendly place to do business with. For example, a South Korean buyer of LNG or coal may choose to buy from Australia instead of the United States, if the price differential is small, as a subtle way of getting back at Trump for hurting South Korea’s steel industry. Again, none of this is certain and behavioural economics are far from an exact science. “I’ve had a lot of worries in my life, most of which never happened,” American writer and humorist Mark Twain wrote. Trump’s proposed tariffs have certainly increased the world’s worries, but if the response is mature and considered, the worst fears may not be realised.

2018-03-05,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s state planner pledged on Monday to cut more steel and coal production capacity this year, putting the country on track to beat its long-term targets, as Beijing reinforced its vow to beat smog and make “skies blue again”. At the opening of the annual meeting of parliament, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a work report it will reduce steel capacity by around 30 million tonnes and coal output by about 150 million tonnes this year. The cuts would put the world’s top steel maker and coal miner on track to meet its 2020 targets in the government’s five-year plan about two years ahead of schedule. The cutbacks came as Premier Li Keqiang said in prepared remarks that the government would consolidate gains made in the country’s fight against pollution to defend the “blue of our skies. China planned to cut emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, major sources of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5, by 3 percent this year, Li said. That’s the same as the 2017 targets, which were easily exceeded. Elsewhere, the NDRC report largely reiterated existing goals, underscoring China’s years-long determination to crack down on pollution, cut back supply in bloated heavy industries and upgrade fossil-fuel energy sources by cutting coal use in favor of cleaner energy. In both steel and coal, it has focused on shutting outdated, more polluting plants, while bringing on more efficient operations with lower emissions to ensure supply. Steel output hit a record last year, while coal production also rose. The 2018 cuts were higher than expected, said Zhang Min, a coal market analyst at China Sublime Information Group. “Setting a high target this year showed the government is not slowing down the pace of reform for the two industries,” said Zhang. AHEAD OF LONG-TERM TARGETS     Cutting 30 million tonnes of steel capacity in 2018 will bring the total reduction over three years to 145 million tonnes. That will put China well ahead of a plan to reduce excess by up to 150 million tonnes by 2018 to 2020. Steel rebar prices dipped 0.7 percent in morning trade, as the news was largely priced in after Beijing flagged last month that it expected to meet the objective in 2018.  A cut of 150 million tonnes of coal this year would bring the total cut since the start of 2016 to 590 million tonnes, well ahead of the five-year plan by the world’s top coal consumer to slash 500 million tonnes of coal capacity by 2020. Thermal coal futures were down 0.7 percent, hitting their lowest since mid-Janauary as concerns about falling demand offset news of the cuts. In 2017, China produced 3.45 billion tonnes of coal in 2017, up 3.2 percent from the previous year and a record 832 million tonnes of steel. Also in the report, the government said it will shut coal-fired power plants with capacity of less than 300,000 kilowatts that fail to meet emission standards in 2018. The NDRC said it also will continue to focus on merging and restructuring steel companies, and guard against eliminated capacity coming back online.

Italian voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, flocking to anti-establishment and far-right parties in record numbers and casting the euro zone’s third-largest economy into a political gridlock that could take months to clear. After a see-saw start, the common currency eased back to $1.2333 from a two-week high of $1.2365 as the eurosceptic 5-star Movement saw its support soar to become the largest single party, according to projections based on early vote-counting. “There is a highly uncertain landscape that this election has thrown up,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. “It adds to a period of uncertainty and is euro negative in the near-term at least.” Even so, the euro was supported by the revival of Germany’s grand coalition over the weekend, meaning Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives will form a new government more than five months since the country’s inconclusive election. The euro also got a lift from safe-haven flows, as did the yen, with risk sentiment souring after U.S. President Donald Trump proposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminium, rattling financial markets. The dollar fell for a fourth straight session to trade around 105.53 yen, but was slightly above Friday’s low of 105.23, a level not seen since November 2016. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, was a tad weaker. “Nothing’s happened over the weekend to soften concerns about trade wars or retaliatory actions by other countries. There is no rowing back so that gets us to a cautious start,” NAB’s Attrill added. News over the weekend suggested that Trump was going ahead with his threat, while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs planned on imported steel and aluminium. Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. China said on Sunday it did not want a trade war with the United States but will defend its interests, adding policies based on “mistaken assumptions” will damage bilateral relations. Asian shares started the week on the defensive despite a late rebound on Wall Street on Friday as investors worried a U.S.-led trade war could derail economic momentum around the world. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a touch weaker, hovering near the lowest since mid-February. It ended last week down more than 2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.4 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI faltered 0.3 percent and Australian shares declined 0.3 percent. U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.2 percent and Dow futures off 0.1 percent. “Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut. “A number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of a parliamentary election in Italy.” Chinese shares were buoyant, with the blue-chip CSI 300 up 0.3 percent and Shanghai’s SSE Composite climbing 0.2 percent after Chinese Premier Li Keqiang predicted the country’s economy will expand by around 6.5 percent this year. In commodities, oil prices rose ahead of meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global oil glut. Brent crude was up 42 cents at $64.79 a barrel while U.S. light crude edged up 40 cents to $61.65. Spot gold climbed 0.3 percent to $1,325.76.

2018-03-05,"* Le Drian in Tehran for talks with senior Iranian officials * Visit comes as Trump deadline to fix nuclear deal looms * France to assess if Iran ready for talks on ballistic programme By John Irish TEHRAN, March 5 (Reuters) - France’s foreign minister was in Iran on Monday to reaffirm Europe’s commitment to a nuclear deal that opened the Iranian economy to investment, but also to echo concerns raised by U.S. President Donald Trump who has threatened to quit the agreement. Jean-Yves Le Drian will tell Iran it must address the West’s misgivings about its ballistic missile programme and military activities around the Middle East - points the White House says need attention if the nuclear pact is to survive. “We’re not going to be Donald Trump’s envoys or Iran’s defence lawyers,” said a French diplomatic source. “We have our own concerns and will talk to the different sensibilities of the Iranian system to get our point across.” Trump has said European allies must help “fix” the nuclear deal before a May 12 deadline. The 2015 accord between France, Britain, Germany, Russia, China and the United States gave Iran relief from economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear programme, allowing Tehran to talk trade with Europe for the first time in years. France has been quick to restore trade ties. Planemaker Airbus, oil major Total and automobile manufacturers Peugeot and Renault have signed deals, all of which could be at risk if Trump walks out of the accord. In an effort to keep him on board, French President Emmanuel Macron has criticised Iran’s ballistics programme and raised the possibility of new sanctions. On the eve of Le Drian’s visit, he told President Hassan Rouhani France expects Iran to make a “constructive contribution” to solving crises in the Middle East, Macron’s office said on Sunday. Tehran supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad against rebels, including groups backed by the West, and backs Israel’s enemy Hezbollah in Lebanon. The two presidents agreed in their phone call to work together in the coming days with the United Nations, the Syrian government and other countries involved to improve the situation for civilians and make a ceasefire effective, Paris said. France has urged Washington to see the nuclear deal separately from Iran’s regional activities and its missile programme, and Le Drian will stress Macron’s commitment to the nuclear accord, especially as Iran is respecting its terms, French officials said. Le Drian is due to meet Rouhani and Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as well as officials close to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, including Ali Shamkhani, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council. Khamenei said on March 1 that Iran would keep supporting Assad’s war effort and a Foreign Ministry spokesman on Sunday rejected Macron’s comments about Iran’s missile programme, insisting its “defensive missile work” would continue. An official close to Rouhani said Iran “has always been open to talks and to resolve issues through diplomacy ... but this does not mean we will yield to unjust pressure over our inevitable rights, whether defensive or anything else.” While France says Iran is sticking to the terms of the nuclear deal, it may not be respecting part of U.N. resolution 2231 that calls on it to refrain from work on ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear warheads. The resolution enshrines the nuclear deal, which itself makes no explicit reference to the ballistics programme, but it is unclear whether the wording binds Tehran to an obligatory commitment on missiles. “On the ballistics, the Iranian programme is not compatible with 2231 and we have a particular concern on the transfer of know-how of ballistic capacity to regional actors and by that we mean Hezbollah,” said the diplomatic source. A second diplomat said: “While our concerns aren’t directly linked to the nuclear deal, it’s important we make progress on these other subjects because otherwise Trump risks killing the deal.” (Additional reporting by Parisa Hafezi Editing by Richard Lough and Robin Pomeroy)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-france/french-minister-to-lay-out-concerns-on-ballistics-regional-role-in-iran-visit-idUKL8N1QK6AI,05 Mar 2018,"* France to assess if Iran ready for talks on ballistic

2018-03-05,"(Adds quote, details on OPEC production cuts, Venezuela) By Marianna Parraga HOUSTON, March 4 (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has not discussed “at this stage” extending production cuts into next year, the group’s president said on Sunday, adding that reducing global crude supply inventories remained its focus. Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei, the United Arab Emirates oil minister and OPEC’s president, said in a brief interview ahead of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston: “We feel there is still some market overhang.” The group and allies agreed last year to cut combined output by about 1.8 million barrels per day to drain a global oil glut. The agreement began in January 2017 and runs through the end of this year. Production cuts by the group and non-OPEC member countries led by Russia have helped stabilize oil prices mostly above $61 a barrel this year and any decision to phase out or extend the curbs would affect global prices. Saudi Arabia said last week it hoped the agreement could be relaxed next year and followed by a permanent framework to stabilize oil markets after the deal expires. “There are no talks about that (extending cuts into 2019) at this stage,” Mizrouei said. Mizrouei also said the oil cartel last year discussed OPEC-member Venezuela’s falling production and offered technical aid to help restore the South American country’s output. Venezuela’s oil production fell 13 percent in 2017 to a 28-year low of about 2.072 million bpd. OPEC believes Venezuela will be able to rebuild its production, Mizrouei said. The United States, Canada and Mexico recently formed a working group to address the potential impact on Caribbean nations of the U.S. restricting imports of Venezuelan crude. Caribbean countries received subsidized fuel and earn income from hosting oil storage and shipment facilities used by Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA oil firm.

Three aftershocks stronger than magnitude 5 shook the mountainous Southern Highlands, about 600 km (370 miles) northwest of the capital Port Moresby early on Monday, the U.S. Geological Survey said, including a shallow magnitude 6 quake. “We haven’t slept. It’s been shaking all through the night,” said William Bando, provincial administrator of Hela Province, by telephone from Tari, about 40 km from where the shocks hit. “What we experienced this morning could have caused more damage, but we don’t know ... it almost threw me out of bed.” The national disaster centre in Port Moresby could not immediately be reached by telephone. The strong tremors hit a region already badly damaged by the magnitude 7.5 quake that struck on Feb. 26, the largest to hit the seismically-active highlands in nearly a century, triggering landslides, flattening buildings and closing oil and gas operations. While the region has no major urban centres, around 670,000 people live within 100 km (62 miles) of the epicentre, according to the Red Cross. At least 13 people were killed when hamlets nearest the epicentre were buried. Most of the other casualties were in the provincial capital of Mendi and the township of Tari, officials told Reuters. The quake has been felt on global natural gas markets, with ExxonMobil Corp declaring force majeure on exports from Papua New Guinea, according to an industry source, pushing Asian spot liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices LNG-AS 5 percent higher. The company declined to comment. Aid agencies have said nearly 150,000 people remain in urgent need of emergency supplies. Australia, New Zealand and the Red Cross have all pledged aid, though reaching the remote area has proven challenging as forbidding terrain, bad weather, as well as damaged roads and runways have delayed aid efforts. “The rugged terrain and loss of communications in the area impacted means it is taking time to build a complete picture of the damage but we know that tens of thousands of people are reported as requiring humanitarian assistance,” New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said in a statement on Monday.

Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI was flat and Australian shares declined 0.3 percent. U.S. stock futures did not inspire much confidence, with S&P E-Minis down 0.1 percent. News over the weekend suggested that Trump was going ahead with his threat, while there was no indication that allies would be excluded from the tariffs planned on imported steel and aluminium. Canada and Mexico have threatened retaliation, and the European Union said it would apply 25 percent tariffs on about $3.5 billion of imports from the United States if Trump carried out his threat. Trump says the tariffs are needed to protect domestic industries against unfair competition from China and elsewhere. “Despite staging a comeback, major U.S. indexes suffered their worst week since early February,” said James McGlew, executive director for corporate stockbroking at Perth-based Argonaut. “A number of other fears linger as investors reassess the prospects for continued global growth, brace for the possibility of a broader trade war and await the outcome of a parliamentary election in Italy.” In commodities, Brent crude was up 35 cents at $64.72 a barrel while U.S. light crude edged up 34 cents to $61.59. Spot gold was a tad firmer at $1,323.53.

2018-03-05,"SEOUL, March 5 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose early on Monday ahead of a meeting between OPEC and U.S. shale firms in Houston, raising expectations that oil producers would discuss further how to clear a global oil glut. Oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other global oil players are set to gather in Houston as CERAWeek, the largest energy industry conference, begins on Monday. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo and other OPEC officials are expected to hold a dinner on Monday with U.S. shale firms on the sidelines of te conference. International benchmark Brent crude was up 36 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $64.73 a barrel by 0027 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 35 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $61.60 per barrel. Rising U.S. shale oil production has been a drag on the OPEC’s commitment to erode a prolonged global oil glut and prop up prices. U.S. energy companies added 1 oil rig in the week to March 2, bringing the total count to 800, the highest level since April 2015, according to a weekly report from General Electric’s Baker Hughes unit. Speculators raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude futures and options in the week to Feb. 27 for the second consecutive week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday. Money managers also upped their bullish bets on Brent crude, InterContinental Exchange (ICE) data showed.
