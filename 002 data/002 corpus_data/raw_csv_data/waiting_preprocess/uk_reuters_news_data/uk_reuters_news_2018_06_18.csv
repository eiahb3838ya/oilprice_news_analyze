2018-06-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stocks ended lower on Monday as investors eyed an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China while oil prices rose on bets that an OPEC production increase would be smaller than expected. A jump in energy shares helped limit losses in Wall Street’s major indexes, which closed well above session lows.  U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, effective July 6. China said it would retaliate immediately by suspending previous trade agreements with Trump’s administration and slapping duties on American exports, including crude oil. “The biggest thing hanging over markets is trade and the back and forth between the U.S. and China,” said Chris Zaccarelli, Chief Investment Officer, Independent Advisor Alliance in Charlotte, North Carolina.  “But, if people thought this was really going to be a trade war stocks would be down a lot more. The fact they’re down so little means that people think what the Trump administration is doing is part of their negotiating strategy.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 103.01 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,987.47, the S&P 500 lost 5.8 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,773.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.65 point, or 0.01 percent, to 7,747.03. The energy sector was the S&P 500’s second most positive boost with a 1.1 percent increase as crude oil futures reversed earlier losses to settle higher. U.S. crude rose 1.11 percent to $65.78 per barrel after hitting a two-month low of $63.59 and Brent was last at $75.26, up 2.48 percent on the day after falling to a six-week low of $72.45.

OPEC and some allies including Russia have been restricting output since the start of 2017. Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York, said indications from OPEC members and other large producers on the scale of potential production increases would drive the oil market this week. “Clearly investors have already priced in some easing on the production limits that OPEC has had in place now for some time,” said Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, in New York. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.80 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.43 percent. U.S. long-dated Treasury yields were volatile after a hectic week when the Federal Reserve struck an upbeat tone on the U.S. economy.

2018-06-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Monday in volatile trade as market participants lowered their expectations for how much OPEC might increase production and investors assessed the impact of a trade dispute between the United States and China. U.S. crude oil CLc1 rose 79 cents a barrel to settle at $65.85. The contract traded at a two-month low of $63.59 early in the session. Brent crude LCOc1 jumped $1.90 to $75.34 a barrel. U.S. crude’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened to as much as $9.75 a barrel, after narrowing on Friday. China imposed import duties on U.S. products on Friday, and suggested that crude oil tariffs were planned. That could leave growing volumes of U.S. crude from shale without a buyer, traders said. While the volumes would ultimately get shipped elsewhere, absent China the price could be depressed, traders said.  Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied oil producers including Russia meet on June 22 in Vienna. Russia and OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia are pushing for higher output. In May, Brent hit a 3-1/2-year high above $80 a barrel, but has since slid on reports of the potential production increases.  “Volatility is going to be pretty high this week,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. Indications from OPEC members and other large producers on the scale of potential output increases are likely to drive the market, he said.  Russia and Saudi Arabia have put forward a proposal to increase production from OPEC and non-OPEC countries by 1.5 million barrels per day, Ecuador’s oil minister said on Monday. But OPEC’s second- and third-largest producers, Iraq and Iran, have said they would oppose steep output increases as it would breach previous agreements to keep production cuts in place until the end of the year. The market traded higher on expectations that the production increases could be less than the full 1.5 million bpd, at 300,000 to 600,000 bpd, said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford.  Supply disruptions in Venezuela and Libya also supported the market, he said.  Venezuela’s state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela has seen its operations mired by problems ranging from fast-declining crude production and poor refining due to a lack of equipment, to obstacles for exporting oil amid port congestion and financial sanctions. Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) said storage capacity at Ras Lanuf port had been cut by 400,000 barrels after a second crude oil tank was set on fire amid fighting between rival factions for control of two key export terminals. Rising output from U.S. shale has stoked worries about potential oversupply, however. Five U.S. shale executives were set to speak at the OPEC seminar this week, but three, including Continental Resources Chief Executive Harold Hamm, have withdrawn. U.S. crude production from major shale formations is expected to rise 141,000 barrels per day (bpd) in July from the previous month to a record 7.34 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a monthly productivity report on Monday. Despite potential downward pressure from large producers increasing output, Goldman Sachs maintained its bullish outlook. The bank said “the oil market remains in deficit ... requiring higher core OPEC and Russia production to avoid a stock-out by year-end”. The bank said it expected OPEC and Russian output to rise 1 million bpd by year-end and another 0.5 million bpd in the first half of 2019. Societe Generale said it expects Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait to increase output by a combined 500,000 bpd beginning in July, and Russia to increase by 200,000 bpd within two to three months.  “The focus will be on replacing Venezuelan losses,” the bank said.  Adding extra pressure are global trade tensions. U.S. President Donald Trump last week pushed ahead with tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, starting on July 6, leading China to retaliate with the threatened oil tariffs. “It’s more of a threat than anything,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Potomac Research. “They’re trying to gain leverage in a soft spot for Trump to use for other concessions later.” Additional reporting by Henning Gloystein in Singapore and Christopher Johnson in London; editing by Cynthia Osterman and Rosalba O'Brien",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-12-oil-rises-ahead-of-opec-china-tariffs-loom-over-u-s-prices-idUKL4N1TK18A,18 Jun 2018,"* China, big buyer of U.S. crude, threatens oil import

The energy sector was the S&P 500’s most positive boost with a 1 percent increase as crude oil futures reversed earlier losses to settle higher. U.S. crude was last up 1.18 percent at $65.83 per barrel after earlier hitting a two-month low of $63.59 and Brent was last at $75.35, up 2.6 percent on the day after falling to a six-week low of $72.45.

On top of trade, a potentially destabilizing spilt in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition over a migration plan weighed on the euro and put further pressure on European shares. Germany’s DAX fell 1.4 percent while France’s CAC 40 declined 0.9 percent. U.S. 10- and 30-year Treasury yields turned positive in the late morning after falling for two consecutive sessions. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.9278 percent, from 2.924 percent late on Friday. The 30-year bond last fell 7/32 in price to yield 3.0568 percent, from 3.047 percent late on Friday. The immediate fallout from the trade dispute was limited in currencies although the escalation seemed to encourage some risk aversion as the safe-haven Japanese yen recovered from three-week lows against the dollar. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of major currencies, fell 0.02 percent, while the euro was up 0.09 percent to $1.1617. “It’s tough to say whether it will spiral further because it’s so fluid. It does weigh on sentiment at times,” said Eric Viloria, currency strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. “Our base case is that there won’t be a trade war.” However, the yuan CNH=D3 fell to 6.4600 per dollar, its weakest in five months in the offshore market. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.15 percent, trading at 110.51 per dollar. Additional reporting by Richard Leong, Gertrude

2018-06-18,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia have put forward a proposal to increase production by OPEC and non-OPEC countries by 1.5 million barrels per day, Ecuador’s oil minister said on Monday. Carlos Perez said on his arrival in Vienna for the meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that this was the only proposal he has seen being put forward, and that the proposed increase would be from the quota that the members of the deal had agreed on. OPEC’s second and third largest producers Iraq and Iran have said they would oppose steep output increases as it would breach previous agreements to keep production cuts in place until the end of the year. Both countries would struggle to increase output significantly, as Iran is facing renewed U.S. sanctions that will impact its oil industry and Iraq still has production constraints. By contrast Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies have capacity to raise output and have said they were keen to meet calls from consumers such as the United States and China to cool down oil prices and help meet global oil demand. Russia has also said that limiting production for too long could encourage too much production growth from the United States which is not part of the agreement to curb output.

2018-06-18,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian President-elect Ivan Duque has promised to unite a divided country behind his plans to toughen a peace accord with Marxist rebels and rekindle economic growth, but he will face major challenges when he takes office in August.  The right-wing former senator comfortably won Sunday’s election with 54 percent of votes against leftist rival Gustavo Petro, who garnered 42 percent with his pledge to shake up Colombia’s economic model and tackle inequality. Both the Colombian peso and local Treasury bonds fell on Monday due to external factors, analysts said, though in the medium term investment flows are expected to increase based on support for Duque’s business-friendly policies. The peso was down 0.95 percent to 2,923.05 per dollar while the yield on local Treasury bonds, known as TES, coming due in July 2024 rose to 6.17 percent from 6.14 percent on Friday. It was the first presidential election since a 2016 peace agreement with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended its part in a five-decade conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions.     Duque, 41, pledged in his victory speech to unite the polarized Andean country and tackle corruption, improve security and increase educational opportunities. “Peace is something all Colombians yearn for, and peace means that we turn the page on the fissures that have divided us,” Duque told cheering crowds at his celebration party on Sunday night in Bogota as confetti rained down.  Duque, a protégé of hard-line former President Alvaro Uribe, first grabbed attention railing from Congress against the peace deal, which he believes is too easy on former rebel leaders. Striking a conciliatory tone on Sunday, he promised to guarantee justice for victims and the reintegration of rank-and-file rebels into Colombian society. His aim of revamping the agreement to impose tougher punishment on FARC leaders for war crimes will face considerable opposition from the Constitutional Court and Congress, where most parties favour implementing the existing accord. The FARC has invited Duque to discuss the accord. “He is going to have a harder time passing reforms to the peace agreement than he would have his supporters believe,” said Sergio Guzman, Colombia lead analyst for consultancy Control Risks, singling out the Constitutional Court, which has already ruled that the deal cannot be changed. The nine-judge court is responsible for deciding whether laws passed by Congress are in line with the constitution. Duque needs to include politicians from centrist parties in his cabinet if he wants to unite the country, Guzman said. He is likely to reveal the names of some ministers this week. Duque will face no shortage of security challenges. Crime gangs allied with Mexican drug traffickers, the National Liberation Army (ELN) - the remaining rebel group - as well as FARC dissidents who have refused to demobilize, have moved into territory left behind by the FARC. Only 19.3 million people, just over half of eligible voters, participated in the election, suggesting some centrists did not like either choice. Duque has promised to bolster Colombia’s $324 billion economy with tax cuts and support for extractive industries such as oil and coal, the country’s top exports. The government expects the economy to grow 2.7 percent this year.  “With the election of Ivan Duque the business sector, made up of both local and foreign investment, will see fiscal reforms that will seek a reduction of the tax burden for businesses and the simplification of administrative processes,” said Ciro Meza of law firm Baker McKenzie. Some economists are concerned that Duque’s proposed tax cuts may worsen the budget deficit and force him to push through unpopular reforms, including a pension overhaul, to preserve Colombia’s investment-grade credit rating. Ratings agency Fitch said on Monday that Duque’s victory signals a continuation of economic policies but added that a fiscal consolidation and encouraging growth are his government’s key challenges.  While oil has been the main driver for peso movements, the election has added to the currency’s volatility according to Kenneth Lam, a New York-based Latin America foreign exchange strategist at Citigroup. “Now that we got the (electoral) outcome we expected, oil reverts to be the main driver” for the peso, which has been outperforming other Latin American currencies, he said.  Alberto Carrasquilla, who served as finance minister during Uribe’s first term and was Duque’s economic adviser during the campaign, could reprise the finance minister role, Capital Economics said in a note, and would be “a safe pair of hands.” Duque has said he will curb ELN attacks on pipelines and invest in state-run oil company Ecopetrol’s refineries to allow exports of more higher-value crude derivatives. Although Petro, a former M19 rebel, won a majority in only eight provinces and the capital Bogota, the fact that a leftist received 8 million votes, versus 10.3 million for Duque, is historic in traditionally conservative Colombia.  The fractured left has failed for decades to come close to winning Colombia’s presidency, overshadowed by right-wing contenders who promised security. Yet the FARC deal has shifted priorities for many of Colombia’s more than 50 million people.  Voters are interested in tackling inequality, corruption and inadequate social services, which could create opportunities for the left. “If Duque is not able to get moving on his promises and see concrete results, and if he doesn’t look for reconciliation, the left could win in 2022,” said Andres Pardo, head of investment holding company Corficolombiana.

2018-06-18,"LONDON, June 18 (Reuters) - Swedish power producer Vattenfall is on course to pay a dividend on annual profits for a second year in a row as it benefits from higher European electricity prices, its chief executive told Reuters. After years of losses caused by a financially disastrous expansion out the Nordic region that led to huge writedowns and job losses, Vattenfall announced its first dividend in five years in February, based on its 2017 results. Meanwhile, an unusually cold winter pushed up power prices in Vattenfall’s markets, creating a positive start to 2018. “We are working towards increasing our profits. We are now entering a price increase environment ... If nothing very particular happens, I hope to pay dividend,” CEO Magnus Hall said. Vattenfall aims to establish a dividend-paying run of years, he said, but declined to give a dividend or profit forecast for 2018. “Dividend is important. If you started to pay dividend I think it is prudent to expect a strategy where you don’t see one year paying a dividend and the next one not paying,” he said. In February, Vattenfall proposed a dividend of 2.0 billion crowns ($227 million), or 24 percent of its after-tax profit to its owner, the Swedish government, against a target range of 40–70 percent of profit after tax. In May, Vattenfall announced a deal with Facebook to supply the U.S. company’s Scandinavian data centres with power from Norway and Sweden, and said it was aiming for more such deals. Although power prices in the two Nordic countries have doubled this summer compared with a year ago, operating data centres there was still more attractive than elsewhere in Europe, Hall said. “They (data centre operators) look at Sweden and Norway as countries where prices have been traditionally lower than in Europe and where they would expect them to be lower in the future, in comparison,” he said. Norway and Sweden face higher power costs this summer as much of the snow in their mountains evaporated or melted into the ground during a heat wave from mid-May until early June, instead of reaching hydropower reservoirs.

2018-06-18,"(New throughout, adds China tariff details, OPEC background) By Ernest Scheyder VIENNA, June 18 (Reuters) - Harold Hamm, founder and chief executive officer of Continental Resources Inc, has canceled a scheduled appearance at an OPEC event this week in Vienna, a company spokeswoman said. Hamm is the third of five U.S. shale executives to withdraw from a scheduled speaking slot at the OPEC meeting in Vienna. His withdrawal comes days after a trade skirmish between China and the United States intensified, with China imposing $50 billion in tariffs on U.S. crude oil and other goods, a retaliatory measure on Washington’s tariffs of Chinese products. Continental, the largest oil producer in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation, has been a key supplier of crude oil to China, shipping more than 1 million barrels to the country since a U.S. crude export ban was lifted in 2015. It was unclear how China will replace that source of crude, but several OPEC countries produce crude grades similar to Continental’s Bakken wells. Continental spokeswoman Kristin Thomas confirmed Hamm’s withdrawal, saying the event did not fit with his schedule. The company did not immediately respond to requests for further comment on the China tariffs. Hamm, who was an informal campaign adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump in 2016 and was considered for a U.S. Cabinet post, had been listed since at least March on the OPEC International Seminar's website as a speaker here. His attendance had been widely anticipated as he had derided OPEC as a ""toothless tiger"" in 2014. Trump also chided OPEC last week, blaming the group for rising oil prices and saying its 14 members were “at it again.” Yet, Hamm has appeared in recent months to be trying to reach a more conciliatory tone with OPEC producers. Last month he attended a board meeting of Saudi Aramco, the oil producer controlled by OPEC’s largest member, Saudi Arabia. He has also begun asking fellow shale producers to focus more on profitability and less on profligate production. Hamm’s withdrawal leaves only two U.S. shale executives confirmed to speak at the event, out of an original five. Centennial Resource Development Inc CEO Mark Papa and ConocoPhillips Ryan Lance also withdrew from the OPEC event. Lance himself pulled out because of concerns his participation would seem as if he were the designate U.S. representative at such a forum, according to a source familiar with the company’s thinking. Pioneer Natural Resources Co Executive Chairman Scott Sheffield and Hess Corp Chief Executive John Hess are still slated to attend.

Trade fears also pushed U.S. long-dated Treasury debt yields lower. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday announced tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, starting on July 6. China said it would retaliate immediately by suspending previous trade agreements with Trump’s administration and slapping duties on American exports, including crude oil. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was last down 0.5 percent, after falling to its lowest point since June 1. “The trade war is definitely on the front burner right now, and will continue to be in the absence of news catalysts and unless something substantially changes,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist, B. Riley FBR in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 152.58 points, or 0.61 percent, to 24,937.9, the S&P 500 lost 6.53 points, or 0.23 percent, to 2,773.13 and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.06 points, or 0.01 percent, to 7,747.43. On top of trade, a potentially destabilizing vote in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition partner over a migration plan weighed on the euro and put further pressure on European shares. Germany’s DAX was down 1.3 percent while France’s CAC 40 declined 1 percent. Crude oil futures reversed course and turned positive. U.S. crude rose 0.23 percent to $65.21 per barrel after earlier hitting a two-month low of $63.59 and Brent was last at $74.68, up 1.69 percent after falling to a six-week low of $72.45. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is de facto led by Saudi Arabia, is due to meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide production policy. OPEC and some allies including Russia have been restricting output since the start of 2017. U.S. 10- and 30-year Treasury yields fell for a third consecutive session in generally thin volume, while those on two-year notes were steady, underscoring the Federal Reserve’s tightening monetary policy. Ten-year notes last rose 3/32 in price to yield 2.915 percent, from 2.924 percent late on Friday while the 30-year bond last fell 1/32 in price to yield 3.0481 percent, from 3.047 percent late Friday. The immediate fallout from the dispute was limited in currencies although the escalation appeared to encourage some risk aversion as the safe-haven Japanese yen recovered from three-week lows against the dollar.

2018-06-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - A consortium led by top oil trader Vitol has entered exclusive talks to acquire stakes in Nigerian offshore fields that are held by Brazil’s Petrobras (PETR4.SA) and its partners, industry sources said. The assets are estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion, the two banking sources and one industry source told Reuters. The buyers are talking to state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, which is leading the sale, the sources added. bit.ly/2tjCAKu The buying consortium comprises Vitol, Vancouver-based Africa Oil (AOI.TO) and Delonex Energy, an Africa-focused oil company backed by private equity fund Warburg Pincus and the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Delonex, Petrobras and Vitol declined to comment. Africa Oil did not respond to a request for comment. The Vitol-led group emerged as winners from a number of groups that bid for the assets in its initial two rounds, which included rival commodity trader Glencore. Heavily indebted Petrobras launched the sale of Petrobras Oil & Gas BV, or Petrobras Africa, in which it holds 50 percent, as part plans to offload $21 billion in assets through 2018. The sale, announced last year, includes the 40 percent stake of Petrobras Africa held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and the 10 percent holding owned by Helios Investment Partners. Scotiabank is running the sale process with Evercore, according to the sale document. The deal would offer the consortium a stake in some of Nigeria’s largest and lowest-cost fields. Vitol is expected to shoulder the largest part of the investment, spending an estimated $1 billion, according to one source. Petrobras Africa has stakes in two offshore blocks, known as OMLs, that contain two producing fields. The Agbami field in OML 127 is operated by an affiliate of U.S. firm Chevron (CVX.N) and the Akpo field in OML 130 is operated by Total SA (TOTF.PA). The Agbami oilfield is the main prize, producing about 240,000 bpd of light, sweet crude. Petrobras Africa holds a 12.5 percent stake in the field, Statoil has 20.2 percent and Chevron holds a 67.3 percent stake. The Akpo field produces nearly 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate and Total is also due to start production at the Egina development in OML 130 later this year.

2018-06-18,"(Adds Equinor, drilling ban details) By Nerijus Adomaitis OSLO, June 18 (Reuters) - Norway has awarded 12 oil and gas exploration licences to Equinor and 10 other companies focused mostly on the Arctic, where Oslo believes it has the greatest potential for significant new discoveries. Nine of the licences are located in the Barents Sea and three in the Norwegian Sea off central Norway, the Ministry of Oil and Energy said on Monday. “This licensing round confirms that the oil companies see opportunities for further profitable petroleum activity in the north,” Oil and Energy Minister Terje Soeviknes said in a statement. Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, was awarded five licences and will participate as a non-operating participant in a further two. “In contrast to the awards of the 23rd licensing round, the majority of these awards are less mature and therefore require more work before the drilling candidates are ready,” Equinor said in a statement. The award includes one firm commitment to drill an exploration well in the southwestern part of the Barents Sea, it added. Shell, Aker BP, Lundin, OMV and Spirit Energy, a joint venture between Britain’s Centrica and Germany’s Bayerngas, were also offered operatorships. Licence operators determine exploration programs and sign contracts with suppliers, in coordination with partners. In addition, DEA, Idemitsu, M Vest Energy, VNG and Wintershall were awarded participating interest. The number of firms applying for blocks in the 24th licensing round fell to 11 from 26 in the previous round two years ago, with analysts pointing to last year’s disappointing exploration campaign that resulted in a few minor discoveries. Aker BP won operatorships in two licenses located near Bear Island, although the government said drilling would be banned between April 1 and August 15 to protect important nesting grounds for Arctic Birds. The company was not immediately available to comment on how this would impact plans. The restriction was added as a result of coalition talks after parliamentary elections last September. Environmental groups have protested against oil exploration in Arctic waters citing the risk of oil spills, and Norway’s commitments to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. Greenpeace and other activists this year lost a lawsuit arguing that exploration in Norway’s northernmost region is unconstitutional and should be banned as it violates the right to a clean environment. An appeal in the case is pending. Oil and gas production accounts for about 40 percent of Norway’s exports and helped to build the world’s largest sovereign wealth fund.

2018-06-18,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. LNG, coking coal, crude oil: reut.rs/2JP6Ub5 By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 18 (Reuters) - China’s threat to impose tariffs on U.S. crude oil, certain refined products and coal is possibly the only sign of clear thinking in the increasingly muddled escalating trade dispute with the administration of President Donald Trump. The tariffs on energy imports were mooted by the Chinese on June 15 as part of their response to the U.S. announcement of tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports. To be clear, the tariffs on crude oil and products and coal are still in the realm of the possible, and it will likely take a further deterioration in the relationship between the world’s two largest economies to turn them into a reality. It was also curious that the list of potential targets for customs included natural gas in its gaseous form, but not as liquefied natural gas (LNG). China imports zero gaseous natural gas from the United States, but is major buyer of its LNG. The Chinese threat to impose tariffs on energy imports makes sense from two perspectives. The first is that in economic terms it’s generally best to put tariffs on goods with high elasticity, in other words goods you can substitute relatively easily from other suppliers. The second is that if the aim of your tariffs is to inflict sufficient pain on the other country, it’s best to target them where they can do the most damage to the economy, or the politicians promoting the trade war. Looking at the first point, it’s clear that China would be able to source crude oil, refined products and coal from other countries, even if it had to pay slightly more. The Chinese have become a major buyer of U.S. crude, importing about 319,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first five months of the year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. This makes China the biggest net buyer of U.S. crude (Canada imports more but also exports to the U.S.), and therefore an important customer for the booming shale industry. With U.S. crude exports running at about 2 million bpd, China’s purchases represent about 16 percent of the total. However, U.S. crude supplies to China account for only about 3.5 percent of the country’s total daily imports. What this is likely to mean is that China will find it easier to replace U.S. crude imports than U.S. producers will to get new customers. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario whereby China encourages Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s top oil exporters and partners in the agreement to restrict output, to pump more crude. China would then buy the additional Saudi and Russian output, using it to replace cargoes from the United States, and even from Iran, assuming the renewed U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic force Beijing to curtail imports. Turning to coal, the majority of China’s imports from the United States are coking coal, used in steel making. Supply of this type of coal is more concentrated, with Australia dominating the seaborne market. But absent a weather-related disruption in Australia, it’s likely China could buy all it needs without tapping U.S. supplies, although this may result in a shuffling among buyers. For example, Japan may buy more from the United States and less from Australia. Looking at natural gas, and while LNG remains off the customs list for the time being, the Chinese could also probably replace what they buy from the United States from other countries if needed. In the first five months of the year, the United States supplied about 8.2 percent of China’s LNG imports, according to vessel-tracking data. However, China bought about 22 percent of all U.S. LNG exports, meaning that China is more important to U.S. LNG producers than they are to the Chinese. By putting energy imports on the agenda for tariffs, even if LNG is excluded so far, the Chinese have put doubt in the minds of investors thinking of putting capital into a new U.S. LNG project. The second leg to China’s threat is that any tariff on U.S. energy imports will strike at the heart of President Trump’s support base. Coal miners count among Trump’s most vocal backers, but if China does stop buying U.S. coking coal, it may force producers to accept lower prices from other buyers in order to move cargoes. The oil and natural gas industries have also been viewed as largely in Trump’s corner and they are concentrated in states won by the former reality television star in his unexpected 2016 triumph. Losing as big a buyer as China may force producers to accept lower prices or even reduce output. Energy is also one of the few areas where the Chinese have genuine scope to increase purchases from the United States, thereby making it key to any efforts to lower the trade surplus China has with the United States. Flagging energy imports as a possible target in the current trade skirmish comes across as a sign that Beijing is entirely serious about engaging in a tit-for-tat escalation with Trump. The Chinese have probably calculated that they can take the pain from a trade conflict longer than Trump can, or at least longer than the U.S. economy, companies and workers will be prepared to tolerate.

Fears the spat between the world’s two largest economies could intensify added to pressure on oil prices, which extended Friday’s big fall into the start of week, while the dollar retreated from a seven-month high against a basket of currencies. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.3 percent, nearing a seven-day low. Trump announced tariffs on Friday on $50 billion of Chinese imports, including cars, starting on July 6. China said it would retaliate immediately by slapping duties on American export products, including crude oil, and suspend all previous trade agreements with Trump’s administration. The exchange of blows between Washington and Beijing has heightened fears of a protracted dispute that could hurt global growth and particularly Europe, given that Trump has signalled he wants to impose tariffs on automotive exports. Those concerns saw European bourses start the week in the red, after Asian shares fell early on Monday to a 2-1/2 week low. Futures on main euro zone benchmarks were trading down 0.2-0.5 percent as investor angst about the outlook for economic growth filtered through to European stocks. The pan-regional STOXX 600 was on track to relinquish gains recorded on Thursday when a dovish European Central Bank pushed back expectations for an interest rate hike. Germany’s DAX was down 1.36 percent while France’s CAC 40 declined 1.23 percent. “This all shows how quickly trade tensions could escalate between the U.S. and China,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG Bank. “It may not be the end of the matter as U.S. officials are looking at another $100 billion of Chinese imports on which they could impose tariffs if desired,” he said. A potentially destabilising vote in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition partner over a migration plan weighed on the euro and could put further pressure on European shares. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures fell to a six-week low of $72.45 a barrel on Monday after reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia would likely agree to increase production at the June 22 OPEC meeting in Vienna. U.S. light crude oil hit a two-month low of $63.59 a barrel before recovering somewhat to trade at $64.72, down 30 cents, by 1100 GMT. The producer cartel of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is de facto led by Saudi Arabia, and some allies including Russia have been restricting output since the start of 2017. They will meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide future production policy. China has hiked its list of U.S. goods on which it said it would slap tariffs six-fold from a version released in April, but the value was kept at $50 billion, as some high-value items such as commercial aircraft were deleted. Some analysts, however, believe there is still room for compromise, suspecting Trump’s announcement was a negotiating tactic to wring faster concessions from Beijing. Analysts also say the direct impact of the tariffs may be limited, especially for the U.S. economy, which is in decent shape. The immediate fallout from the dispute was limited in currency markets although the escalation appeared to encourage some risk aversion as the safe haven Japanese yen recovered from three week lows against the dollar. A mild reaction in the dollar suggested that the exchange of blows was anticipated in some markets. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies crept down 0.1 percent to 94.729. The index remained close to 95.131, though, a peak scaled on Friday, thanks to the dollar soaring more than 1 percent last week after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave a hawkish signal on interest rates while the European Central Bank struck a dovish tone. The euro traded at $1.6165, not far from a recent two-week low of $1.1543 after the European Central Bank suggested it would hold off raising interest rates through the summer of next year. The Australian dollar, a liquid hedge for risk, slipped to a six-week trough while its New Zealand cousin fell to the lowest since end-May. Asian trade-reliant economies and companies plugged into China’s supply chains are worried that they will suffer collateral damage if world trade slows down, hurting global growth and dampening business confidence. “There are trade frictions not only between the U.S. and China but also between the U.S. and its allies. Trump could put more pressure on other countries like Japan and NATO courtiers,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “So far investors have been escaping to high-tech shares and small cap shares. After all, money is still abundant. But investors should be cautious.” (Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Adrian Croft and Richard Balmforth)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-global-stocks-oil-suffer-as-u-s-china-trade-spat-heats-up-idUKL8N1TK24Q,18 Jun 2018,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh

2018-06-18,"* Eskom began power cuts last week after wage protests * Utility produces 90 pct of South Africa’s electricity * Unions had wanted 15 pct pay hikes, Eskom offered no rise * Inflation-linked wage settlement now more likely (Recasts to focus on inflation-linked deal) By Ed Stoddard and Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, June 18 (Reuters) - South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) is open to an inflation-linked pay rise for its members at struggling state power firm Eskom instead of its initial demand for a 15 percent increase, a source at the union told Reuters. Africa’s most industrialised economy suffered power outages last week because of what Eskom had said was an “illegal protest action” by the NUM and two other unions. The unions, who were incensed by Eskom’s initial refusal to offer pay rises for this year, had threatened a “total shutdown” of the power firm. The last time there were controlled power outages in South Africa, in 2015, economic output suffered. The NUM source, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters on Monday that the mineworkers’ union would consider a wage offer from Eskom of “inflation plus a certain percentage”. South Africa’s consumer inflation was running at 4.5 percent in April, well below the level unions had initially targeted. Cutting costs at troubled state entities such as Eskom is a top priority for President Cyril Ramaphosa, and the labour dispute at Eskom will test his administration’s commitment to reforms aimed at putting a sluggish economy on a sustained growth path. Eskom produces more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power and was embroiled in corruption scandals under former president Jacob Zuma. It has said it could be forced to resume controlled power cuts - known locally as load-shedding - on Monday evening, when electricity demand is higher in the winter season. A potential stumbling block to the conclusion of a wage deal between Eskom and unions this week was that the NUM is scheduled to hold its national congress from Wednesday to Friday, when new union leaders will be elected. But the NUM, the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) and Solidarity all agreed to resume talks on Tuesday after Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said that Eskom would make a pay hike offer. Gordhan oversees Eskom in Ramaphosa’s cabinet and is guiding efforts to reform South Africa’s cash-strapped state-owned companies. The three unions, the NUM, NUMSA and Solidarity, say they together represent more than half of Eskom’s 47,000 employees. Deon Reyneke, deputy secretary general of the Solidarity trade union which represents mostly skilled workers, said Eskom had signalled to unions that it would be looking at a formula linked to consumer inflation for its next wage offer. Phakamile Hlubi-Majola, a NUMSA spokeswoman, said the metalworkers’ union would not reveal its negotiating position until talks had started. Eskom has now conceded that it will grant some increase in wages. Asked about the NUM source’s comment on an inflation-linked increase, Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the company’s management was still “crunching the numbers” ahead of the resumption of talks. Phasiwe said Eskom had been able to return several generating units to the grid on Sunday as some workers had returned to work. He said the power firm, which narrowly avoided a liquidity crunch early this year, had sent a “positive signal” to employees by agreeing that a zero percent salary increase was now off the table.

2018-06-18,"BOGOTA, June 18 (Reuters) - Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque has promised to unite a divided country behind his plans to toughen a peace accord with Marxist rebels and to rekindle economic growth, but he will face major challenges when he takes office in August. The right-wing former senator comfortably won Sunday’s election with 54 percent of votes against his leftist rival Gustavo Petro, who garnered 42 percent with his pledge to shake up Colombia’s economic model and tackle inequality. Market reaction to Duque’s victory is expected to be muted because he held a strong poll lead going into the election and investors are largely supportive of his business-friendly economic policies. It was the first presidential election since a 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which ended its part in a five-decade conflict that has killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. Duque, 41, pledged in his victory speech to unite the polarized Andean country and tackle corruption, to improve security and increase educational opportunities. “Peace is something all Colombians yearn for and peace means that we turn the page on the fissures that have divided us,” Duque told cheering crowds at his celebration party in Bogota as confetti rained down. Duque, a protégé of hard-line former President Alvaro Uribe, won fame railing from Congress against the peace deal - which he believes is too easy on former rebel leaders. Striking a conciliatory tone on Sunday, he promised to press ahead with implementing the disarmament and reinserting ordinary rebels into Colombian society. His aim of revamping the agreement to impose tougher punishments for war crimes on FARC leaders will face considerable opposition from the Constitutional Court and Congress, where most parties favor implementing the existing accord. “He is going to have a harder time passing reforms to the peace agreement than he would have his supporters believe,” said Sergio Guzman, Control Risks’ lead analyst for Colombia, singling out the Constitutional Court, which has already ruled that the deal cannot be changed. Duque needs to include politicians from centrist parties in his cabinet if he wants to unite the country, Guzman said. He is likely to reveal the names of some ministers this week. Only 19.3 million people, just over half of eligible voters, participated in the election, suggesting some centrists preferred not to vote for either choice. Duque has promised to bolster Colombia’s $324 billion economy via tax cuts and support for extractive industries such as oil and coal, the country’s top exports. The government expects the economy to grow 2.7 percent this year. “From an economic point of view, Duque’s victory is reassuring,” said Carlos Sepulveda, the dean of economy at Rosario University. “It creates a positive panorama for the Colombian economy, although there will be a lot of challenges in the months ahead.” Some economists have raised concern that Duque’s proposed tax cuts may worsen the budget deficit and force him to push through unpopular reforms, including a pension overhaul, to preserve Colombia’s investment-grade credit rating. Duque has said he will curb attacks by remaining leftist rebels on pipelines and invest in state-run oil company Ecopetrol’s refineries to allow exports of more higher-value derivatives. Although Petro, a former M19 rebel, won a majority in only eight provinces and the capital Bogota, the fact a leftist got 8 million votes - versus 10.3 million for Duque - is historic in traditionally conservative Colombia. The fractured left has failed for decades to come close to winning Colombia’s presidency, overshadowed by right-wing contenders who promised security. Yet the FARC deal has shifted priorities for many of Colombia’s nearly 50 million people. Voter interest in tackling inequality, corruption and inadequate social services looks set to create opportunities for the left. “If Duque is not able to get moving on his promises and to see concrete results, and if he doesn’t look for reconciliation, the left could win in 2022,” said Andres Pardo, head of investment holding company Corficolombiana.

2018-06-18," LONDON (Reuters) - Investors continued to reduce their overall bullish position in petroleum, but profit-taking concentrated on fuels while signs of stabilisation emerged in crude. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 18 million barrels in the week to June 12. For the third week running, portfolio managers cut net long positions in gasoline (-18 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-8 million barrels) and European gasoil (-8 million barrels). But fund managers left their position in NYMEX and ICE WTI basically unchanged (-2 million barrels) and actually boosted their position in Brent (+18 million barrels). The combined position in Brent and WTI rose by 16 million barrels, ending seven weeks of declines totalling 302 million barrels, according to regulatory and exchange data. (For a chartbook, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2JNK2sE). Profit-taking appeared to have been largely completed on the crude oil side though it still had some way to run on refined products. Fund managers are still heavily bullish towards crude oil, with long positions outnumbering short ones by a ratio of almost 6.5:1. But the positioning has become much less stretched since the middle of April, when the ratio hit 15:1, following heavy profit-taking. By contrast, positioning in gasoline (12:1), heating oil (4:1) and gasoil (59:1) still appears very stretched by past standards for these contracts. The fundamental outlook has become more complicated and uncertain in recent weeks, which appears to be holding prices about $5 per barrel below their month-ago highs. Oil consumption growth remains strong but there are growing doubts about the sustainability of recent rapid growth rates given the 70 percent increase in prices over the past year. OPEC and its allies seem poised to increase production to offset some of the output lost from Venezuela and prospective production losses from Iran as a result of sanctions. However, the magnitude and timing of any production increase remains unclear and it will leave little spare capacity to deal with any further supply disruptions in 2018/19. In the last year, the world economy has been growing at some of the fastest rates since the global financial crisis in 2008/09, helping drive a rapid rise in fuel consumption, especially for middle distillates. But recent indicators have shown signs of slowing growth outside the United States, and the escalating tariff battle between the United States and China threatens to sap business confidence and growth.

Fears the spat between the world’s two largest economies could intensify added to pressure on oil prices, which extended Friday’s big fall into the start of week, while the dollar retreated from near 3-week highs against the safe-haven yen. Trump announced tariffs on Friday on $50 billion of Chinese imports, including cars, starting on July 6. China said it would retaliate immediately by slapping duties on American export products, including crude oil, and suspend all previous trade agreements with Trump’s administration. The exchange of blows between Beijing and Washington has heightened fears of a broader and more protracted dispute, sending Asian shares to a 2-1/2 week low. European shares opened lower as investor angst about the outlook for economic growth filtered through to European stocks. The STOXX 600 slipped 0.3 percent and Germany’s DAX was down 0.5 percent while France’s CAC 40 declined 0.7 percent. “This all shows how quickly trade tensions could escalate between the U.S. and China,” said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at MUFG Bank. “This may not be the end of the matter as U.S. officials are looking at another $100 billion of Chinese imports on which they could impose tariffs if desired,” he said. A potentially destabilising vote in German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition partner over a migration plan could put further pressure on European shares. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures fell to a six-week low of $72.45 a barrel on Monday on worries about a hit to global growth from the trade dispute and after reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia would likely agree to increase production at the June 22 OPEC meeting in Vienna. U.S. light crude oil hit a two-month low of $63.59 a barrel before edging back to $64.00, down $1.06, by 0755 GMT. The producer cartel of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is de facto led by Saudi Arabia, and some allies including Russia have been restricting output since the start of 2017. They will meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide future production policy. China has hiked its list of U.S. goods on which it said it would slap tariffs six-fold from a version released in April, but the value was kept at $50 billion, as some high-value items such as commercial aircraft were deleted. Some analysts, however, believe there is still room for compromise, suspecting Trump’s announcement was a negotiating tactic to wring faster concessions from Beijing. Analysts also say the direct impact of the tariffs may be limited, especially for the U.S. economy, which is in decent shape. The immediate fallout from the dispute was limited in currency markets. A mild reaction in the dollar suggested that the exchange of blows was anticipated in some markets. The dollar index versus a basket of six major currencies crept up 0.1 percent to 94.862. The index was close to 95.131, a peak scaled on Friday, thanks to the dollar soaring more than 1 percent last week after the U.S. Federal Reserve gave a hawkish signal on interest rates while the European Central Bank struck a dovish tone. The euro traded at $1.1565, not far from a recent two-week low of $1.1543 after the European Central Bank suggested it would hold off raising interest rates through the summer of next year. The Australian dollar, a liquid hedge for risk, slipped to a six-week trough while its New Zealand cousin fell to the lowest since end-May. Asian trade-reliant economies and companies plugged into China’s supply chains are worried that they will suffer collateral damage if world trade slows down, hurting global growth and dampening business confidence. “There are trade frictions not only between the U.S. and China but also between the U.S. and its allies. Trump could put more pressure on other countries like Japan and NATO courtiers,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “So far investors have been escaping to high-tech shares and small cap shares. After all, money is still abundant. But investors should be cautious.” (Additional reporting by Hideyuki Sano in Tokyo; Editing by Adrian Croft)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-global-stocks-oil-suffer-as-u-s-china-trade-spat-heats-up-idUKL8N1TK1E9,18 Jun 2018,"Global stocks slid on Monday and

2018-06-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - London Mayor Sadiq Khan and other city leaders from across Britain said on Monday a government plan to ban the sale of new diesel and petrol cars should be brought forward by 10 years to 2030, in the latest push to improve air quality. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Conservative government said last year it would ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2040 although it is unclear whether that includes hybrid vehicles, which have both an electric and combustion engine. The government is due to detail the proposals in a “Road to Zero” plan shortly, but on Monday, Khan joined mayors and city leaders from Manchester, Liverpool, Oxford, Sheffield and Bristol to call for the measures to be implemented quicker.  “Banning the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2030, providing support to deliver Clean Air Zones in cities and introducing a national vehicle renewal scheme will dramatically improve our air quality and our health,” said Khan, who is from the opposition Labour Party.  Cities and nations around the world are introducing restrictions or bans on the use of vehicles powered by combustion engines in the years ahead to cut high levels of pollution.  Carmakers have argued that cleaner diesel models play a part in bringing down overall carbon dioxide emissions but demand for the segment has nosedived in much of Europe for over a year as many authorities plan clampdowns and tax hikes.

2018-06-18," LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - China’s threat to impose tariffs on U.S. crude oil, certain refined products and coal is possibly the only sign of clear thinking in the increasingly muddled escalating trade dispute with the administration of President Donald Trump. The tariffs on energy imports were mooted by the Chinese on June 15 as part of their response to the U.S. announcement of tariffs on $50 billion worth of imports. To be clear, the tariffs on crude oil and products and coal are still in the realm of the possible, and it will likely take a further deterioration in the relationship between the world’s two largest economies to turn them into a reality. It was also curious that the list of potential targets for customs included natural gas in its gaseous form, but not as liquefied natural gas (LNG). China imports zero gaseous natural gas from the United States, but is major buyer of its LNG. (GRAPHIC: China's imports of U.S. LNG, coking coal, crude oil: reut.rs/2JP6Ub5) The Chinese threat to impose tariffs on energy imports makes sense from two perspectives. The first is that in economic terms it’s generally best to put tariffs on goods with high elasticity, in other words goods you can substitute relatively easily from other suppliers. The second is that if the aim of your tariffs is to inflict sufficient pain on the other country, it’s best to target them where they can do the most damage to the economy, or the politicians promoting the trade war. Looking at the first point, it’s clear that China would be able to source crude oil, refined products and coal from other countries, even if it had to pay slightly more. The Chinese have become a major buyer of U.S. crude, importing about 319,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first five months of the year, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts. This makes China the biggest net buyer of U.S. crude (Canada imports more but also exports to the U.S.), and therefore an important customer for the booming shale industry. With U.S. crude exports running at about 2 million bpd, China’s purchases represent about 16 percent of the total. However, U.S. crude supplies to China account for only about 3.5 percent of the country’s total daily imports. What this is likely to mean is that China will find it easier to replace U.S. crude imports than U.S. producers will to get new customers. It’s not hard to imagine a scenario whereby China encourages Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s top oil exporters and partners in the agreement to restrict output, to pump more crude. China would then buy the additional Saudi and Russian output, using it to replace cargoes from the United States, and even from Iran, assuming the renewed U.S. sanctions against the Islamic Republic force Beijing to curtail imports. Turning to coal, the majority of China’s imports from the United States are coking coal, used in steel making. Supply of this type of coal is more concentrated, with Australia dominating the seaborne market. But absent a weather-related disruption in Australia, it’s likely China could buy all it needs without tapping U.S. supplies, although this may result in a shuffling among buyers. For example, Japan may buy more from the United States and less from Australia. Looking at natural gas, and while LNG remains off the customs list for the time being, the Chinese could also probably replace what they buy from the United States from other countries if needed. In the first five months of the year, the United States supplied about 8.2 percent of China’s LNG imports, according to vessel-tracking data. However, China bought about 22 percent of all U.S. LNG exports, meaning that China is more important to U.S. LNG producers than they are to the Chinese. By putting energy imports on the agenda for tariffs, even if LNG is excluded so far, the Chinese have put doubt in the minds of investors thinking of putting capital into a new U.S. LNG project. The second leg to China’s threat is that any tariff on U.S. energy imports will strike at the heart of President Trump’s support base. Coal miners count among Trump’s most vocal backers, but if China does stop buying U.S. coking coal, it may force producers to accept lower prices from other buyers in order to move cargoes. The oil and natural gas industries have also been viewed as largely in Trump’s corner and they are concentrated in states won by the former reality television star in his unexpected 2016 triumph. Losing as big a buyer as China may force producers to accept lower prices or even reduce output. Energy is also one of the few areas where the Chinese have genuine scope to increase purchases from the United States, thereby making it key to any efforts to lower the trade surplus China has with the United States. Flagging energy imports as a possible target in the current trade skirmish comes across as a sign that Beijing is entirely serious about engaging in a tit-for-tat escalation with Trump. The Chinese have probably calculated that they can take the pain from a trade conflict longer than Trump can, or at least longer than the U.S. economy, companies and workers will be prepared to tolerate.

2018-06-18,"(Repeats Friday’s story without changes) * Major central bank chiefs meet in Portugal * Euro zone consumer, business sentiment data due * Bank of England could give pointers to rate move in August By Philip Blenkinsop BRUSSELS, June 15 (Reuters) - Is Europe’s economy merely encountering a soft spot or entering a more lasting decline? Bank of England policymakers are likely to debate this question in the week ahead, while data from the euro zone will indicate whether European Central Bank President Mario Draghi is right to refer to current conditions simply as a “soft patch”. A cold snap from February into March, later Easter holidays than usual and strikes took their toll in the first quarter, but hard data since have not pointed to a clear rebound. In announcing an end to bond purchases by the end of the year, Draghi said such softness could last longer than currently projected by ECB economists. “In some countries, for example, it is foreseen that it may extend into the second quarter,” he said, while adding the underlying strength of the economy did not appear changed, albeit with greater uncertainty, such as over global trade. Peter Vanden Houte, chief euro zone economist at ING, said markets were very much looking for news to test the ECB’s idea that the economy would grow at a satisfactory pace in the second quarter and possibly even accelerate afterwards. “This is still in doubt because you might also have a further deceleration of the economy. That will remain very much in the mind of traders and economists,” he said. Belgian central bank chief Jan Smets, an ECB Governing Council member, said an improving labour market, with income gains, and accommodating monetary policy, were foundations for growth in the coming years. “That cannot make us blind that, especially in the global environment, there are prominent risks which may even have increased. One is the protectionist measures, which I regret,” he said. Draghi may also return to this issue at the ECB Forum on Central Banking in Portugal. He gives a speech on Tuesday and appears on a panel the day after with U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, Bank of Japan governor Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia head Philip Lowe. Survey data on Thursday and Friday may then provide some answers. The euro zone flash estimate for consumer confidence on June 21 is forecast to decline for a second consecutive month, with the index turning negative for the first time since October. On Friday, IHS Markit’s composite flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) for the euro zone, seen as a good guide to overall economic health, is seen unchanged. However, this would match an 18-month low and with the manufacturing component expected to fall for a sixth straight month. “These are the first figures that will actually show what has been the impact of Italy,” Vanden Houte said, referring to Italy’s new government of anti-establishment parties. They will also be the first survey data since U.S. President Donald Trump made EU steel and aluminium subject to import tariffs. Draghi said on Thursday that the impact in Europe of U.S. tariffs was limited to date, but a series of tit-for-tat measures could particularly hit confidence. With political uncertainty in Germany too, it is only a dip in oil prices after an upward march of 11 months that has really provided some comfort. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other producers meet in Vienna from Friday and could agree to increase production from July. In Britain, the Bank of England (BoE) is expected to keep interest rates on hold, but the focus will be on indications for its following meeting in August, when markets put the chance of a hike at about 50 percent. The chances of a rate increase were pegged back in the past week by softer than expected manufacturing, earnings and inflation data. Its announcement will come on Thursday, with no news conference, though BoE governor Mark Carney will deliver a speech at the annual banker’s dinner at London’s Mansion House that evening. The BoE has said it wants to be sure the economy has recovered from near-stagnation in an unusually cold early 2018, before pushing ahead with only its second rate hike since before the global financial crisis. In the United States, there is little on the economic front to occupy markets a week after the Federal Reserve increased interest rates for the second time this year and signalled more to come. The global trade war could though ramp up a notch after Trump announced new tariffs of $50 billion of Chinese imports and Beijing threatened to respond in kind.

2018-06-18,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s threat to impose duties on U.S. oil imports will hit a business that has soared in the last two years, and which is now worth almost $1 billion per month. In an escalating spat over the United States’ trade deficit with most of its major trading partners, including China, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week he was pushing ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, starting on July 6. China said Friday it would retaliate by slapping duties on several American commodities, including oil. Investors expect the spat to come at the expense of U.S. oil firms, pulling down the share prices of ExxonMobil and Chevron by 1 to 2 percent since Friday, while U.S. crude oil prices fell by around 5 percent. “This escalation of the trade war is dangerous for oil prices,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore. “Let’s hope cooler heads prevail, but I’m not overly optimistic,” he added. To view a graphic on  Russia vs Saudi vs U.S. oil production, click: reut.rs/2JAw1dG The dispute between the United States and China comes at a pivotal time for oil markets. Following a year and a half of voluntary supply cuts led by the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), as well as the non-OPEC producer Russia, oil markets have tightened, pushing up prices. The potential drop-off in American oil exports to China would benefit other producers, especially from OPEC and Russia. The OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia and Russia indicated on Friday they would loosen their supply restraint and were starting to raise exports. A cut in Chinese purchases of U.S. oil may also benefit Iran’s sales, which Washington is trying to curb with new sanctions it announced in May. “The Chinese may just replace some of the American oil with Iranian crude,” said John Driscoll, director of consultancy JTD Energy Services. “China isn’t intimidated by the threat of U.S. sanctions. They haven’t been in the past. So in this diplomatic spat they might just replace U.S. crude with Iranian oil. That would obviously infuriate Trump,” he said. To view a graphic on U.S. crude oil exports to China, click: reut.rs/2ymEr7m China’s aggressive riposte to Trump took some in the industry by surprise. U.S. crude exports to China have been rising sharply, thanks to a production surge in the past three years that was a welcome alternative to make up for the cut in supplies from OPEC and Russia. “We’re caught by surprise that crude oil is on the list,” said an official with a Chinese state oil major, asking not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. “We were actually preparing to raise imports according to an earlier government line,” he added, referring to a Beijing policy enacted earlier this year to help reduce the U.S. trade deficit with China. U.S. oil exports, which have been surging thanks to a sharp increase in production in the past three years, were seen as a viable alternative to make up for the cut in supplies from OPEC and Russia. Shipping data in Thomson Reuters Eikon shows that U.S. crude oil shipments to China have soared in value recently, jumping from just $100 million per month in early 2017 to almost $1 billion per month currently. The threatened tariff would make U.S. oil more expensive versus supplies from other regions, including the Middle East and Russia, and likely disrupt a business that has soared recently. “With Trump’s politics, we’re in a world of re-aligning alliances. China will not just swallow U.S. tariffs,” said Driscoll. “This is tit-for-tat petroleum diplomacy,” he added. “The OPEC/non-OPEC cartel is the big beneficiary of all this oil diplomacy, as it will squeeze global spare oil capacity and likely push up crude prices.” To view a graphic on ExxonMobil & Chevron share prices, click: reut.rs/2MyQUrv (This version of the story has been refiled to fix graphic links.)

Fears of a global trade war added to pressure on oil prices, which extended Friday’s big fall, while the dollar retreated from near 3-week highs against the safe haven yen. Spreadbetters suggested a subdued start for European shares, with FTSE futures off about 0.1 percent. U.S. E-Mini S&P futures stumbled 0.5 percent, suggesting a weaker start on Wall Street. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.5 percent to its lowest level since May 31. Financial markets in China and Hong Kong were closed for Dragon Boat festival holiday. Japan’s Nikkei sank 0.8 percent as worries over growing protectionism overshadowed stronger-than-expected export data. “The on-again off-again possible global trade war is looking to be back on again as the U.S. and China announced tariffs on each other’s imports,” said Nick Twidale, Sydney-based analyst at Rakuten Securities Australia. “This looks set to be the main theme that investors will focus on...with any further escalation in tension adding to the downside risk.” Trump announced hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports on Friday, laying out a list of more than 800 strategically important imports from China that would be subject to a 25 percent tariff starting on July 6, including cars. China said it would respond with tariffs “of the same scale and strength” and that any previous trade deals with Trump were “invalid.” The official Xinhua news agency said China would impose 25 percent tariffs on 659 U.S. products, ranging from soybeans and autos to seafood. China’s retaliation list was increased more than six-fold from a version released in April, but the value was kept at $50 billion, as some high-value items such as commercial aircraft were deleted. However, many market watchers believe there is still room for compromise, suspecting Trump’s announcement was a negotiating tactic to wring faster concessions from Beijing. “Ultimately, a negotiated solution is likely – and this is what both the U.S. and China want - but the risks are high and the tariffs could well be implemented before the issue is resolved,” said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based chief economist at AMP. Analysts say the direct impact of the tariffs may be limited, especially for the U.S. economy, which is in strong shape. But Asia’s other trade-reliant economies and companies plugged into China’s supply chains are worried they will suffer collateral damage if world trade slows down, hurting global growth and dampening business confidence. Shares of Japanese construction equipment makers Komatsu Ltd and Hitachi Construction Machinery tumbled 3.9 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively. Both are vulnerable to any downturns in Chinese and global capital spending. “There are trade frictions not only between the U.S. and China but also between the U.S. and its allies. Trump could put more pressure on other countries like Japan and NATO courtiers,” said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo. “So far investors have been escaping to high-tech shares and small cap shares.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures touched their lowest level since April, falling to $63.59 per barrel before edging back to $63.83 a barrel by 0426 GMT. That was still down $1.23, or 1.9 percent, from their last settlement. “Crude oil prices crashed as U.S.-China trade tensions escalated last Friday,” wrote Benjamin Lu of Singapore-based futures brokerage Phillip Futures. In an escalating spat over the American trade deficit with most of its major trading partners, including China, U.S. President Donald Trump last week pushed ahead with hefty tariffs on $50 billion of Chinese imports, starting on July 6. China on Friday said it would retaliate by slapping duties on American export products, including crude oil. “Beijing has retaliated ... with its position as a top importer from the U.S.,” Lu said. “These punitive measures on bilateral trade have unnerved investors as it hurts global economic growth.” International oil prices also fell, with Brent crude futures down 76 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $72.67 per barrel. This was in response to reports that top suppliers Saudi Arabia and Russia would likely increase production. The producer cartel of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which is de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, and some allies including Russia have been withholding output since the start of 2017. They will meet in Vienna on June 22 to decide forward production policy. “Most industry observers are expecting a production rise,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA, although he added that “the magnitude and timing of the boost remain uncertain”.

2018-06-18,"OSLO (Reuters) - At least 25 percent of the plastics used in new Volvo car models from 2025 will be from recycled materials, the Chinese-owned company said on Monday in an anti-pollution plan praised by the United Nations. Recycled plastics - such as from fishing nets or old bottles in car dashboards or carpets, would not affect safety or quality, Stuart Templar, director for sustainability at Volvo Cars, told Reuters.  “We think this makes business sense,” he said.  Many big companies are designing products that can be recycled after use to limit pollution. Volvo’s plan goes a step further by building ever more recycled materials into its production lines. “Volvo Cars is committed to minimising its global environmental footprint,” Håkan Samuelsson, president and CEO of Volvo Cars, which is owned by China’s Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd, said in a statement.  Volvo said it was in talks with plastics producers to achieve its “ambition that from 2025, at least 25 percent of the plastics used in every newly launched Volvo car will be made from recycled material.” Volvo sold 570,000 cars last year, with about five percent of plastics in its cars currently made from recycled materials. Volvo unveiled a test model of its XC60 T8 plug-in hybrid SUV in Gothenburg, Sweden, that it said looks identical to the existing car except that some of its plastic parts were made from recycled materials. The carpet, for instance, had fibres made from PET plastic bottles, old Volvo car seats were used in sound-absorbing material under the bonnet and fishing nets and ropes were used in the tunnel console - between the passenger and driver seats. The United Nations welcomed Volvo’s plan. More than eight million tonnes of plastics end up in the oceans every year, threatening marine life from fish stocks to coral reefs. “As far as we are aware this is a first – an attempt to source waste as a raw material for a new vehicle,” Erik Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Programme in Nairobi, told Reuters. “We need to see a situation in which plastic waste begins to have more value and the processes to transform it into something new will also advance,” he said. In 2017, Volvo said that it would electrify all new cars launched after 2019. Last month it said its aim was  that fully electric cars would make up half of its global sales by 2025.

2018-06-18,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s President-elect Ivan Duque, who swept aside leftist Gustavo Petro in Sunday’s election, pledged to unite his South American nation after a divisive campaign but insisted he would change a landmark peace accord with leftist rebels. Duque’s decisive victory in Sunday’s poll, with 54 percent of votes to Petro’s 42 percent, is likely to reassure investors in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy who were alarmed by the leftist candidate’s promise to overturn Colombia’s orthodox economic model. Yet, in the first presidential election since the 2016 peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Duque worried Colombians with a promise to overhaul the accord that ended a five-decade conflict which killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions. He has promised to impose tougher punishments on rebels for war crimes.  Surrounded by friends and family, Duque thanked voters for handing him the biggest electoral victory in Colombia’s history based on number of votes received. He struck a conciliatory tone, calling for the nation of more than 50 million people to unite behind him after a polarizing campaign. “With humility and honour, I tell the Colombian people that I will give all my energies to unite our country. No more divisions,” Duque told a crowd of cheering supporters in Bogota.  “I will not govern with hatred.”  Duque, 41, the business friendly protégé of hardline former President Alvaro Uribe, has promised to toughen the peace deal  while keeping Colombia’s business friendly economic policies intact. By contrast, former guerrilla Petro had pledged to take on political elites, redistribute land to the poor and gradually eliminate the need for oil and coal in Latin America’s fourth-largest economy. His positions prompted critics to compare him to Venezuela’s former socialist President Hugo Chavez.  Although Petro won a majority in only eight of 32 provinces, and the capital Bogota, the fact that a leftist advanced to the presidential runoff is historic in Colombia, where traditionally conservative politicians have held sway. Petro won 8 million votes versus 10.3 million for Duque.  Petro, 58, had called on supporters to take to the streets if he felt there was widespread manipulation of the tally, but he accepted the outcome of Sunday’s election.  “We accept Duque’s triumph. He is the president of the Republic of Colombia... Today we are the opposition to his government,” Petro, he will return to the Senate, told cheering supporters in Bogota. Duque will face significant challenges when he takes office in August. The economy remains weak; drug trafficking gangs have moved into areas once controlled by the FARC and more than half a million Venezuelan migrants have crossed into Colombia, looking for food and work. His plans to change the peace deal will face considerable opposition in Congress and from Colombia’s Constitutional Court. On Sunday, he said he would make necessary “corrections” to the accord so victims’ rights receive greater priority and justice and reparations are respected. “Peace is something all Colombians yearn for, and peace means that we turn the page on the fractures that have divided us into friends and enemies of peace,” he said, as confetti rained down and supporters danced and honked horns.  “Today, we’re all friends to build that peace and it must be a peace that above all allows the guerrilla base its demobilization, its disarmament and its effective reinsertion.” FARC leader Rodrigo Londono, known as Timochenko, congratulated Duque on Twitter, calling for reconciliation and saying he respected Colombians’ decision. Duque has also promised to bolster the $324 billion economy, keep investors happy by cutting business taxes, support the oil and coal sectors - top exports - and help manufacturing. “It is a result that’s very in line with what the market had been expecting and it guarantees that Colombia’s reputation - political and economic stability - is still valid,” Felipe Campos, head economist at Alianza brokerage, said.  Duque is the candidate for the Democratic Centre Party, a movement started in 2013 by Uribe, seen as the power behind the throne.  A one-term senator, Duque worked at the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington until 2014, when Uribe asked him to return to Colombia and take a seat in Congress. Duque’s running mate, Marta Lucia Ramirez, will be Colombia’s first female vice president. “Our hope has arrived,” said 52-year-old publicist Carlos Cortes, a Duque supporter. “Now, with more respect for private enterprise, more jobs will be generated and we’ll move forward as a country.” For decades, Colombia’s fractured left has failed to come close to winning the presidency or exercising control in Congress, overshadowed by right-wing contenders who have promised strong security policies.  Yet the 2016 deal with the FARC clearly shifted priorities for many voters in the Andean country of nearly 50 million people.  Despite Petro’s loss, voter interest in tackling inequality, corruption and inadequate social services looks set to create opportunities for the left in future, possibly as soon as 2022.

2018-06-18,"MELBOURNE, June 18 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp, southeastern Australia’s biggest gas supplier, is considering importing liquefied natural gas (LNG) to help plug a looming gas shortage from 2021 and protect its market share. The move would compete with plans by both Australia’s no.2 energy retailer AGL Energy to start importing LNG by 2021 and a consortium involving Japan’s JERA to start imports from 2020. ExxonMobil is also stepping up exploration off the coast of Victoria and considering developing a gas field called West Barracouta close to an existing field, it said in an emailed statement on Monday. “Combined with the existing Gippsland resource and infrastructure, an LNG import facility could ensure ExxonMobil can continue to meet our customers’ needs,” the company said. The facility could open by 2022, it said. Australia’s energy market operator warned in March that Victoria, the country’s biggest gas consuming state, could face shortages from mid-2021 due to a rapid drop in supply from the the Gippsland Basin Joint Venture, owned by ExxonMobil and BHP Billiton. Output from the Gippsland Basin, the state’s mainstay supplier over the past 50 years, is expected to fall to just half of 2018 levels by 2022, it said. Even though Australia is set to challenge Qatar as the world’s top LNG exporter, local gas supplies are under threat due to field declines and long-term export contracts. ExxonMobil could use a lot of its existing infrastructure at Longford in Victoria for an LNG import facility. The company declined to comment on an estimate by Macquarie analysts cited in The Australian newspaper that it could build import facilities for around A$100 million ($74 million), less than half the estimated cost of the two rival LNG import plans. AGL is working toward a final investment decision for its import plans by June 2019. “If we saw some new supply come to market that fundamentally changed that market dynamic, we would revisit the business case, but we haven’t seen that to date,” AGL General Manager Phaedra Deckart told Reuters in an interview last week. She said rising LNG prices would not deter the company from going ahead with the plan. “It’s not about what price can we bring LNG into the market. It’s about meeting the needs of our 1.4 million gas customers and the 10 large industrial customers that have executed (tentative agreements) with us and are looking for a new source of supply to meet that shortfall beyond 2020.” $1 = 1.3450 Australian dollars

2018-06-18,"(Repeats with no changes to text) * Teapot refiners swing into losses on stricter tax collection * Some teapots shut for maintenance amid high crude prices * Independents losing market share to state-owned rivals * Processing losses for teapots at 300 yuan a tonne - analyst By Meng Meng and Chen Aizhu BEIJING, June 15 (Reuters) - China’s independent oil refiners are suffering a drastic change of fortune as new tax rules, shrinking diesel demand and higher crude prices threaten their nearly three-year profit bonanza. Industry executives and analysts said nearly 40 private refiners, often called “teapots” - which account for a fifth of China’s almost 10 million barrels per day (bpd) in crude oil imports - are losing money and market share. Several have shut for maintenance to cut exposure to the market, and some teapots may have to shut for good if the conditions continue. “The gains in retail prices at pumps in recent weeks have been completely wiped out by higher costs of crude and a hefty consumption tax,” said Gao Jian, crude oil analyst with China Sublime Information Group. “We expect much weaker margins in June and July as more orders booked at peak crude prices arrive,” Gao said. Asian refining margins have thinned as crude prices surged amid output cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Venezuela supply disruptions and looming U.S. sanctions against major exporter Iran. But China’s independents have also been hit hard by new tax rules that cut even further into their profit. Last month, teapots lost 300 yuan ($46.80) per tonne of crude oil processed, data provided by Zibo Longzong Information Group showed. That is a stunning reversal from a profit of 900 yuan a tonne in early 2016. Beijing enacted new rules in March to enforce collection of a $38 per barrel gasoline consumption tax and a $29 per barrel tax on diesel, a response to the alleged use of illicit fuel invoices by many of the teapots to evade the taxes. The teapots’ plight throws into sharp relief the performances of their state rivals, including top refiners PetroChina and Sinopec, where 2018 profits so far are running at their best in two or more years. State refiners have to pay the consumption tax as well, but their massive local marketing networks and control of China’s fuel exports help to offset the domestic market pressures. The teapots’ influence and size has grown significantly since they began winning crude import licences in 2015. Last year was a blockbuster, as they churned out record earnings, expanded into petrochemicals and beefed up trading teams. This year, in contrast, has been one of deepening trouble, with several teapots shutting for maintenance to avoid losses. Jincheng Petrochemical Co launched a month of maintenance in May at its 5.9 million-tonne-per-year (118,000 bpd) refinery, after losing money on rising crude prices since late March, said a marketing manager with the refinery, declining to be named due to company policy. At an oil trade show late last month in Dongying in Shandong province, home to many teapots, sales managers from more than 20 independents were jostling about trying to sell fuel to major trading firms, state refiners and other teapots. Several, including Wudi Xinyue Fuel and Chemicals Co and Fuhai Group, plan to keep product inventories low, fearing that domestic oversupply could further dampen fuel prices, according to interviews with sales managers at the trade show. “We barely keep any inventory for diesel and gasoline. There are more uncertainties in the market with more refineries coming online this year,” said an executive with a teapot in Dongying. Others like the Haike Group were retreating from the northeastern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning, where last year’s strong sales were not repeating. Haike is instead focusing on areas around Shandong in the east, an executive with the group said. State refiners have access to a surging export market, and dominate China’s retail fuel market, making it easier for them to pass higher crude costs and tax burdens on to consumers. Teapots, however, have to offer more competitive prices and their margins are much thinner. Several independent refiners, including Shandong Zhonghai Fine Chemical Group, Guangrao Kelida Petrochemicals Technology and ChemChina’s Huaxing Petrochemical, said PetroChina and Sinopec were paying for products only at steep discounts to market values and were also reducing purchases. A manager at Kelida, a major supplier of asphalt to PetroChina, said his firm was now struggling to break even compared with a 400 yuan a tonne profit last year. “Wholesale prices offered by PetroChina are so cheap that we will be running at a loss,” the manager said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to media. Zhonghai Fine Chemical, with 2.3 million tonnes a year in crude processing capacity, said Sinopec was ordering far less fuel than last year. “Sinopec has halted buying diesel from us this year. Last year the volume was at least 10,000 tonnes each month,” a manager said, also declining to be named. Teapot managers said they are urging the government to give them leeway in paying the consumption taxes. “We urged the government to reconsider the tax policies. Otherwise some of us are going to fail,” said a manager with ChemChina Huaxing refinery. Sinopec declined to comment on its purchase plans, and PetroChina did not respond to inquiries.

State-controlled PetroChina expects June loadings from Venezuela, mainly the Merey grade, to be half the normal rates, according to two Beijing-based oil officials briefed on the matter. Venezuela’s state firm PDVSA has promised the lost volume would be topped up in July loadings for arrival in August-September, they said. The plunge in supplies to Venezuela’s most important customer, creditor and political ally is the latest indicator of tough times for the cash-strapped country with the world’s largest oil reserves. Crude output fell to the lowest annual average in over three decades between January and April, while claims on assets by creditors have cut off PDVSA’s access to export terminals. The slide cuts both ways. China’s growing thirst for oil amid still-sturdy economic growth is increasing its reliance on imports, while Venezuela’s trouble exporting as its infrastructure crumbles means it’s missing out on crude oil prices that have risen to their highest in years. “One of the best things about Venezuelan oil was its stable volumes for all these years and competitive prices,” said one senior oil industry official with direct knowledge of the supply situation. “But now they seem in very bad shape, not having the money to upgrade port facilities, no money even to remove the high water content in crude oil.” The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorised to discuss the matter with media. Only one supertanker, the “New Pearl” carrying 2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, is set to arrive in China’s eastern province of Shandong in July, down from this year’s monthly peak of 11 million barrels in March, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon trade flows data. That would be the lowest monthly import volume since late 2010, according to Chinese customs data C-IMP-VECN-MTH. PetroChina said it does not comment on market speculation. PDVSA did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Disruptions in Venezuelan crude supplies to China started in April, and from mid-May through early June PDVSA did not load any crude for PetroChina, said the senior oil official. The Chinese firm lifted an average of around 20 million tonnes a year - or 400,000 barrels a day - in 2016 and 2017 of Venezuelan crude oil under a government-to-government loan-for-oil programme. “Venezuela remains the biggest and most visible casualty of the (oil) market share war,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets led by Helima Croft said in a note on Thursday. “We see almost no prospect of a turnaround in the Venezuelan story this year, at least barring a change in government, and even if the country comes under new management, it will still take a considerable amount of time and international assistance to right the ship and restore production.” PDVSA has halted operations at units that convert extra-heavy oil into exportable crude. Early this month it asked customers to transfer oil at sea to clear a backlog of tankers waiting to load at its ports. The Venezuelan firm has notified PetroChina of the new ship-to-ship requirement and agreed also to bear the additional cost, according to another industry executive with knowledge of the matter. One trader with an independent Chinese refiner said he was still receiving offers of Venezuelan oil for August delivery at stable prices compared with a month ago, but added that the supply outlook is murky. “There isn’t a lot of cheap heavy crude (available) so some Chinese refineries might have to change diet a bit,” he said. Sengyick Tee, a Beijing-based consultant at SIA Energy, said Chinese independents have increased imports of other heavy crude grades such as Castilla from Colombia and fuel oil as replacement. Venezuela was the eighth-largest crude supplier to China last year, with 435,400 barrels per day (bpd), behind Brazil, according to China customs data. But it already dropped to the ninth position in the first quarter of this year with an average volume of 381,300 bpd as China ramped up imports from Iraq, Kuwait and Brazil. Venezuelan crude exports to India have also dropped 20 percent in the first five months to 323,600 bpd, according to data from shipping and industry sources. Reliance Industries Ltd and Nayara Energy, key Venezuelan crude buyers, have stepped up imports of similar-quality oil from Brazil, Mexico, Kuwait, Iran, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Chad for replacement, data showed.
