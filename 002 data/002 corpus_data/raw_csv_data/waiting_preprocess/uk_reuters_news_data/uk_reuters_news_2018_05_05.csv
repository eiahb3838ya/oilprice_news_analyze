2018-05-05,"DUBAI (Reuters) - A committee investigating a collision between an Iranian tanker and a Chinese freighter has come to diverging conclusions over the causes of the worst oil ship disaster in decades, Iran’s state television reported on Saturday. The Panama-registered Sanchi, run by Iran’s top oil shipping operator NITC, collided with the CF Crystal, registered in Hong Kong, off the coast of China near Shanghai and the mouth of the Yangtze River Delta on Jan. 6.  The Sanchi sank on Jan. 14 after burning for several days. The entire crew of 30 Iranians and two Bangladeshis, are presumed dead. “(Representatives of) China and Hong Kong believe that both vessels were to blame, but Iran, Panama and Bangladesh see the veering to the right by the Crystal as the cause of the disaster,” Iran’s state TV quoted Nader Pasandeh, the country’s representative on the investigating committee, as saying.  Pasandeh later told the television that a court will likely have to rule in the case. “The issue of the main cause of the disaster is a legal one and it will have to be decided by a court,” he said, without elaborating. The Sanchi was carrying the equivalent of nearly 1 million barrels of ultra-light crude, plus its own fuel, to South Korea. According to the International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation, the collision led to the worst tanker spill in 35 years.

2018-05-05,"WARSAW, May 5 (Reuters) - Seven Polish coal miners were missing on Saturday after a quake hit a mine owned by JSW, the European Union’s largest coking coal producer, officials said. The quake took place in the Borynia-Zofiowka-Jastrzebie coal mine in southern Poland. “According to latest information, seven employees are missing,” the spokeswoman for the WUG mining office, Anna Swiniarska-Tadla, told state news agency PAP. Eight teams of rescuers were at the mine aiming to locate the missing miners, the spokeswoman said. High levels of methane in the air in the area of the quake were hampering the rescue operation.

2018-05-05,"LONDON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Qatar is taking a nearly 19 percent stake in Rosneft (ROSN.MM), rescuing the Russian oil major from its stalled deal to sell a major stake to China’s CEFC. The deal strengthens ties between Moscow and Doha at a time when Qatar is facing boycott by its Gulf Arab neighbors. Qatar’s sovereign investment fund QIA initially bought 19.5 percent in Rosneft together with Swiss trading giant Glencore (GLEN.L) for 10.2 billion euros ($12.2 billion) during the Russian firm’s partial privatization in 2016.  But last year the consortium agreed to sell a 14.16 stake in Rosneft to CEFC China Energy in a $9.1 billion deal that was seen as key to helping expand relations between Russia and China, the world’s top energy exporter and top consumer. That deal ran into trouble after CEFC Founder and Chairman Ye Jianming was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported in March. Glencore said on Friday that the consortium that had been selling the Rosneft stake had been dissolved, and said Qatar and Glencore would now own stakes directly. QIA would control an equity stake of 18.93 percent and Glencore would hold some 0.57 percent. CEFC has not commented publicly since the termination of the deal was announced. The company did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Calls to its Shanghai headquarters were not answered on Saturday. The once high-flying conglomerate is now conducting fire sales of its assets following the investigation into its chief and offering staff severance packages after failing to pay them for two months, as creditors scramble to collect debts amid growing regulatory scrutiny of the firm. “CEFC China’s purchase of a stake in Rosneft has ended in a debacle. Russia’s pivot to the East now feels more like a pivot to the Middle East, with Qatar coming to the rescue,” said Christian Boermel, senior research analyst, Russia Upstream, at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Rosneft was hit hard by U.S. sanctions on Russia over Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and incursion in east Ukraine.  But sources close to QIA have said Rosneft could prove a profitable long-term investment given the giant firm is worth only $65 billion despite producing more crude than U.S. ExxonMobil, which is worth $324 billion. The fate of the CEFC deal, one of the largest investments by China in Russia, was seen as a litmus test of how far President Xi Jinping’s government was prepared to go with a crackdown on financially risky activities among big-spending conglomerates. Rosneft has, however, said it continues to consider China as a strategic market and that it will supply its term contracts based on the agreed timing and volumes to CEFC. The Russian oil major in 2017 signed a five-year contract to supply 12 million tonnes of oil per year to the Chinese firm. Glencore will also keep its long-term crude offtake agreement with the Russian producer under the new arrangement, a source told Reuters.

2018-05-05,"(Adds revenue, year-ago comparisons) RIO DE JANEIRO, May 4 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras Distribuidora SA, the fuel distribution unit of state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, missed net income estimates in the first quarter, a filing showed on Friday. BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, posted net income of 247 million reais ($69.98 million), well below a consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters of 332.37 million reais, but 58 percent above its profit in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - a common gauge of operational profitability - totaled 773 million reais in the period, above a consensus estimate of 733.77 million reais and nearly 20 percent above its EBITDA in the January-March period last year. In its second earnings report since a December initial public offering, the company posted revenue of 22.5 billion reais, just above forecasts for 21.929 billion reais and 12.2 percent over sales in the same period in 2017. Despite higher revenues, volumes sold in the first quarter slipped by 2.2 percent, the company said. Petrobras raked in north of 5 billion reais late last year when it floated a 30 percent stake in the unit as part of a bid to reduce the heftiest debt load among oil majors worldwide.
