2018-04-15,"LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gold and oil traded slightly lower as markets opened for the first time since Western powers launched a missile attack on Syria, but equities are unlikely to experience big losses unless the West strikes again or Russia retaliates. “The news flow is actually better than what it looked like at one point during last week, as the strike was surgical, followed by a pullback. Reports show a lot of care was taken not to hit Russian targets, which is a good sign and the market should take heart from that,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier investment managers in London, speaking before trading resumed. Spot gold and major crude benchmarks eased slightly, as the market reacted to the military actions over the weekend. Treasuries also weakened, while equities rose.  Gold has benefited in recent days as a safe-haven asset amid a U.S.-China trade dispute and the escalating conflict in Syria, which also pushed oil above $70 a barrel because of concerns about a spike in Middle Eastern tensions. “It ended up being a very measured attack,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. “The greater fears of the oil market of this spilling into a greater conflict that could involve Iran and Saudi Arabia has not and will not come to pass.”  World stocks wobbled last week but still ended with the best weekly gain in over a month, as investors await potentially healthy U.S. company earnings. Despite heightened geopolitical risks, the impact on so-called safe-haven assets has been short-lived and modest. While the yen rose initially on fears of a Syrian strike, it ended near seven-week lows to the dollar last week. On Saturday, U.S., French and British missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons program in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack a week ago, although the assault appeared unlikely to halt Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s progress in the seven-year-old civil war. For map of Syrian strikes, see tmsnrt.rs/2EKgAMN The bombing, denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression, was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his powerful ally Russia. But the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war. Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets, said gold was poised to gain on Monday but the rally would not be very steep: “The focus will be on the counter-reaction from Russia.” Gold, often used as a store of value in times of political and economic uncertainty, could rally toward $1,400 per ounce after two consecutive weeks of gains. “If we do break above $1,365, that next week we would be very bullish,” said Aslam. Tokyo will be the first major market to open on Monday and the yen will likely strengthen to the dollar, but not beyond 106.50, said Itsuo Toshima, market analyst at Toshima & Associates, adding that he did not expect stocks traders to make sharp moves. “The first attack was within expectations and was already priced in the market. ... However, if there is a second round of strikes, that is not in line with expectations. So that should prompt a sharp risk-off move in markets,” he added. Frank Benzimra, head of global markets for Asia Pacific at Societe Generale Corporate and Investment Banking, said stocks would plunge only in case of new strikes by Western powers. In case of such an escalation, oil would rally further, the yen would spike and Japan’s domestic defensive stocks would outperform international stocks. “For the stress on Asia equity markets to be sustainable, we would need to have oil prices spiking to such a level that fundamental concerns, i.e. higher inflation and risks on growth, return to the market,” he said. Amrita Sen from Energy Aspects said that despite Middle Eastern tensions and looming new U.S. sanctions on Iran, oil had outperformed most expectations this year and may have rallied too far too fast. “We are likely to get a sell-off this week as the extent of the Syrian strikes have been muted and, in general, calmer nerves prevail in Washington,” she said. Oil traders had locked in long positions ahead of the weekend, in anticipation of potential strikes, sending both West Texas Intermediate CLc1 and global benchmark Brent LCOc1 crude futures to their highest since 2014.

2018-04-15,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday moved to end an escalating crisis over a Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO) oil pipeline, saying Ottawa was prepared to offer financial aid to ensure the project went ahead. Trudeau cited investor confidence as one reason to help Kinder Morgan Canada, part of Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N), which plans to almost triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain line from Alberta to the Pacific province of British Columbia. The company, unhappy about moves by the British Columbia government to impede the C$7.4 billion ($5.9 billion) project on environmental grounds, is threatening to walk away unless it receives sufficient clarity about the path ahead by May 31. “I have instructed the minister of finance to initiate formal financial discussions with Kinder Morgan, the result of which will be to remove the uncertainty overhanging the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project,” Trudeau told reporters, calling the line “a vital strategic interest to Canada.” Trudeau, speaking after an emergency summit with the premiers of Alberta and British Columbia, said “we are actively pursuing legislative options that will assert and reinforce the government of Canada’s jurisdiction in this matter.” He declined to give details on exactly what the ruling Liberals had in mind to end an impasse that is prompting investor unease and could threaten his political future. Both the federal and Alberta governments have already suggested they could take a stake in the project. Speaking before the meeting, a federal government source said past examples of help included a bailout of the auto industry in 2009, federal loan guarantees for a hydro-electric project and Ottawa’s investment in an offshore energy project. “Construction will go ahead,” said Trudeau, who is under increasing pressure from the business community and opposition politicians to take action amid fears the dispute could hit already flagging foreign investment. Kinder Morgan Canada said it would not comment on Trudeau’s remarks “until we’ve reached a sufficiently definitive agreement on or before May 31 that satisfies our objectives.” Many in the energy industry are concerned about whether quarrels over jurisdiction and increasingly vehement protests mean any new pipelines can be built in Canada, which sits on the world’s third-largest proven reserves of crude and is the single largest exporter of energy to the United States. The lack of pipeline capacity means Canadian crude trades at a discount to the U.S. oil benchmark CLc1. Environmentalists and aboriginal activists frequently demonstrate at Trans Mountain facilities and British Columbia police have arrested about 200 people since mid-March. “The federal government can’t buy off the opposition to this failing pipeline ... the resistance continues to grow,” said Mike Hudema of Greenpeace Canada. Although Trudeau’s Liberal government could invoke emergency powers to ensure the project goes ahead, that would most likely anger voters in British Columbia and cost the Liberals support in a federal election in October 2019. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley, who also attended the talks in Ottawa, said she was convinced the expansion would be built if the financial assistance deal could be worked out. British Columbia Premier John Horgan said after the meeting he had not changed his position that the risks of a spill from the pipeline were too great.  Horgan wants Ottawa to refer the matter to the Supreme Court but the Liberals are not interested, saying it is already clear the federal government has jurisdiction over the project. Horgan also said he would ask the courts in British Columbia to make clear how much powers the province had to protect the provincial environment. Federal officials complain this is a time-wasting tactic.

2018-04-15,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Sunday criticised Russia for a series of activities beyond its borders, blaming it for a cyber attack on his own ministry, and said Moscow must change its ways. Maas listed a series of what he called problematic actions that also included the lack of progress in implementing a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, a poison gas attack in Britain, support for the Syrian government, and efforts to influence Western elections. “We had an attack on the Foreign Ministry where we have to assume that it stemmed from Russia,” he told the German broadcaster ZDF. “We can’t just wish all that away ... And I think it’s not only reasonable but necessary to point out that we do not view those as constructive contributions.” German government officials in February disclosed what they called an “isolated” cyber attack on the government computer network that was first discovered in December. The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency last week said there was “a high likelihood” that Moscow was behind the attack. Maas, a Social Democrat who has adopted a tougher stance on Russia than his predecessors from the same party, told the other German public broadcaster, ARD, on Sunday that Moscow had been an increasingly “difficult partner” but Berlin was committed to maintaining dialogue, particularly on the crisis in Syria. “It is time, I think, to point out that we expect constructive contributions from the Russian side, including on the Syrian conflict. And also that they don’t always simply protect (Syrian President Bashar) al-Assad,” he said. Russia has denied any efforts to influence Western elections, and scoffed at suggestions it was behind the cyber attack in Germany. It also denied involvement in a poison gas attack on a former Russian double agent and his daughter in Britain. Western air strikes aimed at destroying Syria’s chemical weapons facilities have exacerbated tensions between Moscow and the West, already at a new post-Cold War high after the expulsion of more than 130 Russian diplomats in response to the nerve agent attack on ex-spy Sergei Skripal. Syria denied using chemical weapons against its civilian population.  German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, another Social Democrat, who has served as foreign minister, on Sunday warned against demonising Russia and said Germany had a particular role to play in maintaining dialogue with Moscow, given its history. Steinmeier told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper he was concerned about a “galloping alienation between Russia and the West” and urged German politicians to avoid portraying Russia and its people as an enemy. Maas on Saturday called for a new international effort to end the war in Syria, and said Germany would use its relationship with Moscow to ensure Russia played a “constructive” role. “Whether we like it or not, the Syrian conflict cannot be resolved without Russia,” he said on Sunday.   Germany, which relies on Russia for about a third of the gas it uses, has long walked a careful line with Moscow — pushing for continued sanctions over Ukraine and eastern Ukraine while also maintaining dialogue and trade relations.

2018-04-15,"* Brent oil trading above $70 a barrel * Saudi’s Advanced Petrochemical rebounds despite Q1 loss * Abu Dhabi’s Aldar up on rise in foreign ownership limit * Dana Gas buoyed by dividend hopes * Dubai retailer Marka plunges on capital change news By Davide Barbuscia DUBAI, April 15 (Reuters) - Most Gulf stock markets rose on Sunday due to firm oil prices and relief that the weekend’s military attack on Syria was relatively limited in scope and there was no immediate retaliation. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles after a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week earlier. The strikes were limited to three alleged chemical weapons facilities, Washington said. “Regional markets have lagged global risky assets over the last four years, so the sharp recovery in oil prices so far further underpins the bull case for regional markets,” said Mohamed El Jamal, managing director at Abu Dhabi’s Waha Capital. “Today’s price action demonstrates that despite the geopolitical risks, investors remain in a buy-the-dip mode in the Gulf Cooperation Council.” Brent crude oil closed Friday at $72.58 a barrel, near multi-year highs. This gave support to the petrochemical sector in Saudi Arabia, where the main stock index rose 1.9 percent on Sunday. Nama Chemicals was the best performer, up 10 percent. Blue chip Saudi Basic Industries added 1.8 percent and Saudi Kayan Petrochemical was up 2.7 percent. Advanced Petrochemical fell in early trade but rebounded to close 2.3 percent higher. The company estimated first-quarter net profit fell to 98 million riyals ($26.13 million) from 124.4 million riyals a year earlier, as sales declined 4.2 percent; analysts surveyed by Reuters had on average forecast profit of 124 million riyals. The Abu Dhabi index rose 1.0 percent, lifted by energy producer Dana Gas, up 2.2 percent, and real estate developer Aldar Properties, which added 2.9 percent. Dana said in late March it would seek shareholder approval to pay a dividend for 2017, its first in years. At the weekend, it published on its website a report by Al-Khaleej newspaper saying “the Board can also now continue to recommend dividends in future years”. Aldar Properties rose 2.9 percent after raising its foreign ownership limit to 49 percent from 40 percent. The change may not lead to an immediate rise in actual foreign ownership — non-Arab foreigners now hold 25.66 percent of the company — but it may boost the stock’s weighting in emerging market indexes. In Dubai, where the index added 1.8 percent, amusement park operator DXB Entertainment gained 1.4 percent. The stock started rising last week after it announced an increase in visitor numbers to its facilities in the first quarter of this year. Retailer Marka was the worst performer, plunging 10 percent after saying it would ask shareholders on April 30 to approve a capital reduction in order to extinguish accumulated losses of 450 million dirhams ($122.6 million), then issue new shares. Real estate developer Deyaar rose 2.2 percent after reporting a 25 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, as revenue rose 24 percent; in full-year 2017, profit shrank 40 percent. The Kuwaiti and Omani markets were closed for public holidays. * The index gained 1.9 percent to 7,973 points. * The index climbed 1.8 percent to 3,151 points. * The index rose 1.0 percent to 4,699 points. * The index shed 0.3 percent to 8,892 points. * The index lost 0.2 percent to 17,589 points. * The index edged up 0.1 percent to 1,292 points.

2018-04-15,"OTTAWA, April 15 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will on Sunday try to tackle an escalating dispute over a oil pipeline project that threatens to undermine his political and economic agenda. Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd wants to almost triple the capacity of its Trans Mountain pipeline from oil-rich Alberta to the Pacific province of British Columbia, which strongly opposes the idea on environmental grounds. Trudeau - who says the expansion will benefit the economy and needs to proceed - is due to hold a emergency meeting at 10 am ET (1400 GMT) with the premiers of both provinces. “This is not about punishing British Columbians, this is not about hurting Canadians, this is about bringing forward a project in the national interest,” he told reporters in Peru late on Saturday before returning to Ottawa. “We will do it in such a way that doesn’t seek to further polarize or raise the temperature in this debate.” Although Trudeau’s Liberal government could invoke emergency powers to ensure the project goes ahead, that would most likely anger voters in British Columbia and cost the Liberals support in a federal election in October 2019. But Trudeau is under increasing pressure from the business community and opposition politicians to take action amid fears the dispute could hit already flagging foreign investment. “In the absence of a swift resolution to this issue, foreign and domestic investors will be left to question whether Canada is a suitable place to invest,” said John Manley, President of the Business Council of Canada and a former Liberal finance minister. Both the federal and Alberta governments have suggested they could take a stake in the project. “There are enough determined parties that a solution will be reached. It won’t be easy - it’s not an easy issue, none of this is,” a senior government official said ahead of the meeting. British Columbia premier John Horgan told reporters on Saturday he wanted to protect his province against “the catastrophic consequences” of a pipeline leak. He wants Ottawa to refer the matter to the Supreme Court but the Liberals are not interested, saying it is already clear the federal government has jurisdiction over the project. Horgan’s office says he plans to speak to reporters at 11 am, suggesting he will not be talking for long to Trudeau and Alberta premier Rachel Notley.

2018-04-15,"OTTAWA, April 15 (Reuters) - Canada’s government got just 24 hours notice that it would be thrust into a political and economic crisis by an ultimatum from a pipeline operator, government sources said, leaving Prime Minister Justin Trudeau scrambling for options in a dispute that could damage his re-election chances. The Kinder Morgan Canada pipeline issue has pitted Ottawa against the Pacific province of British Columbia and could turn into a constitutional crisis, derail Trudeau’s energy strategy and dent business confidence. Trudeau broke off a foreign trip to hold an emergency meeting on Sunday with the premiers of two provinces locked in a standoff over the pipeline after the company set a May 31 deadline to resolve the impasse or it would walk away. Federal officials had been talking to the company since February when British Columbia’s left-leaning coalition, which includes the Green party, made clear it would delay the planned expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline from Alberta’s oil sands to the coast. But the government had no idea that Kinder Morgan Canada was about to drop a bombshell. “Kinder Morgan’s announcement on Sunday was unexpected,” said a senior government official who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the situation. “We had 24 hours’ notice.” The move by Kinder Morgan Canada, which was spun off by its U.S. parent last year, puts pressure on Trudeau to solve the problem without alienating voters in British Columbia or presiding over an investment failure ahead of 2019 elections. A second federal government source said the prime minister and senior cabinet members had worked behind the scenes for weeks, pressing British Columbia to change its position. “If we’re talking of things going awry, British Columbia knew this was federal jurisdiction,” said the source. The operator wants to almost triple the capacity of the existing pipeline. Ottawa, which approved the project in 2016, insists it has jurisdiction. British Columbia’s government, elected in 2017, disagrees, citing the risk of a spill. “I do believe we have a mandate to defend the coast,” provincial Premier John Horgan told reporters on Friday. Trudeau won power in 2015 partly thanks to extra seats his Liberals won in British Columbia as well as increased support from environmentalists. Cracking down too hard would cost him support in both camps, leaving him with a weak minority government in the October 2019 elections. Long-standing tensions over the pipeline meant Liberals in British Columbia were already nervous about softening support before Kinder Morgan Canada’s ultimatum, said a Liberal party official. The Liberals also have to pick up seats in the province of Quebec, which has a strong green tradition. “It wouldn’t really take a lot to tip the government into minority territory,” said pollster Nik Nanos of Nanos Research. “If you’re looking at hard political calculus, the prime minister realistically has to tilt in favor of the environment because if he doesn’t that will kill him in Quebec.” During Sunday’s meeting, Trudeau will lay out the various financial, regulatory and legal options, said the second government source. “It’s not a matter of getting angry, or being mean or nice about it - he will lay out the facts,” said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The federal and Alberta governments both say they could take a stake in the pipeline to keep the project alive, with Alberta’s premier saying her province could even buy it outright. Kinder Morgan Canada has said it was open to discussions but did not elaborate. The first government source there was a “huge gray zone” of possible government help, citing the past bailout of the auto industry in 2009, federal loan guarantees for a hydro-electric project and Ottawa’s investment in an offshore energy project. Toronto-Dominion Bank Deputy Chairman Frank McKenna, a member of Alberta’s pipeline advisory taskforce, said he raised the issue with Trudeau in a recent call and that Ottawa has to “provide deal certainty ... a backstop”. “That could be something in the nature of an indemnity agreement or a guarantee against potential losses that would come from political instability and not based on normal construction risk,” said McKenna, a former premier of New Brunswick. TD Bank is Kinder Morgan Canada’s biggest lender. “At the end of the day this pipeline can’t be allowed to fail, it would be a huge blow to the leadership of the country and to the image of the country.” (With additional reporting by Matt Scuffham in Toronto, Julie Gordon in Vancouver;)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/kinder-morgan-cn-pipeline-surprise/canadas-trudeau-faces-election-risk-after-firms-pipeline-surprise-idUKL1N1RQ1DW,15 Apr 2018,"Canada's government got just 24

2018-04-15,"(Adds detail, background) * S.Korea’s March Iranian crude imports at 1.37 mln T * Jan-March oil imports from Iran fall 39.4 pct to 3.45 mln T y/y * March total crude imports at 10.91 mln T vs 12.68 mln T y/y By Jane Chung SEOUL, April 15 (Reuters) - South Korea’s March crude oil imports from Iran dropped 39.3 percent from a year earlier on slowing demand for Iranian oil, the country’s customs data showed on Sunday. In March, the world’s fifth-biggest crude oil importer, imported 1.37 million tonnes of Iranian crude, or 324,612 barrels per day (bpd), from 2.26 million tonnes from the previous year when the import volume hit a record high, according the customs data. South Korea, one of Asia’s major Iranian oil customers, mainly buys condensate, or an utlra-light oil, but its data does not provide a breakdown of imports by types. Seoul has reduced its purchases of Tehran’s oil in recent months compared to last year’s levels, despite the Middle Eastern country’s efforts to retain its Asian buyers by cutting official selling prices. That came as the National Iranian Oil Company had cut supplies to South Korea by 3 million barrels each month from the start of this month due to lower production and a start of a new splitter, according to three sources. South Korean condensate buyers were also seeking to diversify supplies should the United States impose new sanctions against Iran. For the first quarter of 2018, South Korea’s imports from Iran fell 39.4 percent to 3.45 million tonnes, or 280,736 bpd, versus 5.69 million tonnes over the same period last year, according to the data. Meanwhile, crude imports from Qatar in January-March of this year were 2.19 million tonnes, or 178,652 bpd, up 2.4 percent from 2.14 million tonnes during the same period last year. South Korea typically switches to Qatari condensate to replace Iranian one. Overall, South Korea’s March crude oil imports were 10.91 million tonnes, or 2.58 million bpd, down 14 percent from 12.68 million tonnes from last year, according to the data. In the first three months of this year, South Korea imported 36.70 million tonnes of crude, or nearly 3 million bpd, down 0.4 percent from 36.88 million tonnes from the previous year. The country’s final data for March crude imports data will be released by state-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) later this month.

2018-04-15,"LIMA (Reuters) - The United States urged regional leaders on Saturday to take stronger steps to isolate Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, as it joined a declaration condemning the worsening humanitarian crisis and political repression in the South American nation. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told the Summit of the Americas in the Peruvian capital that immediate action was needed as Venezuela gears up for presidential elections on May 20 that have been condemned by many regional leaders as a farce to legitimize Maduro’s rule.  For the first time, the United States backed a statement by heads of state from the Lima Group of nations - established last year to seek a peaceful end to Venezuela’s political turmoil - which called on Maduro to release political prisoners and hold free elections.      Despite an economic collapse that has driven an estimated 3 million people to flee his once-prosperous OPEC nation, Maduro is expected to win next month’s poll. Venezuela’s two most popular opposition leaders are banned from competing and electoral authorities are stacked with government supporters.    “The United States of America will not stand idly by as Venezuela crumbles,” Pence said in a speech. “Every free nation gathered here must take stronger action to isolate the Maduro regime. We must all stand with our brothers and sisters suffering in Venezuela.” The statement by the Lima Group voiced alarm at an exodus of migrants from Venezuela and urged governments to intensify actions aimed at restoring democracy.    Washington has already targeted senior members of Maduro’s administration with sanctions due to accusations of corruption and rights abuses.  Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson raised the prospect in February that this could be broadened to restrict Venezuela’s exports of crude oil and its imports of U.S. refined products. Neighbouring countries’ frustration with Maduro’s socialist government has been stoked by the arrival of thousands of hungry migrants across the border into Colombia and Brazil every day. The joint statement called on international organizations to offer support to neighbouring countries to cope with the arrivals and for Maduro to allow access for humanitarian aid to his nation of 30 million people - something he has refused to do, denying there is a crisis. “To have in Maduro a leader that will not allow humanitarian aid into his own country as people are starving and people are dying is unconscionable,” Pence said.  Addressing red-shirted supporters at an “anti-imperialist” rally in Caracas, Maduro branded the meeting in Lima as “a complete failure” and said Latin American presidents were wasting their time criticizing him. Maduro was banned from the Lima gathering due to regional censure of his democratic record. Hosting the summit, Peru has sought the broadest possible support for the document from governments outside the 14-nation Lima Group - which includes regional heavyweights such as Brazil, Mexico and Canada but not the United States. However, efforts to build momentum behind the statement were hit by the last-minute cancellation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s attendance.  In the end, the statement was signed by 16 nations, fewer than half of the 35 countries that are members of the Organization of American States (OAS). Previous efforts to build consensus behind strongly worded condemnations of Venezuela at the OAS have run into resistance not just from Caracas’ left-leaning allies such as Cuba and Bolivia, but Caribbean nations that have benefited from Venezuela’s subsidized oil programmers. The official theme of the Lima summit was the fight against corruption and leaders agreed a statement calling for improvements in transparency of public tenders, more independent and accountable judiciaries and stronger international cooperation on money laundering.  However, the meeting was overshadowed by U.S. air strikes in Syria in retaliation for what Washington said was a chemical weapons attack by President Bashar al-Assad’s government. While Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau voiced strong support for the air strikes by the United States, France and Britain, several Latin American nations including Brazil, Argentina and Peru expressed caution about the escalating military action. “There’s deep concern in Brazil with the escalation of military conflict in Syria,” Brazilian President Michel Temer told the summit. “It’s time to find permanent solutions based on international law to a war that has been going for far too long and ended too many lives.”  Reporting By Roberta Rampton, Lisandra Paraguassu and Teresa Cespedes; Writing by Daniel Flynn; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Alistair Bell",https://uk.reuters.com/article/amers-summit/update-2-u-s-urges-regional-leaders-to-isolate-venezuelas-maduro-idUKL1N1RR0F6,15 Apr 2018,"The United States urged regional
