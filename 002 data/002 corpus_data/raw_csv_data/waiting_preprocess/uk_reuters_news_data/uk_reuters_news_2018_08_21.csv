2018-08-21,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers pushed for more aggressive steps to counteract the Russian “menace” on Tuesday, despite Trump administration officials insisting current sanctions were having an effect and vowing to impose more economic pain if Moscow does not change its behaviour. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he would like better ties with Moscow, but although he met Russian President Vladimir Putin last month, relations between the two countries have been further strained. Members of Congress, where both chambers are controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans, have called for more action,  including introducing new sanctions legislation “from hell,” to punish Russia for its annexation of Crimea, involvement in Syria’s civil war and cyber attacks seeking to influence U.S. elections. They held three hearings related to Russia on Tuesday, in the Banking and Foreign Relations committees and a Judiciary counter-terrorism subcommittee. Lawmakers chastised administration officials for doing too little to change Russian behaviour. Both Republicans and Democrats have criticized Trump, particularly after his Helsinki summit with Putin last month, for failing to stand up to Moscow and not fully enacting a sweeping sanctions law passed nearly unanimously a year ago. “It’s not often that Congress acts together in such a strong manner,” said Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Banking Committee, which oversees sanctions policy. “... But then, Russia is a menace on so many different levels, today, that Congress can be compelled to act with a single voice.” Senator Bob Menendez noted that the administration has not designated any new oligarchs for sanctions since April and has eased some sanctions. “We’re told to judge the administration by its actions and not the president’s words, but these actions seem to be more aligned with the president’s accommodating and disturbing rhetoric than a tougher approach to the Kremlin,” Menendez said at the banking hearing. Menendez vowed that Congress will act, with or without the administration. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters later Tuesday there was strong interest in legislation to punish Moscow, although he said chances were “probably pretty slim”  such a measure would come up for a vote before the Nov. 6 congressional elections.   Microsoft Corp said late Monday that hackers linked to the Kremlin sought to launch cyber attacks on the Senate and conservative American think tanks, warning of broader attacks ahead of the November vote. The Kremlin rejected the Microsoft allegations. Moscow has repeatedly denied attempting to influence U.S. elections, including the 2016 presidential vote that brought Trump into office.  U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in 2016, seeking to tilt the vote in Trump’s favour, and, backed by lawmakers, warned that more would come in upcoming elections. “America is under cyber attack. We’re beginning to act, but not quick enough and not forcefully enough,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said at the Judiciary subcommittee hearing. Administration officials insisted existing sanctions were hitting Russia. “Though Russia’s malign activities continue, we believe its adventurism undoubtedly has been checked by the knowledge that we can bring much more economic pain to bear using our powerful range of authorities - and that we will not hesitate to do so if its conduct does not demonstrably and significantly change,” senior Treasury official Sigal Mandelker told the banking panel. The Treasury Department imposed new sanctions on two Russians, one Russian company and one Slovakian firm over actions it said helped another Russian company avoid penalties over cyber-related activities. The United States also announced sanctions on Russian shipping over violations of U.N. restrictions on North Korea. Assistant Secretary of State Wess Mitchell told Foreign Relations that concern about sanctions has cost Russia $8 to $10 billion (£6.2-£7.7 billion) in arms deals. Mitchell also said foreign direct investment in Russia has fallen by 80 percent since 2013, “which is a pretty stunning number.” “I think this administration has been clear that we are prepared to take additional steps,” Mitchell said. “There is an escalatory ladder to sanctions. We are aware of what additional steps would be needed to make an even bigger point.” In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Trump said he would only consider lifting sanctions against Russia if it were to do something positive for the United States, for instance in Syria or in Ukraine.

2018-08-21,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday proposed replacing a signature Obama-era policy to combat climate change with a weaker plan that would let states write their own rules on coal-fired power plants, prompting critics to warn of dire environmental and health consequences. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposal would require states to submit plans for improving efficiency of coal-fired power plants. The federal government will set carbon emission guidelines, but states will have the leeway to set less-stringent standards, taking into account a facility’s age and the cost of upgrades.  The rule also could allow power plant owners to sidestep costly permits for those improvements. “The era of top down, one-size-fits-all federal mandates is over,” EPA Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said on a conference call. The attorneys general of Virginia and New York quickly criticized the EPA announcement and said they would sue to block the rule if it becomes law.  EPA projected the new plan would result in $400 million a year in economic benefits and reduce retail power prices by up to 0.5 percent by 2025. Yet documents released on Tuesday showed the EPA estimated carbon dioxide emissions would be higher than under the Obama policy, while pollution-related premature deaths, hospital admissions, asthma cases and school absence days could be higher by 2030.                The agency’s assistant administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, said that under the new rule, power sector emissions would be similar to the goals set under the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan (CPP) because of how much the industry has already shifted toward cleaner fuels. “Things have changed a lot since the CPP was put in place,” Wehrum said to reporters on the EPA conference call. “The industry continues to transform before our very eyes.” The administration’s Affordable Clean Energy Rule is limited in its scope to coal-fired plants. The Obama-era plan, which has been put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court, set overall carbon-reduction goals for each state using a series of different measures. EPA forecast that under the new rule, coal production would rise by up to 5.8 percent by 2025. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, asked in an interview whether his state would sue to block the plan, said “we’re moving in that direction” but would see the administrative process through. “We think that there is a strong case to be made that they are violating the very laws they are supposed to enforce,” Becerra said. EPA’s 236-page proposal is open for a public comment period, with a final rule expected later this year. The effort to re-write the plan is the latest move by  Trump administration to roll back environmental rules put in place by Obama. Trump, who has scheduled a rally on Tuesday in coal-producing state West Virginia, has vowed to end what he termed “the war on coal” and boost domestic fossil fuels production.   Environmental groups warned the focus on improving efficiency of coal-fired generators could raise overall carbon emissions. “A coal plant that operates more efficiently may be called upon to run more hours, increasing the total amount of CO2 emitted overall,” Lissa Lynch, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in a statement. The CPP, which Obama’s EPA finalized in 2015, sought to reduce emissions from power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. The Supreme Court put the brakes on it in 2016 after energy-producing states sued the EPA, saying it had exceeded its legal reach. In many states, the CPP’s limits on emissions have already been met because the cost of generating power from natural gas and renewable energy like wind and solar is cheaper than coal. An EPA study forecast that compliance costs relative to the CPP would be slightly lower or higher depending on the assumed cost of making efficiency improvements to the coal-fired plants. That is because the electricity sector has already become far less carbon intensive in recent years.

2018-08-21,"MEXICO CITY, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Mexico’s competition authority said on Tuesday that it has fined a unit of state-owned oil company Pemex for presenting an annual compliance report on antimonopoly measures in the recently opened fuel market a year after it was due. The Federal Commission for Economic Competition, or COFECE, fined Pemex’s Industrial Transformation unit, responsible for a range of refining and logistical activities, 418.31 million pesos ($22.1 million) for the late report. COFECE said the report, one of the measures the Pemex unit committed to in 2016 to end an investigation into monopolistic practices in the sale and distribution of diesel and other fuels was presented a year late. “By delaying the presentation of the aforementioned audit, Pemex’s TRI (Industrial Transformation unit) disregarded a necessary and fundamental element for COFECE to verify compliance with the obligations acquired,” the authority said in a statement. COFECE said Pemex could ask a judge to review the decision. Pemex did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Last year, COFECE fined Pemex’s Industrial Transformation unit nearly 369 million pesos for the “possible commission of a monopolistic practice... in the diesel market.” At the time, Pemex said it would challenge the fine. $1 = 18.8900 Mexican pesos

2018-08-21,"(Adds details on pipe imports) WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The U.S. Commerce Department said on Tuesday it had made a preliminary determination that large-diameter welded pipe from Canada, China, Greece, India, South Korea and Turkey was being dumped in the U.S. market. The department said it found that the pipe, which is typically used to build oil and gas pipelines, was being sold at less than fair value at rates ranging from 3.45 percent to 132.63 percent. In June, the department had made an initial finding that imports of the pipe from four of the countries - China, India, South Korea and Turkey - were being unfairly subsidized. It imposed preliminary duties that in the case of India ranged up to more than 500 percent. In its announcement on Tuesday, it said imports of the pipe from Canada were being dumped at a rate of 24.38 percent; from China at 132.63 percent; from Greece at 22.51 percent; from India at 50.55 percent; from Korea ranging from 14.97 percent to 22.21 percent; and from Turkey ranging from 3.45 percent to 5.29 percent. Imports of the pipe from those six countries were valued at more than $720 million last year, the department said. The U.S. probe into the imports was launched in March after a petition from a group of privately held U.S. producers. The probe covers welded carbon and alloy steel pipe larger than 16 inches (406.4 mm) in diameter.

2018-08-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose to its highest level in a week on Tuesday, buoyed by the prospect of U.S. sanctions on Iran, though the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing kept traders and analysts cautious. Oil futures extended gains in post-settlement trade after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed that U.S. crude stockpiles fell 5.2 million barrels last week, more than three times analysts’ forecasts, as imports fell and refinery runs rose. Official data is due on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT) Brent crude LCOc1 futures for October delivery rose 42 cents to settle at $72.63 a barrel. The global benchmark earlier hit $72.95 a barrel, the highest level since Aug. 14.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for October delivery CLc2, the most active contract, rose 42 cents to settle at $65.84 a barrel. The September contract CLc1 expired on Tuesday and settled 92 cents higher to $67.35 a barrel. September WTI’s premium to the October contract CLU8-V8 widened to as much as $1.69 a barrel on Tuesday, after narrowing since the beginning of August. It last marked $1.50 a barrel. Strength in the spread caught many traders by surprise as September is typically seen as a month when inventories start to rise as refineries begin planned maintenance activities. The front-month spread CLc1-CLc2 widened significantly in July after an unexpected outage at Canada’s oil sands facility dented flows of crude into Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. futures. The Syncrude facility has since begun ramping up light oil production, which surprised market participants because it was earlier than expected and caused them to short the market, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Americas. Oil prices have gained in the last two sessions following weeks of declines on the prospect of lower oil supply from Iran. The United States is trying to halt Iranian oil exports in an effort to force Tehran to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East. However, the full impact of the Iran sanctions are unclear. While most of Europe’s energy firms are likely to fall in line with Washington, China has indicated that it will continue to buy Iranian oil. BNP Paribas said it expected oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a member, to fall from an average of 32.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to 31.7 million in 2019. However, oil exports from southern Iraq are on course to hit another record high this month, two industry sources said, adding to signs that OPEC’s second-largest producer is following through on the group’s agreement to raise output. Washington on Monday offered 11 million barrels of sour crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve for delivery from Oct. 1 to Nov. 30. The released oil could offset expected supply shortfalls from the sanctions against Iran.     The market also continued to eye the U.S.-China trade dispute, which threatens to undermine global growth and, therefore, consumption of industrial commodities. A Chinese delegation is due in Washington this week to try to resolve the dispute, but U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters on Monday he does not expect much progress and that resolving the disagreement will “take time.” “The fact that there are negotiations beginning that probably ultimately come to some resolution on this are a positive,” said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at energy investment manager Tortoise Capital. “The de-escalation rather than the escalation of trade wars will be a benefit.” (INTERACTIVE GRAPHIC: Global rig count: tmsnrt.rs/2MnSEr2) Additional reporting by Amanda Cooper in London and Henning Gloystein in Sinapore; Editing by Marguerita Choy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-10-oil-hits-one-week-high-as-iran-driven-rally-gathers-pace-idUKL3N1VC17J,21 Aug 2018,"* U.S. crude oil stocks fall 5.2 mln bbls -API

2018-08-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 setting a record high, fuelled by strong earnings and economic growth, while the dollar weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. The S&P 500 rose as high as 2,873.23, topping the previous record of 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26, and was poised to mark another major milestone Wednesday when the bull market turns 3,453 days old. That will make it the longest such streak in the eyes of many market watchers. “Remarkably, even at this point – a new all-time record and on the verge of being the longest bull market in history – it’s got some room to run,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates, and said the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. Trump also accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. The euro is down about 3.4 percent so far this year against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan has slipped 5.1 percent this year against the greenback. “It would appear that Mr. Trump would like to keep the U.S. dollar a little on the weak side in order to remain competitive,” said CMC Markets chief market analyst David Madden. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.66 percent on Tuesday. It has slid almost 1.6 percent over the past four days, its worst such run since late March.        The dollar’s weakness eased pressure on emerging markets, many of which have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey sparked a sell-off in EM assets around the globe.   MSCI’s benchmark emerging equities index rose 1.02 percent and posted a third day of gains after Trump’s comments. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.47 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.20 percent, lifted by gains in Bayer, Total and Novo Nordisk. Encouraging earnings reports, led by medical device maker Medtronic Plc’s posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted equities in both the United States and Europe. Operating earnings have gained more than 25 percent year-over-year in the first two quarters, which JPMorgan’s Kelly said is truly extraordinary in the bull market’s 10th year. “This is about to become the longest bull market in history. Because it’s the most hated bull market, it’s important to realize that the longevity has been helped by the fact people have been skeptical all the way along,” he said. Some remain sceptical because equities are relatively expensive. A price/earnings multiple of 20 will make it hard for stocks to move materially higher in the near future, with earnings comparisons getting tougher and earnings growth slowing, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group. “There’s not a whole lot of reasons for stocks in aggregate to move materially higher or lower anytime soon,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 63.26 points, or 0.25 percent, to 25,821.95. The S&P 500 rose 5.86 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,862.91, and the Nasdaq Composite added 38.17 points, or 0.49 percent, to 7,859.17. Trump, who had criticized the Fed when he was a candidate, said in the interview with Reuters that other countries benefited from their central banks’ moves during tough trade talks, but the United States was not getting support from the Fed. “During this period of time, I should be given some help by the Fed. The other countries are accommodated,” Trump said. The euro gained 0.79 percent to $1.157 while the Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 110.42 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose on improving risk appetite and as investors awaited a speech by Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. Expectations for two additional Fed rate hikes this year were lower a day after Trump’s comments. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.8442 percent.  Oil rose to its highest in a week, buoyed by the prospect of price support from U.S. sanctions on Iran, though the U.S.-Chinese trade dispute kept traders and analysts cautious. Brent crude futures rose 42 cents to settle at $72.63 per barrel, and U.S. crude settled 92 cents higher at $67.35 per barrel. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up $5.40 at $1,200 per ounce.

2018-08-21,"JAKARTA, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia made public on Tuesday a revised regulation that gives the country’s palm crop fund more leeway to support the expanded use of biodiesel in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. Indonesia announced plans this month to require all diesel fuel used in the country to contain a 20 percent bio-component from September. The move aims to reduce diesel fuel imports, boost palm oil consumption and support the rupiah currency. The revised regulation for the Estate Crop Fund, signed by President Joko Widodo on Aug. 15 and made public on Tuesday, widens the fund’s ability to subsidise the price gap between biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel fuel. The current retail price of diesel is 5,150 rupiah ($0.3526) per litre compared to 7,600 rupiah for unblended biodiesel. Previously, the fund was limited to providing subsidies to Public Service Obligation (PSO) sectors, such as certain types of transport and power stations. A government official said this month biodiesel producers would receive incentives to ensure uniform pricing for PSO and non-PSO sectors. Dono Boestami, head of the Estate Crop Fund, told reporters on Monday the agency is prepared to provide incentives to support the biodiesel plan. The Estate Crop Fund collects levies from palm oil exporters and the proceeds are used to finance government palm oil programmes such as biodiesel and crop replanting. Boestami said the agency collected 14.2 trillion rupiah ($972 million) in levies last year, and provided subsidies on 2.3 million kilolitres of biodiesel. In the first quarter of 2018, the fund collected 6.4 trillion rupiah in fees and subsidised 1.1 million kilolitres of biodiesel. Indonesia currently imports around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products, which makes the economy vulnerable to the increases in global crude prices that have occurred since last year. With the country’s current account deficit estimated to grow by $8 billion in 2018, the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers, including power plants and railways, use biodiesel that contains 20 percent bio-content (B20), typically palm oil. Officials estimate biodiesel consumption will rise to between 5.5 million to 6 million kilolitres in 2019, from 4 million kilolitres this year, and save Indonesia around $6 billion per year. “Palm oil oversupply will be absorbed through biodiesel programme because at the moment (biodiesel) production utilization is only 30 percent of annual installed capacity,” Boestami said. Separately, Indonesia’s energy ministry planned to issue its regulation and guidance regarding the blending and biodiesel supply quota allocations later this week, Rida Mulyana, a senior ministry official, told Reuters on Tuesday.

2018-08-21,"* Ability to raise prices limited to U.S. shale * Sees pricing improving more generally after this year * H1 EBITA $260 mln, revenue up 13 pct * Shares rise as much as 5 percent (Adds CEO comments, analysts comments) By Muvija M and Shadia Nasralla Aug 21 (Reuters) - British oilfield services firm Wood Plc hit the top end of its forecasts for first-half profit in an improving global oil market, while warning its ability to raise prices was still limited to buoyant U.S. shale markets. Shares in Aberdeen-based Wood rose 5 percent, initially topping gainers on the midcap FTSE 250, after it also raised its prediction of cost-savings from its takeover of smaller rival Amec Foster last October. The company has seen demand for services recover in its core oil and gas market over the past two years as prices of crude tripled from 2016 lows, ending a period of aggressive cost-cutting by producers. But Chief Financial Officer David Kemp told Reuters that improvement was still only slowly showing up in Wood’s ability to increase prices, with U.S. shale markets roughly 6 to 12 months ahead of the rest of the business. “In ‘18 we don’t expect that pricing uplift outside of U.S. shale whereas when we get part way through the cycle, we expect pricing (more generally) to improve,” he said. “Revenue has grown over 13 percent in the first half. We see that momentum continuing into the second half and that creates the right ambition for pricing improvement in the future.” Wood, which operates in more than 50 countries, expects to see a further pick-up in activity, including higher spending by international oil and gas explorers. Cost-savings from integrating Amec Foster, which it bought last year, are now expected to be at least $210 million, compared with an earlier forecast of at least $170 million, Wood said. Shares of the company were up 4.7 percent to 692.6 pence at 0830 GMT. Wood stuck to its full-year forecast and said it was on track to deliver earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) growth in line with market expectations. “A slight disappointment is that WG (Wood) has not raised EBITA expectations for 2018 on the back of such strong topline growth,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. Revenue rose 13.4 percent to $5.38 billion as demand for its oilfield services and products picked up due to higher spending by oil producers after a prolonged crude price slump. Wood’s order book stood at about $10.6 billion as of June 30, with about 85 percent of expected 2018 revenue delivered or secured. Lower project completions - normal for the first half - reduced EBITA to $260 million from $264 million a year earlier on a pro forma basis, with margins dipping 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 percent. The company did not give figures stripping out the impact of the merger with Amec Foster for other measures of profit. The company posted a loss of $52 million for the first half, compared with a profit of $6 million a year earlier, hurt by a non-cash amortisation charge of $125 million and exceptional costs of $101 million.

2018-08-21,"* Seeking up to 1.5 mmtpa of LNG from 2019 * EGAT has been buying gas from Thailand’s sole importer PTT * Part of liberalisation of market to create competition (Adds analyst comment) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - State-run Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is seeking to directly import liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the first time, as part of a government plan to boost competition in the power sector. Thailand joins other Asian countries such as China where LNG imports have risen exponentially over the past few years driven by strong economic growth and a push for cleaner air. “This seems to be a continuation of the current trend, where we see increasing amounts of end-user buyers coming to the market to procure LNG directly,” said Edmund Siau, analyst with energy consultancy FGE. EGAT is requesting expressions of interest for up to 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of LNG via Thailand’s existing Map Ta Phut LNG Receiving Terminal in the eastern part of the country, according to a document issued by the company and reviewed by Reuters. EGAT, the country’s largest power producer, typically buys gas from state-owned PTT, which is Thailand’s sole gas supplier and its only LNG importer. EGAT is seeking expressions of interest for the delivery of LNG through an agreement with PTT’s LNG terminal for 4 to 8 years from March 2019, according to the document. The LNG will feed its power plants, including South Bangkok, Bang Pakong and Wang Noi, as part of Thailand’s target to increase competition in the downstream gas sector. PTT will be allowed to participate in EGAT’s tendering process. Expressions of interest are due by Aug. 31. EGAT also acquired access to 1.5 mmtpa of regasification capacity from PTT LNG at the current terminal, over a 38-year period from 2019 to 2056, the document said. EGAT is also planning its own 5 mmtpa floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in the Gulf of Thailand, expected to be ready by 2024, it said. The FSRU will be linked to Thailand’s existing gas pipeline network. Thailand’s LNG imports could more than double in five years from the current 4 mmtpa, driven by rising import dependency amidst declining domestic gas production, said FGE’s Siau. “Thailand is looking to diversify its gas supply away from declining production from the Gulf of Thailand,” he said, adding that pipeline gas import contracts with Myanmar are set to expire over the next decade. “Coal-fired power generation has been proposed several times, but there is strong anti-coal sentiment in Thailand, he said. “New coal projects in Thailand have been delayed multiple times.” (Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/thailand-lng-imports/update-2-thailands-egat-seeks-lng-for-first-time-as-market-liberalises-idUKL3N1VC2SM,21 Aug 2018,"* Part of liberalisation of market to create competition

2018-08-21,"KUALA LUMPUR/BEIJING (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday that the Chinese-funded $20 billion (15.68 billion pounds)East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project and a natural gas pipeline project in Sabah will be cancelled for now, according to media reports.   Mahathir made the comments while addressing the media in Beijing during his five-day trip to China. He said the projects,  would be cancelled until such time as Malaysia can afford it. The Prime Minister’s office confirmed the comments Mahathir made to reporters in Beijing. Prior to his China visit, Mahathir had vowed repeatedly to discuss what he called “unfair” Chinese infrastructure deals authorised by his predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat in May amid a massive financial scandal.  Mahathir said he relayed the matter to China and they understood the problems faced by Malaysia, the New Straits Times (NST) reported. “I believe China itself does not want to see Malaysia become a bankrupt country,” the NST quoted him as saying during a press conference marking the end of his China trip. The ECRL project was the centrepiece of China’s infrastructure push in Malaysia but work has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations. Project contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd told Reuters that more than 1,800 of the 2,250 people hired for the ECRL project had been laid off since the suspension. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Mahathir had said during his visit that China’s development was an opportunity for Malaysia. Both countries’ peoples benefit from their trade and business relations, Lu said on Tuesday.  “But in the cooperation between any two countries, it can’t be avoided that there may be various kinds of problems, and different views at different times.” Lu said such differences should be “appropriately resolved by friendly consultations”, and that it was an important consensus reached by both countries. Mahathir said in a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday that he believed China would sympathise with Malaysia’s “internal fiscal problems”. Mahathir also told the press on Tuesday that he did not bring up Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, in his dialogue with the Chinese leaders, local reports said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harboured in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir’s agenda. Mahathir’s predecessor Najib Razak is set to stand trial in February next year on charges linked to a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to 1MDB.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump said late on Monday he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates and said the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy. American presidents have rarely criticized the Fed in recent decades because its independence has been seen as important for economic stability. “The Fed is independent in setting monetary policy and markets were spooked by yet another comment from Donald Trump criticising higher interest rates,” said Artjom Hatsaturjants, an analyst at Accendo Markets. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.35 percent on Tuesday. It has now fallen 1.2 percent in the last four days, its worst such run since late March. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.2 percent in early trade on Tuesday, with export-led UK stocks underperforming. The FTSE 100, which derives a large portion of its revenues in the United States and so benefits from dollar strength, was flat. The dollar’s weakness took the pressure off many emerging market currencies, that have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey precipitated a sell-off across the globe. The Chinese yuan rose by 0.25 percent to 6.839 per dollar. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week. The yuan had weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns over the country’s economic growth, Sino-U.S. trade war worries and a broad rally by the dollar. In his Reuters interview, Trump also accused China of manipulating its currency and said there was little hope of progress in the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries in talks due this week. Other emerging currencies, including the South African rand , Thai baht, Mexican peso, Hungarian forint , Polish zloty and Indian rupee, were all higher by 0.2 to 0.8 percent against the dollar. Commodities that are priced in dollars and so benefit from any weakness were also higher across the board. Base metals prices rose, with London copper climbing for a second day and crossing the $6,000-a-tonne mark, while spot gold rose 0.28 percent to $1,193.

Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 30 cents, or 0.45 percent, at 0651 GMT, at $66.73 per barrel. The contract expires on Tuesday. Traders said U.S. markets were lifted by a tightening outlook for fuel markets in the coming months. Inventories in the United States for refined products such as diesel and heating oil for this time of year are at their lowest in four years. This is occurring just ahead of the peak demand period for these fuels, with diesel needed for tractors to harvest crops and the arrival of colder weather during the Northern Hemisphere autumn raising consumption of heating oil. Outside the United States, markets focused on U.S. sanctions against Iran, which from November will target its oil sector. International Brent crude oil futures were down 9 cents, at $72.12 a barrel. Washington on Monday offered 11 million barrels of high-sulphur, or sour, crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for delivery from Oct. 1 to Nov. 30. The released oil could offset expected supply shortfalls from U.S. sanctions against Iran. Because of the sanctions, French bank BNP Paribas said it expected oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, to fall from an average of 32.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 to 31.7 million bpd in 2019. Still, traders said overall market sentiment was cautious because of concerns over the demand outlook amid the trade dispute between the United States and China. A Chinese trade delegation is due in Washington this week to resolve the dispute, but U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday he does not expect much progress, and that resolving the trade dispute with China will “take time”. The impact of the Iran sanctions is not yet clear. While most of Europe’s energy firms will likely fall in line with Washington, China has indicated that it will continue to buy Iranian oil. The Iran supply cut may also be more than compensated for by production increases outside OPEC. BNP Paribas said non-OPEC output would likely grow by 2 million bpd in 2018 and by 1.9 million bpd next year. “Depending on when pipeline infrastructure constraints are lifted in the U.S., non-OPEC supply growth by the end of 2019 may prove higher than currently assumed,” the bank said. The search for new oil has increased globally in the last two years, with the worldwide rig count rising from 1,013 at the end of July 2016 to 1,664 in August 2018, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes. The biggest increase was in North America, where the rig count shot up from 491 to 1,057 in the last two years. How prices develop will also depend on demand. “We see global oil demand growing by 1.4 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019,” BNP Paribas said, implying that global markets are likely to remain sufficiently supplied.

2018-08-21,"* Underlying profit down 39 pct, but beats forecasts * Post-quake community recovery to take years - CEO * PNG aims to agree LNG expansion fiscal terms by Nov * (Recasts, adds managing director comments) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search Ltd reported a near 40 percent fall in half-year profit on Tuesday, but the drop was not as bad as feared after an earthquake in Papua New Guinea forced it to shut oil and gas production. Oil Search’s operations supply gas to the PNG LNG liquefied natural gas project, run by ExxonMobil Corp, which was shut for six weeks after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake hit the country’s rugged highlands in February, triggering widespread damage. More than 145 people died. “It has been a very, very challenging time,” Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten told reporters. “We anticipate it will actually be a number of years before our key communities in the Highlands area get back to some form of normality as roads and schools start to open and they get their gardens back on their feet,” he said. Oil Search’s oil facilities are all back on line, but will take around six months to return to normal operating rates, Botten said. But he said PNG LNG had recovered well, achieving record rates above 9 million tonnes a year, or 30 percent above its design capacity, since restarting production in mid-April. As a result, Oil Search raised its production guidance for 2018 to between 24 million and 26 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from 23 million to 26 million boe flagged in July. Net profit fell to $79.2 million for the six months to June from $129.1 million in the same half last year, but beat an average of five broker forecasts of $69 million. Production costs for the half year rose to $14.04 per boe, from $8.52 a year earlier, due to the drop in output. For the full year it sees production costs at between $11 and $13 per boe. Oil Search’s shares fell 2.4 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 1.8 percent fall in the ASX energy index . The focus for Oil Search in the second half will be on talks with its partners in PNG LNG and Papua LNG, led by France’s Total SA, and the Papua New Guinean government about a $12 billion expansion of the PNG LNG plant. They plan to add 8 million tonnes a year of capacity, with two new production units, or trains, to be underpinned by Papua LNG’s Elk and Antelope fields, and one train to be underpinned by PNG LNG’s P’nyang field. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill has said he wants to finalise an agreement on the LNG expansion before the Asia Pacific Economic Co-Operation (APEC) summit in PNG in November, Botten said. “There still is a lot to do, but real progress is being made,” Botten said. The earthquake aftermath made negotiations tougher, with a backlash against the project from locals who considered the quake a natural reaction to gas drilling. The government is pressing Oil Search, Exxon and Total for better fiscal terms for the expansion than the original PNG LNG project after its revenue from the country’s biggest natural resource venture was less than expected. The plant started exports in 2014 just before oil prices collapsed. “We all understand there has to be a balance of rewards for all parties to make this work,” Botten said.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly lower, with Britain’s FTSE dipping 0.25 percent, Germany’s DAX shedding 0.05 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.1 percent. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, President Donald Trump said that China was manipulating its currency to make up for having to pay tariffs imposed by Washington on some imports from China. This kept global trade conflict concerns alive and dented some of the market optimism ahead of upcoming U.S.-China trade talks. He also said he believed the euro was being manipulated. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.6 percent. Australian stocks lost 1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.95 percent and Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.2 percent. Chinese shares rose, with the Shanghai Composite Index climbing more than 1 percent, helped by bargain hunting of consumer and healthcare firms after their recent slump. Wall Street’s major indexes rose on Monday on optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, though they fell from session highs after Trump’s comments. Immediate focus was on the lower-level trade talks due to start this week between the United States and China. Speculation that the talks might help ease trade tensions has shored up the broader equity markets over the past few sessions. Market optimism was tested, however, after Trump said he did not “anticipate much” from the discussions. “Given the little progress made on the U.S.-China negotiations in the past six months, investors’ expectations are still low,” wrote Tai Hui, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Ongoing negotiation is good news, and that’s what the market is riding on at this stage, but a sustainable agreement to end this tension still seems unlikely at this point.” In currency markets, the dollar came under pressure after Trump reiterated his displeasure at the Fed’s rate hikes, saying the central bank should do more to help him boost the U.S. economy. “The Fed looked to have strengthened its hawkish stance at the August policy meeting. But since then, the side effects of the U.S.-China trade war have started to appear, and Republicans struggled to win a special election in Ohio,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Bank in Tokyo. “Against such a background, Trump’s latest jab at the Fed appears to have become stronger compared to the last time (in late July).” The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.4 percent at 95.499, extending losses from the previous day. The euro brushed a 12-day high of $1.1544, stretching its gains after climbing about climbing about 0.35 percent overnight. The U.S. currency touched 109.775 yen, its lowest since late June before edging back to 110.085. The onshore Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.828 per dollar, its strongest since Aug. 9. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week. The yuan has weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns towards the country’s economic growth, Sino-U.S. trade war worries and a broad rally by the dollar. The yuan has since pulled back slightly from the trough, with the People’s Bank of China taking steps perceived by investors that the authorities were not going to allow the currency to keep depreciating indefinitely. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 2.835 percent after stooping to a near a six-week low of 2.815 percent overnight in the wake of Trump’s interest rate comments. Oil prices nudged further up after rising the previous day, when investors grew more concerned about an expected fall in supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions. U.S. crude futures were up 0.33 percent at $66.65 per barrel while Brent added 0.05 percent to $72.25 per barrel.

2018-08-21,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Small to mid-sized renewable energy companies in India are starting to look like attractive takeover targets as lenders and investors withhold funds, worried by the stiff competition, weak bond markets, low tariffs and high debt besetting the sector.  The small companies’ difficulty in raising cash is keeping them away from government power project auctions, restricting their growth and crippling their ability to refinance loans, said a consultant from a top global consultancy firm.  With many smaller operators being gobbled up or offering themselves for sale, the number of projects being developed could fall, potentially keeping India from its renewable energy targets, said the consultant, who did not wish to be named as he is directly involved with a company that canceled a bond issue.  “India’s solar industry is becoming a big boys’ club,” said Rahul Goswami, managing director of Greenstone Energy Advisors.  In a few years, there may be only a few big companies and a few regional firms active in India’s renewable sector, he said.  The trend goes back at least to 2016, when Tata Power bought solar and wind company Welspun Renewable Energy, but the pace is expected to pick up.  “Smaller players are being squeezed out ... due to two main factors: cost of equipment and ... financing”, said Alok Verma, executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, an arm of Kotak Mahindra Bank.  One of India’s largest renewables companies, Greenko Group, said in June that it was buying 750 megawatts (MWs) of solar and wind assets from Orange Renewables, because the Singapore-based company saw few opportunities for growth. The deal has yet to be closed.  Essel Infra, with a renewable power capacity of 685 MWs, and Shapoorji Pallonji Group’s 400-MW solar arm are also in talks to sell off their assets, one firm and two banks doing the due diligence for these companies have said.  Besides loans, other funding options have also been dead ends for the smaller companies, further limiting growth opportunities.  ACME Solar postponed an initial public offering (IPO) announced in September last year as the proposed share issue did not generate enough interest from investors, confirmed a banker who was directly involved in the listing attempt.  Mytrah Energy, a major mid-sized renewables company, called off a $300 million to $500 million bond issue earlier this year as that option also went dry for the sector, and it canned IPO plans as well, said a separate banker directly involved there.  The companies have all declined to comment.  This dearth of financing and trend towards consolidation could be a significant threat to India’s target of 175 gigawatts (GWs) of renewables capacity by 2022, up from 71 GWs now, some analysts said.  Others said a concentration of bigger players, with more cash and better financing, could mean things move faster.  “Consolidation in the renewable energy industry augurs well for the overall success of the program ... Large players have access to required capital at reasonable rates and can procure the latest technology,” said Debasish Mishra, head of Energy, Resources and Industrials at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India.  Tata Power, one of India’s largest power generators, said in May it plans to invest $5 billion to increase its renewable capacity in India fourfold over the next decade to 12 GWs.  More than doubling India’s renewables capacity by 2022 will require $76 billion, including debt of $53 billion, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in July. For a graphic on India's renewable capacity growth, click tmsnrt.rs/2Pgiw60 Another problem in India’s renewable sector is debt.  “Many mid-sized firms have taken debt to fund their equity,” the partner of an investment firm said, adding that many such companies will need financial restructuring or have to put themselves up for auction.  This model of financing debt through equity is called mezzanine financing and tends to involve high interest rates and an option to convert debt to equity in future.  Both ACME and Mytrah are funded by Piramal Finance Ltd via mezzanine financing, according to statements by the companies at the time of funding.  For lending banks, this quasi-equity is seen as debt, making the liabilities of these companies look higher than usual, said the partner, who asked not to be named. The investment firm handles all kinds of financing, including mezzanine.  When companies with mezzanine financing go to banks for funds for upcoming projects, banks ask them for higher collateral or offer less cash in loan, said Kotak’s Verma.  Fitch Solutions said in a note last week that India would likely miss its renewable capacity targets due to “risks stemming from bureaucratic, financing and logistical delays.”  Reporting by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-renewables/indias-small-renewables-firms-fighting-consolidation-wave-idUKL4N1UD3OF,21 Aug 2018,"Small to mid-sized renewable

2018-08-21,"(Adds reaction from Russia, details throughout) WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on two Russian shipping companies and six vessels it said were involved in the transfer of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of United Nations. restrictions. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov called the sanctions as well as other U.S. steps over alleged hacking, groundless, and promised a response. The U.S. Treasury identified the shipping firms as Vladivostok-based shipping companies Primorye Maritime Logistics Co Ltd (Primorye) and Gudzon Shipping Co LLC (Gudzon). It also named six Russian-flagged vessels: Bella, Bogatyr, Neptun, Partizan, Patriot and Sevastopol. “Ship-to-ship transfers with North Korea-flagged vessels from Russia or elsewhere of any goods being supplied, sold, or transferred to or from (North Korea) are prohibited under the U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea and are sanctionable under U.S. law,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Consequences for violating these sanctions will remain in place until we have achieved the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea,” Mnuchin added. The United States has been pressuring North Korea via sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons program. The Treasury statement said Russian ship Patriot conducted two ship-to-ship transfers of oil in early 2018 - 1,500 tons to the North Korea-flagged Chong Rim 2 and 2,000 tons to the North Korea-flagged Chon Ma San. It said the buyer was the Taesong Bank, a North Korean entity subordinate to the Workers’ Party of Korea Office 39, “which engages in illicit economic activities for North Korean leadership.” Taesong Bank has already been slapped with both U.N. and U.S. sanctions. In a statement published on the Russian Foreign Ministry website, Ryabkov said the latest sanctions were introduced under a “false pretense.” Tuesday’s announcement came just days after Washington imposed sanctions on a Russian port service agency as well as Chinese companies for aiding North Korean ships and selling alcohol and tobacco to Pyongyang in breach of U.S. sanctions. After last week’s announcement, Russia said the United States had acted without evidence on the basis of groundless accusations and said it was working on retaliatory measures.

2018-08-21,"(Adds record high; gold, oil settlement prices) * S&P 500 notches new all-time high * Dollar falls for fourth day * Emerging market shares gain * Oil higher as Iran-driven rally gathers pace * For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Global equity markets rose on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 setting a new record high, as strong earnings and economic growth fueled stocks, while the dollar weakened after U.S. President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates. The S&P 500 rose as much as 0.57 percent to 2,873.23, above its previous record high of 2,872.87 set on Jan. 26. The benchmark index has gained over 2 percent in the past month. “Remarkably, even at this point – a new all-time record and on the verge of being the longest bull market in history – it’s got some room to run,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York. The S&P 500 was poised to mark another major milestone on Wednesday when the bull market turns 3,453 days old, making it the longest such streak in the eyes of many market watchers. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising rates and that the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. Trump also accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. The euro is down about 3.4 percent so far this year against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan has slipped 5.1 percent this year against the greenback. “It would appear that Mr. Trump would like to keep the U.S. dollar a little on the weak side in order to remain competitive,” said CMC Markets chief markets analyst David Madden. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.8 percent on Tuesday, and has slid almost 1.6 percent over the past four days, its worst such run since late March. The dollar’s weakness eased pressure on emerging markets, many of which have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey sparked a sell-off in EM assets around the globe. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equities index rose 1.23 percent and was on track for a third day of gains after Trump’s comments. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.62 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.20 percent, lifted by gains in Bayer, Total and Novo Nordisk. Encouraging earnings reports, led by medical device maker Medtronic Plc posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted both U.S. equities and shares in Europe. Operating earnings have gained more than 25 percent year-over-year in the first two quarters, which Kelly said is truly extraordinary in the bull market’s tenth year. “This is about to become the longest bull market in history. Because it’s the most hated bull market, it’s important to realize that the longevity has been helped by the fact people have been skeptical all the way along,” he said. Some remain skeptical as equities are relatively expensive. A price/earnings multiple of 20 will make it hard for stocks to move materially higher in the near future, with earnings comparisons getter tougher and earnings growth slowing, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group. “There’s not a whole lot of reasons for stocks in aggregate to move materially higher or lower anytime soon,” he said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 103.99 points, or 0.4 percent, to 25,862.68. The S&P 500 gained 11.28 points, or 0.39 percent, to 2,868.33 and the Nasdaq Composite added 55.09 points, or 0.7 percent, to 7,876.10. Trump, who criticized the Fed when he was a candidate, said in the interview other countries benefited from their central banks’ moves during tough trade talks, but the United States was not getting support from the Fed. “During this period of time, I should be given some help by the Fed. The other countries are accommodated,” Trump said. The dollar index fell 0.78 percent, while the euro gained 0.94 percent to $1.1587. The Japanese yen weakened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 110.36 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose on improving risk appetite and as investors awaited the minutes from the Fed’s August meeting on Wednesday and a speech by Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. Expectations for two additional Fed rate hikes this year were lower a day after Trump’s comments. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.8442 percent. Oil rose to its highest in a week, buoyed by the prospect of price support from U.S. sanctions on Iran, though the U.S.-Chinese trade dispute kept traders and analysts cautious. Brent crude futures rose 42 cents to settle at $72.63 per barrel and U.S. crude settled 92 cents higher at $67.35 per barrel. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up $5.40 at $1,200 per ounce. Reporting by Herbert Lash; Editing by Meredith Mazzilli and

In a statement, published on the ministry website, he also said the sanctions were introduced under a “false pretence”. The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on two Russians, one Russian company and one Slovakian firm for what Washington said were their actions to help another Russian company avoid sanctions over the country’s malicious cyber-related activities. It also announced sanctions on two Russian shipping companies and six vessels it said were involved in the transfer of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of U.N. restrictions.

2018-08-21,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Tuesday it would begin talks with Angola over providing financial support after the oil producing country’s economic growth was weaker than expected this year. Africa’s second-largest oil producer has been hit by lower oil prices, which have caused a dollar liquidity squeeze that has made it difficult for foreign companies to repatriate profits and discouraged many from investing. Angola’s Finance Ministry said on Monday it had sought financial support from the IMF but did not provide further detail on how much money was involved. “We expect to initiate programme discussions with the Angolan authorities as soon as feasible,” Deputy Managing Director of the IMF Tao Zhang said in a statement which confirmed the Fund had received a letter from the Angolan authorities to start talks.  The request came after the IMF was invited to Luanda in October to negotiate the programme, which would last for two years and then be extendable for one more. “The IMF stands ready to help the authorities address Angola’s economic challenges by supporting their economic policies and reforms based on the government’s macroeconomic stabilisation programme and in the national development plan for 2018–22,” Zhang said.  Angola’s economy has struggled due to lower oil prices, a situation made worse by declining production. Output is expected to fall to 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018, down from 1.6 million last year and 1.9 million a decade ago. The IMF expects the country’s economy to grow 2.2 percent this year, well below an original government forecast of 4.9 percent. President João Lourenço, who took over last September after 38 years of rule by José Eduardo dos Santos, has said he wants to bring about an economic miracle in Angola by opening up to foreign investment and diversifying away from oil.

2018-08-21,"(Adds U.S. market open, byline, dateline; previous LONDON) * Dollar falls for fourth day * S&P 500 hovers near record high * Emerging market shares gain * Oil higher as Iran-driven rally gathers pace * Graphic: World FX rates in 2017 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The dollar weakened on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump slammed the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, while global equity markets rose as strong economic and earnings growth favored stocks in a relatively benign environment. Wall Street shares rose, following stock market gains worldwide, with the benchmark S&P 500 edging closer to an all-time high. Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that he was “not thrilled” with the Fed under his appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising rates and that the U.S. central bank should do more to boost the economy. Trump also accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies. The euro is down about 3.8 percent so far this year against the dollar, while the Chinese yuan has slipped 5.1 percent this year against the greenback. “It would appear that Mr. Trump would like to keep the U.S. dollar a little on the weak side in order to remain competitive,” said CMC Markets chief markets analyst David Madden. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.31 percent on Tuesday, and has slid almost 1.2 percent over the past four days, its worst such run since late March. The dollar’s weakness eased the pressure on many emerging markets, which have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey precipitated a selloff in emerging market assets around the globe. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equities index rose 1.03 percent and was on track for a third day of gains after Trump’s comments. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.4 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.25 percent, lifted by gains in Bayer, Total and Novo Nordisk. More encouraging earnings reports, led by medical device maker Medtronic Plc posting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, lifted U.S. equities and shares in Europe. Sales growth and operating margins for companies in the S&P 500 set records in the second quarter and earnings should be strong for the next couple of quarters, said Michael Geraghty, equity strategist at Cornerstone Capital Group. But a price-to-earnings multiple of 20 will make it hard for stocks to move materially higher, with earnings comparisons getter tougher and earnings growth slowing, he said. “The reason we’re up is because we’re not down,” Geraghty said. “There’s no Turkey issue weighing on stocks today, there’s been no escalation in the trade and tariff situation.” The S&P 500 hovered just below its Jan. 26 record high and was poised to mark a major milestone on Wednesday when the bull market turns 3,453 days old, making it the longest such streak in the eyes of some market watchers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 80.92 points, or 0.31 percent, to 25,839.61. The S&P 500 gained 11.3 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,868.35 and the Nasdaq Composite added 57.48 points, or 0.73 percent, to 7,878.49. Trump, who criticized the Fed when he was a candidate, said in the interview other countries benefited from their central banks’ moves during tough trade talks, but the United States was not getting support from the Fed. “During this period of time I should be given some help by the Fed. The other countries are accommodated,” Trump said. The dollar index fell 0.41 percent, while the euro gained 0.44 percent to $1.153. The Japanese yen weakened 0.31 percent versus the greenback at 110.43 per dollar. U.S. Treasury yields rose on improving risk appetite and as investors awaited the minutes from the Fed’s August meeting on Wednesday and a speech by Powell in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday. Expectations for two additional Fed rate hikes this year were lower a day after Trump’s comments. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes fell 7/32 in price to yield 2.846 percent. Oil rose to its highest in a week, buoyed by the prospect of price support from U.S. sanctions on Iran, though the U.S.-Chinese trade dispute kept traders and analysts cautious. Brent crude futures rose 28 cents to $72.49 per barrel and U.S. crude rose 82 cents to $67.25 per barrel.

2018-08-21,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Europe needs to set up payment systems independent of the United States if it wants to save the nuclear deal between Iran and major powers that was abandoned by President Donald Trump, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. “That’s why it is indispensable that we strengthen European autonomy by creating payment channels that are independent of the United States, a European Monetary Fund and an independent SWIFT system,” Maas wrote in the Handelsblatt business daily. “Every day the deal is alive is better than the highly explosive crisis that would otherwise threaten the Middle East,” he added in the article to be published on Wednesday. The Belgium-based SWIFT global payment network that facilitates the bulk of the world’s cross-border transactions shut out Iran in 2012 after the United States and EU agreed to impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic over its nuclear activities. The 2015 agreement between Iran and world powers lifted international sanctions. In return, Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear activities, increasing the time it would need to produce an atom bomb if it chose to do so. It has long denied having any such intent. Trump withdrew the United States from the deal - signed before he took office - in May, calling the agreement deeply flawed and imposing new sanctions earlier this month. European powers have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal.   This has proven difficult, with many European firms wary of far-reaching U.S. financial penalties. Iran urged Europe this week to speed up efforts to salvage the nuclear accord after French oil group Total formally pulled out of a major gas project. Trump’s decision on Iran and his imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the European Union have strained relations between the U.S. and its European allies. “Given the circumstances, it is of strategic importance that we tell Washington clearly: we want to work together,” Maas wrote. “But we will not allow you to hurt our interests without consulting us.” The EU has vowed to counter Trump’s renewed sanctions on Iran, including by means of a new law to shield European companies from punitive measures.

2018-08-21,"WASHINGTON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday announced sanctions on two Russian shipping companies and six vessels it said were involved in the transfer of refined petroleum products to North Korean vessels in violation of U.N. restrictions. The U.S. Treasury identified the firms as Vladivostok-based shipping companies Primorye Maritime Logistics Co Ltd (Primorye) and Gudzon Shipping Co LLC (Gudzon). It also named six Russian-flagged vessels: Bella, Bogatyr, Neptun, Partizan, Patriot and Sevastopol. “Ship-to-ship transfers with North Korea-flagged vessels from Russia or elsewhere of any goods being supplied, sold, or transferred to or from (North Korea) are prohibited under the U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea and are sanctionable under U.S. law,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. “Consequences for violating these sanctions will remain in place until we have achieved the final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.” The United States has been pressuring North Korea via sanctions to give up its nuclear weapons program. Tuesday’s announcement came just days after Washington imposed sanctions on a Russian port service agency and Chinese companies for aiding North Korean ships and selling alcohol and tobacco to Pyongyang in breach of U.S. sanctions. After last week’s announcement, Russia said the United States had acted without evidence on the basis of groundless accusations when imposing sanctions on the Russian company. It said it was working on retaliatory measures.

2018-08-21,"(Adds detail) MOSCOW, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Caspian pipeline consortium (CPC) expects to pump about 60 million tonnes of CPC Blend BFO-CPC crude oil via the CPC pipeline this year, down from the previous plan for 67 million tonnes, the consortium told Reuters on Tuesday. “We ... expect to pump around 60 million tonnes, but it (the export volume), of course, depends on producers,” CPC said. On a daily basis, CPC Blend exports will be 10 percent lower than under the previous plan, Reuters calculations show. The original plan was based on producers’ annual requests, CPC said, but shipped volumes can be affected by factors such as maintenance and bad weather. “We’re pragmatists and understand that the maximum volume of loadings (67 million tonnes) is unlikely to be achieved. We stay in contact with producers and plan exports monthly and quarterly, which allows us to make corrections to the export schedule according to the latest changes,” CPC told Reuters. Preliminary CPC Blend loading schedules for August-December, seen by Reuters, and export data for January-July suggest CPC Blend exports may reach 60.2 million tonnes this year, in line with the revised plan. CPC Blend exports in January-July totalled 34.48 million tonnes, according to Kazakhstan’s Energy Ministry data. The CPC pipeline’s current capacity is 72 million tonnes per year with the use of pipe dopes, CPC said. It is unclear whether the capacity may be fully used next year as the consortium has not yet received producers’ requests for exports in 2019. Lower shipments via the CPC pipeline are expected as a result of maintenance on the Tengizchevroil (TCO) and Karachaganak Petroleum Operating (KPO) oilfields in August-October, as well as on the giant Kashagan oilfield. The CPC consortium’s main shareholders are Russia, which holds a 31 percent stake, Kazakhstan’s Kazmunaigaz with a 19 percent, and Chevron Caspian Pipeline Consortium Company with 15 percent. Other shareholders include Lukraco B.V., Rosneft-Shell Caspian Ventures Limited, Mobil Caspian Pipeline Company, Eni, BG Overseas Holding and Oryx Caspian Pipeline.

2018-08-21,"(Repeats to additional subscribers) * New coal plants must have emissions-reducing tech * Environmentalists want privately built plants halted * Banks are wary of regulatory issues By Wendell Roelf CAPE TOWN, Aug 21 (Reuters) - South Africa’s first privately built coal-fired power plants must have the latest technology to reduce harmful emissions, the energy minister said on Tuesday, as a wave of court challenges threaten to derail the projects. Environmental activists have taken legal action against the new Thabametsi and Khanyisa coal-fired projects and are also lobbying banks and developers against investing in them. Coal-fired power plants already provide some 90 percent of South Africa’s electricity. The country, which has vast coal reserves, is Africa’s top emissions polluter although it aims to diversify its energy mix. The two projects have been in the works since 2016 and form part of an initiative to increase baseload generation capacity. “When we are using coal we are going to be ensuring that we utilise new technologies to mitigate against those gas emissions,” Energy Minister Jeff Radebe told reporters after briefing parliament’s energy committee. Asked about Thabametsi, which is expected to produce around 9.9 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year once phase two of the 1,2000 MW plant is built, Radebe said any concerns about the plant would need to be fixed. “That has to be corrected to ensure that technologies are put (in place) to ensure we reduce those emissions,” he said without elaborating. Thabametsi, situated in South Africa’s northern Limpopo province, and Khanyisa located in Mpumalanga province, are backed by local consortia and developers from Korea, Japan and Saudi Arabia, including Marubeni and Saudi Arabian power company ACWA. Their development is being challenged in the High Court by environmental groups groundWork and Earthlife Africa, represented by the Centre for Environmental Rights (CER). “These power stations are simply not in the public interest, and we will continue to challenge them on this basis,” CER attorney Nicole Loser said. Failure to secure regulatory approval for the two projects, which are initially expected to add more than 850 megawatts (MW) to South Africa’s national grid, would potentially halt funding. Phumza Macanda, a spokeswoman for Absa confirmed that the bank is a potential financial backer of the two coal plants. “This remains subject to further credit approvals, due diligences and satisfactory outcome on the litigation currently in progress,” she said. Besides Absa, Nedbank, Standard Bank and Rand Merchant Bank are the local banks co-funding Thabametsi and Khanyisa, whose development is expected to inject some 40 billion rand ($3 billion) into the local economy and create thousands of jobs. Other potential funders include the Industrial Development Corporation of SA and Development Bank of Southern Africa, according to documents submitted to the energy regulator. The developers remain committed to the projects. “We plan to stay involved in the project,” said a Tokyo-based official of Japan’s Marubeni, which holds a 24.5 percent stake in Thabametsi through wholly-owned subsidiary Axia Power Holdings B.V. “The project will be carried out,” said an official from South Korea’s KEPCO who asked not to named. The KEPCO consortium is preparing to sign financial and project contracts (for Thabametsi) within 2018, according to its May quarterly report.

2018-08-21,"* Southern exports in first 19 days of Aug hit 3.7 mbpd - tracker * Northern exports rise about 50,000 bpd in August * Increase follows OPEC deal in June to boost supply By Alex Lawler LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Oil exports from southern Iraq are on course to hit another record high this month, two industry sources said, adding to signs that OPEC’s second-largest producer is following through on the group’s agreement to raise output. Southern Iraqi exports in the first 19 days of August averaged 3.7 million barrels per day, according to ship-tracking data compiled by an industry source, up 160,000 bpd from July’s 3.54 million bpd - the existing monthly record. The increase follows June’s pact among OPEC and allied oil producers to boost supply after they had curbed output since 2017 to remove a glut. Iraq in July provided the largest increase among OPEC members that took part in the previous cuts. “We are seeing volumes run at another record so far in the month,” the industry source said on Tuesday. A second industry source who tracks shipments said exports this month had averaged at least 3.6 million bpd, reflecting smooth operations at export terminals and a lack of developments such as bad weather that can curb shipments. “It’s just business as usual,” the source said. “There are no major storms, winds or anything.” Other sources say exports from Iraq’s south, the outlet for most of its crude, are higher this month. Two oil executives quoted on Aug. 16 said such shipments had averaged 3.6 million bpd in August. Before the June OPEC deal, Iraq had been boosting exports from southern terminals to offset a halt in shipments from the northern Kirkuk region last October after Iraqi forces seized control of oilfields there from Kurdish fighters. Northern exports have also increased in August, averaging about 350,000 bpd so far, according to shipping data, up from about 300,000 bpd in July. That is still far below levels of more than 500,000 bpd in some months of 2017. On June 22-23, OPEC, Russia and other non-members agreed to return to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017. That amounted to an increase of about 1 million bpd, according to OPEC’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia. Iraq told the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries that it boosted production by 100,000 bpd month-on-month in July, while Saudi Arabia cut back.

By Alasdair Pal LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Critical comments by U.S. President Donald Trump about the country’s central bank saw the dollar fall for the fourth straight day in its worst spell since March, boosting emerging market stocks and currencies in the process. In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump said late on Monday he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates, and said the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy. American presidents have rarely criticized the Fed in recent decades because its independence has been seen as important for economic stability. “The Fed is independent in setting monetary policy and markets were spooked by yet another comment from Donald Trump criticising higher interest rates,” said Artjom Hatsaturjants, an analyst at Accendo Markets. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.39 percent on Tuesday. It has now fallen 1.2 percent in the last four days, its worst such run since late March. The dollar’s weakness took pressure off many emerging markets, which have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey precipitated a sell-off across the globe. MSCI’s benchmark emerging equities index rose 1 percent and was set for a third day of gains after Trump’s comments. Chinese mainland shares jumped 1.8 percent, South Korea 1 percent and Indonesia 0.9 percent. In Europe, Turkish stocks rose 1.6 percent and Polish shares 0.8 percent. The Chinese yuan rose by 0.17 percent to 6.8427 per dollar. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week. The yuan had weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns over the country’s economic growth, a Sino-U.S. trade war and a broad rally by the dollar. In his Reuters interview, Trump also accused China of manipulating its currency and said there was little hope of progress in the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries in talks due this week. Other emerging-market currencies, including the South African rand, Thai baht, Mexican peso, Hungarian forint and Polish zloty were all higher by 0.2 to 0.9 percent against the dollar. Commodities that are priced in dollars and so benefit from any weakness were also higher across the board. Base metals prices rose, with London copper climbing for a second day and crossing the $6,000-a-tonne mark. Spot gold rose 0.28 percent to $1,193 . Brent crude oil rose 0.33 percent to $72.45 per barrel. In developed market equities, defensive sectors were in favour, with areas considered less dependent on the economic cycle like healthcare, utilities and consumer staples among the leading gainers in Europe. Futures in the United States pointed to the blue-chip S&P 500 index opening 0.2 percent higher. Reporting by Alasdair Pal; editing by Louise Heavens, Larry

2018-08-21,"LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - The Abu Dhabi owner of Spanish energy company Cepsa is expected to opt for an IPO instead of a private stake sale and plans to launch the listing as early as September, according to four banking sources familiar with the deal. While parallel negotiations for a potential sale are ongoing, sources said a Madrid listing was the more likely option. Two of the sources said the business would be valued at around 10 billion euros ($11.44 billion). Once companies announce an intention to float the listing usually takes place a few weeks later. Cepsa, an oil refiner and distributor, is owned by Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadalah. A Mubadala spokesman said in March it was considering a public listing or sale of all or a stake in the company, which also has exploration and production interests in Latin America, north Africa and Asia. Mubadala declined to comment. After years of stake-building in Cepsa, the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund bought the remaining shares it did not already own from France’s Total in 2011, valuing the Spanish company at around 7.5 billion euros. Finance industry sources said they expected a flurry of new listings in September in Europe after the summer lull as companies take advantage of favourable market conditions which might not last. Proceeds from initial public offerings (IPO) of European firms rose 35 percent in the first half of the year to almost $30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Packager SIG Combibloc and chip factory builder Exyte are both on track to launch IPOs in the coming weeks, sources have previously said. One of the sources said Cepsa’s owners had considered London for the listing but chose Madrid, which has fewer comparable companies but has investors which already know Cepsa because it was previously listed there. In the first half of 2018, Cepsa reported an IFRS net profit of 441 million euros compared to 412 million euros in the first half of 2017. Revenue in the first half of 2018 was 12.4 billion euros, according to a statement from the company on its website. Mubadala’s chief executive officer said last year it was lining up new overseas investments and might also sell or reduce some of its existing stakes in companies.

2018-08-21,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Rising fuel costs have dampened gasoline demand from private motorists in the United States, leaving the market relying on continued economic and freight expansion to boost oil use. U.S. traffic volumes were up by just 0.3 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis in the three months from April to June compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Federal Highway Administration. Traffic growth has slowed from an annual rate of between 2 percent and 3 percent through most of 2015 and 2016, when gasoline prices were low and falling (“Traffic Volume Trends,” FHA, August 2018). Traffic growth has been correlated with changes in gasoline prices for the past quarter century and recent fuel price increases have resulted in a predictable slowdown (tmsnrt.rs/2nRQtxk). Retail gasoline prices are up by more than 55 percent from their cyclical low in February 2016, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Traffic volumes have levelled out despite continued strong growth in economic output, incomes and employment, indicating that motoring demand has been hit by rising fuel prices. Slower traffic growth has been mirrored in flattening gasoline consumption, with sales to domestic customers at or slightly below prior-year levels for most months so far this year. Between March and May, the most recent three-month period for which data are available, gasoline supplied to the domestic market was marginally down from the same period in 2017. The Energy Information Administration is now forecasting gasoline consumption will be essentially unchanged in 2018, down from predicted growth of around 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) at the start of the year (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, August 2018). If the prediction proves accurate, it will be the second year of little or no growth, after gasoline use surged by 140,000 bpd in 2016 and 257,000 bpd in 2015, corresponding with the slump in oil prices. Lack of growth in gasoline contrasts with distillate fuel oil, where consumption between March and May was up by almost 75,000 bpd compared with 2017, spurred by rising industrial output and strong growth in freight. U.S. freight volumes were up by more than 8 percent year-on-year in June, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics (“Transportation Services Index”, BTS, August 2018). Manufacturing output was up by 2.8 percent in the year to July while mining output, which includes oil and gas drilling, rose by 12.9 percent (“Industrial production and capacity utilization”, Federal Reserve, August 2018). Distillate fuel oil and jet fuel accounted for essentially all the growth in fuel consumption in the United States in the March-May period. EIA forecasts distillate consumption will increase by 170,000 bpd in 2018, while jet fuel will be up by another 30,000 bpd. Freight growth within the United States remains robust, but in the rest of the world has showed signs of slowing since the start of the year. Flat-lining domestic gasoline consumption coupled with softness in international distillate growth helps explain why benchmark oil prices have pulled back from highs set in May. Prices are falling to buy back some demand growth, or at least prevent any more being lost.

2018-08-21,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The chemical manufacturing unit of Malaysia’s state energy firm Petronas [PETR.UL] is actively looking to acquire companies to expand its specialty chemical business, its chief executive officer said on Tuesday. Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (PCGB.KL) is looking to grow aggressively in specialty chemicals, which are raw materials used to manufacture consumer products such as high-performance tyres and LCD televisions. CEO Sazali Hamzah said acquisitions would be a key step toward expanding the higher-margin specialty chemicals business. “We have already targeted a few. When we acquire, it’s not only for technology but also for market penetration,” Sazali told Reuters in an interview, adding that Petronas Chemicals was looking at companies in Europe, the United States and India. Sazali also said the acquisition market was competitive as a lot of companies are looking to expand into petrochemicals. The hunt for acquisitions comes as parent company Petroliam Nasional Bhd, or Petronas, relies more on its downstream business to boost revenue amid analyst estimates that it will produce less oil in the future.  Much of Petronas’ capital expenditures in the last few years has been spent on its downstream business, particularly the Refinery and Petrochemical Integrated Development (RAPID) project in the southern Malaysian state of Johor.  RAPID is part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) that includes a 300,000 barrel-per-day oil refinery and a petrochemical complex with a production capacity of 7.7 million metric tonnes and an oil storage site.  Companies such as Saudi Aramco, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) have all been expanding into petrochemicals in recent years to diversify their businesses from crude oil production.  Last year, Aramco inked a deal to invest $7 billion in RAPID. It later bought a $900 million stake in petrochemical projects in the RAPID complex. Petronas Chemicals is spearheading the petrochemicals component of RAPID, which is Petronas’ largest downstream project with an estimated $27 billion of total investment. Sazali said Aramco could expand its investment in PIC. “There is a possibility... Some we offer to them, some they are interested in but subject to the economics of it,” he said. The company is conducting joint studies with other potential partners for developing more petrochemical projects in PIC, he said, declining to provide details. Reporting by A.

2018-08-21,"JAKARTA, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Indonesia made public on Tuesday a revised regulation that gives the country’s palm crop fund more leeway to support the expanded use of biodiesel in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. Indonesia announced plans this month to require all diesel fuel used in the country to contain a 20 percent bio-component from September. The move aims to reduce diesel fuel imports, boost palm oil consumption and support the rupiah currency. The revised regulation for the Estate Crop Fund, signed by President Joko Widodo on Aug. 15 and made public on Tuesday, widens the fund’s ability to subsidise the price gap between biodiesel and petroleum-based diesel fuel. The current retail price of diesel is 5,150 rupiah ($0.3526) per litre compared to 7,600 rupiah for unblended biodiesel. Previously, the fund was limited to providing subsidies to Public Service Obligation (PSO) sectors, such as certain types of transport and power stations. A government official said this month biodiesel producers would receive incentives to ensure uniform pricing for PSO and non-PSO sectors. Dono Boestami, head of the Estate Crop Fund, told reporters on Monday the agency is prepared to provide incentives to support the biodiesel plan. The Estate Crop Fund collects levies from palm oil exporters and the proceeds are used to finance government palm oil programmes such as biodiesel and crop replanting. Boestami said the agency collected 14.2 trillion rupiah ($972 million) in levies last year, and provided subsidies on 2.3 million kilolitres of biodiesel. In the first quarter of 2018, the fund collected 6.4 trillion rupiah in fees and subsidised 1.1 million kilolitres of biodiesel. Indonesia currently imports around 400,000 barrels per day of crude oil and a roughly similar amount of refined products, which makes the economy vulnerable to the increases in global crude prices that have occurred since last year. With the country’s current account deficit estimated to grow by $8 billion in 2018, the plan is to cut diesel imports by mandating that all diesel consumers, including power plants and railways, use biodiesel that contains 20 percent bio-content (B20), typically palm oil. Officials estimate biodiesel consumption will rise to between 5.5 million to 6 million kilolitres in 2019, from 4 million kilolitres this year, and save Indonesia around $6 billion per year. “Palm oil oversupply will be absorbed through biodiesel programme because at the moment (biodiesel) production utilization is only 30 percent of annual installed capacity,” Boestami said. Separately, Indonesia’s energy ministry planned to issue its regulation and guidance regarding the blending and biodiesel supply quota allocations later this week, Rida Mulyana, a senior ministry official, told Reuters on Tuesday.

2018-08-21,"* Ability to raise prices limited to U.S. shale * Sees pricing improving more generally after this year * H1 EBITA $260 mln, revenue up 13 pct * Shares rise as much as 5 percent (Adds CEO comments, analysts comments) By Muvija M and Shadia Nasralla Aug 21 (Reuters) - British oilfield services firm Wood Plc hit the top end of its forecasts for first-half profit in an improving global oil market, while warning its ability to raise prices was still limited to buoyant U.S. shale markets. Shares in Aberdeen-based Wood rose 5 percent, initially topping gainers on the midcap FTSE 250, after it also raised its prediction of cost-savings from its takeover of smaller rival Amec Foster last October. The company has seen demand for services recover in its core oil and gas market over the past two years as prices of crude tripled from 2016 lows, ending a period of aggressive cost-cutting by producers. But Chief Financial Officer David Kemp told Reuters that improvement was still only slowly showing up in Wood’s ability to increase prices, with U.S. shale markets roughly 6 to 12 months ahead of the rest of the business. “In ‘18 we don’t expect that pricing uplift outside of U.S. shale whereas when we get part way through the cycle, we expect pricing (more generally) to improve,” he said. “Revenue has grown over 13 percent in the first half. We see that momentum continuing into the second half and that creates the right ambition for pricing improvement in the future.” Wood, which operates in more than 50 countries, expects to see a further pick-up in activity, including higher spending by international oil and gas explorers. Cost-savings from integrating Amec Foster, which it bought last year, are now expected to be at least $210 million, compared with an earlier forecast of at least $170 million, Wood said. Shares of the company were up 4.7 percent to 692.6 pence at 0830 GMT. Wood stuck to its full-year forecast and said it was on track to deliver earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) growth in line with market expectations. “A slight disappointment is that WG (Wood) has not raised EBITA expectations for 2018 on the back of such strong topline growth,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note. Revenue rose 13.4 percent to $5.38 billion as demand for its oilfield services and products picked up due to higher spending by oil producers after a prolonged crude price slump. Wood’s order book stood at about $10.6 billion as of June 30, with about 85 percent of expected 2018 revenue delivered or secured. Lower project completions - normal for the first half - reduced EBITA to $260 million from $264 million a year earlier on a pro forma basis, with margins dipping 0.8 percentage points to 4.8 percent. The company did not give figures stripping out the impact of the merger with Amec Foster for other measures of profit. The company posted a loss of $52 million for the first half, compared with a profit of $6 million a year earlier, hurt by a non-cash amortisation charge of $125 million and exceptional costs of $101 million.

2018-08-21,"* Seeking up to 1.5 mmtpa of LNG from 2019 * EGAT has been buying gas from Thailand’s sole importer PTT * Part of liberalisation of market to create competition (Adds analyst comment) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - State-run Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand is seeking to directly import liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the first time, as part of a government plan to boost competition in the power sector. Thailand joins other Asian countries such as China where LNG imports have risen exponentially over the past few years driven by strong economic growth and a push for cleaner air. “This seems to be a continuation of the current trend, where we see increasing amounts of end-user buyers coming to the market to procure LNG directly,” said Edmund Siau, analyst with energy consultancy FGE. EGAT is requesting expressions of interest for up to 1.5 million metric tonnes per annum (mmtpa) of LNG via Thailand’s existing Map Ta Phut LNG Receiving Terminal in the eastern part of the country, according to a document issued by the company and reviewed by Reuters. EGAT, the country’s largest power producer, typically buys gas from state-owned PTT, which is Thailand’s sole gas supplier and its only LNG importer. EGAT is seeking expressions of interest for the delivery of LNG through an agreement with PTT’s LNG terminal for 4 to 8 years from March 2019, according to the document. The LNG will feed its power plants, including South Bangkok, Bang Pakong and Wang Noi, as part of Thailand’s target to increase competition in the downstream gas sector. PTT will be allowed to participate in EGAT’s tendering process. Expressions of interest are due by Aug. 31. EGAT also acquired access to 1.5 mmtpa of regasification capacity from PTT LNG at the current terminal, over a 38-year period from 2019 to 2056, the document said. EGAT is also planning its own 5 mmtpa floating storage regasification unit (FSRU) in the Gulf of Thailand, expected to be ready by 2024, it said. The FSRU will be linked to Thailand’s existing gas pipeline network. Thailand’s LNG imports could more than double in five years from the current 4 mmtpa, driven by rising import dependency amidst declining domestic gas production, said FGE’s Siau. “Thailand is looking to diversify its gas supply away from declining production from the Gulf of Thailand,” he said, adding that pipeline gas import contracts with Myanmar are set to expire over the next decade. “Coal-fired power generation has been proposed several times, but there is strong anti-coal sentiment in Thailand, he said. “New coal projects in Thailand have been delayed multiple times.” (Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; editing by Richard Pullin and Christian Schmollinger)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/thailand-lng-imports/update-2-thailands-egat-seeks-lng-for-first-time-as-market-liberalises-idUKL3N1VC2SM,21 Aug 2018,"* Part of liberalisation of market to create competition

2018-08-21,"KUALA LUMPUR/BEIJING (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday that the Chinese-funded $20 billion (15.68 billion pounds)East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project and a natural gas pipeline project in Sabah will be cancelled for now, according to media reports.   Mahathir made the comments while addressing the media in Beijing during his five-day trip to China. He said the projects,  would be cancelled until such time as Malaysia can afford it. The Prime Minister’s office confirmed the comments Mahathir made to reporters in Beijing. Prior to his China visit, Mahathir had vowed repeatedly to discuss what he called “unfair” Chinese infrastructure deals authorised by his predecessor Najib Razak, whose near-decade long rule ended in electoral defeat in May amid a massive financial scandal.  Mahathir said he relayed the matter to China and they understood the problems faced by Malaysia, the New Straits Times (NST) reported. “I believe China itself does not want to see Malaysia become a bankrupt country,” the NST quoted him as saying during a press conference marking the end of his China trip. The ECRL project was the centrepiece of China’s infrastructure push in Malaysia but work has been suspended pending discussions over pricing and graft accusations. Project contractor, China Communications Construction Co Ltd told Reuters that more than 1,800 of the 2,250 people hired for the ECRL project had been laid off since the suspension. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a daily news briefing in Beijing that Mahathir had said during his visit that China’s development was an opportunity for Malaysia. Both countries’ peoples benefit from their trade and business relations, Lu said on Tuesday.  “But in the cooperation between any two countries, it can’t be avoided that there may be various kinds of problems, and different views at different times.” Lu said such differences should be “appropriately resolved by friendly consultations”, and that it was an important consensus reached by both countries. Mahathir said in a joint press conference with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday that he believed China would sympathise with Malaysia’s “internal fiscal problems”. Mahathir also told the press on Tuesday that he did not bring up Low Taek Jho, the Malaysian financier wanted for his role in the multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB, in his dialogue with the Chinese leaders, local reports said. The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Malaysia believed Low was being harboured in China and that a request to extradite him would be high on Mahathir’s agenda. Mahathir’s predecessor Najib Razak is set to stand trial in February next year on charges linked to a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing related to 1MDB.

In an exclusive interview with Reuters, Trump said late on Monday he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve under his own appointee, Chairman Jerome Powell, for raising interest rates and said the Fed should do more to help him to boost the economy. American presidents have rarely criticized the Fed in recent decades because its independence has been seen as important for economic stability. “The Fed is independent in setting monetary policy and markets were spooked by yet another comment from Donald Trump criticising higher interest rates,” said Artjom Hatsaturjants, an analyst at Accendo Markets. The dollar index, which tracks performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.35 percent on Tuesday. It has now fallen 1.2 percent in the last four days, its worst such run since late March. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index rose 0.2 percent in early trade on Tuesday, with export-led UK stocks underperforming. The FTSE 100, which derives a large portion of its revenues in the United States and so benefits from dollar strength, was flat. The dollar’s weakness took the pressure off many emerging market currencies, that have struggled in recent weeks as worries over Turkey precipitated a sell-off across the globe. The Chinese yuan rose by 0.25 percent to 6.839 per dollar. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week. The yuan had weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns over the country’s economic growth, Sino-U.S. trade war worries and a broad rally by the dollar. In his Reuters interview, Trump also accused China of manipulating its currency and said there was little hope of progress in the ongoing trade dispute between the two countries in talks due this week. Other emerging currencies, including the South African rand , Thai baht, Mexican peso, Hungarian forint , Polish zloty and Indian rupee, were all higher by 0.2 to 0.8 percent against the dollar. Commodities that are priced in dollars and so benefit from any weakness were also higher across the board. Base metals prices rose, with London copper climbing for a second day and crossing the $6,000-a-tonne mark, while spot gold rose 0.28 percent to $1,193.

2018-08-21,"(Repeats for technical reason with no change to text.) * U.S. autumn fuel market outlook tightens * International markets prepare for U.S. sanctions vs Iran * U.S.-China trade dispute threatens global economic growth * Trump does not expect trade talks to resolve issues soon * Rising global production points to ample supply By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices held firm on Tuesday, with U.S. fuel markets seen to be tightening, although the release of crude from the American strategic reserve somewhat offset an expected supply cut due to upcoming sanctions against Iran. Front-month U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 30 cents, or 0.45 percent, at 0651 GMT, at $66.73 per barrel. The contract expires on Tuesday. Traders said U.S. markets were lifted by a tightening outlook for fuel markets in the coming months. Inventories in the United States for refined products such as diesel and heating oil for this time of year are at their lowest in four years. This is occurring just ahead of the peak demand period for these fuels, with diesel needed for tractors to harvest crops and the arrival of colder weather during the Northern Hemisphere autumn raising consumption of heating oil. Outside the United States, markets focused on U.S. sanctions against Iran, which from November will target its oil sector. International Brent crude oil futures were down 9 cents, at $72.12 a barrel. Washington on Monday offered 11 million barrels of high-sulphur, or sour, crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for delivery from Oct. 1 to Nov. 30. The released oil could offset expected supply shortfalls from U.S. sanctions against Iran. Because of the sanctions, French bank BNP Paribas said it expected oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, to fall from an average of 32.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 to 31.7 million bpd in 2019. Still, traders said overall market sentiment was cautious because of concerns over the demand outlook amid the trade dispute between the United States and China. A Chinese trade delegation is due in Washington this week to resolve the dispute, but U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday he does not expect much progress, and that resolving the trade dispute with China will “take time”. The impact of the Iran sanctions is not yet clear. While most of Europe’s energy firms will likely fall in line with Washington, China has indicated that it will continue to buy Iranian oil. The Iran supply cut may also be more than compensated for by production increases outside OPEC. BNP Paribas said non-OPEC output would likely grow by 2 million bpd in 2018 and by 1.9 million bpd next year. “Depending on when pipeline infrastructure constraints are lifted in the U.S., non-OPEC supply growth by the end of 2019 may prove higher than currently assumed,” the bank said. The search for new oil has increased globally in the last two years, with the worldwide rig count rising from 1,013 at the end of July 2016 to 1,664 in August 2018, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes. The biggest increase was in North America, where the rig count shot up from 491 to 1,057 in the last two years. How prices develop will also depend on demand. “We see global oil demand growing by 1.4 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019,” BNP Paribas said, implying that global markets are likely to remain sufficiently supplied.

More than 145 people died. “It has been a very, very challenging time,” Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten told reporters. “We anticipate it will actually be a number of years before our key communities in the Highlands area get back to some form of normality as roads and schools start to open and they get their gardens back on their feet,” he said. Oil Search’s oil facilities are all back on line, but will take around six months to return to normal operating rates, Botten said. But he said PNG LNG had recovered well, achieving record rates above 9 million tonnes a year, or 30 percent above its design capacity, since restarting production in mid-April. As a result, Oil Search raised its production guidance for 2018 to between 24 million and 26 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from 23 million to 26 million boe flagged in July. Net profit fell to $79.2 million for the six months to June from $129.1 million in the same half last year, but beat an average of five broker forecasts of $69 million. Production costs for the half year rose to $14.04 per boe, from $8.52 a year earlier, due to the drop in output. For the full year it sees production costs at between $11 and $13 per boe. Oil Search’s shares fell 2.4 percent on Tuesday, underperforming a 1.8 percent fall in the ASX energy index . The focus for Oil Search in the second half will be on talks with its partners in PNG LNG and Papua LNG, led by France’s Total SA, and the Papua New Guinean government about a $12 billion expansion of the PNG LNG plant. They plan to add 8 million tonnes a year of capacity, with two new production units, or trains, to be underpinned by Papua LNG’s Elk and Antelope fields, and one train to be underpinned by PNG LNG’s P’nyang field. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill has said he wants to finalise an agreement on the LNG expansion before the Asia Pacific Economic Co-Operation (APEC) summit in PNG in November, Botten said. “There still is a lot to do, but real progress is being made,” Botten said. The earthquake aftermath made negotiations tougher, with a backlash against the project from locals who considered the quake a natural reaction to gas drilling. The government is pressing Oil Search, Exxon and Total for better fiscal terms for the expansion than the original PNG LNG project after its revenue from the country’s biggest natural resource venture was less than expected. The plant started exports in 2014 just before oil prices collapsed. “We all understand there has to be a balance of rewards for all parties to make this work,” Botten said.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly lower, with Britain’s FTSE dipping 0.25 percent, Germany’s DAX shedding 0.05 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.1 percent. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, President Donald Trump said that China was manipulating its currency to make up for having to pay tariffs imposed by Washington on some imports from China. This kept global trade conflict concerns alive and dented some of the market optimism ahead of upcoming U.S.-China trade talks. He also said he believed the euro was being manipulated. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.6 percent. Australian stocks lost 1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI gained 0.95 percent and Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.2 percent. Chinese shares rose, with the Shanghai Composite Index climbing more than 1 percent, helped by bargain hunting of consumer and healthcare firms after their recent slump. Wall Street’s major indexes rose on Monday on optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, though they fell from session highs after Trump’s comments. Immediate focus was on the lower-level trade talks due to start this week between the United States and China. Speculation that the talks might help ease trade tensions has shored up the broader equity markets over the past few sessions. Market optimism was tested, however, after Trump said he did not “anticipate much” from the discussions. “Given the little progress made on the U.S.-China negotiations in the past six months, investors’ expectations are still low,” wrote Tai Hui, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “Ongoing negotiation is good news, and that’s what the market is riding on at this stage, but a sustainable agreement to end this tension still seems unlikely at this point.” In currency markets, the dollar came under pressure after Trump reiterated his displeasure at the Fed’s rate hikes, saying the central bank should do more to help him boost the U.S. economy. “The Fed looked to have strengthened its hawkish stance at the August policy meeting. But since then, the side effects of the U.S.-China trade war have started to appear, and Republicans struggled to win a special election in Ohio,” said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Mitsui Sumitomo Bank in Tokyo. “Against such a background, Trump’s latest jab at the Fed appears to have become stronger compared to the last time (in late July).” The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.4 percent at 95.499, extending losses from the previous day. The euro brushed a 12-day high of $1.1544, stretching its gains after climbing about climbing about 0.35 percent overnight. The U.S. currency touched 109.775 yen, its lowest since late June before edging back to 110.085. The onshore Chinese yuan rose to as high as 6.828 per dollar, its strongest since Aug. 9. The currency was on track for its fourth session of gains, pulling further away from 6.934, its weakest since January 2017 marked last week. The yuan has weakened to a 19-month low against the dollar earlier this month amid concerns towards the country’s economic growth, Sino-U.S. trade war worries and a broad rally by the dollar. The yuan has since pulled back slightly from the trough, with the People’s Bank of China taking steps perceived by investors that the authorities were not going to allow the currency to keep depreciating indefinitely. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was at 2.835 percent after stooping to a near a six-week low of 2.815 percent overnight in the wake of Trump’s interest rate comments. Oil prices nudged further up after rising the previous day, when investors grew more concerned about an expected fall in supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions.

2018-08-21,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Small to mid-sized renewable energy companies in India are starting to look like attractive takeover targets as lenders and investors withhold funds, worried by the stiff competition, weak bond markets, low tariffs and high debt besetting the sector.  The small companies’ difficulty in raising cash is keeping them away from government power project auctions, restricting their growth and crippling their ability to refinance loans, said a consultant from a top global consultancy firm.  With many smaller operators being gobbled up or offering themselves for sale, the number of projects being developed could fall, potentially keeping India from its renewable energy targets, said the consultant, who did not wish to be named as he is directly involved with a company that canceled a bond issue.  “India’s solar industry is becoming a big boys’ club,” said Rahul Goswami, managing director of Greenstone Energy Advisors.  In a few years, there may be only a few big companies and a few regional firms active in India’s renewable sector, he said.  The trend goes back at least to 2016, when Tata Power bought solar and wind company Welspun Renewable Energy, but the pace is expected to pick up.  “Smaller players are being squeezed out ... due to two main factors: cost of equipment and ... financing”, said Alok Verma, executive director at Kotak Investment Banking, an arm of Kotak Mahindra Bank.  One of India’s largest renewables companies, Greenko Group, said in June that it was buying 750 megawatts (MWs) of solar and wind assets from Orange Renewables, because the Singapore-based company saw few opportunities for growth. The deal has yet to be closed.  Essel Infra, with a renewable power capacity of 685 MWs, and Shapoorji Pallonji Group’s 400-MW solar arm are also in talks to sell off their assets, one firm and two banks doing the due diligence for these companies have said.  Besides loans, other funding options have also been dead ends for the smaller companies, further limiting growth opportunities.  ACME Solar postponed an initial public offering (IPO) announced in September last year as the proposed share issue did not generate enough interest from investors, confirmed a banker who was directly involved in the listing attempt.  Mytrah Energy, a major mid-sized renewables company, called off a $300 million to $500 million bond issue earlier this year as that option also went dry for the sector, and it canned IPO plans as well, said a separate banker directly involved there.  The companies have all declined to comment.  This dearth of financing and trend towards consolidation could be a significant threat to India’s target of 175 gigawatts (GWs) of renewables capacity by 2022, up from 71 GWs now, some analysts said.  Others said a concentration of bigger players, with more cash and better financing, could mean things move faster.  “Consolidation in the renewable energy industry augurs well for the overall success of the program ... Large players have access to required capital at reasonable rates and can procure the latest technology,” said Debasish Mishra, head of Energy, Resources and Industrials at Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu India.  Tata Power, one of India’s largest power generators, said in May it plans to invest $5 billion to increase its renewable capacity in India fourfold over the next decade to 12 GWs.  More than doubling India’s renewables capacity by 2022 will require $76 billion, including debt of $53 billion, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy said in July. For a graphic on India's renewable capacity growth, click tmsnrt.rs/2Pgiw60 Another problem in India’s renewable sector is debt.  “Many mid-sized firms have taken debt to fund their equity,” the partner of an investment firm said, adding that many such companies will need financial restructuring or have to put themselves up for auction.  This model of financing debt through equity is called mezzanine financing and tends to involve high interest rates and an option to convert debt to equity in future.  Both ACME and Mytrah are funded by Piramal Finance Ltd via mezzanine financing, according to statements by the companies at the time of funding.  For lending banks, this quasi-equity is seen as debt, making the liabilities of these companies look higher than usual, said the partner, who asked not to be named. The investment firm handles all kinds of financing, including mezzanine.  When companies with mezzanine financing go to banks for funds for upcoming projects, banks ask them for higher collateral or offer less cash in loan, said Kotak’s Verma.  Fitch Solutions said in a note last week that India would likely miss its renewable capacity targets due to “risks stemming from bureaucratic, financing and logistical delays.”  Reporting by Promit Mukherjee; Editing by Henning Gloystein and Tom Hogue",https://uk.reuters.com/article/india-renewables/indias-small-renewables-firms-fighting-consolidation-wave-idUKL4N1UD3OF,21 Aug 2018,"Small to mid-sized renewable

2018-08-21,"(Reuters) - Huawei Technology Co’s [HWT.UL] coming U.S. launch of a solar-panel control device is expected to collide with new Trump administration tariffs on Chinese electronics, undermining a product that analysts had seen as challenging rivals on pricing. The Chinese company, best known for its smart phones and telecommunications equipment, has developed a new generation of low-cost solar inverters, which convert, manage and monitor energy produced by solar panels for home use. Huawei has said it was aiming to roll out the product, called FusionHome, in the United States before the end of the summer, a year after its original target. Analysts and distributors had expected it to knock $100-$200 off current market prices of similar devices costing between $1,000 and $1,500 per household. But a coming 25 percent tariff on Chinese electronics that would overturn much of Huawei’s expected price advantage may have stalled talks with U.S. installers and distributors, said analysts and research firms. Huawei will either have to reduce its margins or raise prices, they said, potentially benefiting rival producers including SolarEdge (SEDG.O) and Enphase Energy (ENPH.O), which are ramping up manufacturing outside China. Huawei declined to comment on tariffs and did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters on the current status of FusionHome. Company spokesman Joe Kelly said in July that the company was planning to introduce the new product to its partners in the United States this summer and that the timing of the roll-out would depend on those distributors. The 25 percent tariff, if implemented, will take effect Aug. 23, and analysts covering the sector say it will affect the new Huawei product. “It certainly would eat into profits and is just a question on how aggressive Huawei wants to be,” said Cowen & Co analyst Jeffrey Osborne. Huawei’s foray into the high-margin residential market comes after panel installations fell in 2017 for the first time in seven years. GTM Research recently cut its forecast for 2018 residential solar market installations by 8 percent to 2.2 gigawatts. Of four major solar panel makers Reuters talked to, only Utah-based Vivint Solar (VSLR.N) confirmed it was considering adding Huawei’s inverter to its lineup.  SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) and Tesla’s SolarCity (TSLA.O) did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. A SunRun (RUN.O) spokeswoman said the company welcomed new innovations that made solar energy cheaper and more accessible. “A 25 percent tariff could eat up the margins of cost-competitive Chinese manufacturers and potentially change the player landscape of the U.S. solar inverter market,” said another analyst, Iben Frimann-Dahl from Rystad Energy.

Brent crude oil futures were at $72.24 per barrel at 0104 GMT, up 3 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $66.67 per barrel. Traders said prices were lifted by expectations of a drop in supply once U.S. sanctions against major oil exporter Iran take effect from November. In an attempt to prevent prices from spiking because of the potential supply reduction, the United States on Monday offered 11 million barrels of crude from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) for delivery from October 1 to November 30. Because of the looming supply disruption from Iran, French bank BNP Paribas said it expected oil production from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), of which Iran is a member, to fall from an average of 32.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2018 to 31.7 million bpd in 2019. Despite this, traders said overall oil market sentiment was cautious because of concerns over the demand outlook amid trade disputes between the United States and China. A Chinese trade delegation is due in Washington this week to resolve the dispute, but U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview on Monday he does not expect much progress, and that resolving the trade dispute with China will “take time.” The impact of the Iran sanctions is not yet clear. China has indicated that it will ignore the U.S. sanctions. The Iran supply cut may also be more than compensated for by production increases outside the OPEC producer cartel. BNP Paribas said non-OPEC output would likely grow by 2 million bpd in 2018 and by 1.9 million bpd next year. “Depending on when pipeline infrastructure constraints are lifted in the U.S., non-OPEC supply growth by the end of 2019 may prove higher than currently assumed,” the bank said. The search for new oil has increased globally in the last two years, with the worldwide rig count rising from 1,013 at the end of July 2016 to 1,664 in August 2018, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes (tmsnrt.rs/2MnSEr2). The biggest increase was in North America, where the rig count shot up from 491 to 1,057 in the last two years. How prices develop will also depend on demand. “We see global oil demand growing by 1.4 million barrels per day in both 2018 and 2019,” BNP Paribas said, implying that global markets are likely to remain sufficiently supplied.

Fund managers are becoming less bullish on the outlook for prices but few have dared to bet on substantial price falls (tmsnrt.rs/2OQQrkO). Gross long positions across the six major contracts have fallen by 464 million barrels since late April, while short positions have also fallen by 10 million barrels over the same period. Last week, as in most previous weeks, the reduction in net length was led by crude, with Brent down by 17 million and WTI by 41 million. By contrast, U.S. gasoline positions were down by 14 million barrels, but U.S. heating oil was unchanged and European gasoil rose by 4 million. And as in previous weeks, the reduction in net length was driven by the liquidation of former long positions (-67 million barrels) rather than the creation of new short ones (+2 million). Hedge fund managers continue to exit from their former bullish positions in Brent and WTI, according to regulatory and exchange data. Portfolio managers have cut their net long position in Brent in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 296 million barrels. Net length in Brent has fallen to its lowest level for 55 weeks, unwinding most of the increase since prices started to rise in July 2017. Brent long positions are very close to their lowest level 24 months; it is only the comparative absence of short positions that gives the hedge fund community a bullish position overall. The liquidation of so many former long positions has mitigated one source of downside risk hanging over oil prices. But with so few short positions, the hedge fund community’s positioning remains stretched, with almost 10 long positions for every short. If the outlook for the global economy and oil consumption deteriorates, there is still scope for funds to add short positions and push prices lower.

2018-08-21,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.02 pct, Nikkei down 0.6 pct * Trump accuses China, Europe of manipulating their currencies * Trump also reiterates displeasure at Fed’s rate hikes * Dollar/yen slips to near 3-mth low, US yields brush 6-wk trough By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Aug 21 (Reuters) - Asian stocks were capped and the dollar dipped on Tuesday after U.S. President Donald Trump accused China and Europe of manipulating their currencies and said he was “not thrilled” with the Federal Reserve for hiking interest rates. Keeping global trade conflict concerns on the boil, Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Monday that China was manipulating the yuan to make up for having to pay tariffs imposed by Washington on some imports from China. He also said he believed the euro was being manipulated. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.02 percent. Australian stocks lost 0.7 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI nudged up 0.1 percent and Japan’s Nikkei fell 0.6 percent. Wall Street’s major indexes rose on Monday on optimism over trade talks between the United States and China, though they fell from session highs after Trump’s comments. Immediate focus was on the lower-level trade talks due to start later on Tuesday between the United States and China. Speculation that the talks might help ease trade tensions has shored up the broader equity markets over the past few sessions. In currencies, the dollar came under pressure after Trump reiterated his displeasure at the Fed’s rate hikes, saying the central bank should do more to help him boost the U.S. economy. “While Trump’s displeasure for rising interest rates is nothing new, and the Fed maintains full operational independence, markets remain attentive to such comments,” wrote strategists at ANZ. The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.2 percent at 95.714, extending losses from the previous day. The euro brushed an 11-day high of $1.1493, stretching its gains after climbing about climbing about 0.35 percent overnight. The U.S. currency slipped to 109.84 yen, its lowest since late June. The offshore Chinese yuan was a shade firmer at 6.831 per dollar after dipping slightly the previous day. Yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note was near a six-week low of 2.807 percent plumbed overnight in the wake of Trump’s interest rate comments. Oil prices extended their overnight rise, with U.S. crude futures up 0.33 percent at $66.65 per barrel. Crude rose on Monday after weeks of declines, as investors grew more concerned about an expected fall in supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions. Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro
