2018-06-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israel’s energy minister said on Tuesday after meeting Trump administration officials he is confident that the United States will not relax non-proliferation standards in any nuclear power deal it agrees with Saudi Arabia. Israel vehemently opposes any effort by the Saudi Arabia to relax “gold standard” non-proliferation limits on enriching uranium or reprocessing nuclear fuel in any deal between the two countries, Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, told Reuters in an interview. “Once you allow one country to enrich uranium or reprocess fuel, it will be extremely difficult to tell other countries in this vicinity or elsewhere in the world not to do so,” he said.  Steinitz, in Washington for the World Gas Conference, met this week with people in the Trump administration about Saudi Arabia’s quest to build at least two nuclear power stations with the help of U.S. technology. He did not identify who he met with. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry has been working with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear agreement that could allow the kingdom to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium, practices that non-proliferation advocates worry could one day be covertly altered to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons.  The Energy Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the status of the nuclear power talks with Saudi Arabia. Israel and Saudi Arabia do not have diplomatic relations, but they share concern about Iranian influence in the Middle East. If the United States allows Saudi to relax the standards, “then you deteriorate the non-proliferation effort, so I am confident the Americans would listen to our concern,” Steinitz said. Steinitz said it would support Saudi Arabia’s development of nuclear power only if it included the gold standard protections and if the kingdom purchases uranium from the United States.   Saudi Arabia has said if it does not get U.S. assistance to build reactors it could turn to other international partners. The kingdom is also in talks with companies from Russia, China, South Korea and other countries on nuclear power.

2018-06-26,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - When General Electric Co bought oilfield services giant Baker Hughes last July, it created a global industry colossus with $22 billion (£16.62 billion) in annual revenue. GE promised to digitalize oilfields worldwide, marrying its expertise in big data, analytical software and subsea equipment with Baker Hughes’ experience in drilling services, chemicals and tools. Less than a year later, GE is bailing out of the deal, the firm announced Tuesday, planning to sell its 63 percent stake in the combined firm over time as part of a larger move to simplify its business and reduce debt. The retreat comes amid slipping market share, management missteps and culture clashes that have unsettled employees and frustrated suppliers and customers, according to data reviewed by Reuters and interviews with more than 30 employees, former employees, recruiters, analysts, suppliers and customers. GE managers initially took 11 of the combined firm’s top 15 posts and ushered in a by-the-book culture more like its aviation business than that of oil industry, where relationships are more prized and handshake deals are still common, said people who have had dealings with both. In a Tuesday note to employees seen by Reuters, Baker Hughes GE Chief Executive Lorenzo Simonelli complimented his “amazing team” and reassured them about the path ahead, but acknowledged “the last year has not always been easy for you, or our customers and partners.” “I recognize that this moment is bittersweet for some, welcomed perhaps by others,” he wrote. Baker Hughes GE lost market share in 12 of 19 services and equipment sectors between 2016 and 2017, according to a Reuters analysis of data from prominent oilfield services consultancy Spears & Associates. In one area where Baker Hughes has been a pioneer, drill bits, its share fell to 17 percent from 20 percent between 2016 and 2017. In a statement to Reuters, Baker Hughes GE attributed the market share losses to “challenging market dynamics” and said most of the losses occurred before the merger closed in summer of last year. Since the merger, suppliers have chafed under strict cost-cutting demands, and some customers shifted to competitors after abrupt service-fee increases and contract changes, according to suppliers, customers and former Baker Hughes executives. The choppy transition also has driven out veteran Baker Hughes managers in key departments and rattled staff. Revenue for the combined company last year was $21.9 billion, well below the $23.8 billion estimated in its 2017 merger proxy. Baker Hughes GE oilfield services and equipment revenues declined by $700 million. Rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton posted higher revenues on a resurgence in the North American hydraulic fracturing market, said Chirag Rathi, a consulting director at market researcher Frost & Sullivan. Baker Hughes sold a majority of its hydraulic fracturing business in 2016. Baker Hughes GE said its financial performance reflects broader industry trends and called itself a “strong and differentiated company” that now has a “defined path” to unwind the merger over the next two or three years. It said it would stay focused on supporting workers, customers and boosting shareholder value. Baker Hughes GE’s shares were up 2 percent to $33.13 on Tuesday, but still down nearly 18 percent since the merger closed. The company will now set about dividing itself before ever fully integrating the two firms. While the combined culture remains a work in progress, “the old Baker Hughes structure has been torn apart,” said Edward Muztafago, director of equity research at Societe Generale. It remains unclear whether Baker Hughes will continue to benefit from GE’s financial clout and advanced manufacturing over the long term.  Last year, Baker Hughes landed a major deal with Twinza Oil to provide oilfield services, equipment and financing for an offshore development near Papua New Guinea. Analysts say access to credit and lending from GE Capital, a unit GE is now planning to shrink, helped that deal come together. For now, Baker Hughes will continue to have access to vaunted GE technologies that were cited as key advantages in the original merger, including the GE Store, a technology and manufacturing exchange, and GE’s Predix operating system, which links and monitors equipment through the internet, the company said. But the company said Tuesday it would also develop solutions independent of the Predix system. Shortly after the merger closed last year, Baker Hughes GE made an “overnight” decision to raise prices and internal sales targets, a former employee told Reuters. The moves, along with squeezing costs from supplier contracts, aimed to raise revenue and margins. While oilfield margins have modestly improved, they still trail well behind those of top rivals Schlumberger and Halliburton, said Bernstein analyst Colin Davies, who noted the oil-price recovery has driven margin gains industrywide. One privately-held U.S. oil producer that uses Baker Hughes GE’s artificial lift products said the company raised its service prices by 20 percent late last year with little notice. The customer shifted some of its business to a rival, Novomet Inc, even after Baker Hughes GE agreed through negotiations to trim the increase. “They’re not managing the account as personally as they need to,” the customer said, declining to be named because of ongoing business between the two firms. Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on its pricing except to say it makes regular adjustments to stay competitive. Suppliers also have faced post-merger changes to contract terms and procurement processes. One company told Reuters that Baker Hughes GE pressed for a 3.5 percent discount on goods and a 120-day grace period on payments, terms the company rejected. Normally, customers pay within 30 to 60 days, the supplier said. One dispute escalated into a breach-of-contract lawsuit. Manufacturer Markall Inc built a successful business supplying components to Baker Hughes over four decades, but the relationship quickly deteriorated after the merger.   In the suit, filed in November, Markall alleges Baker Hughes GE had not paid for more than $5 million in custom parts that it had agreed to buy before the merger. Baker Hughes GE declined to comment on the lawsuit, saying it deals with issues predating the acquisition. GE Chief Executive John Flannery, appointed shortly after the merger, foreshadowed Tuesday’s announcement last November when he said the firm was considering its “exit options” just months after acquiring its controlling stake. Then the company cancelled a planned switch of former Baker employees to GE’s healthcare plan, several former Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas employees told Reuters. A move to cut staff just ahead of end-of-year holidays also hurt morale, two former workers said. Another sign of strain: the departure of veteran employees in key positions, according to more than a dozen sources familiar with the resignations. More than 50 resumes from Baker Hughes employees have landed with one professional recruiter since last summer, according to a headhunter there. Melissa Law - a 20-year Baker Hughes veteran and former president of its global chemicals business - joined food ingredients supplier Tate & Lyle last September. Eric Holcomb, formerly a Baker Hughes director of financial planning, left after more than a dozen years to join marine shipping company Kirby Corp in December. Chief Global Operations Officer Belgacem Chariag - one of a handful of Baker Hughes executives to remain in senior management after the merger - resigned in January without announcing a new position.  Chariag did not respond to a request for comment. Baker Hughes declined to comment on the departures but called its overall retention rates “strong and in line with the market.” Reporting by Liz Hampton; Additional reporting by Andres Guerra Luz in New York; Editing by Gary McWilliams and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/baker-hughes-ge-future/insight-the-culture-clash-behind-ges-quick-exit-from-baker-hughes-stake-idUKL2N1PP2ZK,26 Jun 2018,"When General Electric Co

2018-06-26,"WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - Israel is confident a second auction to sell rights to develop offshore natural gas will be more successful than its first because some Arab countries have shown they are open to importing the fuel, the country’s energy minister said in an interview on Tuesday. Israel, which discovered it has large reserves of natural gas offshore in 2009, will hold a second auction in October or November, offering about 20 or 25 blocks in the Mediterranean. The first auction, held last year, only got bids from two companies as some oil majors were concerned about a backlash from oil-rich Arab states hostile to the country. But Egypt agreed early this year to buy $15 billion in Israeli gas and Yuval Steinitz, Israel’s energy minister, is confident that sale, and another one to Jordan, will help the auction get more attention this year. Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries that have treaties with Israel. Though powerful Sunni Gulf Countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates do not recognize Israel, the U.S. allies do have a shared concern over Iranian influence in the region. “I think companies were skeptics about the exporting possibilities” of Israel, Steinitz told Reuters in an interview. “Things are different now.” In March, the partners in Israel’s offshore natural gas field Leviathan, its largest, said that all conditions have been met to allow the supply of gas to Jordan’s power generating company. In 2016 Leviathan’s partners signed a 15-year, $10 billion deal to supply gas to Jordan, subject to conditions and approvals. Steinitz met with five energy companies this week, in part to spark interest in the auction, including Exxon Mobil, France’s Total, and Australia’s Woodside Energy, on the sidelines of the World Gas Conference held in Washington. Israel could offer incentives for companies interested in developing its offshore gas, Steinitz said. Companies developing small to mid-size fields would face no export limits, he said. Companies developing larger fields would have some export limits but those would be “very minimal, almost insignificant,” he said. In addition, some companies would not necessarily have to link up with the Israeli natural gas transmission system and would have the option to pipe gas to Cyprus or Egypt or build a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) platform, he said. Israel has many plans for its gas abundance. It hopes to sell more to Egypt where the fuel could be converted to LNG for export, and to build pipelines, one to Jordan, where gas could be sent to India and avoid the Suez Canal, and other to Europe. Israel and Lebanon, meanwhile, have been struggling to overcome a dispute over exploration in the eastern Mediterranean. The U.S. government has been trying to help resolve the disagreement by participating in back-channel talks. Steinitz said there were new ideas on how to solve the issue, but did not reveal them. Israel would like to help bring an end to the problem, but it is more urgent for Lebanon because the gas would help its economy, he said.

2018-06-26,"(Adds more comments) NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday proposed a 3 percent increase in total renewable fuel volume requirements for next year, sparking criticism from some ethanol and oil groups and cheers from U.S. biodiesel producers. Below are comments on the proposal, which the EPA is required to finalize by Nov. 30. ADVANCED BIOFUELS BUSINESS COUNCIL “On its face, the EPA proposal is promising. It reverses last year’s roll back of cellulosic biofuels, and it opens growth opportunities for advanced producers who are establishing new revenue streams for rural America. But until there is some check on the EPA’s abuse of waivers, regulatory uncertainty will continue to threaten investments in advanced biofuels,” said Brooke Coleman, executive director. “EPA made the right call in not reallocating the waived small refiner exemption volumes, however the agency’s latest proposal for 2019 is yet another example – in fact it’s an annual example of a broken government program that needs a comprehensive legislative solution that includes the sunset of the program,” said Downstream Group Director Frank Macchiarola. “The RFS is a backward-looking policy that doesn’t reflect today’s energy market realities of strong domestic energy production.” “We welcome EPA’s decision to raise the advanced and cellulosic biofuel volumes in its proposal, which will help propel the industry forward in 2019. However, the advanced biofuels industry is still suffering the effects of the Agency’s decision to arbitrarily limit growth for low carbon biofuels in 2018, by setting a backward looking RFS requirement. The 2019 volumes should be higher, to correct from last year and also spur growth for the coming year,” said Executive Vice President Brent Erickson. JONI ERNST, REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM IOWA “As the state that leads the nation in renewable fuels production, Iowa farmers deserve honesty and transparency from the EPA on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The proposed uptick in the amount of renewable fuel that refiners blend into transportation fuel is encouraging, but does not make up for about 1.5 billion gallons lost by Administrator Pruitt’s decision to hand out an unprecedented number of small refinery waivers.” GROWTH ENERGY “The EPA proposed 15 billion gallons for conventional biofuels, but that still isn’t a real number we can count on. This plan fails to ensure those gallons will, in fact, be blended. By neglecting to reallocate gallons lost to waivers, the EPA is doubling down on another year of an estimated 1.5 billion gallons in demand destruction,” said Chief Executive Officer Emily Skor. IOWA RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION “This is a status quo proposal for ethanol and the status quo is bad,” said Executive Director Monte Shaw. “The ethanol number isn’t worth the paper it’s written on so long as Scott Pruitt is granting small refinery exemptions left and right – even beyond what the Department of Energy recommends.” NATIONAL BIODIESEL BOARD “We welcome the administration’s proposal to grow the biodiesel volumes, following two flatlined years. This is a positive signal for our industry and we’re pleased the EPA has acknowledged our ability to produce higher volumes. We’ve consistently demonstrated that we can do much more,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs. “It is promising that the EPA is planning to increase the volume of American grown and produced fuels in our transportation sector. However, the proposal does not do enough to account for the demand destruction of over a billion gallons of renewable fuels,” said Rob Larew, senior vice president of public policy and communications. “It would seem a hollow and cynical exercise to praise or thank EPA Administrator Pruitt for appearing to follow the statute with this proposed RVO,” said President and CEO Bob Dinneen. “While we acknowledge that the implied 15 billion-gallon requirement for conventional biofuels like corn ethanol should, in theory, send a positive signal to the market, it comes with the backdrop of 1.6 billion gallons of demand destructed by illegal waivers to small refineries and no commitment that EPA is changing its approach to granting these exemptions.” JOHN BARRASSO, REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM WYOMING “EPA made the right decision to follow the law, which explicitly allows small refineries to apply for hardship relief ‘at any time.’ EPA also made the right decision not to transfer the burden of small refineries to other refineries. Today, the agency has taken a positive step to protect American workers and reduce the way this broken program distorts the fuel market.” THE FUELING AMERICAN JOBS COALITION “If the ethanol industry would like to open the renewable fuel standard to reform in a comprehensive way, we are confident that many parties – fuel makers, environmentalists, consumer groups and others – would be very happy to join in.  Frankly, clarifying the SRE program is the least of the problems with the RFS. Making it more sensitive to the current realities of the fuel market would be a much better place to start.” “Today’s proposal ignores the underlying problems of the Renewable Fuel Standard. This fundamentally broken Washington-knows-best regulation causes millions of American families and businesses to pay more at the pump.” KEVIN SKUNES, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL CORN GROWERS ASSOCIATION “It is encouraging that EPA is following Congressional intent and proposing some growth in the RFS volumes and continuing to propose an implied 15-billion-gallon volume for conventional ethanol. However, by continuing to allow retroactive exemptions to refineries, EPA will undercut the volumes in this rule, rendering the proposed blending levels meaningless.” CHET THOMPSON, PRESIDENT & CEO OF AMERICAN FUEL AND PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURERS “EPA proposed to double-down on the most failed parts of the Renewable Fuel Standard. Higher cellulosic and biodiesel volumes— that are not connected to reality — would compound problems for consumers and refiners and continue the legacy of RFS dependence on expensive biodiesel imports. The RFS is a broken mandate and U.S. manufacturers, refiners and consumers are paying the price. Congress must reform this program.” Reporting by Chris Prentice

2018-06-26,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday proposed setting a blending mandate of 19.88 billion gallons for 2019 under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), 3 percent higher from this year’s and in line with expectations. The agency also said it is considering a number of measures to bring some transparency to the compliance credit market and decided against forcing large refiners to blend extra volumes to compensate for the hardship waiver exemptions for small refineries. The EPA’s decision against reallocating exempt volumes drew a wave of criticism from biofuel groups and their legislative backers in congress, but was applauded by the oil industry - the latest sign in the growing divide between the rival groups. The blending mandate would be up 3 percent from a 2018 requirement of 19.29 billion gallons and identical to figures that Reuters and other news outlets reported last week. The EPA proposal would leave the target for conventional biofuel, mostly corn-based ethanol, at 15 billion gallons, the agency said.  The agency proposed an advanced fuel requirement at 4.88 billion gallons for 2019 and a biodiesel mandate of 2.43 billion gallons for 2020. It proposed a cellulosic mandate of 381 million gallons for next year. “I’ve traveled to numerous states and heard firsthand about the importance of the RFS to farmers and local communities across the country,” EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement accompanying the release. Mike McAdams, president of the Advanced Biofuels Association, said the EPA proposal recognizes gains in the production of next-generation alternatives to corn-based ethanol. He said additional facilities are coming online and the higher targets will help ensure markets for the new gallons. Each year, the EPA must set annual requirements for the volume of renewable fuels that oil refiners and other fuel companies must blend with their petroleum-based products. The 2005 policy has been a source of contention between powerful corn and oil lobbies in Washington.  The agency also has the power to exempt smaller refineries from the blending requirements.  The EPA, under Pruitt, has roughly tripled the number of exemptions granted to small refiners, angering Midwest farmers and their legislative backers who say he is effectively lowering the mandate unless he forces larger refiners to make up the difference. Exemptions representing some 2.25 million gallons worth of biofuel were granted for 2017 and 2016, according to the EPA proposal. That includes waivers covering 1.46 million RINs in 2017, the EPA said. Pruitt was considering a plan to shift the burden to larger refineries but the plan was scrapped after an outcry from the oil industry. “The ethanol number isn’t worth the paper it’s written on so long as Scott Pruitt is granting small refinery exemptions left and right,” said Iowa Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA) Executive Director Monte Shaw. The American Petroleum Institute’s Downstream Group Director Frank Macchiarola said the EPA made the right call in not reallocating the waived volumes, but called on the agency to embrace much needed reforms. “The agency’s latest proposal for 2019 is yet another example – in fact it’s an annual example of a broken government program that needs a comprehensive legislative solution that includes the sunset of the program,” Macchiarola said.

2018-06-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rising shares of energy and technology companies helped global stock markets regain ground on Tuesday, a day after a mounting trade fight pummelled equities, while oil surged more than 2 percent as Washington lobbied against Iranian crude imports. Wall Street closed higher, aided in part by energy shares that soared after a senior U.S. State Department official said Washington was telling its allies to stop importing Iranian crude oil. “Yes, we are asking them to go to zero,” the official said when asked if the United States was pushing allies, including China and India, to cut oil imports to zero by November. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 30.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to 24,283.11, the S&P 500 gained 5.99 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,723.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.62 points, or 0.39 percent, to 7,561.63. Tech stocks rebounded from a sharp sell-off on Monday, after U.S. government officials said plans were in the works to block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.”   Apple Inc, which rose 1.2 percent, snapped a three-day losing streak. Stocks were also propelled upward by shares of consumer discretionary companies and by General Electric Co, whose shares rose 7.8 percent after the company said it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services company Baker Hughes.   A basket of European stocks also got a reprieve. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.09 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.08 percent, after Asia had extended a sell-off that wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. Despite the modest gains, investors remained wary. “We’re still in a tug-of-war between daily twists and turns of a potential trade war and the reality of a strong underlying U.S. economy,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co, said. Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as Washington and Europe, had led two benchmark Wall Street indexes on Monday to suffer their biggest losses in more than two months and launched China into bear market territory, with its major stock indexes down 20 percent from January peaks. After seeing a surge in buying on Monday, U.S. Treasury debt yields edged higher as concerned lingered that trade tensions could hurt economic growth, though safe-haven buying was capped on anticipation of more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. Gold hit its lowest in over six months as the selloff in global risk assets eased and it remained under pressure from the prospect that rising U.S. interest rates will further support the dollar. Oil prices, meanwhile, soared after the U.S.  official said the government was pressuring allies to halt Iranian crude imports.  “We’re going to isolate streams of Iranian funding and looking to highlight the totality of Iran’s malign behaviour across the region,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. Benchmark oil prices jumped over 2 percent and U.S. crude topped $70 a barrel for the first time in two months Brent crude gained 2.6 percent to trade at $76.68U.S. light crude rose 3.8 percent to $70.68. News that Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil in July, the most in its history, was outweighed by the renewed Iranian supply concerns, traders said. In currencies, the dollar rose across the board as global trade tensions prompted traders to ditch most high-yielding currencies and investors focused on expectations the Federal Reserve will continue to raise interest rates. The dollar index rose 0.43 percent, with the euro down 0.49 percent to $1.1645. The Japanese yen weakened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 110.07 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3219, down 0.41 percent.

2018-06-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude futures jumped over 2 percent on Tuesday and U.S. oil topped $70 for the first time in two months as Washington pushed allies to halt imports of Iranian crude, which would constrain global supplies.  The market rallied further in post-settlement trading, after the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude inventories fell a surprising 9.2 million barrels, far exceeding the decline of 2.6 million barrels that had been expected. [API/S] Brent crude LCOc1 gained $1.58 to settle at $76.31 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 climbed $2.45 to settle at $70.53. In post-settlement trading, where volumes are small, Brent extended gains to $76.61 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose to $70.76 a barrel. Washington is pushing countries to halt imports of Iranian oil from November, a senior State Department official said, adding it will not grant waivers to sanctions. That “lit a fire” under oil markets today, said Matt Smith, director of commodities research at ClipperData. It overshadowed Saudi Arabia’s plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil in July, the most in its history, traders said. U.S. President Donald Trump in May said his administration was withdrawing from a 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions.  During the previous sanctions regime, some Asian countries received waivers enabling them to buy Iranian crude. If waivers are not granted, that suggests reduced flows to Asia as well as to Europe.  “This is a new development,” Smith said. “If we are going to see more Iranian barrels coming off the market, that is likely to be bullish for U.S. exports.”  Iran’s seaborne crude exports fell to about 1.93 million bpd in June from 2.38 mln bpd in May and 2.58 mln bpd in April, based on Thomson Reuters data. The U.S. official specifically cited India and China as countries that would have to stop accepting Iranian imports, though officials have not yet spoken with those countries. India imports large quantities of oil from Iran, though the country has suggested it would comply with Washington; Beijing, meanwhile, has not committed to an agreement to stop buying Iranian oil, and rising trade tensions with the United States may make such an agreement less likely. The market was also dealing with the outage at Syncrude Canada’s 360,000 bpd oil sands facility near Fort McMurray, Alberta, which a spokeswoman confirmed will remain offline through July. Traders expect this to reduce crude flows to Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery point of the U.S. crude futures contract.  In addition, a power struggle among the two parallel Libyan national oil companies created uncertainty on the country’s export ability. These output losses follow a move by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers last week to increase supply by around 1 million barrels per day (bpd). “There is concern that the recent agreement by OPEC and non-OPEC producers will not be enough to satisfy oil demand,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates.  The API data showed builds in gasoline and diesel inventories. The figures are followed with Wednesday’s release of U.S. Energy Information Administration figures on oil and refined product stocks.

2018-06-26,"VANCOUVER/WINNIPEG, Manitoba, June 26 (Reuters) - The nationalization of a crude oil export pipeline in western Canada has buoyed long-standing hopes for crude exports to markets beyond the United States - but the most likely destination for much of that oil is California. Faced with declining production from Latin America and rising prices for higher-grade crudes from the Middle East, the Golden State is importing more oil from Canada - much of it via the Trans Mountain pipeline, which Kinder Morgan Canada last month sold to Ottawa for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion). The Canadian government has pledged to “immediately” start work on the C$7.4 billion Edmonton-to-Vancouver expansion, in an attempt to alleviate a bottleneck of Canadian crude oil due to full pipelines and several aborted attempts to add additional capacity. This line, when completed, would nearly triple flows to 890,000 barrels per day (bpd). The project would provide landlocked Western Canadian producers with long-desired access to markets beyond the United States. The U.S. currently buys virtually all of Canada’s oil exports, most of it at a steep discount. But recent shipping data suggests demand from California for Canadian crude is rising, and experts say that state could end up taking up to half of the new export capacity from an expanded Trans Mountain. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has tried to sell the pipeline to a divided public as a crucial link to Asia, amid domestic concerns over the mounting trade tussle with the United States. Just days after Trudeau’s government agreed to buy the project, an Aframax tanker carrying more than 500,000 barrels of heavy crude left Kinder Morgan’s Westridge Marine Terminal and traveled to Long Beach, California, one of eight shipments to California in May. Canadian crude exports from Westridge topped 2.5 million barrels that month, with every last drop shipped to California refineries, according to Reuters Eikon data. So far this year, 72.8 percent of Westridge crude exports have gone to California. The state currently imports the bulk of its crude from Canada, Ecuador, Colombia and the Middle East. But production is declining in Ecuador and Colombia, and Canadian crude is priced more attractively than Middle Eastern grades, making the Trans Mountain expansion a lucrative possibility for refiners. Specifically, Canadian shippers will price crude to displace barrels from Saudi Arabia and Iraq, said Dave Hackett, president of consultancy Stillwater Associates. “With Venezuela in chaos, the world is going to welcome additional heavy Canadian barrels,” he said. Canada has been trying for years to build a pipeline to its coast to access world markets. Recent attempts like Enbridge Inc’s Northern Gateway and TransCanada Corp’s Energy East have failed amid court battles and regulatory uncertainty. Rising output from Canada’s oil sands has outstripped current pipeline capacity and rail has not yet ramped up to meet existing demand from producers, leaving Canadian crude deeply discounted. While California is currently a big customer, crude flows shift and opening up access to Asia and other regions through an expanded Trans Mountain is in Canada’s best interest, said Jennifer Rowland, a senior analyst with Edward Jones Equity Research. “Pretty much everything goes to the United States,” she said. “You wouldn’t run your company that way. You’d want to have more than one customer.” ($1 = 1.2980 Canadian dollars) (Reporting by Julie Gordon in Vancouver Editing by Marguerita Choy)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/canada-pipeline-exports/canada-dreams-of-oil-exports-to-asia-but-california-beckons-idUKL2N1TA1AC,26 Jun 2018,"The

2018-06-26,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates will soon announce an integrated programme to support Bahrain’s economic reforms and its fiscal stability, a joint statement from the three Gulf states said on Tuesday. Bahrain’s finances have been hit hard by a slump in oil prices in 2014. On Tuesday, Bahrain’s dinar plunged to a 17-year low against the U.S. dollar as hedge funds dumped Bahraini bonds because of concern about rising public debt. Many bankers said expectations that Saudi Arabia and perhaps other regional allies of Bahrain would eventually provide it with additional financial support were preventing worse instability in the markets. The three wealthy Gulf states said in a statement sent to Reuters late on Tuesday that they are in talks with authorities of Bahrain to enhance the financial stability of the Kingdom.  They said they were in discussions “to confirm their commitment to consider all options to support the kingdom of Bahrain and to finalise an integrated programme that will soon be announced to enable the kingdom of Bahrain to support its economic reforms and fiscal stability.” Bankers and officials in the Gulf previously told Reuters that Bahrain has been discussing for over a year the possibility of obtaining such aid from Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries. The small size of the Bahraini economy would make it relatively easy for its wealthier neighbouring states to bail it out, which could protect their own economies from the risk of contagion. Manama has projected a state budget gap of $3.5 billion in 2018.

2018-06-26,"LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon’s oil workers’ union ONEP plans to start a 15-day strike at the facilities of French oil firm Total on Sunday if its demands for higher pay and other benefits are not met, it said in a letter to Total Gabon. In the letter dated on Monday and seen by Reuters, ONEP also demanded new bonuses for employees, increased career advancement opportunities and a reduction in the number of foreign workers. A Total spokeswoman said that Total Gabon had fully consulted workers’ representatives about recent changes in the company’s strategy and that discussions were continuing to resolve the dispute.  The strike would affect all of Total’s facilities in Gabon, including in the capital Libreville and oil hub of Port Gentil. The threat of strike action follows the company’s failure to respond to the union’s earlier demands made in May, the letter said.  The Central African nation produces about 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, but output from the OPEC member’s ageing fields has plummeted from a 1997 peak of 370,000 bpd. A steep fall in oil prices in 2014 and 2015 cut much needed revenue and forced companies to lay off thousands of oil workers.  Total produces about 54,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Gabon.

2018-06-26,"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Tuesday proposed a 3 percent increase in total renewable fuel volume requirements for next year, sparking criticism from some ethanol and oil groups and cheers from U.S. biodiesel producers. Below are comments on the proposal, which the EPA is required to finalize by Nov. 30. ADVANCED BIOFUELS BUSINESS COUNCIL “On its face, the EPA proposal is promising. It reverses last year’s roll back of cellulosic biofuels, and it opens growth opportunities for advanced producers who are establishing new revenue streams for rural America. But until there is some check on the EPA’s abuse of waivers, regulatory uncertainty will continue to threaten investments in advanced biofuels,” said Brooke Coleman, executive director. “EPA made the right call in not reallocating the waived small refiner exemption volumes, however the agency’s latest proposal for 2019 is yet another example – in fact it’s an annual example of a broken government program that needs a comprehensive legislative solution that includes the sunset of the program,” said Downstream Group Director Frank Macchiarola. “The RFS is a backward-looking policy that doesn’t reflect today’s energy market realities of strong domestic energy production.” “We welcome EPA’s decision to raise the advanced and cellulosic biofuel volumes in its proposal, which will help propel the industry forward in 2019. However, the advanced biofuels industry is still suffering the effects of the Agency’s decision to arbitrarily limit growth for low carbon biofuels in 2018, by setting a backward looking RFS requirement. The 2019 volumes should be higher, to correct from last year and also spur growth for the coming year,” said Executive Vice President Brent Erickson. JONI ERNST, REPUBLICAN SENATOR FROM IOWA “As the state that leads the nation in renewable fuels production, Iowa farmers deserve honesty and transparency from the EPA on the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS). The proposed uptick in the amount of renewable fuel that refiners blend into transportation fuel is encouraging, but does not make up for about 1.5 billion gallons lost by Administrator Pruitt’s decision to hand out an unprecedented number of small refinery waivers.” GROWTH ENERGY “The EPA proposed 15 billion gallons for conventional biofuels, but that still isn’t a real number we can count on. This plan fails to ensure those gallons will, in fact, be blended. By neglecting to reallocate gallons lost to waivers, the EPA is doubling down on another year of an estimated 1.5 billion gallons in demand destruction,” said Chief Executive Officer Emily Skor. IOWA RENEWABLE FUELS ASSOCIATION “This is a status quo proposal for ethanol and the status quo is bad,” said Executive Director Monte Shaw. “The ethanol number isn’t worth the paper it’s written on so long as Scott Pruitt is granting small refinery exemptions left and right – even beyond what the Department of Energy recommends.” NATIONAL BIODIESEL BOARD “We welcome the administration’s proposal to grow the biodiesel volumes, following two flatlined years. This is a positive signal for our industry and we’re pleased the EPA has acknowledged our ability to produce higher volumes. We’ve consistently demonstrated that we can do much more,” said Kurt Kovarik, vice president of federal affairs. “It is promising that the EPA is planning to increase the volume of American grown and produced fuels in our transportation sector. However, the proposal does not do enough to account for the demand destruction of over a billion gallons of renewable fuels,” said Rob Larew, senior vice president of public policy and communications. “It would seem a hollow and cynical exercise to praise or thank EPA Administrator Pruitt for appearing to follow the statute with this proposed RVO,” said President and CEO Bob Dinneen. “While we acknowledge that the implied 15 billion-gallon requirement for conventional biofuels like corn ethanol should, in theory, send a positive signal to the market, it comes with the backdrop of 1.6 billion gallons of demand destructed by illegal waivers to small refineries and no commitment that EPA is changing its approach to granting these exemptions.” Reporting by Chris Prentice; Editing by Lisa Shumaker",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-biofuels-reaction/factbox-ethanol-oil-groups-criticize-u-s-biofuels-plan-biodiesel-industry-cheers-idUKL1N1TS1HA,26 Jun 2018,"The U.S. Environmental

2018-06-26,"(Reuters) - A federal court in California dismissed climate change lawsuits by the cities of San Francisco and Oakland against five oil companies, saying the complaints required foreign and domestic policy decisions that were outside its purview. San Francisco and Oakland sued Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, and BP Plc last year seeking an abatement fund to help the cities address flooding they said was a result of climate change. Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said in the ruling that the  dangers raised by the complainants were real and worldwide, and both parties accepted the science behind global warming.  “(However), the problem deserves a solution on a more vast scale than can be supplied by a District Judge or jury in a public nuisance case,” Judge Alsup said.  The suit was one of several filed by cities and local governments around the country that argued in part the production of fossil fuels had led to rising tides that damaged shorelines, roads and other properties requiring remediation.  Alsup, who held a primer on climate change during the case, wrote that although scientists agree burning fossil fuels is raising ocean levels, the suits “could interfere with reaching a worldwide consensus” on the social pros and cons of fuel use.     Chevron, which took the lead in fighting the case, called the decision “important and well-reasoned” and said although the ruling is not binding on other courts, judges in similar cases “should follow Judge Alsup’s lead and dismiss their cases as well,” according to spokesman Sean Comey.   Richard Wiles, executive director of the Center for Climate Integrity, an advocacy group that supports the lawsuits, called the decision disappointing, but added: “This fight is just getting started and we expect to win.”     A Shell spokeswoman said the company regards climate change to be a complex problem, which is not an issue for the courts but requires sound government policy.

2018-06-26,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Tuesday it will spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services firm Baker Hughes, effectively breaking up the 126-year-old conglomerate which was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power. The slimmed-down company will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy, which GE hopes will reward battered shareholders who have seen the stock lose more than half its value over the past 20 years. “This is really the culmination of 10 years of observations I’ve had about the company,” said Chief Executive John Flannery, a GE veteran who took the helm in August with a mandate to revamp the company. Flannery’s comments came on a conference call with investors and analysts. GE said its plan will strengthen its balance sheet by reducing debt, building up cash and further shrinking GE Capital. Shareholders will receive 80 percent of the value of GE Healthcare as a tax-free distribution of shares. GE shares jumped 8.7 percent to $13.86, on track for their best day in three years. Effective Tuesday, GE was kicked out of the Dow Jones industrial average, the iconic stock index of which it was a founding member in 1896.  The company will spin off the profitable healthcare unit over the next 12 to 18 months, and sell its Baker Hughes stake over two to three years. GE will likely either need to hold an initial public offering of Baker Hughes, organize numerous block trades of shares to institutional investors, or find an entirely new investor to acquire its holding since the only two strategic buyers of its stake, Schlumberger NV and Halliburton Co, would have major antitrust risks in the oilfield services market, analysts said. In an interview, Flannery declined to rule out selling healthcare or the Baker Hughes stake to strategic buyers, but he said the company intended to have them both trade publicly so GE shareholders benefit from future growth. The decision to divest does not mean GE dislikes the businesses, he said. “It’s quite the opposite. We’re trying to get these out directly into our shareholders hands and in an environment where they can grow more quickly.”  GE pledged to preserve its 48-cent-a-year dividend until the healthcare unit is spun off, partially appeasing investors who have expressed concerns about the company’s ability to pay it. [L2N1SU17A] The moves, which end a year-long strategic review, mirror changes that analysts had sought a year ago.  GE said its plan to divest $20 billion in assets “is substantially complete,” leaving a “simpler and stronger” company that it hopes will boost growth, operating profits and shareholder returns. Major shareholder Trian Fund Management supports GE’s plans and believes that the initiatives will create “substantial value for shareholders,” it said in a statement.  The remaining businesses “share similar technologies and industrial markets, in contrast to limited synergies that exist with GE Healthcare,” Fitch analyst Eric Ause said in a note. To view a graphic on GE's market capitalization under past 4 CEOs, click: reut.rs/2Mp76e4 But the changes leave GE with some of its best- and worst-performing units. Aviation has been highly profitable, but power business profit has tumbled as sales of plants and services have slowed, and renewable energy profit margins are less than 5 percent, a result of fierce price competition. Flannery said in the interview that he expected gas-powered electricity generation to keep rising over the next 30 years. But new power plant sales will be weak “and frankly we’re planning for that as sort of indefinite,” Flannery said.  “We’re making management actions now premised on we’ve got to live in that world,” he said. “If it changes, great, but don’t hope.” The healthcare unit spinoff follows rival Siemens AG’s floating its medical business as a separate company, Siemens Healthineers, in March. On Monday GE said it agreed to sell its distributed power unit for $3.25 billion to U.S. buyout group Advent. GE also has agreed to shed its transportation unit, which makes railroad locomotives. GE bought Baker Hughes in 2017 and combined it with its own oil-and-gas equipment and services unit to create a new company in which GE owns 62.5 percent. The unit reported sales of $17.23 billion in 2017. GE estimated restructuring costs at between $800 million and $1.2 billion, and said it plans to reduce industrial net debt by about $25 billion by 2020 and maintain more than $15 billion of cash on its balance sheet. The company has foundered in key markets in recent years, and a foray into financial services steered it into the eye of the global financial crisis in 2008. GE has since largely divested GE Capital, but lingering liabilities forced it to take a $6.2 billion charge last year, and begin setting aside $15 billion more in reserves against insurance claims. Former GE CEO Jeff Immelt, who ran the company for 16 years, from shortly before the 9/11 attacks to last summer, said in a statement that important elements of GE’s history would continue after the latest batch of sales are done. “GE remains a formidable company,” he said.

GE jumped 8.6 percent, putting it on track for its biggest one-day gain in more than three years, after the company said it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services company Baker Hughes. Tech stocks rebounded from a sharp selloff on Monday, after U.S. government officials said plans were in the works to block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.47 points, or 0.41 percent, to 24,352.27, the S&P 500 gained 11.72 points, or 0.43 percent, to 2,728.79 and the Nasdaq Composite added 43.66 points, or 0.58 percent, to 7,575.67. A basket of European stocks also got a reprieve. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.09 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.18 percent, after Asia had extended a sell-off that has wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. Despite the modest gains, investors remained wary. “We’re still in a tug-of-war between daily twists and turns of a potential trade war and the reality of a strong underlying U.S. economy,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Co, said. Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as Washington and Europe, had led two benchmark Wall Street indexes on Monday to suffer their biggest losses in more than two months and launched China into bear market territory, with its major stock indexes down 20 percent from January peaks. After seeing a surge in buying on Monday, U.S. Treasury debt yields edged higher as concerned lingered that trade tensions could hurt economic growth, though safe-haven buying was capped on anticipation of more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The tense atmosphere knocked down most industrial metal prices amid worries about the global fallout of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which could hamper economic growth and metals demand. Copper and aluminum were at or near their lowest since April while zinc plunged to its weakest since August last year. Gold hit its lowest in over six months as the selloff in global risk assets eased and it remained under pressure from the prospect that rising U.S. interest rates will further support the dollar. Oil prices, meanwhile, soared after a U.S. government official said Washington was pushing its allies to halt imports of Iranian crude. “We’re going to isolate streams of Iranian funding and looking to highlight the totality of Iran’s malign behavior across the region,” the official told reporters. Benchmark oil prices jumped over 2 percent and U.S. crude topped $70 a barrel for the first time in two months Brent crude gained $1.30 to trade at $76.03 by 2:17 p.m. EDT (1817 GMT). U.S. light crude rose $2.08 to $70.16. News that Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil in July, the most in its history, was outweighed by the renewed Iranian supply concerns, traders said. In currencies, the dollar index rose 0.42 percent, with the euro down 0.47 percent to $1.1647. The Japanese yen weakened 0.33 percent versus the greenback at 110.13 per dollar, while sterling was last trading at $1.3208, down 0.50 percent. The Turkish lira firmed against the dollar in volatile trade amid uncertainty over economic policy under a new government due to be formed following President Tayyip Erdogan’s victory in Sunday’s election.

2018-06-26,"(Adds details, background) DUBAI, June 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to pump up to 11 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) in July, the highest in its history, up from about 10.8 million bpd in June, an industry source familiar with Saudi oil production plans told Reuters on Tuesday. OPEC agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies on Saturday to raise output from July by about 1 million bpd, with Saudi Arabia pledging a “measurable” supply boost but giving no specific numbers. It was not immediately clear whether most of the output will move towards exports or Saudi inventories. A second industry source said the boost in output “will go to the market” without giving more details. The move by Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is a clear indication it is serious about bringing oil prices down, after major consumers such as the United States, China and India raised concerns that prices were rising too high, too quickly. Benchmark oil prices jumped over 2 percent on Tuesday and U.S. crude topped $70 for the first time in two months, as Washington pushed allies to halt imports of Iranian crude. Brent crude gained $1.30 to trade at $76.03 a barrel by 2:17 p.m. EDT (1817 GMT). U.S. light crude rose $2.08 to $70.16. The United States is pushing countries to halt oil imports from Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer, from November, a senior State Department official said, and it will not grant any waivers to sanctions. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Saturday the kingdom will increase output by hundreds of thousands of barrels, with exact figures to be decided later. “We already mobilised the Aramco machinery, before coming to Vienna,” Falih said, referring to the Saudi state oil company, adding that the media and analysts have “underestimated” the action that will be taken by OPEC and its allies. OPEC and non-OPEC said in their statement on Saturday that they would raise supply by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously agreed output cuts, after months of underproduction. That would mean a roughly 1 million bpd increase in output. OPEC sources have said OPEC alone would produce around 770,000 bpd out of the 1 million bpd, with non-OPEC pumping about 185,000 bpd. Out of OPEC’s share Saudi Arabia was likely to produce between 300,000 bpd and 400,000 bpd, above its current production target of 10.058 million bpd, OPEC sources said. Saudi Arabia pumped just above 10 million bpd in May, but remained under its target.

2018-06-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency has consistently ignored recommendations from the Department of Energy to reject or limit waivers to oil refiners seeking exemptions from nation’s biofuels law, according to five sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires the firms to cover costs of blending corn-based ethanol into gasoline. But the EPA, after consulting with the energy department, can exempt small refineries in cases where compliance presents a “disproportionate economic hardship.”  The waivers can save refiners tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Under EPA chief Scott Pruitt, an appointee of President Donald Trump, the agency has issued more than two dozen such exemptions in recent months - about triple the usual number granted under past administrations. During that time, EPA has consistently granted full waivers in cases where the energy department recommended only partial exemptions, and, at least once, granted a full approval when the energy department advised an outright rejection, according to two sources familiar with the decisions. That approach marks a sharp break from Obama administration’s EPA, which had often either adopted energy department recommendations or, when it didn’t, ruled against exempting oil refiners, the sources said. The shift between the Democratic and Republican administrations shows how political ideologies and constituencies can steer bureaucratic interpretation of a law that never changed - with major impacts on industry. The waivers save refineries money by freeing them from their obligation to blend ethanol into their gasoline or to purchase compliance credits from those who do. The broad use of waivers lately has angered the powerful corn lobby, which argues they threaten corn demand. The Renewable Fuels Association, which represents U.S. ethanol makers, last month estimated that the waivers have reduced the amount of ethanol refiners are required to blend by 1.6 billion gallons. The law currently requires refiners to blend 15 billion gallons of the biofuel per year. The surge in waivers has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five-year lows, saving refiners such as Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy hundreds of millions of dollars. Until now, it was not known if the EPA gave the waivers on the basis of the energy department recommendations or despite them. The EPA has denied public records requests seeking information on the waivers, which it considers proprietary company information. Pruitt has misled farmers about the agency’s relationship with the energy department to help shield himself from criticism, Jon Doggett, said Executive Vice President of the National Corn Growers Association. “Actions like that make it nearly impossible for farmers to trust anything this EPA has to say,” Dogget said in a statement Tuesday. Biofuel groups have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Washington to review legality of the waivers - arguing the EPA is “methodically destroying the demand for renewable fuels” - and to force the EPA to disclose them. EPA spokeswoman Molly Block declined to comment on the pending litigation or on whether the agency has approved waivers that the energy department recommended rejecting. “From the beginning of this administration, we have worked closely with our partners at DOE on this issue,” she said in a written statement. DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not respond to requests for comment. During a recent Midwest tour, Pruitt told Nebraska farmers that the EPA works “in alliance with the Department of Energy” to grant the waivers, saying there was just one example of disagreement. EPA spokespeople have repeatedly said the agency’s criteria for granting waivers have not changed. “He sat in our conference room, looked us in the eye, and told us ... that EPA doesn’t approve them without DOE’s recommendation,” Bill Pracht, a farmer and CEO of East Kansas Agri-Energy, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Now we know that just isn’t true.” The sources with knowledge of the two agencies’ interactions disputed the assertion that the EPA and DOE are acting as partners in these decisions. They declined to provide a specific number of cases in which the EPA has gone against energy department recommendations or to name most of the companies involved, but did provide two examples of what they said has become regular practice. In one case, the EPA provided a full waiver to a refiner after the energy department had recommended rejecting the exemption, two sources told Reuters. In another, the EPA granted full waivers to refineries owned by Andeavor - a large U.S. refining company which reported $1.4 billion in net income last year - after the energy department had recommended a 50-percent exemption, according to two other sources familiar with the company’s approval. The waivers for Andeavor were first reported by Reuters in April. The company said in a May earnings statement that the waivers, provided to its smallest refineries, saved it about $100 million in compliance costs.  Scott LaBelle, an Andeavor spokesman, declined to comment beyond the company’s previous statements. Obama’s administration was accused of being too stingy with the waivers. Last year, an appellate judge said Obama’s EPA had used too narrow a definition of “financial hardship” when it denied Sinclair Oil waivers for its Wyoming refineries for 2014 and 2015. But appellate judges in two other similar cases upheld the EPA’s denials and its methods. Neither the rulings nor the change in presidential administrations changed the way energy department analysts scored applications, according to the sources.  Energy department analysts score applications on a two-part test that considers whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact or threaten a refinery’s viability. Qualifying under either leads to a partial exemption; qualifying under both leads to a full exemption.  The EPA’s relaxed standard for the waivers is the latest illustration of the agency’s leadership seeking to deliver relief to refiners from the law, which was signed under Republican President George W. Bush to help farmers, reduce petroleum imports and improve air quality. Pruitt has repeatedly recommended overhauling the law to reduce strain on refiners and advocated for changes during months of failed negotiations between oil and corn representatives mediated by President Donald Trump.  Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa, the top ethanol-producing state, said Pruitt’s handling of the waivers appeared to be based on a political goal of helping the oil industry - a charge the EPA has denied. “This is definitely a workaround that they have figured out. That’s why we are demanding transparency,” Ernst said in an interview, referring to requests her and other lawmakers for the EPA to disclose information on the waivers. The current administration has attempted to lower compliance costs for some refiners since billionaire investor and refinery-owner Carl Icahn first raised concerns to Trump during his campaign, and then again after Trump named Icahn as a “special advisor” on industry regulation after his election. Icahn resigned from his advisory post in August under pressure from lawmakers who said his dual role as investor and advisor posed ethical concerns. Icahn’s CVR Energy was among the refining companies that received a waiver from EPA, Reuters reported earlier this year.

2018-06-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has told countries to cut all imports of Iranian oil from November and is unlikely to offer any exemptions, a senior State Department official said on Tuesday as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on allies to cut off funding to Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump in May said his administration was withdrawing from the “defective” nuclear deal agreed between Iran and six world powers in July 2015, aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear capabilities in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions, and ordered the reimposition of U.S. sanctions against Tehran that were suspended under the accord. “Yes, we are asking them to go to zero,” the official said when asked if the United States was pushing allies, including China and India, to cut oil imports to zero by November. “We’re going to isolate streams of Iranian funding and looking to highlight the totality of Iran’s malign behavior across the region,” the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters. The official said a U.S. delegation was headed to the Middle East next week to urge Gulf producers to ensure global oil supplies as Iran is cut out of the market starting on Nov. 4 when U.S. sanctions are reimposed. Officials have yet to hold talks with China and India, among the largest importers of Iran’s oil, as well as Turkey and Iraq. Benchmark U.S. oil futures rose more than $2 on Tuesday, topping $70 a barrel for the first time since May 25 as the threat that the United States would push buyers to limit Iranian oil imports added to concerns about tightening supplies. Asked if any waivers were expected to be granted in the process, the official said the position of the administration was that no exemptions would be permitted. He added: “I would be hesitant to say zero waivers ever.”  Senior State Department and Treasury officials are pressing allies in Europe, Asia and the Middle East to adhere to the sanctions, which are aimed at pressuring Iran to negotiate a follow-up agreement to halt its nuclear programs. Iran has met with Chinese oil buyers to ask them to maintain imports of its oil, although it failed to secure guarantees from China, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in May. “We will be engaging in the next segment coming up in a week or so with our Middle Eastern partners to ensure the global supply of oil is not adversely affected by these sanctions,” the official said. China, the world’s top crude oil buyer, imported around 655,000 barrels a day on average from Iran in the first quarter of this year, according to official Chinese customs data, equivalent to more than a quarter of Iran’s total exports. Oil analysts said there are concerns that OPEC producers will not be able to fully supply the market after Iranian oil is cut from the market. “There is real concern on whether the ‘OPEC Plus’ will have enough spare capacity to balance potential drops in oil production from Venezuela and Iran,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London. European powers have vowed to keep the 2015 deal alive without the United States by trying to keep Iran’s oil and investment flowing, but have acknowledged that U.S. sanctions would make it difficult to give Tehran guarantees. “For the vast majority of countries they are willing to adhere and support our approach to this because they also view” Iran’s behavior as a threat, the official added. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday promised Iranians the government would be able to handle the economic pressure of new U.S. sanctions amid reports of a second day of demonstrations in protest at financial hardship and a weakening rial. Fars news agency reported that parts of Tehran’s Grand Bazaar were on strike for a second straight day. Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the report. Washington has sought to emphasize that the protests are part of rising economic discontent in Iran hoping it will force the government to negotiate a new nuclear deal to avoid sanctions. “There is a level of frustration that people have with regard to the regime activity and behavior, the enrichment of the military and clerical elite and the squeezing out of the life of the economy,” the senior State Department official said.  “Iranians are tired of this situation,” the official added.

2018-06-26,"* Russia laying TurkStream under Black Sea to bypass Ukraine * Bulgaria sees some Russian gas going to new hub * Gazprom yet to decide on TurkStream route beyond Turkey (.) By Tsvetelia Tsolova and Alissa de Carbonnel SOFIA/BRUSSELS, June 26 (Reuters) - Bulgaria launched a tender on Wednesday for a new gas link with Turkey in a push to persuade Russia to extend the second part of the TurkStream pipeline to its border rather than Greece. Sofia has engaged in a flurry of diplomacy with Moscow and Istanbul in recent weeks to ensure it receives the gas Russia plans to send to Europe through its Black Sea pipeline bypassing Ukraine to the south. Bulgaria has also been building a business case. It has tapped market interest in a 1.4 billion euro ($1.6 billion) pipeline to take mainly Russian gas via Bulgaria to central and eastern Europe. State gas firm Bulgartransgaz has said five firms expressed an interest in shipping gas through Bulgaria’s network and sources said Russian energy giant Gazprom was interested in using most of the capacity. Sofia is planning to seek firm commitments from companies by the end of 2018. The moves have alarmed some in Brussels. It has tentatively backed a plan to build a Balkan Gas Hub in Bulgaria’s Black Sea port of Varna to ensure any more Russian gas coming into the EU would compete with gas from at least two other sources, such as Azerbaijan or liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipped from Greece. But EU officials fear Sofia may opt to simply send the gas onto Europe to earn transit fees rather than allowing it to be traded at new a gas hub, cementing the small EU nation’s near 100 percent dependence on Gazprom. Europe’s energy chief warned that any new pipeline infrastructure in Bulgaria would come under “very very close” scrutiny to ensure it complies with EU rules. “I understand that this (transit pipeline) looks like something which is much easier and simpler,” European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic told Reuters. “The most important thing is to have a choice, to have options and to become the trader, not a mere transit,” he said. Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who visited Russia and Turkey recently, has said Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready to send Russian gas to Bulgaria if it could find a way of shipping it to the rest of Europe and wins Brussels’ nod. Bulgaria is still smarting from the 2014 cancellation of Russia’s plan to bring gas to its shores with its South Stream pipeline. The project, which had promised the Balkan country on the EU’s periphery money and clout, was dropped by Russia after it blamed opposition from Brussels. Borissov has regretted that the huge steel pipes intended for South Stream staked high at Bulgaria’s ports are now being used to build TurkStream instead. Borissov, whose vision is still to turn Bulgaria into bridge between east and west, has also said he is in talks with Brussels about having some Russian gas traded and some sent through a transit network. Two EU sources said they would have little power to stop Bulgaria going ahead with a new transit pipeline project, as long as it follows EU internal energy market rules. The EU sources worry such a pipeline for Russian gas would be more attractive to the bloc’s poorest member state, promising more money sooner given that any gas hub is still considered a long way off. Bulgaria has yet to fully implement EU energy rules and follow through with plans to open cross-border gas pipelines with neighbouring Greece and Serbia. After years of delays, it has now built a gas interconnector with Romania. “It’s like putting the cart before the horse. You can’t have a hub in place by decree,” said Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies. The tug-of-war over what route Gazprom uses to supply some 34 percent of the Europe’s gas needs is intensifying with its contract for gas transit through Ukraine due to expire in 2019. The planned Nord Stream pipeline to Germany and TurkStream are part of the Kremlin’s drive to reduce flows through Ukraine. With Moscow and Kiev at loggerheads, Sofia fears gas supplies via Ukraine could be cut and that it would lose about 100 million euros ($116 million) a year in transit fees. Russian gas now flows from Ukraine through Romania to Bulgaria. Some 3 billion cubic metres (bcm) is for Bulgaria’s use while 13 bcm is shipped on to Turkey. Although Bulgaria is carrying out a feasibility study for the Balkan Gas Hub - paid for in part by Brussels and due later this year - it is also getting ready to receive Russian gas coming to the region via Turkey. Besides the 48.9 million levs ($29 million) tender to build a new 11 km link to Turkey launched on Wednesday, Bulgaria also completed new gas infrastructure at the border this month. It has expanded its pipeline capacity to Turkey and allowed for reverse gas flows from its southern neighbour once the two lines of TurkStream with an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres are completed. The tender for the new link runs until July 26 but the contract will only become valid once a final decision has been made to link TurkStream to Bulgaria, Bulgartransgaz said. Gazprom will decide by year’s end whether to send gas on from Turkey to Europe via Greece and Italy or Bulgaria, a source close to the matter said. “If Bulgaria opts for transit, then this would be the last nail in the coffin of Ukrainian transit,” one EU source said.

2018-06-26,"(Repeats story to additional subscribers, no change to headline or text) By Rod Nickel ST. PAUL, Minnesota, June 26 (Reuters) - Commissioners on a Minnesota regulatory board questioned crude oil demand for Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline on Tuesday, ahead of an expected decision this week on whether work can proceed on a proposed expansion of the line. Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin, but it needs approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which must decide whether the project is needed, and the route. Bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude this year. Line 3, placed into service in 1968, operates at half its capacity due to integrity concerns. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Commissioners spent part of the morning discussing whether the project is necessary. Commissioner Dan Lipschultz said he felt “frustration” having to rely on forecasts provided by Enbridge based on rising oil production, rather than on refiners’ demand. Enbridge lawyer Eric Swanson noted that global demand is growing, and that Enbridge apportions demand on Line 3 - transporting less oil than shippers request. “We think it shows a compelling case that Line 3 plus the expansion will be fully utilized,” he said. Lipschultz asked Swanson whether it would be reasonable to approve Line 3 for lesser capacity of 500,000 bpd, to which Swanson said ‘no.’ Commissioner Matt Schuerger said data for state refineries suggest little idle capacity, although the state’s largest refiner, Flint Hills Resources, has said Line 3 is badly needed. “They’re getting oil clearly,” Schuerger said. “The oil is getting to market somehow,” replied Swanson, representing Enbridge. “The question is what is the most reliable, efficient means of getting it there.” Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and damage to tribal wild rice harvesting areas. Business and labor groups say the project, to cost $2.5 billion in Minnesota, would create jobs and tax revenue. Mysti Babineau, a member of Red Lake band, wore a baseball cap with a message, “Love water, not oil.” The potential environmental cost is too great and fossil fuels-based energy is on its way out, she said, comparing it to manufacturing VCRs. “It’s outdated technology,” she said. Line 3 supporters wore neon green T-shirts with the message, “We support safe energy transportation.” One of them, grandmother Cheryl Grover, crocheted a scarf as she listened. Line 3 would pass under her farm near Shevlin, Minnesota, following Enbridge’s preferred route. “Because public utilities pay so much (tax), we pay less,” she said.

2018-06-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - President Hassan Rouhani promised Iranians on Tuesday the government would be able to handle the economic pressure of new U.S. sanctions amid a second day of demonstrations in protest at financial hardship and a weakening rial. Parts of Tehran’s Grand Bazaar were on strike for the second day running, state media reported, after traders massed outside parliament on Monday to complain about a sharp fall in the value of the national currency. Video footage posted on social media showed protesters setting fire to garbage dumpsters in Tehran streets to block riot police from attacking them. Reuters was unable to verify the authenticity of the footage. Other videos showed riot police breaking windows of closed shops, and striking parked motorcycles with batons. The police has accused protesters in recent days of causing damage to public property. Metro stations near the bazaar were closed for hours as the result of protests, state media reported. Pictures also showed shopkeepers were on strike in other cities including Arak, Shiraz, Tabriz and Kermanshah.  On Monday, police patrolled the bazaar following clashes with protesters angered by the rial’s collapse, which is disrupting business by driving up the cost of imports. Defending his economic record, Rouhani said the government’s income had not been affected in recent months, and the fall in the rial was the result of “foreign media propaganda”. “Even in the worst case, I promise that the basic needs of Iranians will be provided. We have enough sugar, wheat, and cooking oil. We have enough foreign currency to inject into the market,” Rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state television. Washington is to start reimposing economic penalties on Tehran in coming months after U.S. President Donald Trump quit an agreement between major world powers and Iran in which sanctions were lifted in return for curbs on its nuclear programme. This may cut Iran’s hard currency earnings from oil exports, and the prospect is triggering a panicked flight of Iranians’ savings from the rial into dollars. A senior U.S. official said on Tuesday that countries buying oil from Iran should prepare to halt all imports of it starting in November or face punishment. The International Monetary Fund estimated in March that the government held $112 billion of foreign assets and reserves, and that Iran was running a current account surplus. These figures suggested Iran might withstand the sanctions without an external payments crisis. Iran’s judiciary chief warned on Tuesday that the “economic saboteurs”, who he said were behind the fall of rial, would face severe punishment, including execution or 20 years in jail. “The enemy is now trying to disrupt our economy through a psychological operation. In recent days some tried to shut down the Bazaar, but their plot was thwarted by the police,” Ayatollah Sadeq Larijani was quoted as saying by Fars news agency. Tehran’s prosecutor Abbas Jafari-Dolatabadi said some protesters near the bazaar were arrested on Monday and would not be released before going to trial. The Iranian government is implementing new plans to control rising prices, including banning imports of over 1,300 products, preparing its economy to resist threatened U.S. sanctions.  Rouhani, who is under pressure to change his economic team, said the fresh U.S. sanctions were part of a “psychological, economic and political war”, adding that Washington would pay a high price for its actions. “Withdrawal was the worst decision he (Trump) could make. It was appalling. It hurt America’s global reputation,” he said. In late December, demonstrations which began over economic hardship spread to more than 80 Iranian cities and towns. At least 25 people died in the ensuing unrest, the biggest expression of public discontent in almost a decade. Demonstrators initially vented their anger over high prices and alleged corruption, but the protests took on a rare political dimension, with a growing number of people calling on Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to step down.

2018-06-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump wants to help allies replicate the U.S. natural gas and oil production boom by exporting American know-how, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday, even as trade disputes intensified. Perry said the surge in U.S. fossil fuels production over the past several years, made possible by advanced hydraulic fracturing drilling technology, had helped the country to reduce its dependence on foreign oil and improved its economy.  “We are bearing witness to this astonishing energy miracle,” Perry said at the opening ceremony of the triennial World Gas Conference. “But this is not just about exporting our energy bounty, it is about exporting the technology, the know-how, that unleashed our bounty in the first place,” he said. He added that he believed replicating the U.S. production boom overseas could help the world’s poor to access affordable electricity, and that boosting the share of natural gas in the mix could help limit greenhouse gas emissions. The Trump administration has repeatedly said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to allies through supply agreements and technology sharing. But the task could become more complicated as it imposes steep tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports and deals with retaliatory measures against U.S. crops, motorcycles and other products including petroleum. Beijing this month proposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports, which are expected to dent sales to the U.S. shale industry’s largest customer and further pressure American firms that produce gas as a byproduct of oil drilling.  LNG imports have so far been spared, but the industry is concerned that the supercooled gas could be next if China’s talks with Washington sour. That would be particularly bad for the United States, which has become the world’s biggest natural gas producer, one of the top crude oil producers, and a growing exporter of both since last year.  The administration has said it hopes exporting energy and related technology will help create alternatives to geopolitical rival energy producers like Russia, while also forging bonds with big consumers like China. The leaders of two of the world’s largest energy companies said they were worried trade tensions could destabilize the global economy, hurting hurt overall demand for energy. “The risk of trade wars starts to weigh on people’s perception of economic growth in the future,” Chevron (CVX.N) Chief Executive Mike Wirth said at the conference. “These things run the risk of becoming a bit of drag on growth.” Darren Woods, Exxon Mobil’s (XOM.N) CEO, said his company is trying to keep a “level headed voice” around tariffs, but that protectionism can dent investment. “The world has been very well served with low tariffs and free trade,” Woods said. “With tariffs, you run the risk of making some projects less attractive.” The global natural gas industry is currently forecasting rapid growth driven by low-cost production from the U.S. fracking boom and rising demand from Asia. But to capitalize, the gas industry needs to invest billions of dollars in new LNG infrastructure.  The International Energy Agency expects global gas demand to grow an average of 1.6 percent per year over the next five years, with Chinese consumption leading the way, according to the latest forecast released Tuesday. Longer-term, the IEA said the global gas market also faces the challenge of cost competitiveness in emerging markets, and said the industry must tamp down on leaks of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Gas is widely viewed as one of the cleanest fossil fuels because it burns more efficiently than oil or coal, but gas can be lost in production and transport.   The conference has drawn executives from global energy giants like Exxon, BP Plc (BP.L), and Total, along with senior officials from the U.S. State Department’s energy bureau, and ministers from energy producers and consumers. It follows last week’s OPEC meetings in Vienna, where the partner countries agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.

2018-06-26,"(Adds quotes, color, background) By Ernest Scheyder WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The leaders of two of the world’s largest energy companies said on Tuesday they worry a trade conflict between the United States and other nations could destabilize the global economy. U.S. President Donald Trump has in recent months imposed tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports, steps that have resulted in retaliatory measures against U.S. crops, motorcycles and other products, including petroleum. That has sparked concern amongst Chevron Corp, Exxon Mobil Corp and other major oil and natural gas producers that Trump’s actions could imperil relations with some of their largest customers, including China and the European Union. The United States, the world’s largest natural gas producer, has begun exporting more of the fuel, part of Trump’s approach to energy diplomacy. But the tariffs could undermine that plan. “The risk of trade wars starts to weigh on people’s perception of economic growth in the future,” Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth said at the World Gas Conference in Washington. “These things run the risk of becoming a bit of drag on growth.” Chevron tries to buy steel for its pipelines and other equipment from U.S. manufactures but cannot always do so, Wirth said. Darren Woods, Exxon’s CEO, said his company is trying to keep a “level headed voice” around the tariffs. “The world has been very well served with low tariffs and free trade,” Woods said. “With tariffs, you run the risk of making some projects less attractive.” Both companies are major natural gas producers in the United States, with Chevron focused especially on the Marcellus shale in Pennsylvania and Exxon on the Eagle Ford shale in Texas. The two executives, who appeared jointly on a conference panel, argued that natural gas is the best way to help cut global greenhouse gas emissions and also increase the availability of power across the developing world. Natural gas had for several years enjoyed a designation as a “bridge fuel” away from hydrocarbons toward renewable energies. This view has come under assault recently by environmentalists , something both CEOs pushed back on. “Renewables are terrific, but you need the lights and the power and the air conditioning all the time,” said Wirth, who became Chevron’s CEO earlier this year. “You’ve got to have a mix.” Natural gas, Woods said, “as the fuel of the future is a part of the solution to climate change.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by David Gregorio)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oil-conference-majors/update-1-chevron-exxon-ceos-worry-global-trade-conflict-could-harm-economy-idUKL1N1TS0W2,26 Jun 2018,"The leaders of two of the

2018-06-26,"* Wall St rebounds slightly with help from GE, tech stocks * Oil rises as outages balance trade dispute, OPEC * European shares steady after China enters bear territory * Metals knocked back in latest trade storms * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - General Electric Co and U.S. technology shares rose on Tuesday, helping global stock markets regain ground a day after a mounting trade fight between the United States and other top world economies chased investors into safe-haven assets. GE jumped 7.6 percent, the biggest percentage gainer on Wall Street’s S&P 500 index, after the company said it would spin off its healthcare business and divest its stake in oil-services company Baker Hughes. Tech stocks rebounded from a sharp selloff on Monday, after U.S. government officials said plans were in the works to block firms with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. companies with “industrially significant technology.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18.5 points, or 0.08 percent, to 24,271.3, the S&P 500 gained 2.99 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,720.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 14.48 points, or 0.19 percent, to 7,546.48. Europe’s main stock exchanges also got a reprieve. A 0.3 percent rise on the FTSE in London and 0.03 percent gain in Paris were a welcome sight after Asia had extended a sell-off that has wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. Despite the modest gains, investors remained wary. “There is still generally a focus on trade and a bit of uncertainty over what we are going to hear from the Trump administration this week regarding potential investment restrictions,” said Brian Daingerfield, macro strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut. Escalating trade tensions between the United States and China, as well as Washington and Europe, led two benchmark Wall Street indexes on Monday to suffer their worst losses in more than two months and launched China into bear market territory, with its major stock indexes down 20 percent decline from January peaks. After seeing a surge in buying on Monday, U.S. Treasury yields held at lower levels on lingering fears that trade tensions could hurt economic growth, though safe-haven buying was capped on anticipation of more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. [ The tense atmosphere knocked down most industrial metal prices amid worries about the global economic fallout of the trade conflict between the U.S. and China, which could hamper growth and metals demand. Copper and aluminum were at or near their lowest since April while zinc plunged to its weakest since August last year. In currencies, dollar index rose 0.29 percent, with the euro down 0.32 percent to $1.1664. The Japanese yen weakened 0.12 percent versus the greenback at 109.92 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3244, down 0.23 percent on the day. The Turkish lira firmed against the dollar in volatile trade amid uncertainty over economic policy under a new government due to be formed following President Tayyip Erdogan’s victory in Sunday’s election. In oil, prices rose on production losses in Canada, Libya and from the Neutral Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, but they remained under pressure from greater supply from others in OPEC and the escalating trade disputes. U.S. crude rose 0.26 percent to $68.26 per barrel and Brent was last at $74.19, down 0.48 percent on the day.. Additional reporting by Marc Jones, Peter Hobson and

2018-06-26,"HAMBURG/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) plans to shut its main Wolfsburg factory for 1-2 days a week between August and the end of September to deal with problems caused by new engine emissions tests, the German carmaker told employees on Tuesday. Volkswagen (VW) is the second large carmaker after Daimler (DAIGn.DE) to acknowledge a potential dip in sales triggered by stricter anti-pollution test procedures. A new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure, (WLTP), based on real-driving data rather than theoretical scenarios, has resulted in higher carbon dioxide emissions readings for certain vehicles, delaying official road certification and sales. Due to the delays, VW is throttling back production of some models at various plants, following in the footsteps of Daimler which last week blamed WLTP and a trade spat for lowering its profit guidance. VW will also close its Zwickau factory on some days and components manufacturing will face resulting delays, the company said in a statement on its internal website. The group’s plant in Emden will be closed too on some days in the third and fourth quarter due to lacklustre demand for mid-sized cars, the memo said. VW builds its Passat model in Emden.

2018-06-26,"WASHINGTON, June 26 (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump wants to help allies and trade partners replicate the U.S. natural gas and oil production boom by exporting American know-how, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said on Tuesday, even as trade disputes intensified. “We are bearing witness to this astonishing energy miracle,” Perry said at the opening ceremony of the triennial World Gas Conference, referring to a surge in U.S. fossil fuels production over the past several years made possible by advanced hydraulic fracturing drilling technology. “But this is not just about exporting our energy bounty, it is about exporting the technology, the know-how, that unleashed our bounty in the first place,” he said. The Trump administration has said it is eager to expand fossil fuel supplies to allies through supply agreements and technology sharing even as it imposes steep tariffs on steel, aluminum and other imports and deals with retaliatory measures against U.S. crops, motorcycles and other products including petroleum. The United States has become the world’s biggest natural gas producer, one of the top crude oil producers, and a growing exporter of both since last year. The administration has said it hopes exporting energy and related technology will help create alternatives to geopolitical rival energy producers like Russia, while also forging bonds with big consumers like China. The global natural gas industry is currently forecasting rapid growth driven by low-cost production from the U.S. fracking boom and rising demand from Asia. The International Energy Agency expects global gas demand to grow an average of 1.6 percent per year over the next five years, with Chinese consumption leading the way, according to the latest forecast released Tuesday. But the trade dispute between the United States and China could make things complicated in the short-term. Beijing this month proposed 25 percent retaliatory tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports, which are expected to dent sales to the U.S. shale industry’s largest customer and further pressure American firms that produce gas as a byproduct of oil drilling. LNG imports have so far been spared, but the industry is concerned that the supercooled gas could be next if China’s talks with Washington sour. Longer-term, the IEA said the global gas market also faces the challenge of reducing its cost competitiveness in emerging markets, and of tamping down on leaks from the industry of methane, one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Gas is widely viewed as one of the cleanest fossil fuels because it burns more efficiently than oil or coal, but gas can be lost in production and transport. The conference has drawn executives from global energy giants like Exxon Mobil Corp, BP Plc, and Total, along with senior officials from the U.S. State Department’s energy bureau, and ministers from energy producers and consumers like Argentina and Indonesia. It follows last week’s OPEC meetings in Vienna, where the partner countries agreed on a modest increase in oil production from next month, following calls from major consumers to curb rising fuel costs.

2018-06-26,"* Sign heads of agreement to develop LNG bunker supply chain * Deal covers long-term time charter of LNG bunker vessel * Also includes LNG supply deal for Total to deliver LNG bunker By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, June 26 (Reuters) - Total and Singapore’s Pavilion Energy have signed a non-binding deal through their subsidiaries to develop a liquefied natural gas (LNG) bunker supply chain in the port of Singapore, the companies said in a joint statement on Tuesday. Total Marine Fuels Global Solutions, the French oil major’s affiliate in charge of worldwide ship fuelling, or bunkering, activities, and Pavilion Gas signed a heads of agreement which covers the shared long-term time charter of a new generation LNG bunker vessel to be commissioned by Pavilion Gas by 2020, they said. It also includes an LNG supply arrangement between the two companies for Total to deliver LNG bunker fuel to its customers, they added. The agreement follows a memorandum of understanding between both companies in April 2017 on LNG bunkering co-operation in Singapore. It is also a significant step in contributing to the development of Singapore as an LNG bunkering hub, they said. Singapore aims to position itself as an LNG trading hub for Asia to capitalise on an expected rise in LNG imports in the region driven by depleting gas production and growing electricity demand. Shipowners are looking at fuelling vessels with LNG as part of a number of options to comply with new rules by the International Maritime Organization that will go into effect in 2020. The new regulations slash the amount of sulphur allowed in the fuel that ships burn. “The development of infrastructure is one of the key drivers for the take-off of LNG as a marine fuel,” said Patrick Pouyanne, Total’s chairman and chief executive, in the statement. “For the past few months, Total has been very active in that direction.” Pavilion Gas and Shell Eastern Trading, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC, are the country’s approved LNG importers. Total and Pavilion Energy have an existing LNG supply deal for 700,000 tonnes per year to Asia, including Singapore, from 2018. Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Christian

A 0.6 percent rise by the FTSE in London and 0.2 to 0.4 percent gains in Frankfurt, Paris and U.S. markets were a welcome sight, after Asia had extended a sell-off that has now wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. China’s yuan had slumped to a near six-month low against the dollar, and 0.5 to 0.8 percent declines on its big share markets left them down 20 percent from their January peaks, a threshold that defines a bear market. As markets steadied, the dollar rose nearly half a percent against a basket of six other top world currencies as U.S. and other benchmark bond yields began to climb again, too. “The sell-off in risk assets has eased, but it is certainly not the last storm we are likely to see coming from that direction,” said Kit Juckes, Societe Generale’s global macro strategist. The tense atmosphere also kept metals on the defensive as amid worries about the global economic fallout of the U.S. administration’s “America First” agenda. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ramped up the rhetoric on Monday, tweeting that restrictions on investing in U.S. tech firms would apply “to all countries that are trying to steal our technology”. Wall Street was looking to recover from the previous session’s trauma. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both suffered their steepest losses in more than two months, while the Dow Jones closed below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016. The so-called FAANG stocks, which have led momentum in U.S. stocks, were hammered after reaching record intraday highs last week. Facebook dropped 2.7 percent, Amazon <AMZN.O fell 3.1 percent, Netflix slid 6.5 percent, and Alphabet lost 2.6 percent. Asia then followed, albeit on a smaller scale. Tech-heavy indexes such as South Korea’s KOSPI fell 0.45 percent and Taiwan’s weighted index fell 0.55 percent. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was down 1.8 percent, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc lost 1 percent and Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings shed 0.3 percent. “Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington’s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy,” wrote Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “It’s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections (in November).” Another sign of the dust gradually settling in Europe was the first rise in European car shares in eight days. Carmakers are another likely target of U.S President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. The dollar’s resurgence knocked the euro back to 1.1665 from its near two-week high of $1.1722. Against the yen , the dollar was back up at 109.67, having fallen to a two-week low of 109.365 yen. The yen often attracts safe-haven bids in times of political tension and market turmoil. Brent crude oil futures were up 0.5 percent at $75.14 on uncertainty over Libya’s capacity to deliver on exports commitments. Brent futures had fallen 1 percent overnight as receding investor risk appetite weighed on commodities. Oil prices were capped after OPEC and its allies on Friday agreed to increase global supplies, albeit modestly. Trade concerns kept copper on the London Metal Exchange near a 2 1/2-month low of $6,702.5 per tonne brushed on Monday. Spot gold shed 0.8 percent to $1,256 an ounce. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-06-26,"LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - BMW (BMWG.DE) said it is not considering moving production out of Britain because of Brexit, although the carmaker has cut its dependence on its Oxford car plant by quietly expanding a new Dutch assembly site for its Mini brand. By building up a second export base for its Mini brand outside of Britain, BMW can mitigate any damage caused by a possible hard exit from the European Union’s single market.  Asked whether the German carmaker was actively considering moving production out of Britain due to uncertainty over future trade relationships, BMW executive Ian Robertson said: “No we’re not.”  “We are committed to our operations in the UK, our workforce here,” the German carmaker’s special representative for Britain said at a conference on Tuesday. Comments published in the Financial Times from another BMW executive on Monday suggested that BMW would close its British factories which make Mini and Rolls-Royce cars if Brexit leads to serious supply chain disruption. Robertson said those comments were taken out of context and referred to supply chain disruption resulting in delays to production at factories. Asked about the impact of Brexit uncertainty on any new production in Britain, Robertson said there were no investment choices to be made on that front.  “In our cycle we are in an enviable place because we took a lot of decisions three and a half years ago and as a result we don’t need to make any decisions right now,” he said on the sidelines of a conference in London. Britain’s main car lobby group said on Tuesday that a lack of clarity on Brexit had halved new investment in the industry and urged Prime Minister Theresa May to keep the world’s fifth largest economy in the EU’s customs union. BMW has spent the past four years quietly stepping up production capacity at a new European export hub for the Mini with Dutch contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar, reducing its dependence on a plant in Oxford, central England. At VDL Nedcar staffing levels have jumped to about 7,200 today, from around 4,500 last year and 1,450 in 2014, VDL said. VDL declined to give a current figure for vehicle production, but said capacity has risen beyond 170,000 vehicles last year, from 89,000 vehicles in 2016. “The numbers at VDL Nedcar have nothing to do with the current Brexit discussions,” BMW said.  By contrast staffing levels at BMW’s British plant have remained relatively stable during the same period, with just over 4,500 people working on building Minis in Oxford.  The plant in Oxford made about 60 percent of the 378,486 Mini’s produced last year.      BMW said VDL’s staffing levels have jumped after it added the assembly of BMW’s popular X1 model to the Dutch production line in August last year, in addition to building the Mini hatch, Mini plug-in hybrid and Mini convertible at the plant in the southern Dutch town of Born.

2018-06-26,"LIBREVILLE, June 26 (Reuters) - Gabon’s economic growth is expected to rise to 2 percent in 2018 from 0.5 percent a year ago thanks to robust growth in agriculture, mining and logging, which enabled it avoid a recession, the International Monetary Fund said. The oil-dependent central Africa nation was forced to turn to the IMF for a bailout after oil prices slumped from 2014 to 2016. In return, it promised to carry out tough reforms, including deep spending cuts. Now economic activity is stabilising, the IMF said a statement late on Monday. “Economic growth appears set to recover in 2018 and reach 2 percent, which is a more modest bounce back than previously expected,” Alex Segura-Ubiergo, who led an IMF review mission to Gabon from June 13 to 25, said in the statement. The IMF board approved about $642 million facility in June last year to help Gabon’s recovery programme. The mission said it was still concerned over Gabon’s weak program performance, substantial fiscal slippages, and disappointing progress on structural reforms. “There was also insufficient progress to contain current spending — wages and salaries, transfers, subsidies and special accounts — and weak non-oil revenue collections,” IMF said. It added that the government’s efforts to clear domestic and external arrears was also slower than expected, and many important structural reforms had been delayed or not implemented as planned. Gabon last week announced further austerity measures that included a 15 percent reduction of spending by government institutions and administration and a 10 percent reduction the salary of cabinet members. It also announced staff reductions at ministries and other government agencies, froze hiring at all levels, forced those on long-term sick leave to retire and planned to cancel the contracts of temporary hires who are over 60. The belt-tightening could spark protests in Africa’s fourth- largest oil producer, which has seen output decline to around 220,000 barrels per day as its fields mature. A leader of Gabon’s largest public administration trade union, Dynamique Unitaire, on Tuesday rejected the austerity measures announced by the government and called for nationwide civil disobedience campaign.

2018-06-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Brexit has halved new investment in the British car industry and Prime Minister Theresa May should urgently change tack to keep the world’s fifth largest economy in the EU’s customs union, the country’s main car lobby group said. Public announcements of fresh investments into new plant, machinery, models and model development fell to 347.3 million pounds ($461.1 million) between January and June 21, down from 647.4 million pounds in the first half of 2017. “There is growing frustration in global boardrooms at the slow pace of (Brexit) negotiations,” said Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). “Government must rethink its position on the customs union,” Hawes said, referring to May’s position that Britain will leave the customs union which groups EU members in a duty-free area where there is a common import tariff for non-EU goods. With only nine months left until Britain is due to leave the EU, there is little clarity about how trade will flow as May, who is grappling with a rebellion in her party, is still trying to strike a deal with the bloc. In a sign of just how worried big business is getting, Siemens (SIEGn.DE), Airbus (AIR.PA) and BMW (BMWG.DE) have publicly cautioned Britain in the past week that their businesses will be hurt by a disorderly Brexit. When asked about business worries by ambassadors, British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was reported by The Daily Telegraph newspaper to have quipped: “F*** business”. A spokesman disputed that he had used bad language. Under the current timetable, both London and Brussels hope to get a final Brexit deal in October to give enough time to ratify it by Brexit day in March 2019, though few diplomats expect the deal to be struck until months later. The nature of the future relationship with the world’s biggest trading bloc remains unclear and there is deep concern in boardrooms about the prospect of Britain crashing out of the bloc without a deal, or with a deal that would silt up the arteries of trade. That could be highly damaging for an industry which is dependent on the speedy movement of huge numbers of parts across borders. The average car, for example, has about 30,000 parts.  BMW’s Mini plant in Oxford brings in five million components a day and the company is increasingly frustrated about the lack of clarity around how it will be able to do that in future. The car manufacturer’s UK boss, Ian Robertson, told Reuters that if Britain tumbled out of the EU without a deal on March 29 there was no longer enough time to put in place the systems to ensure components could keep moving easily across borders. “What we are asking for is negotiations to take place, decisions to be made, clarity to be achieved and then we can plan our business model accordingly,” Robertson said on the sidelines of the SMMT conference.  BMW has quietly ramped up production capacity at a new export hub for the Mini on continental Europe with Dutch contract manufacturer VDL Nedcar, thereby cutting its dependency on Oxford. It quadrupled staffing in Born, the Netherlands where the Mini is also built, and added the assembly of BMW’s X1 model to the Dutch production line in August last year. More people now work at VDL Nedcar than BMW employs at its plant in Oxford. Even a small increase in paperwork or customs checks after Brexit, for example, could lead to spiraling costs for big manufacturers which depend on vast supply chains that stretch across Europe and the globe. At stake is the future of one of Britain’s few manufacturing success stories since the 1980s: a car industry employing over 800,000 people and generating turnover of $110 billion. Much of the industry is owned by foreign companies. The world’s biggest carmakers including Toyota (7203.T), BMW and Ford (F.N) have urged Britain to ensure that they can import and export without hindrance after Brexit. One British manufacturer is McLaren Automotive, which produces about 5,000 high-end cars a year. Its chief executive Mike Flewitt said the industry needed to know the shape of the new trading relationship in good time.  “The thing we plea for most is time, is notice,” Flewitt said. “If we don’t know what’s coming then we just run into a brick wall.” SHORT-TERM PAIN  Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but that long-term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. Around 52 percent of Britain’s total $1.1 trillion trade in goods last year was with the EU so May wants to sign a free trade agreement and negotiate an as yet relatively undefined customs arrangement to ensure as frictionless trade as possible. SMMT chief Hawes said the British government’s current position - leaving the EU single market and the customs union - would hurt the industry. “The current position, with conflicting messages and red lines goes directly against the interests of the UK automotive sector which has thrived on single market and customs union membership,” he said.

2018-06-26,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's seaborne coal imports vs. price: reut.rs/2trMivA By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 26 (Reuters) - China’s seaborne coal imports are on track to have surged by around 14 percent in the first half of the year, with Indonesia emerging as the big winner among exporters. Imports are likely to be around 126.6 million tonnes in the first six months of this year, up from 111.3 million tonnes for the same period in 2017, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. It also appears that June may be the strongest month so far this year, with 22.1 million tonnes discharged, or in the process of discharging, as of Tuesday. The final figure may be slightly higher, at around 25.9 million tonnes: The data is filtered only to show ships that have already discharged, are discharging or awaiting unloading, and more cargoes may be handled in the final days of June. The strongest month so far this year for China’s coal imports from the seaborne market was March’s 23.2 million tonnes, according to the data. A look at the breakdown of where China is sourcing its coal reveals a surprise packet - Indonesia. China has imported about 15.3 million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first half of 2018 compared with last year. On a net basis, it’s all from the Southeast Asian country. Imports from Indonesia were around 61.8 million tonnes in the first half, up from 46.3 million for the same period in 2017. The strength of shipments from Indonesia may raise some eyebrows among those who believe China is trying to lower air pollution from burning coal, partly by using less and partly by switching to higher-quality coal. Indonesia’s exports are predominantly lower-grade coal, typically with an energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg) or less. However, Indonesia’s coal is also typically low in sulphur. That makes it useful for Chinese coastal power plants to blend with higher-sulphur domestic supplies or imports. This allows them to lower emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, albeit at a small penalty to the efficiency of the boiler. It’s also worth noting that Indonesian coal trades at a substantial discount to higher-quality thermal coal from main regional rival Australia. Indonesian 4,200 kcal/kg coal, as assessed by Argus Media, was at $48.71 a tonne in the week ended June 22. The weekly index for 6,000 kcal/kg coal at Australia’s Newcastle Port was $116.27. The discount of the Indonesian grade to Newcastle has widened substantially over the past year, going from 50 percent at the end of June 2017 to the current 58 percent. While this is encouraging additional cargoes from Indonesia, it also means that Australian exporters are enjoying higher prices, even if their volumes are more or less the same. China imported 42.84 million tonnes from Australia in the first six months of the year, fractionally higher than the 42.62 million tonnes in the same period in 2017, according to the vessel-tracking data. While Indonesia and Australia dominate supply to China, it’s worth noting that Russia also managed to lift deliveries, with imports rising 27 percent to 10.3 million tonnes in the first half. China’s imports from the United States, which are predominantly coking coal used in steel-making, dropped in the first half to 2.09 million tonnes, a decline of 38 percent. This occurred well before any potential impact of proposed Chinese tariffs on coal from the United States, which may be imposed as part of the escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. The decline so far this year in imports from the United States is more likely related to Australian coking coal being more competitive - and available, given the absence this year of major weather-related outages. Overall, China’s increased appetite for imported coal appears to be contributing to higher prices, with the Newcastle index up 12 percent so far, hitting a six-year high of $118.09 a tonne in the week ended June 17.

2018-06-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - A ban on palm oil due to fears it may cause deforestation could displace rather than halt global biodiversity losses as it would likely increase output of other oil crops to meet rising vegetable oil demand, an international survey showed on Tuesday. Palm oil has been at the heart of heated debate in recent years, notably in the European Union where the Parliament has suggested banning its use in transport fuels altogether, raising outcry in top world producers Indonesia and Malaysia.  An EU deal was adopted earlier this month to phase out of its use by 2030. The report released by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) acknowledged palm oil was eating into tropical forests and stressed that because palm trees were grown in the species-rich tropics, its production could have catastrophic effects on global biodiversity. The Switzerland-based IUCN, a group of governments, conservation organisations and scientists, said palm oil production was threatening over 190 species, with orangutans, gibbons and tigers among those suffering severe harm. Areas into which palm oil could potentially expand are home to more than half of the world’s threatened mammals, and almost two-thirds of all threatened birds, the report found.  But if other oil crops - which require up to nine times as much land to produce than palm oil - were to replace palm oil the damage could shift to ecosystems such as the South American tropical forests and savannahs, IUCN said. “Palm oil is decimating South East Asia’s rich diversity of species as it eats into swathes of tropical forest,” report lead author and Chair of IUCN’s Oil Palm Task Force Erik Meijaard said in a statement.  “But if it is replaced by much larger areas of rapeseed, soy or sunflower fields, different natural ecosystems and species may suffer.” The report was released on the sidelines of the European conference of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) in Paris. Certified palm oil had so far proven to be only marginally better in preventing deforestation than its non-certified equivalent, the report said. It noted, however, that the approach was relatively new and held potential for improvement. The organization also called on governments to protect forests in all vegetable oil producing countries and limit demand for non-food uses of palm oil such as biofuels. The IUCN report comes in response to a 2016 resolution adopted by its government and non-governmental members, and aims to provide a constructive path to improving sustainability in the palm oil industry, it said.  It only looks at palm oil’s impacts on biodiversity, not its social or economic impacts, which should be addressed next year.

2018-06-26,"* Breakdown of talks occurs for first time in decades -source * Japan utilities try to cut cost amid electricity market shakeup * Talks fail as coal prices soar to the highest since 2012 (Adds quotes and background) By Yuka Obayashi and Aaron Sheldrick TOKYO, June 26 (Reuters) - Japan’s Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc and Glencore Plc have abandoned talks on annual thermal coal supplies after failing to reach an agreement, the first time in decades the talks have broken down. Tohoku Electric said on Tuesday that the negotiations with Glencore, the world’s biggest exporter of seaborne thermal coal, ended without an agreement after protracted negotiations on supplies from April 2018 to March 2019. “We could not reach an agreement with Glencore on the April to March annual contract,” a spokesman for the Japanese utility company said, citing their inability to agree on terms such as price and volume. “We will negotiate with Glencore for other contracts of coal as needed,” he said, adding that Tohoku has settled some annual contracts with other Australian suppliers. A Glencore spokesman in Australia said no comment when contacted by Reuters. But a senior Glencore official, who declined to be identified, said the talks failed because of price disagreements so they decided to skip this round and Tohoku has already covered its needs. Multiple industry sources said the producer and the utility were not able to reach an agreement on pricing as Tohoku, like its peers, is seeking to cut costs amid increased competition in Japan’s electricity market. Benchmark thermal coal prices also surged to their highest since 2012 while the negotiations were taking place, making the talks more complex, the sources said. The price for thermal coal agreed to by Tohoku and Glencore is used as a benchmark for other Japanese utilities and manufacturers and the breakdown in talks surprised other coal buyers. “This is the first time in my memory that the talks over an annual coal contract between a Japanese major utility and a key Australian supplier were broken off,” said a coal buyer with more than three decades of experience. “The absence of the reference price means that other buyers will need to negotiate with their suppliers without any guidance,” a coal trader based in Tokyo said. The April to March long-term contracts between Australian suppliers and Japanese utilities have traditionally accounted for a major part of Japan’s annual thermal coal imports of about 115 million tonnes. But the volume under the long-term contracts has been declining in recent years as utilities tried to diversify their sources, according to multiple industry sources. Japanese utilities usually pay a premium to secure high-quality supplies from Australia on long-term contracts as they prefer coal with a higher energy content to generate electricity more efficiently and with less environmental harm.

2018-06-26,"NEW YORK, June 26 (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency has consistently ignored recommendations from the Department of Energy to reject or limit waivers to oil refiners seeking exemptions from nation’s biofuels law, according to five sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard requires the firms to cover costs of blending corn-based ethanol into gasoline. But the EPA, after consulting with the energy department, can exempt small refineries in cases where compliance presents a “disproportionate economic hardship.” The waivers can save refiners tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Under EPA chief Scott Pruitt, an appointee of President Donald Trump, the agency has issued more than two dozen such exemptions in recent months - about triple the usual number granted under past administrations. During that time, EPA has consistently granted full waivers in cases where the energy department recommended only partial exemptions, and, at least once, granted a full approval when the energy department advised an outright rejection, according to two sources familiar with the decisions. That approach marks a sharp break from Obama administration’s EPA, which had often either adopted energy department recommendations or, when it didn’t, ruled against exempting oil refiners, the sources said. The shift between the Democratic and Republican administrations shows how political ideologies and constituencies can steer bureaucratic interpretation of a law that never changed - with major impacts on industry. The waivers save refineries money by freeing them from their obligation to blend ethanol into their gasoline or to purchase compliance credits from those who do. The broad use of waivers lately has angered the powerful corn lobby, which argues they threaten corn demand. The Renewable Fuels Association, which represents U.S. ethanol makers, last month estimated that the waivers have reduced the amount of ethanol refiners are required to blend by 1.6 billion gallons. The law currently requires refiners to blend 15 billion gallons of the biofuel per year. The surge in waivers has sent the price of biofuels compliance credits to five-year lows, saving refiners such as Valero Energy Corp and PBF Energy hundreds of millions of dollars. Until now, it was not known if the EPA gave the waivers on the basis of the energy department recommendations or despite them. The EPA has denied public records requests seeking information on the waivers, which it considers proprietary company information. Biofuel groups have asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Washington to review legality of the waivers - arguing the EPA is “methodically destroying the demand for renewable fuels” - and to force the EPA to disclose them. EPA spokeswoman Molly Block declined to comment on the pending litigation or on whether the agency has approved waivers that the energy department recommended rejecting. “From the beginning of this administration, we have worked closely with our partners at DOE on this issue,” she said in a written statement. DOE spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes did not respond to requests for comment. During a recent Midwest tour, Pruitt told Nebraska farmers that the EPA works “in alliance with the Department of Energy” to grant the waivers, saying there was just one example of disagreement. EPA spokespeople have repeatedly said the agency’s criteria for granting waivers have not changed. The sources with knowledge of the two agencies’ interactions disputed the assertion that the EPA and DOE are acting as partners in these decisions. They declined to provide a specific number of cases in which the EPA has gone against energy department recommendations or to name most of the companies involved, but did provide two examples of what they said has become regular practice. In one case, the EPA provided a full waiver to a refiner after the energy department had recommended rejecting the exemption, two sources told Reuters. In another, the EPA granted full waivers to refineries owned by Andeavor - a large U.S. refining company which reported $1.4 billion in net income last year - after the energy department had recommended a 50-percent exemption, according to two other sources familiar with the company’s approval. The waivers for Andeavor were first reported by Reuters in April. The company said in a May earnings statement that the waivers, provided to its smallest refineries, saved it about $100 million in compliance costs. Scott LaBelle, an Andeavor spokesman, declined to comment beyond the company’s previous statements. Obama’s administration was accused of being too stingy with the waivers. Last year, an appellate judge said Obama’s EPA had used too narrow a definition of “financial hardship” when it denied Sinclair Oil waivers for its Wyoming refineries for 2014 and 2015. But appellate judges in two other similar cases upheld the EPA’s denials and its methods. Neither the rulings nor the change in presidential administrations changed the way energy department analysts scored applications, according to the sources. Energy department analysts score applications on a two-part test that considers whether compliance would lead to disproportionate impact or threaten a refinery’s viability. Qualifying under either leads to a partial exemption; qualifying under both leads to a full exemption. The EPA’s relaxed standard for the waivers is the latest illustration of the agency’s leadership seeking to deliver relief to refiners from the law, which was signed under Republican President George W. Bush to help farmers, reduce petroleum imports and improve air quality. Pruitt has repeatedly recommended overhauling the law to reduce strain on refiners and advocated for changes during months of failed negotiations between oil and corn representatives mediated by President Donald Trump. Republican Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa, the top ethanol-producing state, said Pruitt’s handling of the waivers appeared to be based on a political goal of helping the oil industry - a charge the EPA has denied. “This is definitely a workaround that they have figured out. That’s why we are demanding transparency,” Ernst said in an interview, referring to requests her and other lawmakers for the EPA to disclose information on the waivers. The current administration has attempted to lower compliance costs for some refiners since billionaire investor and refinery-owner Carl Icahn first raised concerns to Trump during his campaign, and then again after Trump named Icahn as a “special advisor” on industry regulation after his election. Icahn resigned from his advisory post in August under pressure from lawmakers who said his dual role as investor and advisor posed ethical concerns. Icahn’s CVR Energy was among the refining companies that received a waiver from EPA, Reuters reported earlier this year.

2018-06-26,"* Le Maire’s position contradicts that of Hulot * France to issue draft energy proposals in July By Geert De Clercq and Benjamin Mallet PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Nuclear energy will remain a key part of France’s electricity mix, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at a nuclear conference, contradicting Environment Minister Nicolas Hulot, who last week said nuclear was leading the country astray. Le Maire made no comments about ongoing public debates on the share of nuclear in French electricity production - currently at 75 percent and which the government wants cut to 50 percent by 2035 - but he told an audience of industry executives that nuclear was here to stay. “Nuclear energy remain essential to guarantee France’s competitiveness, security and energy independence over the long term. We can be proud of our nuclear industry,” Le Maire said at the World Nuclear Exhibition in Paris. In July, the French government will issue a first draft of its long-term energy programme (PPE) for the 2019-2023 and 2024-2028 periods, with a final version due by the year-end. The long-awaited text will outline how France will cut the share of nuclear to 50 percent and increase the contribution from renewable energy. “We will diversify the French energy mix by boosting renewable energy, but we will do this without weakening the nuclear sector,” Le Maire said, adding it was pointless to oppose renewables and nuclear. On Thursday, Hulot - number three in the French government and one of France’s most popular personalities - said the cost of nuclear energy keeps going up while the cost of renewable energy is falling quickly. Hulot has repeatedly said that state-controlled utility EDF needs to close several of its nuclear reactors in coming years in order to reduce the share of nuclear in the mix, but EDF has said it has no plans to close any nuclear plants before 2029, other than the ageing Fessenheim plant. “One of the reasons that EDF is in difficulties is because the nuclear industry, sorry to say it, is leading us astray,” Hulot had said.

A 0.3 percent rise from the FTSE in London and 0.4 percent gains from Frankfurt and Paris was a welcome sight after another bumpy Asian session had extended a sell-off that has now wiped $1.5 trillion off world stocks. China’s yuan had slumped to a near six-month low against the dollar, while 0.5-0.8 percent fall on big share markets left them down 20 percent from their January peaks, a threshold that defines a ‘bear’ market. The dollar hovered near a 12-day low against a six-strong group of other top world currencies having drifted down versus the euro, yen and pound despite a modest uptick in U.S. bond yields. “The sell off in risk assets has eased, but it is certainly not the last storm we are likely to see coming from that direction,” said Societe Generale’s global macro strategist Kit Juckes. The tense atmosphere also kept metals on the defensive as financial markets worried about the wider global economic fallout of the U.S. administration’s “America First’ agenda. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin had ramped up the rhetoric again on Monday saying on Twitter that restrictions on investing in U.S. tech firms would apply “to all countries that are trying to steal our technology.” Wall Street had tumbled, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their steepest losses in more than two months, and the Dow Jones closing below its 200-day moving average for the first time since June 2016. The so-called FAANG stocks, which have led momentum in U.S. stocks, were hammered too after having hit record intraday highs last week. Facebook dropped 2.7 percent, Amazon <AMZN.O fell 3.1 percent, Netflix slid 6.5 percent, and Alphabet lost 2.6 percent. Asia then followed albeit in smaller scale. Tech-heavy indexes such as South Korea’s KOSPI and Taiwan’s weighted index fell 0.45 percent and 0.55 percent, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was down 1.8 percent, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc lost 1 percent and Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings shed 0.3 percent. “Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington’s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy,” wrote Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. “It’s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections (in November).” Another sign of the dust gradually settling in Europe was the first rise in European car shares in eight days. Carmakers are another likely target of U.S President Donald Trump’s tariff plans. The euro dipped back having reached a near two-week high of $1.1722 while the dollar was beginning to find some traction again against the yen. It was last at 109.67, having fallen to a two-week low of 109.365 yen. The yen often attracts safe-haven bids in times of political tension  and market turmoil. Brent crude oil futures were up 0.15 percent at $74.83 on uncertainty over Libya’s capacity to deliver on exports commitments. Brent futures had fallen 1 percent overnight as receding investor risk appetite weighed on commodities. Oil prices were capped after OPEC and its allies on Friday agreed to increase global supplies, albeit modestly. Trade concerns kept copper on the London Metal Exchange near a 2-1/2-month low of $6,702.5 per tonne brushed on Monday. Spot gold shed 0.1 percent to $1,263.62 an ounce. Reporting by Marc Jones

2018-06-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Iran’s oil minister said that OPEC’s oil output agreement did not specify a production increase and that a figure of 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) was an interpretation by some members of the group.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other top crude producers, meeting in Vienna, agreed on Friday to raise output from July, but the agreement failed to announce a clear target for the output increase, leaving traders guessing how much more OPEC will actually pump. “Despite what some (members) say about OPEC’s production rise of around 800,000 barrels (per day), there is no figure in the statement,” Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying by Iran’s oil ministry news agency SHANA. “Iran’s suggestion was to first balance oil in the market, secure members’ 100 percent compliance to the agreement, and then decide on a production increase in next meeting if needed,” Zanganeh said. He said that Iran’s suggestion was approved in OPEC’s last summit, and that “if a country has a different interpretation of this agreement, Iran will officially raise it to the OPEC.”  Zanganeh said some countries want to send “positive signals to the market or to the United States”, but that is not related to OPEC’s decision. The United States, China and India had urged oil producers to release more supply to prevent an oil deficit that could undermine global economic growth. Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, had demanded OPEC reject calls from U.S. President Donald Trump for an increase in oil supply, arguing that he had contributed to a recent rise in prices by imposing sanctions on Iran and fellow member Venezuela. Market watchers expect Iran’s oil output to drop by a third by the end of 2018. That means the country has little to gain from a deal to raise OPEC output, unlike arch-rival Saudi Arabia.

2018-06-26,"SOFIA, June 26 (Reuters) - Bulgaria’s state gas network operator Bulgartransgaz has opened a 48.9 million levs  ($29.22 million) tender to build a gas link to Turkey, as Sofia rushes to prepare to transport Russian gas from the TurkStream pipeline to Europe. Offers for the new 11-kilometre pipeline that will provide a link from the Turkish border to Bulgaria’s transit pipeline network will be accepted until July 26, a public procurement order on Bulgartransgaz’s website showed on Tuesday. However, the contract will only become valid after a final investment decision for the construction of the onshore portion of the TurkStream pipeline in Turkey, and final written confirmation that it will be linked with Bulgaria’s gas network, the company said. Turkstream is part of the Kremlin’s plans to bypass Ukraine, currently the main transit route for Russian gas to Europe, and strengthen its position in the European gas market. It consists of two lines with an annual capacity of 15.75 billion cubic metres (bcm) each that will run under the Black Sea to Turkey. The first line, already completed, will be used for local consumption. The second line is planned to run through Turkey to southeastern and central Europe and Bulgaria has said it will be the entry point for it. Russia is yet to decide whether that pipeline will ship gas to Europe via Bulgaria or Greece. The new gas link will expand the capacity of the current transit pipeline to Turkey and will also be important if Russia’s gas giant Gazprom, on whose gas supplies the Balkan country is fully dependent, decides to switch the entry point for its gas deliveries to Bulgaria, it said. At present Gazprom ships about 3 bcm of gas a year for Bulgaria’s domestic needs through Ukraine and Romania. The Balkan country has also built a 20-km looping at its transit pipeline to Turkey, expanding its capacity to 15.7 bcm a year from 14 bcm and making its flows reversible.

2018-06-26,"(Adds details on drilling outlook, background) June 26 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas explorer Kosmos Energy Ltd  said on Tuesday it was abandoning one of its wells offshore Suriname after it failed to find oil. Kosmos said its drilling program would remain unchanged given the independent nature of the prospects and that it was still in the early stages of exploring the basin. The company said its Anapai-1A exploration well, located in Block 45 offshore Suriname, encountered high quality reservoirs in the targeted zones, but did not find hydrocarbons. Kosmos owns a 50 percent stake and is the exploration operator of Block 45, with Chevron Corp holding the remaining interest. The design for the well had to be reconfigured to address some issues, the company said in May, adding that it had spent about $20 million up until then on drilling it.

2018-06-26,"LONDON, June 26 (Reuters) - China will become the world’s top importer of natural gas next year, boosted by liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases, as its superpower economy grows and weans itself off coal-generated energy, the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. In its Gas 2018 annual report, the IEA said Chinese demand for natural gas will rise by almost 60 percent between 2017 and 2023 to 376 billion cubic metres (bcm), including a rise in its LNG imports to 93 bcm by 2023 from 51 bcm in 2017. Imports of LNG, natural gas super-chilled to liquid form so it can be transported around the world on vessels, will rise to 505 bcm by 2023 from 391 bcm last year, a rise of 114 bcm, including China’s 42 bcm growth. Global LNG exports meanwhile will surge 30 percent by 2023 with the United States becoming the second largest supplier in the world, compared to its negligible exports last year, thanks to the shale revolution that has transformed its energy markets. The report from the Paris-based agency highlights the might the two powerhouses have over global energy markets just as U.S. President Donald Trump squares off with Beijing over trade. China threatened tariffs on U.S. oil and gas in retaliation to taxes imposed by Washington on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods, although U.S. LNG was not included in that threat. China’s rise to the top spot next year as an importer of both piped gas and LNG will knock Japan into second place but they together with South Korea continue to dominate the markets. China, Japan and South Korea imported 55 percent of the 391 bcm of LNG sold last year and will buy 48 percent of the 505 bcm of LNG sold in 2023. When all of Asia is taken into account, LNG sales there will rise to 75 percent of all LNG sold globally from 72 percent last year. The demand for LNG in the top three Asian buyers has been driven by policy as they move to the cleaner-burning energy source from coal-fired power plants. In Japan, the Fukushima nuclear disaster accelerated demand after nuclear plants went off line. In other Asian countries such as Indonesia, composed of hundreds of islands, vessel-borne gas is a convenient, cleaner and cheaper way of receiving energy than constructing pipelines for gas or using petroleum products such as diesel. On the production side, global natural gas output will rise 10 percent by 2023 to 4.12 trillion cubic metres (tcm) with the United States contributing by far the largest amount to growth of 160 bcm extra gas in that period. Much of that excess gas will be liquefied into LNG to be exported, making the United States the second largest seller of LNG by 2023 in the world with 101 bcm, pushing Australia into third place with 98 bcm and biting at the heels of Qatar as the top exporter at 105 bcm. LNG from the three countries will account for 60 percent of global sales of 505 bcm.

2018-06-26,"(Adds details, analyst comment) COPENHAGEN, June 26 (Reuters) - Denmark’s Orsted , the world’s largest offshore wind developer, is looking to sell its Danish power distribution and residential customer businesses to focus on developing its international renewable energy operations. The company, which sold its oil and gas business to Ineos last year, has appointed Danske Bank as an adviser and expects to make a decision on a potential divestment before the end of June next year, it said in a statement. The businesses are well-run but do not support the strategy of long-term international growth within renewable energy, and so the board has decided to begin a process to assess market interest in them, Orsted said. Most likely buyers are other Danish power distributors, and the price could be 8 to 13 billion Danish crowns ($1.3-2.0 billion), given an operating profit of 1.3 billion crowns last year, Sydbank analyst Morten Imsgard said. Orsted also said it would set up a new business unit, Customer Solutions, headed by Executive Vice President Morten Buchgreitz. The activities considered for divestment will be organised in a separate business unit, which will also be headed by Buchgreitz, it said. The cash flow from a potential divestment will be included in the company’s overall capital planning where the priorities are to maintain its credit rating and dividend policy and complete “value-creating investments in renewables”.

2018-06-26,"TAICANG, China (Reuters) - In a smoke-filled plant about 50 miles northwest of Shanghai, masked workers feed sacks of plastic scrap into shuddering old machines that transform them into pellets used to make a range of manufactured goods. But while the factory, operated by Taicang Jinhui Recycling Co, remains a hive of activity, the company has been moving much of its capacity to Malaysia following Chinese restrictions on recycled plastic imports that came into effect this year.  The curbs on imported trash have deprived recyclers of about half of what they need to produce the plastic pellets they sell to manufacturers of products ranging from office furniture to sheathes for fiber-optic cables. And with domestic supply hard to come by, many have had little choice but to move abroad to stay alive. “Here in our industrial park we are the only company still producing - another 22 enterprises have stopped operations and just do warehousing or whatever, and all their staff have disappeared,” said Jinhui’s chairman, Thomas He. Jinhui has laid off 250 workers from its workforce of around 400 people since the restrictions came into force, though it has hired another 600 in Malaysia. The Malaysia plant was set up almost entirely with Chinese equipment and technology.  The company is one of more than 1,000 recycling enterprises - a third of China’s total - to relocate its expertise, equipment and waste supply chains to Southeast Asia, according to the China Scrap Plastic Association (CSPA), with total investment so far estimated at around 10 billion yuan  ($1.54 billion). The association did not provide a breakdown. China’s decision last July to stop importing 24 kinds of foreign waste, including plastic, was part of an effort to upgrade its economy and tackle the growing volumes of domestic trash clogging its rivers or sitting untreated in sprawling landfills that encircle major cities. Now, countries in Southeast Asia, already struggling with their own domestic waste problems, will have to grapple with the same issues as trash imports increase.   The Chinese ban disrupted a global supply chain that saw more than 7 million tonnes of scrap plastic, mainly from Europe and the United States, delivered into Chinese ports every year. As that supply dries up for Chinese recyclers, they have created 4 million tonnes of new capacity outside China in operations that can receive imports from countries like the United States and the United Kingdom, said Wang Wang, CSPA’s chairman. But it is not yet enough to offset a supply shortfall of about 6-8 million tonnes of recycled plastic.  “As far as our companies are concerned, they just don’t have enough raw materials,” Wang said. Efforts to have recyclers take on more domestic waste have been progressing slowly; only 5 percent of domestic recycling firms have so far been able to switch to local sources of scrap, according to CSPA figures.  “Handling imports and handling domestic material are two very different channels and it will take time to switch,” said Jinhui’s He. Recyclers said the government’s abrupt ban gave the sector no time to adjust, and crucially, China has not devised policies required to scale up and standardize treatment of domestic waste, which is usually handled by small backstreet operators. With foreign material still the best option, companies hoped moving to countries like Malaysia and Thailand would enable them to deliver processed foreign scrap to China in a higher-grade form, but their shipments have faced delays.           Customs are under pressure to ensure not only that imported pellets meet exacting standards, but also that containers are not being used to smuggle illegal low-grade waste, and cargoes are under far greater scrutiny, He said. The shift to Southeast Asia has alleviated some of the disruptions caused by the ban for companies in Europe. “We are continuing to export significant volumes, but to different destinations,” said Roger Baynham, head of the recycling division of the British Plastics Federation. But as foreign trash piles up in countries like Thailand and Vietnam, China’s recyclers face more risks. “No one wants this trash and the industry is worried these other countries will impose their own restrictions,” said a China-based executive with an overseas recycling firm who did not want to give his name. CSPA said Thailand was tightening regulations and raising import taxes, with one China-invested importer already forced to close. Malaysia also temporarily suspended new import permit applications in mid-May. Jinhui’s He said he was worried that importing rules were likely to get tougher across the region amid environmental concerns. “There’s no way China will import this sort of stuff again,” he said. And Southeast Asia “will become more standardized and regulate more stringently”. Ultimately, bans in China and restrictions elsewhere could force the countries of origin to step up their own recycling efforts, said the British Plastics Federation’s Baynham.  “The irony here is that the impetus for this has come from China, as opposed to economies such as the United Kingdom, which has been happy to accept a get-out-of-jail card in terms of its recycling strategy,” he said.  “Now is the time for the developed world, and the United Kingdom in particular, to step up.” ($1 = 6.5025 yuan) Reporting by David Stanway; Editing by Philip McClellan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution-waste/focus-chinas-plastic-recyclers-go-abroad-as-import-ban-bites-idUKL3N1T92Y1,26 Jun 2018,"* After China ban, firms fear overseas curbs as shipments

2018-06-26,"* Record output, exports from China weigh on market * Asia refiners buy more light crude to produce naphtha, gasoline (Adds details, comments) By Jessica Jaganathan and Florence Tan SINGAPORE, June 26 (Reuters) - Singapore refining margins, the benchmark for profitability among oil processors in Asia, fell to their lowest in two years, dragged down by lower gasoline margins as refiners have ramped up output after completing maintenance and as China stepped up exports. Margins at a typical complex refinery in Singapore dropped to $4.28 a barrel at the market close on Monday, the lowest since August 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data. Among oil products, gasoline margins fell the most, dropping by half in the past month to under $5 a barrel. DUB-SIN-REFGL92-SIN-CRK “The (refining) margin weakness was shared globally,” said Joe Willis, senior research analyst at Wood Mackenzie, adding that the consultancy’s global composite margin fell to $4.20 a barrel during the week of June 18, well below the five-year average of almost $6 a barrel. “The weakness can be primarily attributed to weaker gasoline cracks. Higher outright crude oil prices are likely to result in slower demand growth, particularly in the U.S. among the peak demand season,” he said. China, which holds the most refining capacity in Asia, increased crude throughput during the first five months of 2018 by 9 percent from a year ago to a record, with the bulk of the increase leading to a boost in output of aviation and motor fuel. Similarly, refineries in Japan, South Korea and Singapore are also ramping up output after completing maintenance earlier in the second quarter. Asia will also be importing a record 39 million barrels of U.S. crude in July, mainly light grades. That could further lift gasoline and naphtha output and continue to weigh on refiners’ profits, said two traders that participate in the market. “Refineries in the region have been processing lighter crude as the margins for naphtha and gasoline have been quite good up until recently,” said a Singapore-based crude oil trader. “So (the drop in margin) may mean a switch in crude or yield again, but it will take a while to take effect. The (refining) margins are getting very compressed now.” Diesel and jet fuel margins in Asia have also slipped to their lowest since November as refineries increased output. Meanwhile, China stepped up diesel exports as domestic demand has fallen during an annual fishing ban that is scheduled to run until mid-July, three middle distillates traders said. Chinese exporters are also focusing on selling diesel within Asia as the economics for exporting to Latin America are no longer profitable, they said. India has also been stepping up exports of diesel in the spot market due to weaker demand in the domestic sector because of the monsoon season which typically reduces the need for diesel for irrigation pumps, two traders that participate in the market said. Even with the drop in overall margins, Chinese domestic margins remain high enough to support refiners maintaining their current processing rates, said a manager from PetroChina Co’s Dalian refinery, adding the plant has no plans to cut runs. Japanese domestic margins also remain firm enough to support runs, said an analyst at brokerage in the country who asked to remain unidentified. Idemitsu Kosan Co Ltd, the second-biggest Japanese refiner by sales, said on Tuesday it planned to raise crude throughput in the third quarter by 3 percent from a year ago.

2018-06-26,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: China's seaborne coal imports vs. price: reut.rs/2trMivA By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, June 26 (Reuters) - China’s seaborne coal imports are on track to have surged by around 14 percent in the first half of the year, with Indonesia emerging as the big winner among exporters. Imports are likely to be around 126.6 million tonnes in the first six months of this year, up from 111.3 million tonnes for the same period in 2017, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters Supply Chain and Commodity Forecasts. It also appears that June may be the strongest month so far this year, with 22.1 million tonnes discharged, or in the process of discharging, as of Tuesday. The final figure may be slightly higher, at around 25.9 million tonnes: The data is filtered only to show ships that have already discharged, are discharging or awaiting unloading, and more cargoes may be handled in the final days of June. The strongest month so far this year for China’s coal imports from the seaborne market was March’s 23.2 million tonnes, according to the data. A look at the breakdown of where China is sourcing its coal reveals a surprise packet - Indonesia. China has imported about 15.3 million tonnes more coal from the seaborne market in the first half of 2018 compared with last year. On a net basis, it’s all from the Southeast Asian country. Imports from Indonesia were around 61.8 million tonnes in the first half, up from 46.3 million for the same period in 2017. The strength of shipments from Indonesia may raise some eyebrows among those who believe China is trying to lower air pollution from burning coal, partly by using less and partly by switching to higher-quality coal. Indonesia’s exports are predominantly lower-grade coal, typically with an energy value of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram (kcal/kg) or less. However, Indonesia’s coal is also typically low in sulphur. That makes it useful for Chinese coastal power plants to blend with higher-sulphur domestic supplies or imports. This allows them to lower emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, albeit at a small penalty to the efficiency of the boiler. It’s also worth noting that Indonesian coal trades at a substantial discount to higher-quality thermal coal from main regional rival Australia. Indonesian 4,200 kcal/kg coal, as assessed by Argus Media, was at $48.71 a tonne in the week ended June 22. The weekly index for 6,000 kcal/kg coal at Australia’s Newcastle Port was $116.27. The discount of the Indonesian grade to Newcastle has widened substantially over the past year, going from 50 percent at the end of June 2017 to the current 58 percent. While this is encouraging additional cargoes from Indonesia, it also means that Australian exporters are enjoying higher prices, even if their volumes are more or less the same. China imported 42.84 million tonnes from Australia in the first six months of the year, fractionally higher than the 42.62 million tonnes in the same period in 2017, according to the vessel-tracking data. While Indonesia and Australia dominate supply to China, it’s worth noting that Russia also managed to lift deliveries, with imports rising 27 percent to 10.3 million tonnes in the first half. China’s imports from the United States, which are predominantly coking coal used in steel-making, dropped in the first half to 2.09 million tonnes, a decline of 38 percent. This occurred well before any potential impact of proposed Chinese tariffs on coal from the United States, which may be imposed as part of the escalating trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. The decline so far this year in imports from the United States is more likely related to Australian coking coal being more competitive - and available, given the absence this year of major weather-related outages. Overall, China’s increased appetite for imported coal appears to be contributing to higher prices, with the Newcastle index up 12 percent so far, hitting a six-year high of $118.09 a tonne in the week ended June 17.

Spreadbetters expected European shares to open slightly higher following the previous day’s sharp losses, with Britain’s FTSE gaining 0.25 percent, Germany’s DAX rising 0.35 percent and France’s CAC climbing 0.25 percent. The tense atmosphere lifted demand for safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and kept the dollar on the defensive as financial markets worried about the wider global economic fallout of the Trump administration’s “America First’ agenda. Asian equities were lower across the board after Wall Street tumbled, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their steepest losses in more than two months overnight. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.27 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng retreated 0.2 percent, the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.8 percent, and Japan’s Nikkei was down 0.1 percent after trimming most of its earlier losses. Tech-heavy indexes such as South Korea’s KOSPI and Taiwan’s weighted index fell 0.45 percent and 0.55 percent, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was down 1.8 percent, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc lost 1 percent and Japan’s Tokyo Electron was down 0.6 percent. Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings shed 0.3 percent. Asian tech shares slid after U.S. peers, which derive much of their sales revenue from China, took a battering overnight. Sparking the drop in tech shares and souring broader sentiment was a report on Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was drafting curbs that would block companies with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from investing in U.S. tech firms. “Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and the retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington’s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy,” wrote Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. Besides the trade dispute with China, the United States has recently raised the stakes in a challenge to the European Union by threatening tariffs on cars imported from the bloc. “The increasingly hawkish trade rhetoric the United States is employing could begin impacting the economy by cooling investor sentiment and curbing capital expenditure by corporations,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “It’s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections (in November).” The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies dipped 0.1 percent to 94.202 and was headed for its fifth straight day of losses. The greenback was pressured as long-term U.S. Treasury yields declined to one-week lows as prices rose on heightened risk aversion in financial markets. The euro added to the previous day’s gains and reached a near two-week high of $1.1722. The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 109.460 yen, having fallen to a two-week low of 109.365 on Monday. The yen often attracts safe-haven bids in times of political tension and market turmoil. Brent crude oil futures were up 0.15 percent at $74.83 on uncertainty over Libya’s capacity to deliver on exports commitments. Brent futures had fallen 1 percent overnight as receding investor risk appetite weighed on commodities. Oil prices were capped after OPEC and its allies on Friday agreed to increase global supplies, albeit modestly.

2018-06-26,"SINGAPORE, June 26 (Reuters) - Commodity price agency S&P Global Platts, a unit of S&P Global Inc, is reviewing the way it prices Indonesia’s Minas crude oil, the company told subscribers in a note on Tuesday. Platts is reviewing the suitability of continuing to assess the crude oil grade using a “market-on-close” methodology or move to a market adjusted “gross product worth” calculation, it said. The gross product worth is typically calculated based on the value of refined products that are derived from the crude oil grade. Platts’ pricing process, which it calls market-on-close, usually includes a half-hour period daily when companies which have been pre-approved are able to bid, offer or trade cargoes. The agency then prices the oil cargo using that information among other things. A steep decline in production, as well as continued domestic consumption has led to a “significant fall” in spot market liquidity for Minas, Platts said in the note. Production and exports of Minas crude have fallen in recent years to about 155,000 barrels per day now from a peak of about 420,000 bpd, the agency added.

The tense backdrop lifted safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and kept the dollar on the defensive as financial markets worried about the wider global economic fallout of the Trump administration’s “America First’ agenda. Asian equities were bathed in a sea of red after Wall Street tumbled overnight, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq suffering their steepest losses in more than two months overnight. Markets in China - the epicentre of the trade tensions with the United States - took the biggest knock. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.35 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng retreated 0.4 percent, the Shanghai Composite Index slid 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei shed 0.2 percent. Equities from tech-heavy regions such as South Korea’s KOSPI and Taiwan fell 0.9 percent and 0.75 percent, respectively. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co was down 1.8 percent, South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc lost 1.55 percent and Japan’s Tokyo Electron was down 1.45 percent. Chinese tech giant Tencent Holdings tumbled 1.7 percent. Asian tech shares slid after their U.S. peers which derive much of their revenue from China took a battering overnight. Sparking the drop in tech shares and souring broader sentiment was a report on Monday that the U.S. Treasury Department was drafting curbs that would block companies with at least 25 percent Chinese ownership from buying U.S. tech firms. “Unlike the seemingly spur-of-the-moment tweets by President Trump and retaliatory exchange of tariffs, Washington’s bid to protect intellectual property is an issue at the heart of a trade row between two powers battling for future global supremacy,” wrote Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo. Besides the trade spat with China, the United States has recently upped the ante in a challenge to the European Union by threatening to impose tariffs on cars imported from the bloc. “Increasingly hawkish trade rhetoric the United States is employing could begin impacting the economy by cooling investor sentiment and curbing capital expenditure by corporations,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “It’s turning out to be a long-term bearish factor for the financial markets, as the United States is unlikely to back down at least through its midterm elections.” The dollar index against a basket of six major currencies dipped 0.1 percent to 94.193 and headed for its fifth straight day of losses. The greenback was pressured as long-term U.S. Treasury yields declined to one-week lows amid the heightened risk aversion in financial markets. The euro added to the previous day’s gains and reached a near two-week high of $1.1722. The dollar was down 0.3 percent at 109.450 yen, having fallen to a two-week low of 109.365 on Monday. The yen often attracts bids in times of political tensions and market turmoil. Brent crude oil futures were up 0.07 percent at $74.78 on the back of uncertainty over Libyan exports. The contracts had slid 1 percent overnight as receding investor risk appetite weighed on commodities. Oil prices were capped after OPEC and its allies on Friday agreed to increase global supplies, albeit modestly. Trade concerns kept copper on the London Metal Exchange near a 2-1/2-month low of $6,702.5 per tonne brushed on Monday. Spot gold shed 0.1 percent to $1,263.56 an ounce.

2018-06-26,"SINGAPORE, June 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday on uncertainty over Libyan oil exports, although plans by producer cartel OPEC to raise output continued to drag. Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, were at $74.95 per barrel at 0104 GMT, up 22 cents, or 0.3 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $68.33 a barrel, up 25 cents, or 0.4 percent. Traders said prices were mostly driven higher by uncertainty around oil exports by Libya, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar’s forces have handed control of oil ports to a separate National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the East of the country. The official state-owned oil company based in the capital Tripoli, also called NOC, will not be allowed to handle that oil anymore, he said. In comments later confirmed to Reuters, Ahmed Mismari, spokesman of Haftar’s Libya National Army (LNA), said on television that no tanker would be allowed to dock at eastern ports without permission from an NOC entity based in the main eastern city, Benghazi. The uncertainty over Libya’s oil exports came after OPEC together with a group of non-OPEC partners including top producer OPEC announced a supply rise of around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) aimed at cooling oil markets. Oil markets have tightened significantly since 2017, when OPEC and its partners started withholding supply to prop up slumping prices at the time. “Despite the OPEC agreement (last week) we believe that tight supply is likely to drive oil prices higher during 2018,” Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies said in a note “We expect that Brent prices will be in excess of $80 per barrel in 2H18,” he added.

2018-06-26,"(Repeats with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2tt9dX9 By John Kemp LONDON, June 25 (Reuters) - Hedge funds left their positions largely unchanged in the run up to last week’s meetings among oil ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies. Hedge funds and other money managers trimmed their combined net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum for the ninth week in a row. But the combined net long position was cut by just 14 million barrels in the week to June 19, the smallest weekly amount since the middle of April, taking the total reduction so far to 330 million barrels since April 17. There were only very minor changes to positions in all crude and fuels contracts. Portfolio managers cut net positions in NYMEX and ICE WTI (-9 million barrels), U.S. heating oil (-1 million) and European gasoil (-8 million) but added positions in Brent (+3 million) and U.S. gasoline (+2 million). In most cases, position changes were driven mainly by small reductions in existing bullish long positions rather than the creation of new bearish short ones (tmsnrt.rs/2tt9dX9). Even after the long liquidation over the last nine weeks, fund managers remain overwhelmingly bullish about the outlook for oil prices later in 2018. Bullish long positions outnumber bearish short positions by a ratio of more than 7:1, down from a peak of almost 14:1 in mid-April, but still exceptionally high. Hedge fund managers have become slightly less bullish about the outlook for oil prices rather than outright bearish. Short positions remain at unusually low levels in all petroleum contracts and there has been no sign of significant new short selling.

2018-06-26,"BENGHAZI, Libya/TUNIS (Reuters) - Eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar’s forces have handed control of oil ports to a National Oil Corporation (NOC) based in the east, a spokesman said on Monday, a move the internationally recognised NOC in Tripoli dismissed as illegal. If implemented, the transfer of control would create uncertainty for buyers of Libyan oil who normally go through NOC Tripoli. It could also deepen the split between east and west Libya, which have been home to rival governments since 2014. In comments later confirmed to Reuters, Ahmed Mismari, spokesman of Haftar’s Libya National Army (LNA), said on television that no tanker would be allowed to dock at eastern ports without permission from an NOC entity based in the main eastern city, Benghazi. Mismari said the move was to prevent oil revenues being used to fund militias such as “Chadian mercenaries”, and because of a lack of recognition from the chairman of NOC Tripoli, Mustafa Sanalla, for the “sacrifices” of LNA troops guarding the ports. Armed forces allied to Ibrahim Jathran, a faction leader, briefly seized the Es Sider and Ras Lanuf oil ports this month until the LNA expelled his troops last week. The LNA says fighters from Chad helped Jathran. Mismari said 184 LNA soldiers had been killed and dozens of others wounded in five attacks on the ports, which have been repeatedly fought over by rival factions. When asked how oil exports would be sold in the future via the east, he referred questions to NOC in Benghazi, which is not recognised abroad. Faraj Said, head of the Benghazi NOC, said his office was planning to issue instructions to oil companies to start work. “We are legitimate,” Said told Reuters. “Whoever wants to do business with us is welcome.” NOC Tripoli said in a statement that the LNA had “decided to put itself above the law”, and any attempts by parallel institutions to export oil were illegal and would fail as they had failed in the past. “NOC warns companies against entering into contracts to buy oil from parallel institutions,” it said. “They will not be honoured and NOC will pursue legal action against them by all options available.”   Haftar’s forces control most of eastern Libya, home to a largely powerless parallel government, central bank and NOC entity opposing the U.N.-backed administration in the capital, Tripoli. Eastern factions have long accused the central bank in Tripoli of misspending oil revenues and allocating insufficient funds to the east. A spokesman for the eastern government said its prime minister and central bank had met on Monday to discuss how to start managing oil revenues. The eastern government tried in 2015 to sell oil bypassing NOC Tripoli, but did not find buyers, banks or insurers willing to take the legal risk. Western powers and U.N. Security Council resolutions have protected NOC Tripoli as the sole body that can market and sell Libyan oil.   The fate of Es Sider and Ras Lanuf, two of Libya’s largest ports, is crucial to the fragile recovery of the country’s oil industry. Their closure has led to production losses of up to 450,000 barrels per day from a total national output of a little over 1 million bpd. The Hariga port in Tobruk near the Egyptian border as well as the Brega and Zueitina terminals southwest of Benghazi are also under Haftar’s control. In 2013, Jathran seized and blockaded several eastern oil ports. In March 2014, U.S. Navy SEALS seized a tanker that had loaded crude from one of the ports, and in 2016, Jathran lost control to the LNA. The LNA handed the terminals to NOC Tripoli, allowing Libya’s production and exports to rise sharply.
