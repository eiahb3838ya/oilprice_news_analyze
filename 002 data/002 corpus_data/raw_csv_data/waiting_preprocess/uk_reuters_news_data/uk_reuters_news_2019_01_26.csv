2019-01-26,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia aims to attract private sector investments worth 1.6 trillion riyals ($427 billion / 323.51 billion pounds) over the next decade through an industrial development programme aimed at diversifying the economy, Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Saturday. Investments will be made through the National Industrial Development and Logistics Program (NIDLP), one of the programmes set out under Vision 2030, a wider reform strategy led by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and intended to wean the economy off hydrocarbons and create jobs for Saudis. Falih said the kingdom would on Monday announce projects worth 70 billion riyals that are “ready for negotiations” under the NIDLP to boost industry, mining, energy and logistics. At a later stage, it plans to announce projects in the military, chemicals and small businesses industries worth $50 billion, he added without giving a timeframe. “The (NIDLP) programme targets 1.6 trillion Saudi riyals ... it is quite ambitious but it is over a 10-year period so we have got the time to do it,” Falih told a press conference. The programme will seek to raise money from both domestic and foreign investors. The programme will integrate the mining, industry and energy sectors, which Falih said were each vital to the kingdom’s plan to empower the private sector and make it the main driver for economic growth.  After decades of spending on development projects, the government has made attracting greater foreign investment a cornerstone of its Vision 2030 plan. But foreign investors have been rattled in recent months by Saudi Arabia’s deteriorating relations with Western governments after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Transport Minister Nabeel al-Amudi told the press conference that NIDLP would launch 60 initiatives in the logistics sector, including five new airports and 2,000 km of railways, and aims to attract more than 135 billion riyals of investments. “We aim by 2020 that the logistics sector contributes 221 billion riyals to GDP,” he said. Under Vision 2030 the kingdom aims to have the private sector operate much of its transport infrastructure, including airports and sea ports, with the government keeping a role as regulator.

2019-01-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest, a government-appointed commission said on Saturday, proposing at least 40 billion euros (34.6 billion pounds) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. The roadmap proposals, a hard-won compromise reached early on Saturday after more than 20 hours of talks, must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. They embody Germany’s strategy to shift to renewables, which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year — beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet welcomed the plan hammered out by the commission that included 28 voting members from industry, academia, environmental groups and unions, plus three non-voting members from the ruling parties. “Less CO2, more new jobs, a secure power supply and affordability: a strong signal,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Twitter. The panel, which began its work in June, said at least 40 billion euros in aid should be provided for coal-mining states affected by the exit, less than the roughly 60 billion euros they had sought. “This is a historic accomplishment,” Ronald Pofalla, one of four commission leaders, told reporters in Berlin. He said the deal would allow Germany to meet its climate change targets for 2030, which call for significant cuts in carbon emissions. Another chair of the commission, environmental professor Barbara Praetorius said the plan would also guarantee “affordable and secure energy supplies.” Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s biggest coal-producing region and most populous state, said it would pave the way for an economically viable “future without coal” for regions now heavily dependent on it. He said it was up to the German government and the states to translate the recommendations into policy and law.  Environmental groups vowed to hold the government to account on the targets, saying they would push for an even earlier exit. Business leaders, who had warned that a too-hasty exit from coal could inflate power prices, generally welcomed the plan, though RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany’s top electricity producer, said 2038 was too soon to shut all coal-fired plants. “It’s a compromise that hurts everyone. That’s always a good sign,” added Andreas Scheidt, a member of both the commission and the executive board of the ver.di trade union. In a first step, plant operators including RWE, Uniper (UN01.DE), EnBW (EBKG.DE) and Vattenfall [VATN.UL] will be asked to shut down about 12.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity by 2022, equivalent to about 24 large power station units, said the report, seen by Reuters. Under the proposed plans, coal power capacity in Germany would more than halve to 17 GW by 2030. It said compensation and other shutdown details should be agreed with the operators on a contractual basis. In a blow to RWE, the commission said preserving the contested Hambach forest was “desirable”, hitting the group’s key source of lignite where mining operations have already been halted following a court order. If implemented, the proposals would be the second major intervention in Germany’s energy market within a decade. The German government decided in the wake of Japan’s Fukishima disaster in 2011 to stop producing nuclear power by 2022. While the 2038 date to exit coal was in line with expectations, the report said the phase out could be completed by 2035 — a decision that would be taken in 2032. Compensation for companies and household consumers facing higher power bills due to the phase-out should be two billion euros per year, with the exact amount to be set in 2023, the report said. Stanislaw Tillich, former premier of the coal-producing Saxony region in eastern Germany, said the accord would be exemplary in Europe, by showing that new industries and jobs could be developed even as coal was phased out.

2019-01-26,"(Adds comments by Russia, U.S., Venezuela, China, details throughout) By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told countries at the United Nations on Saturday to “pick a side” on Venezuela, urging them to back Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and calling for free and fair elections as soon as possible. Pompeo was addressing the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which met at his request after Washington and a string of countries in the region recognized Guaido as head of state and urged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim President Guaido’s role.” Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday though Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. Maduro cruised to re-election in May last year amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right leaning Latin American governments declined to recognize the result of the vote. Under Maduro, Venezuela has sunk into turmoil with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Belgium all said on Saturday they would recognize Guaido as interim president unless Maduro called fresh elections within eight days. “Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people,” Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council. “It’s almost childlike.” Arreaza said Maduro’s government still hopes to establish communication and dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. “That offer stands,” he told the council. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called the eight day ultimatum “absurd.” Moscow opposes the U.S. efforts and has accused Washington of backing a coup attempt, placing Venezuela at the heart of a growing geopolitical duel. “This is not about foreign intervention in Venezuela,” former U.S. diplomat Elliott Abrams, who Pompeo named on Friday to lead U.S. efforts on Venezuela, told the council. Russia failed in a bid to stop Saturday’s Security Council meeting. China, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea voted with Moscow to block the meeting, while nine countries voted in favor of the meeting. Ivory Coast and Indonesia abstained. “We strongly condemn those who are pushing the Venezuelan society to the edge of a bloodbath. The U.S. are painting a picture of a confrontation between the Maduro regime and the people of Venezuela. This picture is far from reality,” Nebenzia told the Security Council. Russia, China, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea also blocked a U.S. push for a U.N. Security Council statement expressing full support for Venezuela’s National Assembly as the country’s “only democratically elected institution.” “China does not interfere in other countries internal affairs. We hope the country that accuses others can do likewise itself,” said China’s U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu, referring to the United States. The United States has signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power. Pompeo told reporters on Saturday that he hopes countries “will ensure that they disconnect their financial systems from the Maduro regime and allow assets that belong to the Venezuelan people to go to the rightful governors of that state.” Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Washington, Editing

2019-01-26,"* Investors have been awaiting compensation details * RWE says 2038 exit date too early, wants extension * Uniper says Datteln 4 coal plant may not enter service By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Operators of Germany’s coal-fired power plans will have to negotiate compensation with the authorities for accelerating moves to phase out use of the fuel, a report said on Saturday, with the prospect that payouts could run into billions of euros. A commission has set out proposals for ending the use of coal as a power source by 2038 in Europe’s biggest economy, affecting operators RWE, Uniper, EnBW , Vattenfall, Steag and LEAG. The fuel now generates 38 percent of Germany’s electricity. The government-appointed body’s proposals will serve as the basis for turning the phase-out into law and means several coal-fired power stations will close earlier than expected. “The commission recommends a mutual agreement with the operators on a contractual basis with regard to the shutdown,” the commission’s final report seen by Reuters said, adding this would include agreeing on the size of any compensation. Shareholders and utility investors have been waiting for months for details about what payments would be offered. The report said ways to determine compensation could include capacity tenders or keeping plants on standby, similar to existing reserve payments for operators that have totalled as much as 150 million euros ($171 million) per gigawatt per year in the past. Of Germany’s total installed power generation capacity, which stood at 218 GW at the end of 2017, hard-coal and lignite plants accounted for 46 GW, or more than a fifth, suggesting billions of euros in overall compensation payments. RWE, Germany’s biggest power producer and the largest operator of coal-fired plants at 13.3 GW of capacity, said 2038 was too soon, urging lawmakers to consider extending this during a review in 2032. “We are obliged to protect the interests of our employees as well as our shareholders,” RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said in a statement. The 336-page report by the commission said: “If there are auctions, avoiding forced layoffs as well as unfair social and economic disadvantages for the affected employees is a necessary precondition.” Compensation should apply to plants in operation and those that have not yet entered service or were still being built, which includes Uniper’s Datteln 4 plant, the report said. The older the plants, the lower the compensation, it added. Eckhardt Ruemmler, chief operating officer of Uniper, which operates 3.8 GW of coal-fired capacity in Germany, said the report suggested the Datteln 4, a 1.05 GW coal plant that has so far cost 1.2 billion euros, would never enter service. “In light of the enormous investment and contractual obligations related to the project this requires substantial talks - including with our clients of the plant,” Ruemmler said. “The plant is central to our corporate planning.” Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall and EnBW, which is almost entirely in the hands of one of Germany’s federal states and local municipalities, welcomed the decision to phase-out coal plants by 2038. Vattenfall has sold most of its coal-fired power stations, but still runs a plant in Hamburg. $1 = 0.8763 euros

2019-01-26,"* Britain, Germany, France, Spain call for elections in Venezuela * Back opposition leader Guaido if vote not called in 8 days * Maduro, backed by armed forces, has refused to stand down (Adds Russian, EU comments) By Paul Day MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Major European countries threw their weight behind Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday saying they would recognise him as interim president if Nicolas Maduro failed to call elections within eight days. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise Guaido unless fresh elections were announced. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Maduro cruised to re-election in May last year amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the vote. Guaido proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday though Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. Earlier this week, the United States declared support for Guaido, with Vice President Mike Pence calling Maduro “a dictator with no legitimate claim to power.” Since then, most Latin American nations and Canada have all said they back the 35-year-old opposition leader. On Saturday, they were joined by four European Union countries. “The government of Spain gives Nicolas Maduro eight days to call free, transparent and democratic elections,” Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in statement. “If that doesn’t happen, Spain will recognise Juan Guaido as interim president in charge of calling these elections.” French President Manuel Macron sent a tweet echoing Sanchez’s comments almost simultaneously. “Unless elections are announced within eight days, we will be ready to recognise @jguaido as ‘President in charge’ of Venezuela in order to trigger a political process,” Macron said. A spokeswoman from the German government tweeted the same message shortly after the comments from Madrid and Paris. And later British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt made a similar call. “After banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election it is clear Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela,” Hunt tweeted. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reiterated Brussels’ call for Venezuela to hold free, transparent and credible presidential elections, adding that failure to do so would prompt further action by the EU. Russia, meanwhile, called for the United States and Europe to cease interfering in Venezuela. “The cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state continues. It must stop,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The United States said on Friday it was ready to step up economic measures to drive Maduro from power.

2019-01-26,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition party has halted its presidential election campaign for 72 hours weeks ahead of the vote in protest at the suspension of the country’s most senior judge by President Muhammadu Buhari, it said on Saturday. The European Union’s team observing the election that is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16, as well as the United States and Britain, expressed concern about the suspension. Nigeria’s judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes after past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. The chief justice could rule on any future dispute. The president on Friday said he had suspended chief justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen who has been asked to appear before a tribunal over allegations of breaching asset-declaration rules.  Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him. Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and voted into office in 2015, is seeking a fresh term in the upcoming election. At stake is control of Africa’s top crude oil producer and one of the continent’s biggest economies. “In the first instance, we are suspending our campaign for 72 hours,” the PDP said in a statement. “It is our hope that President Buhari will listen to the voice of all lovers of democracy the world over and restore democracy in Nigeria immediately and without qualifications,” it said, calling the suspension a “brazen assault on the constitution”. Buhari said on Friday a court order from the Code of Conduct Tribunal, which is looking into the asset declaration allegations, directed him to suspend the judge.  “The EU Election Observation Mission is very concerned about the process and timing of the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria,” the EU observers said in an emailed statement.   “The timing, just before the swearing in of justices for Electoral Tribunals and the hearing of election-related cases, has also raised concerns about the opportunity for electoral justice,” it said.  Britain’s High Commission said the timing “risks affecting both domestic and international perceptions on the credibility of the forthcoming elections”, while the U.S. embassy called for issues raised by the suspension to be solved swiftly and peacefully. The PDP postponed a rally that it was due to hold in the central city of Markudi on Saturday.  The party was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari’s 2015 election victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. “It is just an excuse they are looking for in order to escape the  defeat that is awaiting them,” Lanre Issa-Onilu, a spokesman for the ruling APC, said in a telephone interview when asked about the opposition’s decision to pause its campaign.  The PDP’s candidate, businessman Atiku Abubakar who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007, is the main challenger to Buhari in the upcoming poll.

2019-01-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest, a government-appointed commission said on Saturday, proposing at least 40 billion euros (34.6 billion pounds) in aid to regions affected by the phase-out. The roadmap proposals, a hard-won compromise reached early on Saturday after more than 20 hours of talks, must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. They embody Germany’s strategy to shift to renewables, which made up more than 40 percent of the energy mix last year — beating coal for the first time — and follow a 2011 decision to halt nuclear power. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s cabinet welcomed the plan hammered out by the commission that included 28 voting members from industry, academia, environmental groups and unions, plus three non-voting members from the ruling parties. “Less CO2, more new jobs, a secure power supply and affordability: a strong signal,” Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said on Twitter. The panel, which began its work in June, said at least 40 billion euros in aid should be provided for coal-mining states affected by the exit, less than the roughly 60 billion euros they had sought. “This is a historic accomplishment,” Ronald Pofalla, one of four commission leaders, told reporters in Berlin. He said the deal would allow Germany to meet its climate change targets for 2030, which call for significant cuts in carbon emissions. Another chair of the commission, environmental professor Barbara Praetorius said the plan would also guarantee “affordable and secure energy supplies.” Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany’s biggest coal-producing region and most populous state, said it would pave the way for an economically viable “future without coal” for regions now heavily dependent on it. He said it was up to the German government and the states to translate the recommendations into policy and law.  Environmental groups vowed to hold the government to account on the targets, saying they would push for an even earlier exit. Business leaders, who had warned that a too-hasty exit from coal could inflate power prices, generally welcomed the plan, though RWE (RWEG.DE), Germany’s top electricity producer, said 2038 was too soon to shut all coal-fired plants. “It’s a compromise that hurts everyone. That’s always a good sign,” added Andreas Scheidt, a member of both the commission and the executive board of the ver.di trade union. In a first step, plant operators including RWE, Uniper (UN01.DE), EnBW (EBKG.DE) and Vattenfall [VATN.UL] will be asked to shut down about 12.7 gigawatts (GW) of capacity by 2022, equivalent to about 24 large power station units, said the report, seen by Reuters. Under the proposed plans, coal power capacity in Germany would more than halve to 17 GW by 2030. It said compensation and other shutdown details should be agreed with the operators on a contractual basis. In a blow to RWE, the commission said preserving the contested Hambach forest was “desirable”, hitting the group’s key source of lignite where mining operations have already been halted following a court order. If implemented, the proposals would be the second major intervention in Germany’s energy market within a decade. The German government decided in the wake of Japan’s Fukishima disaster in 2011 to stop producing nuclear power by 2022. While the 2038 date to exit coal was in line with expectations, the report said the phase out could be completed by 2035 — a decision that would be taken in 2032. Compensation for companies and household consumers facing higher power bills due to the phase-out should be two billion euros per year, with the exact amount to be set in 2023, the report said. Stanislaw Tillich, former premier of the coal-producing Saxony region in eastern Germany, said the accord would be exemplary in Europe, by showing that new industries and jobs could be developed even as coal was phased out.

2019-01-26,"(Adds comments by Russia, U.S., Venezuela, China, details throughout) By Michelle Nichols UNITED NATIONS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told countries at the United Nations on Saturday to “pick a side” on Venezuela, urging them to back Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido and calling for free and fair elections as soon as possible. Pompeo was addressing the 15-member U.N. Security Council, which met at his request after Washington and a string of countries in the region recognized Guaido as head of state and urged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “Now it is time for every other nation to pick a side ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you’re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,” Pompeo told the council. “We call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela’s democratic transition and interim President Guaido’s role.” Guaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday though Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. Maduro cruised to re-election in May last year amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right leaning Latin American governments declined to recognize the result of the vote. Under Maduro, Venezuela has sunk into turmoil with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Britain, Germany, France, Spain and Belgium all said on Saturday they would recognize Guaido as interim president unless Maduro called fresh elections within eight days. “Europe is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people,” Venezuela’s Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council. “It’s almost childlike.” Arreaza said Maduro’s government still hopes to establish communication and dialogue with U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. “That offer stands,” he told the council. Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia called the eight day ultimatum “absurd.” Moscow opposes the U.S. efforts and has accused Washington of backing a coup attempt, placing Venezuela at the heart of a growing geopolitical duel. “This is not about foreign intervention in Venezuela,” former U.S. diplomat Elliott Abrams, who Pompeo named on Friday to lead U.S. efforts on Venezuela, told the council. Russia failed in a bid to stop Saturday’s Security Council meeting. China, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea voted with Moscow to block the meeting, while nine countries voted in favor of the meeting. Ivory Coast and Indonesia abstained. “We strongly condemn those who are pushing the Venezuelan society to the edge of a bloodbath. The U.S. are painting a picture of a confrontation between the Maduro regime and the people of Venezuela. This picture is far from reality,” Nebenzia told the Security Council. Russia, China, South Africa and Equatorial Guinea also blocked a U.S. push for a U.N. Security Council statement expressing full support for Venezuela’s National Assembly as the country’s “only democratically elected institution.” “China does not interfere in other countries internal affairs. We hope the country that accuses others can do likewise itself,” said China’s U.N. Ambassador Ma Zhaoxu, referring to the United States. The United States has signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power. Pompeo told reporters on Saturday that he hopes countries “will ensure that they disconnect their financial systems from the Maduro regime and allow assets that belong to the Venezuelan people to go to the rightful governors of that state.” Additional reporting by Humeyra Pamuk in Washington, Editing

2019-01-26,"* Investors have been awaiting compensation details * RWE says 2038 exit date too early, wants extension * Uniper says Datteln 4 coal plant may not enter service By Christoph Steitz and Tom Käckenhoff FRANKFURT/DUESSELDORF, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Operators of Germany’s coal-fired power plans will have to negotiate compensation with the authorities for accelerating moves to phase out use of the fuel, a report said on Saturday, with the prospect that payouts could run into billions of euros. A commission has set out proposals for ending the use of coal as a power source by 2038 in Europe’s biggest economy, affecting operators RWE, Uniper, EnBW , Vattenfall, Steag and LEAG. The fuel now generates 38 percent of Germany’s electricity. The government-appointed body’s proposals will serve as the basis for turning the phase-out into law and means several coal-fired power stations will close earlier than expected. “The commission recommends a mutual agreement with the operators on a contractual basis with regard to the shutdown,” the commission’s final report seen by Reuters said, adding this would include agreeing on the size of any compensation. Shareholders and utility investors have been waiting for months for details about what payments would be offered. The report said ways to determine compensation could include capacity tenders or keeping plants on standby, similar to existing reserve payments for operators that have totalled as much as 150 million euros ($171 million) per gigawatt per year in the past. Of Germany’s total installed power generation capacity, which stood at 218 GW at the end of 2017, hard-coal and lignite plants accounted for 46 GW, or more than a fifth, suggesting billions of euros in overall compensation payments. RWE, Germany’s biggest power producer and the largest operator of coal-fired plants at 13.3 GW of capacity, said 2038 was too soon, urging lawmakers to consider extending this during a review in 2032. “We are obliged to protect the interests of our employees as well as our shareholders,” RWE Chief Executive Rolf Martin Schmitz said in a statement. The 336-page report by the commission said: “If there are auctions, avoiding forced layoffs as well as unfair social and economic disadvantages for the affected employees is a necessary precondition.” Compensation should apply to plants in operation and those that have not yet entered service or were still being built, which includes Uniper’s Datteln 4 plant, the report said. The older the plants, the lower the compensation, it added. Eckhardt Ruemmler, chief operating officer of Uniper, which operates 3.8 GW of coal-fired capacity in Germany, said the report suggested the Datteln 4, a 1.05 GW coal plant that has so far cost 1.2 billion euros, would never enter service. “In light of the enormous investment and contractual obligations related to the project this requires substantial talks - including with our clients of the plant,” Ruemmler said. “The plant is central to our corporate planning.” Swedish state-owned utility Vattenfall and EnBW, which is almost entirely in the hands of one of Germany’s federal states and local municipalities, welcomed the decision to phase-out coal plants by 2038. Vattenfall has sold most of its coal-fired power stations, but still runs a plant in Hamburg. $1 = 0.8763 euros

2019-01-26,"* Britain, Germany, France, Spain call for elections in Venezuela * Back opposition leader Guaido if vote not called in 8 days * Maduro, backed by armed forces, has refused to stand down (Adds Russian, EU comments) By Paul Day MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Major European countries threw their weight behind Venezuela’s opposition leader Juan Guaido on Saturday saying they would recognise him as interim president if Nicolas Maduro failed to call elections within eight days. Britain, Germany, France and Spain all said they would recognise Guaido unless fresh elections were announced. Venezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and daily protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year. Maduro cruised to re-election in May last year amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, the United States and right leaning Latin American governments declined to recognise the result of the vote. Guaido proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday though Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down. Earlier this week, the United States declared support for Guaido, with Vice President Mike Pence calling Maduro “a dictator with no legitimate claim to power.” Since then, most Latin American nations and Canada have all said they back the 35-year-old opposition leader. On Saturday, they were joined by four European Union countries. “The government of Spain gives Nicolas Maduro eight days to call free, transparent and democratic elections,” Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in statement. “If that doesn’t happen, Spain will recognise Juan Guaido as interim president in charge of calling these elections.” French President Manuel Macron sent a tweet echoing Sanchez’s comments almost simultaneously. “Unless elections are announced within eight days, we will be ready to recognise @jguaido as ‘President in charge’ of Venezuela in order to trigger a political process,” Macron said. A spokeswoman from the German government tweeted the same message shortly after the comments from Madrid and Paris. And later British foreign minister Jeremy Hunt made a similar call. “After banning opposition candidates, ballot box stuffing and counting irregularities in a deeply flawed election it is clear Nicolas Maduro is not the legitimate leader of Venezuela,” Hunt tweeted. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini reiterated Brussels’ call for Venezuela to hold free, transparent and credible presidential elections, adding that failure to do so would prompt further action by the EU. Russia, meanwhile, called for the United States and Europe to cease interfering in Venezuela. “The cynical, overt interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state continues. It must stop,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday. The United States said on Friday it was ready to step up economic measures to drive Maduro from power.

2019-01-26,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition party has halted its presidential election campaign for 72 hours weeks ahead of the vote in protest at the suspension of the country’s most senior judge by President Muhammadu Buhari, it said on Saturday. The European Union’s team observing the election that is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16, as well as the United States and Britain, expressed concern about the suspension. Nigeria’s judiciary has helped resolve electoral disputes after past votes, some of which have been marred by violence and vote rigging. The chief justice could rule on any future dispute. The president on Friday said he had suspended chief justice of Nigeria Walter Onnoghen who has been asked to appear before a tribunal over allegations of breaching asset-declaration rules.  Onnoghen has not responded to the charges and his lawyers say the tribunal does not have the authority to try him. Buhari, who was a military ruler in the 1980s and voted into office in 2015, is seeking a fresh term in the upcoming election. At stake is control of Africa’s top crude oil producer and one of the continent’s biggest economies. “In the first instance, we are suspending our campaign for 72 hours,” the PDP said in a statement. “It is our hope that President Buhari will listen to the voice of all lovers of democracy the world over and restore democracy in Nigeria immediately and without qualifications,” it said, calling the suspension a “brazen assault on the constitution”. Buhari said on Friday a court order from the Code of Conduct Tribunal, which is looking into the asset declaration allegations, directed him to suspend the judge.  “The EU Election Observation Mission is very concerned about the process and timing of the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria,” the EU observers said in an emailed statement.   “The timing, just before the swearing in of justices for Electoral Tribunals and the hearing of election-related cases, has also raised concerns about the opportunity for electoral justice,” it said.  Britain’s High Commission said the timing “risks affecting both domestic and international perceptions on the credibility of the forthcoming elections”, while the U.S. embassy called for issues raised by the suspension to be solved swiftly and peacefully. The PDP postponed a rally that it was due to hold in the central city of Markudi on Saturday.  The party was in power from the start of civilian rule in 1999 until Buhari’s 2015 election victory with his All Progressives Congress (APC) party. “It is just an excuse they are looking for in order to escape the  defeat that is awaiting them,” Lanre Issa-Onilu, a spokesman for the ruling APC, said in a telephone interview when asked about the opposition’s decision to pause its campaign.  The PDP’s candidate, businessman Atiku Abubakar who served as vice president from 1999 to 2007, is the main challenger to Buhari in the upcoming poll.
