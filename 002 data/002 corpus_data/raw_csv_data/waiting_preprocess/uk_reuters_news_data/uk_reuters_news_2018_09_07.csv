2018-09-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Friday, with U.S. crude slipping on weak global equity markets while Brent inched up on geopolitical factors, including violent protests in Iraq. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 settled down 2 cents at $67.75 per barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled up 33 cents at $76.83 a barrel. For the week, U.S. crude lost almost 3 percent, while Brent was down 0.8 percent. Geopolitical developments lent Brent some support, as protests in the southern Iraqi city of Basra heated up and the civil war in Syria threatened to escalate, analysts said. “The situation in Basra has really flamed up ... that’s giving Brent some help here,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. In post-settlement trading, Brent prices drifted higher after Iraqi protesters entered a 400,000 barrel per day oilfield facility operated by Lukoil and held two staff members hostage. U.S. oil prices had gotten a boost early in the week as the approach of Tropical Storm Gordon forced the closure of Gulf of Mexico oil platforms and threatened Gulf Coast refineries.  Speculators in the week to Sept. 4 raised their bullish bets on U.S. crude to the highest in a month, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Friday. “The market got too juiced up before the tropical storm ... a lot of the weakness in the week (since) has been unwinding from that,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. The storm ultimately weakened and moved away from oil-producing areas and energy companies restarted operations shut as a precautionary measure. The dollar rose on Friday against a basket of other currencies .DXY after the U.S. Labor Department’s closely watched employment report showed U.S. job growth surged in August. [FRX/] A stronger greenback makes it more expensive to buy dollar-denominated commodities like oil.  Escalating trade tensions along with the jobs data, which raised concerns about the possibility of a quickening pace of U.S. interest rate hikes, pressured global equity markets. Wall Street’s three major indexes all moved lower, while the pan-European STOXX 600  had its worst weekly performance since the end of March. [MKTS/GLOB] At the same time, U.S. oil prices remained weighed down by official data showing that U.S. gasoline inventories USOILG=ECI had risen by 1.8 million barrels while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI climbed 3.1 million barrels. “This bears all the hallmarks of a disappointing summer driving season. As a result, the alarm bells are now ringing that a gasoline glut will persist for the foreseeable future,” Stephen Brennock of London brokerage PVM said.  The U.S. rig count, an indicator of future output, fell in the week to Sept. 7, according to data from General Electric’s Baker Hughes energy services unit. U.S. energy companies cut rigs for the second week in three.

2018-09-07,"(New throughout, adds safety concerns, details on locomotive deliveries) By Julie Gordon and Rod Nickel VANCOUVER/WINNIPEG, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc , a major Canadian oil producer, has signed a deal to move more crude with the Canadian National Railway Co, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The deal is one of many being quietly signed that, along with the expedited deliveries of new locomotives, will help boost Canada’s crude-by-rail shipments 50 percent by year end, a government consultant told Reuters separately. The source said the Cenovus-CN deal was inked days before a Canadian court last week overturned the approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. Shipper commitments put CN and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd in position to collectively move more than 300,000 barrels per day by December, said Greg Stringham, a consultant who mediated talks among oil producers and railways for the Alberta government this year. Stringham did not directly address the Cenovus deal, but said new crude-by-rail “contracts are being signed. Not all of those been disclosed yet, but it is continuing.” The railways, burned a few years ago when booming demand for crude-by-rail vanished as oil prices fell and pipeline space opened, are now seeking rich multi-year, take-or-pay deals from producers. The 300,000 bpd would be 50 percent higher than June’s record 200,000 bpd and double 150,000 bpd achieved in December 2017. It is expected to further increase in 2019 as locomotive orders start to catch up with demand. The two railways and Cenovus declined to comment. The source declined to be identified as the deal is not public. Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said in July that he was considering a multi-year commitment to move 50,000 to 60,000 bpd by rail. Cenovus shares rebounded to trade up as much as 0.86 percent soon after the news. Earlier in the day, they had fallen 6.4 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell. CN shares were down 0.5 percent. Increased crude shipping by rail, while still far short of Western Canada’s rail-loading capacity of nearly 1 million bpd, would represent progress in moving more Canadian oil to U.S. refineries. It remains a tiny fraction of the total 3.3 million bpd on average exported, mostly to the U.S., in 2017. But as crude shipments increase, so do safety concerns. In 2013, a runaway train carrying crude exploded in the Quebec town of Lac Megantic killing 47 people. In June, some 230,000 gallons of crude spilled into an Iowa river after a train derailed. The head of Canada’s transportation regulator said last month that stronger tank cars for transporting flammable liquids should be required sooner than a 2025 deadline. Enbridge Inc’s oversubscribed Mainline pipeline rations space each month as oil producers expand production, driving a bigger discount in Western Canada’s heavy crude compared to the North American benchmark. The increased crude by rail volumes could not happen without new locomotives that the railways are placing into service faster than before. “Probably the biggest constraint that was identified was the lack of locomotives being available,” said Stringham, adding that the railways went to their suppliers and were able to cut delivery times from 24 months down to nine to 12 months. CN said on Wednesday that it had ordered an extra 60 locomotives from General Electric Co, adding to a previous deal for 200 locomotives over three years. The original order will now be completed in two years, and the additional 60 are due in 2020, CN spokesman Patrick Waldron said. Those locomotives will be used for energy transport, along with intermodal, coal and agricultural products. Western Canada’s crude inventories reached 36.3 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 31, a record level since Genscape began monitoring in 2010 as oil production expands faster than transport capacity, analyst Dylan White said.

2018-09-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - An annual global climate change meeting due to be held in Poland in December will start a day earlier than planned to allow more work to be done, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said. Government ministers will try to agree on rules for implementing the Paris agreement, which was adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015 and is due to come into force in 2020. “It was agreed that an early opening of the session will provide an opportunity to make the best use of the time available to finalise negotiations on the work programme under the Paris Agreement,” the UNFCCC, which steers the climate talks, said in a statement. The talks, attended by around 190 countries, will take place in Katowice in southern Poland from Dec. 2 to Dec. 14, instead of Dec. 3-14, the UNFCCC said. The Paris agreement sets a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C. During preliminary talks in Thailand this week, Fiji’s Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said governments were unprepared for the Poland meeting later this year, and   Patricia Espinosa, head of the UNFCCC, told Reuters that governments were not on track to meet the 2 degree temperature limit goal.

2018-09-07,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The project manager of a $4 billion Ethiopian dam who was found dead in his vehicle in Addis Ababa on July 26 committed suicide, police said on Friday. Simegnew Bekele was the public face of the Grand Renaissance Dam project on the River Nile - the centrepiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. Scores of people took to the streets following his death, both in his home city in Ethiopia’s north and in the capital Addis Ababa, where he was found with a bullet wound below his right ear, sparking allegations that he might have been murdered. On Friday, police ruled out foul play. “His death was not the result of a murder. The investigation concludes that it was suicide,” the head of Ethiopia’s Federal Police Commission, Zeinu Jemal, told reporters. Forensic examinations matched gunshot residue to a gun he had owned for a decade, he added.  Zeinu said the investigation had shown that the victim had been under pressure from delays in the construction of the dam, and that conversations with his secretary an hour before his death, and with his children the evening before, “seemed like farewell statements”. Ethiopia has been pushing on with the project in the face of opposition from Egypt, which fears the dam will affect the flow of the Nile, its main source of water. In June, the leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt vowed to iron out their differences peacefully. The government has only acknowledged recently that the dam, begun in 2011 and originally expected to be completed this year, might take another 10 years to finish. Last month, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said the government had terminated the contract of the state-run Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC), the contractor for the project’s electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure divisions. Italy’s Salini Impregilo  remains the main contractor building the dam, which is designed to churn out 6,000 megawatts (MW) of power on completion. Zeinu said the preliminary indications were that Simegnew’s suicide was linked not only to the delays but also to the extra costs they were incurring for the government: “All this added up to pile pressure on engineer Simegnew.” Reporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-dam/update-1-manager-of-ethiopias-4-bln-nile-dam-project-committed-suicide-police-idUKL5N1VT2FR,07 Sep 2018,"* Police say he was ""under pressure"" due to delays in

2018-09-07,"(Adds names of some bidders, minister quotes) OSLO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A total of 38 oil companies have submitted bids for exploration acreage offshore Norway in a so-called predefined areas (APA) licensing round, the country’s energy ministry said on Friday. Bidders include oil majors Shell, ConocoPhillips and Total, as well as Norway’s Equinor and Aker BP, Sweden’s Lundin and Italy’s Eni. The total number of bidders was almost as high as the record 39 in the previous APA round last year. When announcing the round in May, the government expanded the pre-defined areas near existing discoveries by a total of 103 blocks in the Norwegian and the Barents Seas. Norway’s right-wing government wants oil companies to explore more on the Norwegian continental shelf, especially in the Arctic Barents Sea, which is estimated to hold more than half of undiscovered resources on the shelf. “The oil companies showing such interest in exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf is important for future value creation, jobs and government revenues from Norway’s largest and most important industry,” Norway’s Oil and Energy Minister Kjell-Boerge Freiberg said. About 170,000 people are directly or indirectly involved in the petroleum industry in the Nordic country of 5.3 million, the ministry said. Environmentalists and some opposition politicians, however, have called on the Norwegian government to stop exploring for new oil and gas resources to reduce global carbon emissions. The ministry plans to award licences in early 2019, it added.

2018-09-07,"* Asia shares ex-Japan lowest since July last year * Tech sector hit by drop in chip stocks, social media * Fears new U.S. tariffs on China could come at any time * Aussie dollar drops to lowest in over 2 years * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2C2BSt0 By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World shares limped toward their worst week in almost six months on Friday, with Asia carving out a 14-month trough as investors braced for a new salvo of Sino-U.S. tariffs. A slump in U.S. chip stocks and reports that President Donald Trump had also weighed a trade scrap with Japan dragged on tech-heavy Asia overnight, while Europe’s main bourses faded after an initial attempt push higher. A flat pan-European STOXX 600 was set to end the week with a 2.6 percent loss, its worst weekly performance since the end of March. Emerging market stocks have lost even more, some 3.2 percent. U.S stock index futures are set to open 0.2 percent lower. Nerves were set to be frayed further after the public comment period for proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports passed at 0400 GMT. The tariffs could now go into effect at any moment, although there was no clear timetable. China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. Australia’s dollar, often used in as play on China’s fortunes due to its huge metals exports there, hit a 2-1/2 year low early on it Europe. “It is all linked to the trade comment period expiring and now we are wondering what the implementation plan is going to be and how China is going to respond,” Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy said. “The Aussie dollar of course is a proxy within G10 for that,” he added, also pointing to shares in mining giants such as BHP trading down near key technical levels. There were some crumbs of comfort, however, for traders. Battered emerging market shares were on course to snap a 7-day losing streak. China had closed higher overnight despite the tariff feud and Turkey’s lira and South Africa’s rand and Argentina’s peso all looked relatively calm early on. Chinese blue chips had managed their 0.5 percent bounce as beaten-down health care stocks found buyers after taking a savaging in recent months amid vaccine scandals. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had still lost 0.3 percent though, having earlier reached its lowest since mid-July last year. The Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, undermined by a rising yen and reports U.S. President Donald Trump could be contemplating taking on Japan over trade. Other emerging markets were trying to steady after a punishing week, with Indonesia and the Philippines still badly scarred by fears of capital flight following crises in Argentina and Turkey and the rumbling U.S.-China trade strains. “It seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The tech sector was also very weak overnight, with a slide in Micron of almost 10 percent and further weakness in the Chinese Internet ADRs.” Eyes were also turning to the U.S. payrolls report for August which is expected to show a robust rise of 191,000, in part as July was temporarily depressed by the closure of the Toys R Us chain that month. Still, analysts at NatWest Markets cautioned that: “Despite employment indicators pointing to another strong report, it is worth noting that there is a tendency for August payrolls to initially disappoint and then be revised up noticeably later.” Just as important will be figures on U.S. wages where a rise above the 0.2 percent forecasted would likely boost the dollar and pressure Treasury prices. The dollar could do with the lift, having lost out to the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc. It was changing hands at 110.70 yen after falling 0.7 percent on Thursday, the sharpest one-day loss in seven weeks. Part of the decline came after a Wall Street Journal columnist reported Trump had mused about starting a trade fight with Japan. The dollar also hit a four-month low on the franc around $0.9645. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index nudged lower to 94.939 and was heading for a fourth weekly drop. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1645, while sterling idled at $1.2939 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. In commodity markets, the dip in the dollar left gold a sliver higher at $1,200.67 an ounce. Crude oil was slightly up too after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday when U.S. data showed gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly last week. Brent was 20 cents higher at $76.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude edged up 23 cents to $67.99. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney

2018-09-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment-grade corporate bonds suffered their worst outflows since December 2016 in the week leading up to Wednesday, with dedicated funds shedding $3.1 billion, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed on Friday.  High-yield and emerging-market bond funds also saw outflows of $800 million and $600 million respectively, but investment grade bore the brunt of selling, according to the BAML data which is based on analysis of numbers from the EPFR Global flow tracker. The bank’s analysts described the current situation on global markets as “1998 redux”, referring to the Asian and Russian financial crises that year. “Fed tightening, U.S. decoupling, flattening yield curve, collapsing emerging markets, underperforming levered quant strategies ... all echo 1998,” they said. BAML particularly warned clients to watch credit spreads in “excessively indebted” Europe, China, emerging markets and U.S. companies in the “BBB” ratings category. The latter sector has $4.93 trillion of debt outstanding compared with $1.08 trillion in 2008, according to BAML.  Overall, bond funds in the past week shed $1.9 billion.  Outflows were more muted in equities, with just $200 million exiting stocks globally. A massive $4.7 billion flowed into exchange-traded funds, offsetting losses from mutual funds.  There was some good news for European equities, which recorded a small $200 million inflow, their first gain in 26 weeks.  On emerging markets, the scene of steep falls in recent weeks, BAML said it saw no evidence of capitulation, estimating that less than 20 percent of the inflows from 2016 to 2018 had been redeemed so far.

2018-09-07,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World share indexes registered their biggest weekly declines in almost six months in a volatile session on Friday as investors weighed solid U.S. economic data against expectations for higher interest rates and U.S. trade tensions on multiple fronts.  U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years, cementing expectations for a third U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike for the year in late September.    The U.S. dollar was boosted by the data, but investors were jittery about U.S. trade relations after President Donald Trump said he could hit China with more tariffs and alluded to trade talks with Japan while Canada negotiations continue. Wall Street stocks ended lower, dragged down after Trump threatened tariffs on a further $267 billion worth of Chinese imports, on top of levies on $200 billion worth of goods that Trump promised could go into effect “very soon.” China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. “If these tariffs go into effect, (China) may have to cushion the economy by devaluing its currency again,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey. “That will push the U.S. dollar higher, which puts more pressure on emerging markets. It will also have a negative effect on U.S. exporters.” Trump also said the United States and Japan have begun trade talks and that Tokyo “knows it’s a big problem” if an agreement cannot be reached.  Meanwhile, Canada’s top trade negotiator said she and her U.S. counterpart were making “very good progress” in talks to save the North American Free Trade Agreement.

The dollar index .DXY rose 0.37 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.52 percent to $1.156. U.S. benchmark Treasury yields rose to their highest levels in almost a month after the higher-than-expected increase in wages raised expectations of higher inflation.

2018-09-07,"(Updates to afternoon, adds commentary, changes byline) By Sinéad Carew NEW YORK, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World share indexes limped toward their worst week in almost six months on Friday and trading was volatile as investors weighed  solid economic data against expectations for interest rate hikes and escalating U.S.-China trade tensions. U.S. job growth accelerated in August and wages notched their largest annual increase in more than nine years, cementing expectations for a third U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate hike for the year in late September. The U.S. dollar was boosted by the jobs growth numbers, but gains were checked by trade war fears as U.S. President Donald Trump said he could hit China with more tariffs. After opening lower and turning positive about an hour into trading, the S&P 500 reversed course early in the afternoon after Trump threatened tariffs on a further $267 billion worth of Chinese imports while the world was still waiting to hear whether he would impose levies on $200 billion worth of goods. Just before Trump’s comments, investors had been feeling a “little better” about the trade situation as White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Trump would not decide on China tariffs before officials evaluate public comments on them. “It’s not that we have good policies or bad policies, it’s that we don’t know what the policy is. It’s very fickle,” said Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago. China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 40.97 points, or 0.16 percent, to 25,954.9, the S&P 500 lost 2.09 points, or 0.07 percent, to 2,875.96 and the Nasdaq Composite was down 5.3 points or 0.07 percent at 7917.25. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.05 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.20 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 0.27 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.33 percent lower hitting a 14-month low during the session. The dollar index rose 0.36 percent, with the euro down 0.49 percent to $1.1564. The dollar was boosted by U.S. job growth data but uncertainty over the U.S.-Chinese trade conflict held gains in check. U.S. benchmark Treasury yields rose to their highest levels in almost a month after the higher-than-expected increase in wages raised expectations of higher inflation. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 18/32 in price to yield 2.9424 percent compared with 2.877 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices were under pressure from a strong dollar, weakness in the equity markets, and Tropical Storm Gordon’s smaller-than-expected impact on U.S. Gulf Coast oil production.

2018-09-07,"ABERDEEN, Scotland (Reuters) - Scotland’s leader Nicola Sturgeon launched on Friday a major renewable energy project boasting the world’s most powerful wind turbines, which she hopes will also propel the independence ambitions of her nationalist party. The 11 191-metre-high turbines in the waters of Aberdeen Bay will eventually produce 312 GWh of power a year - enough to power 80,000 households - helping to reduce Scotland’s reliance on its oil industry.  “Scotland is a world leader in energy and that is good for our present and our future, whatever that may be,” Sturgeon told Reuters, standing on a ferry underneath the churning blades of the new European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC), which is run by Swedish utility Vattenfall. [VATN.UL]  The Scottish National Party she leads, which is seeking to  maintain its drive for independence from the United Kingdom, has embraced renewable power as the centre of its energy policy. The party’s emphasis on optimistic-looking future oil revenues was seen by many as a key weakness in the failed campaign to win an independence referendum in 2014. An SNP strategy published this year removed oil from the party’s baseline plans for the economy, describing it instead as a “bonus”, while renewables were seen as one of Scotland’s economic motors, with food and drink and finance. At the same time, renewable projects such as EODCW enhance the SNP’s appeal to the 61 percent of Scottish voters who think climate change is an urgent concern, according to a survey of households published by the Scottish government this week.  Sturgeon wants 50 percent of all of Scotland’s energy to come from renewables by 2030, compared with an EU target of at least 27 percent. Scotland’s energy minister, Paul Wheelhouse, said the renewable power and low carbon sector provided 49,000 jobs in Scotland, compared with 115,000 in oil and gas, but the difference was narrowing. With Scots unhappy about Britain’s exit from the European Union, another referendum for Scottish independence is a possibility which Sturgeon does not rule out.  The EU’s financial support for renewable projects such as the EOWDC has underpinned support for the bloc.  Scotland has the majority of the UK’s onshore wind energy resources and the seas around Scotland have up to 25 percent of Europe’s tidal power, 10 percent of its wave power and around 25 percent of European offshore wind resource potential. Even so, the value of the oil still under the North Sea has defied predictions of a quick collapse and still dominates  Scotland’s economy for now, especially with the recent recovery in the oil price. At the same time, more efficient techniques for dismantling old oil rigs in deep and often treacherous waters is a skill that Scotland is pioneering as another revenue earner. Not everyone is a fan of the new wind power project in Aberdeen Bay. Before he was elected as U.S. president, Donald Trump objected to the wind farm being located in full view of his golf course at Balmedie. He was defeated in a court battle. “Maybe on his next trip to Scotland he can come and see it and change his mind,” Sturgeon said.

2018-09-07,"VANCOUVER/WINNIPEG (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO), a major Canadian oil producer, has signed a deal to move more crude with the Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO), a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The deal is one of many being quietly signed that, along with the expedited deliveries of new locomotives, will help boost Canada’s crude-by-rail shipments 50 percent by year end, a government consultant told Reuters separately.     The source said the Cenovus-CN deal was inked days before a Canadian court last week overturned the approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion.  Shipper commitments put CN and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) in position to collectively move more than 300,000 barrels per day by December, said Greg Stringham, a consultant who mediated talks among oil producers and railways for the Alberta government this year. Stringham did not directly address the Cenovus deal, but said new crude-by-rail “contracts are being signed. Not all of those been disclosed yet, but it is continuing.” The railways, burned a few years ago when booming demand for crude-by-rail vanished as oil prices fell and pipeline space opened, are now seeking rich multi-year, take-or-pay deals from producers.The 300,000 bpd would be 50 percent higher than June’s record 200,000 bpd and double 150,000 bpd achieved in December 2017. It is expected to further increase in 2019 as locomotive orders start to catch up with demand. The two railways and Cenovus declined to comment. The source declined to be identified as the deal is not public. Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said in July that he was considering a multi-year commitment to move 50,000 to 60,000 bpd by rail. Cenovus shares rebounded to trade up as much as 0.86 percent soon after the news. Earlier in the day, they had fallen 6.4 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell. CN shares were down 0.5 percent. Increased crude shipping by rail, while still far short of Western Canada’s rail-loading capacity of nearly 1 million bpd, would represent progress in moving more Canadian oil to U.S. refineries. It remains a tiny fraction of the total 3.3 million bpd on average exported, mostly to the U.S., in 2017. But as crude shipments increase, so do safety concerns. In 2013, a runaway train carrying crude exploded in the Quebec town of Lac Megantic killing 47 people. In June, some 230,000 gallons of crude spilled into an Iowa river after a train derailed. The head of Canada’s transportation regulator said last month that stronger tank cars for transporting flammable liquids should be required sooner than a 2025 deadline.   Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) oversubscribed Mainline pipeline rations space each month as oil producers expand production, driving a bigger discount in Western Canada’s heavy crude compared to the North American benchmark CLc1. The increased crude by rail volumes could not happen without new locomotives that the railways are placing into service faster than before. “Probably the biggest constraint that was identified was the lack of locomotives being available,” said Stringham, adding that the railways went to their suppliers and were able to cut delivery times from 24 months down to nine to 12 months.    CN said on Wednesday that it had ordered an extra 60 locomotives from General Electric Co (GE.N), adding to a previous deal for 200 locomotives over three years.    The original order will now be completed in two years, and the additional 60 are due in 2020, CN spokesman Patrick Waldron said. Those locomotives will be used for energy transport, along with intermodal, coal and agricultural products.    Western Canada’s crude inventories reached 36.3 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 31, a record level since Genscape began monitoring in 2010 as oil production expands faster than transport capacity, analyst Dylan White said.

2018-09-07,"(Adds rig count in the Permian basin) By Scott DiSavino Sept 7 (Reuters) - U.S. energy companies cut oil rigs for the second week in three as the rig count has stagnated over the past three months along with crude prices. Drillers cut two oil rigs in the week to Sept. 7, bringing the total count down to 860, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI More than half the total oil rigs are in the Permian basin in west Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation’s biggest shale oil field. Active units there declined by two this week to 484, the least since the start of August. Two drilling companies, Halliburton Co and Schlumberger NV, both warned this week that pipeline bottlenecks in the Permian would slow oil production growth and investments in the region. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by one in August after gaining three rigs in July and losing one in June. But is higher than a year ago when 756 rigs were active as energy companies have been ramping up production in anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than previous years. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $66.47 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. This week, U.S. crude prices were on track to decline almost 4 percent to $67.41 per barrel on a build in refined fuel inventories, a strong dollar, weak equity markets and Tropical Storm Gordon’s smaller-than-expected impact on U.S. Gulf Coast oil production. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading over $67 for the balance of 2018 and near $65.50 for calendar 2019 . In anticipation of higher prices in 2018 than 2017, U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.2 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, last week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,048 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would only have to add a handful of rigs during the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. So far this year, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,016. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-09-07,"(Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Friday an international tribunal ruled in its favor in an environmental dispute with Ecuador, finding the South American nation had violated its obligations under international treaties. The tribunal unanimously held that a $9.5 billion pollution  judgment by Ecuador’s Supreme Court against Chevron “was procured through fraud, bribery and corruption and was based on claims that had been already settled and released by the Republic of Ecuador years earlier.” The decision adds to several court victories that Chevron has won against the plaintiffs and its legal team in the 2011 case. Texaco, which Chevron acquired in 2001, was released from liability through a settlement with Ecuador years earlier, the tribunal found.   Ecuador plans to appeal the tribunal’s ruling, challenging the decision in part on its findings of judicial fraud in the case, Inigo Salvador, Ecuador’s attorney general, said at a news conference on Friday.   “It worries us that the tribunal is asking a country to lift a sentence of one of its courts that was issued as part of a dispute between private parties,” said Salvador.  The tribunal, administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, will next conduct a trial to determine the damages suffered by Chevron, a process that could take months.  Chevron estimated its damages and legal costs would run “hundreds of millions of dollars,” said spokesman Sean Comey.  “Ecuador had multiple opportunities to put an end to this liability,” said Comey, who said a failure to now accept the decision “will continue to accrue further damages.”  American lawyer Steven Donziger won an $18 billion judgment in 2011, representing villagers who blamed environmental contamination between 1964 and 1992 on Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.  The award was later reduced to $9.5 billion and in July Donziger was suspended from practicing law in New York by a state appeals court. Chevron, which has said it never had any assets in Ecuador, has successfully fought efforts to enforce the judgment in Argentina, Brazil, Canada and the United States.

The exploration of the Black Sea Neptun block is a joint venture between OMV’s Romanian subsidiary Petrom and U.S. major ExxonMobil and includes the first deep-water exploration well in Romanian waters. In 2012, the firms said they had discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas reserves at the ExxonMobil operated Domino-1 well, located around 170 km offshore. OMV needs reliable framework conditions regarding taxes and royalties before it can give the final nod on such a major investment, Johann Pleininger told Reuters in an interview. “It would be a billion euro investment.” OMV also needs the guarantee that it can export surplus gas, he said. Unlike other countries in the region, Romania is almost entirely energy independent. The state imports less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, largely by state producer Romgaz and Petrom. “I trust the Romanian government to make a sensible proposal that will be accepted by industry,” he said, adding he expected a decision in the autumn. The investment decision could follow “either this year or in the first quarter next year,” he said. OMV owns a 51 stake in OMV Petrom and the Romanian state holds 20.6 percent.

2018-09-07,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Rescue workers with dogs searched for survivors on Friday in debris-strewn landslides caused by an earthquake in Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido, as electricity was restored to just over half of households. Public broadcaster NHK put the death toll at 12, with five people unresponsive. Earlier, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 16 had died, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later clarified in updated numbers that nine had been confirmed dead and nine others were in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, a term typically used before death is confirmed. Another 24 were still missing after Thursday’s pre-dawn magnitude-6.7 quake, the latest deadly natural disaster to hit Japan over the past two months, coming after typhoons, floods and a record-breaking heat wave. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd)     Nearly 5,000 Hokkaido residents spent the night in evacuation centers where food was distributed in the morning. “It was an anxious night with several aftershocks, but we took encouragement from being together and now we’re grateful for some food,” one woman told public broadcaster NHK.         Some 22,000 rescue workers had worked through the night to search for survivors, Abe told an emergency meeting on Friday. With rain forecast for Friday afternoon and Saturday, he urged people to be careful about loose soil that could cause unstable houses to collapse or further landslides. “We will devote all our energy to saving lives,” Abe said. As of Friday afternoon, Hokkaido Electric Power Co had restored power to 1.54 million of the island’s 2.95 million households. The utility aimed to raise that number to 2.4 million, or over 80 percent, by the end of Friday, industry minister Hiroshige Seko said. Flights resumed from midday at Hokkaido’s main airport, New Chitose. The island, about the size of Austria and with 5.3 million people, is a popular tourist destination known for its mountains, lakes, rolling farmland and seafood. Soldiers in fatigues and orange-clad rescue workers searched for survivors, picking through debris on huge mounds of earth near the epicenter in Atsuma in southern Hokkaido. Aerial footage showed rescuers with dogs walking through the destruction. All the missing people are from the Atsuma area, where dozens of landslides wrecked homes and other structures and left starkly barren hillsides.  “I just hope they can find him quickly,” one unidentified man told NHK as he watched the search for his missing neighbor. The quake damaged the big Tomato-Atsuma plant, which normally supplies half of Hokkaido’s power and is located near the epicenter, forcing it to automatically shut down. That caused such instability in the grid that it tripped all other power stations on the island, causing a full blackout. Hokkaido Electric was bringing other smaller plants back on line and also receiving some power transferred through undersea cables from the main island of Honshu.     Kansai International Airport in western Japan has been shut since Typhoon Jebi ripped through Osaka on Tuesday, although some domestic flights operated by Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc’s low-cost carrier Peach Aviation resumed on Friday, the carriers said. JR Hokkaido planned to resume bullet train operations from midday. It was also trying to resume other train services on Friday afternoon, a spokesman said. Manufacturers were still affected by power outages. Toyota Motor Corp’s Tomakomai factory, which makes transmissions and other parts, said operations remained suspended indefinitely until power was restored, a spokesman said. Toppan Printing Co Ltd’s operations at a plant in Chitose, which makes food packages, would remain suspended until it regained power, a spokesman said. The quake prompted Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to cancel two joint military exercises in Hokkaido, including the first-ever drill with Australian fighter jets, and a training exercise with the U.S. Marine Corps. A soccer friendly between Japan and Chile scheduled for Friday in Hokkaido’s main city of Sapporo was also called off.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent at 7,310 points by 0808 GMT. That was its lowest level since mid-April and translates to a 4.9 percent decline this year. “Concerns over emerging markets and another U.S.-China tariff clash are pushing traders towards risk-off sentiment into the weekend,” analysts at Accendo Markets said in a note. Caution was also palpable ahead of the publication of U.S. non-farm payroll data, one of the most-watched economic indicators worldwide. Shares in British Airways’ parent International Airlines Group fell 2.7 percent after the UK flag carrier reported the theft of financial and personal data of potentially hundreds of thousands of customers. Among mid-caps, British pub operator Greene King surged 11 percent after reporting a boost in sales thanks to exceptionally warm weather and the soccer World Cup. The company, which owns ale brands such as Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale, said it sold 3.7 million pints of beer during England’s seven World Cup matches. Shares in Ashmore rose 2 percent after the emerging markets asset manager published full-year results. UK-focused oil company EnQuest fell more than 12 percent after announcing plans for a rights issue to finance acquisition of an oilfield from BP. Online retail trading platform Plus500 lost about 4 percent to 15.44 pounds after Playtech said it has sold its entire 10 percent shareholding for about 176 million pounds ($227.6 million), equating to 15.50 pence per share.

2018-09-07,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake that rattled the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido doubled to at least 16, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday, with more than half the island’s 5.3 million residents still without power. The 6.7-magnitude quake, which hit before dawn on Thursday, triggered landslides that buried houses and paralysed Hokkaido with widespread power and transport cuts. The death toll had been put at eight overnight but NHK cited Abe in reporting the new total soon after he held an emergency meeting early on Friday. Another 26 people were missing, disaster management authorities said. The island, a tourist destination about the size of Austria known for its mountains, lakes and seafood, lost all power after the quake when Hokkaido Electric Power Co shut its fossil fuel-fired power plants as a precaution. The utility had restored power to about 1.31 million of 2.95 million customers by early Friday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. It could take at least a week to restore power fully, Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko has said. The quake was the second disaster to hit Japan this week alone after a summer during which the country has been battered by deadly typhoons, flooding and a record heat wave. Kansai International Airport has been shut since Typhoon Jebi ripped through Osaka on Tuesday, although some domestic flights operated by Japan Airlines (JAL) and ANA’s low-cost carrier Peach Aviation resumed on Friday, the carriers said. At Hokkaido’s main airport, New Chitose, JAL was preparing to restart some flights from around 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Friday, a spokesman said. ANA cancelled all morning flights but would resume operations as normal in the afternoon, a spokesman said. JR Hokkaido planned to resume bullet train operations from midday. It was also trying to resume other train services on Friday afternoon, a spokesman said. However, manufacturers were still being affected by power outages. Toyota Motor Corp’s Tomakomai factory, which makes transmissions and other parts, said operations remained suspended indefinitely until power was restored, a spokesman said. Toppan Printing’s operations at a plant in Chitose, which makes food packages, would remain suspended until it regained power, a spokesman said. Cultural events were also affected, with a soccer friendly between Japan and Chile scheduled for Friday in Sapporo called off. Reporting by Chris Gallagher, Kaori Kaneko, Makiko Yamazaki

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $67.90 per barrel at 0056 GMT, up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures climbed 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $76.62 a barrel. “Oil inventory data released last night showed a larger-than-expected draw in crude inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories fell by 4.3 million barrels to 401.49 million barrels C-STK-T-EIA in the week to Aug. 31, the lowest since February 2015, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed on Thursday. Despite that, analysts said prices were curbed by a rise in refined product stocks and a relatively weak U.S. peak fuel consumption season this summer. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 3.1 million barrels, the EIA data showed. “Gasoline and distillates inventories both rose substantially. The U.S. summer driving season has proven to be a lacklustre one in terms of gasoline demand,” said O’Loughlin. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA last week remained at a record 11 million barrels per day (bpd), a level it has largely been at since July. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-09-07,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Pacific island nations declared climate change to be their “single greatest threat”, urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate, just as Western powers seek to check China’s rising influence in the region.      Australia, which has backed away from its own commitment to Paris without exiting the pact, was among the 18 nations of the Pacific Islands Forum that made the call at a meeting of leaders on the tiny island state of Nauru. “Climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of Pacific people,” the leaders said in a communique, asking the United States to return to the climate pact. Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga told a news conference: “The aspiration is for the U.S. to be in the Paris Agreement again because we cannot have comprehensive robust emission reduction unless the biggest emitter of greenhouse gas is there in the process, we cannot leave the U.S. out.” However, participants said one country would not agree to even stronger language in the communique and Sopoaga made clear which it was, although he stopped short of naming it. “The name of the qualifier (started with) alphabetical A, capital A,” Sopoaga told Wednesday’s news conference, held after the leaders’ meeting. No forum member’s name, apart from Australia’s, begins with the letter ‘A’. Australia’s representative at the meeting, Foreign Minister Marise Payne, declined to answer questions about Sopoaga’s comments. “It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders’ Retreat,” Payne said in an emailed statement. “Australia understands the importance that Pacific Countries place on effective global action to combat climate change,” she said. The demand for action over the low-lying islands of the Pacific, seen as the front line of global climate change, comes as rising sea levels and other climate-related crises force residents to move to higher ground. Against this backdrop, China’s vocal support for tackling global warming aids its drive to win allies and influence in the strategically significant and resource-rich area. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and put the United States at a disadvantage. Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world’s largest coal exporters which has also sought to push back against China’s influence in the Pacific. Wednesday’s communique endorsed “with qualification” a separate, stronger statement from seven small Pacific Island states seeking “urgent resolution” of Paris rules to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius.     “If that cap is not reached, there are going to be serious problems on islands like Tuvalu,” Sopoaga said, citing an estimate of island submergence by 2030 from the U.S. Geological Survey. “2030 is not far away, our grandchildren would still be growing up and the islands of Tuvalu and Kiribati and, maybe, part of Nauru would be submerged,” he said.

2018-09-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - An annual global climate change meeting due to be held in Poland in December will start a day earlier than planned to allow more work to be done, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) said. Government ministers will try to agree on rules for implementing the Paris agreement, which was adopted by almost 200 nations in 2015 and is due to come into force in 2020. “It was agreed that an early opening of the session will provide an opportunity to make the best use of the time available to finalise negotiations on the work programme under the Paris Agreement,” the UNFCCC, which steers the climate talks, said in a statement. The talks, attended by around 190 countries, will take place in Katowice in southern Poland from Dec. 2 to Dec. 14, instead of Dec. 3-14, the UNFCCC said. The Paris agreement sets a goal of limiting warming to “well below” a rise of 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times while “pursuing efforts” for the tougher goal of 1.5 degrees C. During preliminary talks in Thailand this week, Fiji’s Prime Minister Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said governments were unprepared for the Poland meeting later this year, and   Patricia Espinosa, head of the UNFCCC, told Reuters that governments were not on track to meet the 2 degree temperature limit goal.

2018-09-07,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The project manager of a $4 billion Ethiopian dam who was found dead in his vehicle in Addis Ababa on July 26 committed suicide, police said on Friday. Simegnew Bekele was the public face of the Grand Renaissance Dam project on the River Nile - the centrepiece of Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter. Scores of people took to the streets following his death, both in his home city in Ethiopia’s north and in the capital Addis Ababa, where he was found with a bullet wound below his right ear, sparking allegations that he might have been murdered. On Friday, police ruled out foul play. “His death was not the result of a murder. The investigation concludes that it was suicide,” the head of Ethiopia’s Federal Police Commission, Zeinu Jemal, told reporters. Forensic examinations matched gunshot residue to a gun he had owned for a decade, he added.  Zeinu said the investigation had shown that the victim had been under pressure from delays in the construction of the dam, and that conversations with his secretary an hour before his death, and with his children the evening before, “seemed like farewell statements”. Ethiopia has been pushing on with the project in the face of opposition from Egypt, which fears the dam will affect the flow of the Nile, its main source of water. In June, the leaders of Ethiopia and Egypt vowed to iron out their differences peacefully. The government has only acknowledged recently that the dam, begun in 2011 and originally expected to be completed this year, might take another 10 years to finish. Last month, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said the government had terminated the contract of the state-run Metals and Engineering Corporation (METEC), the contractor for the project’s electromechanical and hydraulic steel structure divisions. Italy’s Salini Impregilo  remains the main contractor building the dam, which is designed to churn out 6,000 megawatts (MW) of power on completion. Zeinu said the preliminary indications were that Simegnew’s suicide was linked not only to the delays but also to the extra costs they were incurring for the government: “All this added up to pile pressure on engineer Simegnew.” Reporting by Aaron Maasho; Editing by Ingrid Melander and Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-dam/update-1-manager-of-ethiopias-4-bln-nile-dam-project-committed-suicide-police-idUKL5N1VT2FR,07 Sep 2018,"* Police say he was ""under pressure"" due to delays in

2018-09-07,"(Adds names of some bidders, minister quotes) OSLO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - A total of 38 oil companies have submitted bids for exploration acreage offshore Norway in a so-called predefined areas (APA) licensing round, the country’s energy ministry said on Friday. Bidders include oil majors Shell, ConocoPhillips and Total, as well as Norway’s Equinor and Aker BP, Sweden’s Lundin and Italy’s Eni. The total number of bidders was almost as high as the record 39 in the previous APA round last year. When announcing the round in May, the government expanded the pre-defined areas near existing discoveries by a total of 103 blocks in the Norwegian and the Barents Seas. Norway’s right-wing government wants oil companies to explore more on the Norwegian continental shelf, especially in the Arctic Barents Sea, which is estimated to hold more than half of undiscovered resources on the shelf. “The oil companies showing such interest in exploration on the Norwegian continental shelf is important for future value creation, jobs and government revenues from Norway’s largest and most important industry,” Norway’s Oil and Energy Minister Kjell-Boerge Freiberg said. About 170,000 people are directly or indirectly involved in the petroleum industry in the Nordic country of 5.3 million, the ministry said. Environmentalists and some opposition politicians, however, have called on the Norwegian government to stop exploring for new oil and gas resources to reduce global carbon emissions. The ministry plans to award licences in early 2019, it added.

2018-09-07,"* Asia shares ex-Japan lowest since July last year * Tech sector hit by drop in chip stocks, social media * Fears new U.S. tariffs on China could come at any time * Aussie dollar drops to lowest in over 2 years * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2C2BSt0 By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World shares limped toward their worst week in almost six months on Friday, with Asia carving out a 14-month trough as investors braced for a new salvo of Sino-U.S. tariffs. A slump in U.S. chip stocks and reports that President Donald Trump had also weighed a trade scrap with Japan dragged on tech-heavy Asia overnight, while Europe’s main bourses faded after an initial attempt push higher. A flat pan-European STOXX 600 was set to end the week with a 2.6 percent loss, its worst weekly performance since the end of March. Emerging market stocks have lost even more, some 3.2 percent. U.S stock index futures are set to open 0.2 percent lower. Nerves were set to be frayed further after the public comment period for proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports passed at 0400 GMT. The tariffs could now go into effect at any moment, although there was no clear timetable. China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. Australia’s dollar, often used in as play on China’s fortunes due to its huge metals exports there, hit a 2-1/2 year low early on it Europe. “It is all linked to the trade comment period expiring and now we are wondering what the implementation plan is going to be and how China is going to respond,” Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy said. “The Aussie dollar of course is a proxy within G10 for that,” he added, also pointing to shares in mining giants such as BHP trading down near key technical levels. There were some crumbs of comfort, however, for traders. Battered emerging market shares were on course to snap a 7-day losing streak. China had closed higher overnight despite the tariff feud and Turkey’s lira and South Africa’s rand and Argentina’s peso all looked relatively calm early on. Chinese blue chips had managed their 0.5 percent bounce as beaten-down health care stocks found buyers after taking a savaging in recent months amid vaccine scandals. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had still lost 0.3 percent though, having earlier reached its lowest since mid-July last year. The Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, undermined by a rising yen and reports U.S. President Donald Trump could be contemplating taking on Japan over trade. Other emerging markets were trying to steady after a punishing week, with Indonesia and the Philippines still badly scarred by fears of capital flight following crises in Argentina and Turkey and the rumbling U.S.-China trade strains. “It seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The tech sector was also very weak overnight, with a slide in Micron of almost 10 percent and further weakness in the Chinese Internet ADRs.” Eyes were also turning to the U.S. payrolls report for August which is expected to show a robust rise of 191,000, in part as July was temporarily depressed by the closure of the Toys R Us chain that month. Still, analysts at NatWest Markets cautioned that: “Despite employment indicators pointing to another strong report, it is worth noting that there is a tendency for August payrolls to initially disappoint and then be revised up noticeably later.” Just as important will be figures on U.S. wages where a rise above the 0.2 percent forecasted would likely boost the dollar and pressure Treasury prices. The dollar could do with the lift, having lost out to the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc. It was changing hands at 110.70 yen after falling 0.7 percent on Thursday, the sharpest one-day loss in seven weeks. Part of the decline came after a Wall Street Journal columnist reported Trump had mused about starting a trade fight with Japan. The dollar also hit a four-month low on the franc around $0.9645. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index nudged lower to 94.939 and was heading for a fourth weekly drop. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1645, while sterling idled at $1.2939 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. In commodity markets, the dip in the dollar left gold a sliver higher at $1,200.67 an ounce. Crude oil was slightly up too after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday when U.S. data showed gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly last week. Brent was 20 cents higher at $76.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude edged up 23 cents to $67.99. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney

2018-09-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment-grade corporate bonds suffered their worst outflows since December 2016 in the week leading up to Wednesday, with dedicated funds shedding $3.1 billion, data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch showed on Friday.  High-yield and emerging-market bond funds also saw outflows of $800 million and $600 million respectively, but investment grade bore the brunt of selling, according to the BAML data which is based on analysis of numbers from the EPFR Global flow tracker. The bank’s analysts described the current situation on global markets as “1998 redux”, referring to the Asian and Russian financial crises that year. “Fed tightening, U.S. decoupling, flattening yield curve, collapsing emerging markets, underperforming levered quant strategies ... all echo 1998,” they said. BAML particularly warned clients to watch credit spreads in “excessively indebted” Europe, China, emerging markets and U.S. companies in the “BBB” ratings category. The latter sector has $4.93 trillion of debt outstanding compared with $1.08 trillion in 2008, according to BAML.  Overall, bond funds in the past week shed $1.9 billion.  Outflows were more muted in equities, with just $200 million exiting stocks globally. A massive $4.7 billion flowed into exchange-traded funds, offsetting losses from mutual funds.  There was some good news for European equities, which recorded a small $200 million inflow, their first gain in 26 weeks.  On emerging markets, the scene of steep falls in recent weeks, BAML said it saw no evidence of capitulation, estimating that less than 20 percent of the inflows from 2016 to 2018 had been redeemed so far. Emerging-market equity funds’ losses were limited to $200 million; emerging-market debt funds lost $600 million.

2018-09-07,"TOKYO (Reuters) - After an earthquake knocked out power to 5.3 million people this week, Hokkaido Electric expects to restore service to most of them by the end of Friday, but experts say the island-wide outage highlights fundamental flaws in Japan’s power grid.  Graphic:  Earthquake in Hokkaido - tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd The blackout that hit Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido after early Thursday’s quake was the nation’s worst in seven years, but it would have been less extensive if the utility was not so reliant on one large power station, had spread its plants more widely, and could transfer power more easily from other areas, specialists and energy executives said.  In the aftermath of Japan’s March 2011 disaster, when an earthquake and tsunami caused nuclear meltdowns and widespread power outages, the government mandated a boost in renewable energy supplies, opened up a roughly $70 billion retail electricity market to competition and created a grid oversight company to address these issues. But Hokkaido and other Japanese utilities have been slow to beef up networks and make them more resilient in a country that regularly experiences natural disasters, the specialists said.  “The crisis is primarily the result of over-reliance on a large coal plant in a centralized generation paradigm,” said Andrew DeWit, a professor of energy policy at Rikkyo University in Tokyo.  “That is odd and dangerous, considering the multiplicity of hazards Japan confronts and has experienced in recent years.”  While not as many people were affected by this week’s outage as after the March 2011 quake and tsunami, it was the first time a regional utility in Japan lost its full network, according to the country’s Federation of Electric Power Companies.  Hokkaido Electric Power had restored power to a little more than half of the island’s 2.95 million households by Friday afternoon after receiving supplies from nearby Honshu and rebooting some of its generating units.  The utility’s Tomato-Atsuma coal station, which normally supplies about half the island’s electricity, remained shut after sustaining damage in the quake. It may take a week to restore power fully to Hokkaido.  Hokkaido Electric aims to have power restored to about 80 percent of the island’s households by the end of Friday, according to Japan industry minister Hiroshige Seko.  The abrupt halt in supplies from Tomato-Atsuma, which has three coal-fired generators, caused such a huge imbalance in supply and demand that other power plants on Hokkaido were tripped and shut down.  “Adjusting supply and demand is very difficult. Hokkaido’s power grid is small and the share of Tomato-Atsuma is large, so it must have been much a more difficult a situation than after the big earthquake that struck eastern Japan,” said Tsutomu Oyama, professor of electrical engineering at Yokohama National University.  With its only nuclear plant shut pending approval to restart under new safety guidelines imposed since the Fukushima meltdowns of 2011, Hokkaido Electric has been investing in a new gas-fired station and expanding the capacity of its connection to Honshu. Cost cuts have slowed the process.  It plans to start operations of the gas-fired unit next month and complete a 50 percent expansion in capacity on the Hokkaido-Honshu connection by March next year, a Hokkaido Electric spokesman told Reuters. Those transmission lines currently can supply only about 600 megawatts of power.  Asked if there were lessons from 2011 that could have been applied to help mitigate the current situation, the spokesman said the utility had conducted drills for scenarios including the shutdown of all three units at Tomato-Atsuma but did not provide details.  “It is difficult to answer this question because the 2011 quake and yesterday’s quake are different situations,” he said.

2018-09-07,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov called on Russian businesses on Friday to invest at home instead of abroad and said perceptions the government was seeking to “trick them” out of their profits were false.  Siluanov’s comments came a day after he met business representative Alexander Shokhin and other heads of companies to discuss ways of supporting Russian business. “The relatively stable rouble has allowed business leaders to receive good earnings. That’s why we say: friends, please send these earnings in the direction of Russia’s economy,” Siluanov said on Friday. “Don’t guzzle them away. Don’t invest them in whatever foreign assets. Spend them here.” The minister said that he and Shokhin, a former deputy prime minister who now heads the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, had discussed policies to create favorable conditions for business.  “For some reason, (business leaders) think we are trying to confiscate, to trick them, to take steps to take away their additional profits,” Siluanov said. “That’s not the case at all. Quite the opposite.” Russian ministers and business leaders are in talks following a proposal by Kremlin aide Andrei Belousov to raise 500 billion rubles ($7.24 billion) a year for the stretched state budget from metals and mining firms. His initial suggestion of a windfall tax on the firms, which the government says have profited from a weak rouble and strong commodity prices, triggered a sell-off in metal and mining shares and was opposed by Siluanov. In late August Belousov  proposed instead that firms invest in social projects in Russia. Russia needs extra budget revenue to meet economic goals set out by Putin when he began a new six-year term in the Kremlin in May. The government has already announced plans to raise value-added tax from 2019 and increase the retirement age. Moscow has meanwhile adopted or proposed a number of measures to make it easier for Russian businesses to move their money home, including scrapping penalties on funds repatriated from abroad.

2018-09-07,"LONDON (Reuters) - UK-focused oil company EnQuest (ENQ.L) is offering new discounted shares to buy out the Magnus oilfield and has borrowed money against 15 percent of its Kraken field as it seeks to reduce its debt pile of almost $2 billion.     EnQuest, which owns a quarter of Magnus, launched a $138 million rights issue on Friday to help it to buy the rest of the 12,000 barrel per day (bpd) North Sea field from BP (BP.L), sending its share price tumbling by more than 13 percent. If successful, the deal will bring 60 million barrels of reserves - or an additional 30 percent - to EnQuest’s portfolio and also increase its stakes in the Sullom Voe oil terminal, Ninian pipeline system and Northern Leg Gas pipeline, the company said. The rights issue announcement came as EnQuest, which has a market value of about $590 million, reported a close to 50 percent jump in first-half post-tax profit to $43 million thanks to its Kraken field boosting overall output. EnQuest also said it had agreed to ringfence 15 percent of Kraken for Oz (Och-Ziff) Management in exchange for $175 million, to be paid back within five years. First-half production of 31,000 bpd at Kraken was slightly below expectations but it has since picked up to as much as 36,000 bpd. The company had been seeking to sell a 20 percent stake. The Kraken money will help EnQuest to pay back nearly $200 million of debt due next month, Chief Executive Officer Amjad Bseisu told Reuters. EnQuest is proposing a three-for-seven rights issue at 0.21 pounds ($0.2717) per new ordinary share, equating to a 45.6 percent discount to Thursday’s closing price. Bseisu said shareholders, who can vote on the cash call on Oct. 1, have been supportive of the move. The company’s shares slid more than 13 percent in early trade to their lowest since July. At 1012 GMT the shares were down 12.7 percent at 33.7 pence, against a 0.7 percent fall for the sector index .SXEP. The BP deal will cost about $300 million, with $100 million to be paid in cash from the rights issue. The rest will be funded by a loan from BP that will be repaid from the net cash flow from the 75 percent stake over five years. Once the loan repaid, EnQuest will pay BP half of the cash flow from the 75 percent stake up to a cap of $600 million. Based on the initial acquisition of its 25 percent stake last year, EnQuest has the right to buy the stake from BP by Jan. 15 next year, with the deal backdated to Jan. 1 2017. The rights issue wil be underwritten by JP Morgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

2018-09-07,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen faces a trial next week as investors seek 9.2 billion euros ($10.7 billion) in compensation arguing that the carmaker should have informed shareholders about a diesel pollution scandal before regulators did in September 2015. The lawsuit bundles 1,670 claims brought mainly by VW’s institutional shareholders who have accused the carmaker of failing to inform investors about the scope of a scandal which has cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines. Had VW warned investors about the size of the scandal before the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a “notice of violation” on Sept. 18 2015 then institutional investors may have avoided losses on their shareholdings, plaintiffs said.  VW shares lost up to 37 percent of their value in the days after authorities exposed illegal levels of pollution emitted from VW diesel cars.   Volkswagen has admitted systematic emissions cheating but denies wrongdoing in matters of regulatory disclosure. Presiding Judge Christian Jaede at the Braunschweig higher regional court will make opening remarks at the trial on Monday.  VW insists that the U.S. EPA’s issuance of the notice of violation was not in keeping with how U.S. authorities had handled similar cases involving other carmakers. Because other carmakers had reached a settlement for emissions cheating without an EPA notice of violation, and because VW was in talks about reaching a settlement, VW’s board did not see the need to inform investors, the carmaker said in a filing with the Braunschweig court.  VW had already made substantial provisions in late 2015 to cover other vehicle recalls, and because previous fines by U.S. authorities for similar violations were below $200 million, there was no need to issue an ad-hoc disclosure notice under German law, the carmaker said in the filing. Volkswagen says board members at the time, including Volkswagen’s current chief executive Herbert Diess and Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch therefore did not violate disclosure rules, according to the VW defense document filed with the court. “Neither the management board nor individual board members caused or were involved with the compliance violation in the United States,” VW’s court filing said.  However, plaintiffs, including lawyer Andreas Tilp from law firm TILP and fund management firm Deka, argue that managers below management board level, including divisional heads, knew about deliberate and systematic emissions cheating.  The company as such was therefore aware of severe criminal activity and investors should therefore have been warned earlier, the plaintiffs said.

2018-09-07,"NAIROBI, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Kenya’s economic growth momentum for this year could be snuffed out if a widely unpopular 16 percent Value Added Tax on fuel is maintained, the country’s chamber of commerce said on Friday, pointing at higher prices of goods and transport. The tax, which came into force on Sept. 1, is part of a government bid to boost revenue collection in order to narrow its fiscal deficit and secure an extension of a standby credit facility from the International Monetary Fund. The High Court on Thursday ordered a temporary suspension of the tax, but prices at petrol stations visited by Reuters on Friday had not come back down. “We are asking the government to re-think its options for financing its development and recurrent expenditure instead of overtaxing various products that already bear large tax burdens,” the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KNCCI) said in a statement. The Treasury could not immediately be reached for comment. The finance ministry expects economic growth to rebound to 5.8 percent this year after drought, jitters over a presidential election and sluggish private sector credit growth cut last year’s growth to 4.9 percent. “The recent resurgence of the economy will be negatively impacted by this move and this will reverse any growth we have seen in the past year,” KNCCI said. The new VAT on fuel sent the retail price of petrol up by 12 percent per litre. Transport operators have also raised their charges and some petrol dealers have gone on strike to protest against the new tax, causing fuel shortages. The tax was originally included in a law passed in 2013, but was postponed several times, amid protests about its impact. The revenue authority introduced the tax on Saturday but President Uhuru Kenyatta could still reverse it by signing a bill postponing it again. Justin Muturi, the speaker of the national assembly, told Reuters on Friday the legislature was consulting with the finance ministry to find a way forward on the tax. Kenyan businesses and ordinary people routinely complain of a heavy tax burden. The chamber of commerce said the government could widen the tax base and increase the rate of tax compliance to 50 percent from the current 17 percent. It also urged the government to cut expenditure, reduce wastage of public funds and deal with corruption, which some past studies have found account for the loss of up to a third of the government’s annual budget.

2018-09-07,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German exports and industrial output both fell unexpectedly in July, hit by U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies and bottlenecks in the auto sector caused by new environmental standards. The Federal Statistics Office said on Friday that seasonally adjusted exports fell by 0.9 percent on the month, while imports surged by 2.8 percent - the strongest rise in almost four years and a record volume of 94.5 billion euros (85.1 billion pounds). A Reuters poll had pointed to a rise of 0.2 percent in both.  Separate data from the Economy Ministry showed industrial output dropped by 1.1 percent, confounding the Reuters forecast for a 0.2 percent rise. “The summer dip, in our view, seems to be driven by uncertainty stemming from global trade tensions and once again the summer vacation period,” said ING economist Carsten Brzeski. Trump has triggered trade disputes with China, Europe and many others regions by imposing steep tariffs on a broad range of products in his pledge to protect American jobs against what he calls unfair trade practices. Last month, Salzgitter (SZGG.DE), Germany’s No.2 steelmaker, warned of a rise in imports into the European Union. It stuck by its financial guidance for the current year despite a strong first half, citing “uncertainty from trade policies and their possible impact”. The Economy Ministry said German industrial output would likely regain momentum soon after a muted start to the third quarter, which was depressed by “temporary bottlenecks in passenger car registrations under the new driving cycle”. Those bottlenecks stem from a new pollution standard - the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) - for which some German car models have not yet gained regulatory clearance. “As bad as the latest German data may be, it is a special effect and not a fundamental issue,” UniCredit economist Andreas Rees wrote in a research note. “To be sure, WLTP creates uncertainties to our short-term growth forecasts in the second half of 2018. However, it is not a persistent pattern and a rebound in (auto) production will follow sooner or later,” he added. Brzeski agreed: “This week’s disappointing industrial data are no need to panic.” On Thursday, industrial orders fell by 0.9 percent in July after a revised plunge of 3.9 percent in the previous month. “The strongest assets of the German economy currently are the weak euro and strong domestic demand on the back of low interest rates, record high employment and wage increases,” Brzeski added. Germany’s domestic economy is in robust form. The Ifo economic institute said on Thursday it had raised its 2018 growth forecast for the German economy to 1.9 percent from 1.8 percent previously, citing a better-than-expected performance in the first half of the year.

2018-09-07,"* Asia shares ex-Japan lowest since July last year * Tech sector hit by drop in chip stocks, social media * Fears new U.S. tariffs on China could come at any time * Aussie dollar drops to lowest in over 2 years * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2C2BSt0 By Marc Jones LONDON, Sept 7 (Reuters) - World shares limped toward their worst week in almost six months on Friday, with Asia carving out a 14-month trough as investors braced for a new salvo of Sino-U.S. tariffs. A slump in U.S. chip stocks and reports that President Donald Trump had also weighed a trade scrap with Japan dragged on tech-heavy Asia overnight, while Europe’s main bourses faded after an initial attempt push higher. A flat pan-European STOXX 600 was set to end the week with a 2.3 percent loss, its worst weekly performance since the end of March. Emerging market stocks have lost even more, some 3 percent. Nerves were set to be frayed further after the public comment period for proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports passed at 0400 GMT. The tariffs could now go into effect at any moment, although there was no clear timetable. China has warned of retaliation if Washington launches any new measures. Australia’s dollar, often used in as play on China’s fortunes due to its huge metals exports there, hit a 2-1/2 year low early on it Europe. “It is all linked to the trade comment period expiring and now we are wondering what the implementation plan is going to be and how China is going to respond,” Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy said. “The Aussie dollar of course is a proxy within G10 for that,” he added, also pointing to shares in mining giants such as BHP trading down near key technical levels. There were some crumbs of comfort, however, for traders. Battered emerging market shares were on course to snap a 7-day losing streak. China had closed higher overnight despite the tariff feud and Turkey’s lira and South Africa’s rand and Argentina’s peso all looked relatively calm early on. Chinese blue chips had managed their 0.5 percent bounce as beaten-down health care stocks found buyers after taking a savaging in recent months amid vaccine scandals. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan had still lost 0.3 percent though, having earlier reached its lowest since mid-July last year. The Nikkei shed 0.8 percent, undermined by a rising yen and reports U.S. President Donald Trump could be contemplating taking on Japan over trade. Other emerging markets were trying to steady after a punishing week, with Indonesia and the Philippines still badly scarred by fears of capital flight following crises in Argentina and Turkey and the rumbling U.S.-China trade strains. “It seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The tech sector was also very weak overnight, with a slide in Micron of almost 10 percent and further weakness in the Chinese Internet ADRs.” Eyes were also turning to the U.S. payrolls report for August which is expected to show a robust rise of 191,000, in part as July was temporarily depressed by the closure of the Toys R Us chain that month. Still, analysts at NatWest Markets cautioned that: “Despite employment indicators pointing to another strong report, it is worth noting that there is a tendency for August payrolls to initially disappoint and then be revised up noticeably later.” Just as important will be figures on U.S. wages where a rise above the 0.2 percent forecasted would likely boost the dollar and pressure Treasury prices. The dollar could do with the lift, having lost out to the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc. It was changing hands at 110.70 yen after falling 0.7 percent on Thursday, the sharpest one-day loss in seven weeks. Part of the decline came after a Wall Street Journal columnist reported Trump had mused about starting a trade fight with Japan. The dollar also hit a four-month low on the franc around $0.9645. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index nudged lower to 94.939 and was heading for a fourth weekly drop. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1645, while sterling idled at $1.2939 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. In commodity markets, the dip in the dollar left gold a sliver higher at $1,200.67 an ounce. Crude oil was slightly up too after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday when U.S. data showed gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly last week. Brent was 20 cents higher at $76.69 a barrel, while U.S. crude edged up 23 cents to $67.99. Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney

2018-09-07,"* Aims to agree an exploration deal in Asia by year-end * Tunisian asset up for sale, Polarled JV sold * Internal production cost target of less than $7/boe * Planned Gazprom asset swap: solution seen by year-end By Kirsti Knolle and Alexandra Schwarz-Goerlich VIENNA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Austrian oil and gas group OMV plans to expand its exploration business with an acquisition in Southeast Asia by the end of the year, in line with its strategy to grow in low-cost markets outside Europe, its upstream chief told Reuters. OMV is betting on further growth in fossil fuels, instead of flocking to renewables like many of its rivals, forecasting a strong increase in demand for natural gas in particular because burning it emits less carbon dioxide than oil. The group, whose presence in Russia and countries such as Libya and Yemen makes it vulnerable to geopolitical tensions there, expanded in New Zealand and the United Arab Emirates earlier this year to try to balance risks. Johann Pleininger, responsible for OMV’s exploration and production business, has compiled a list of three to five companies and 10 to 15 assets “that are attractive for us” in Australia, Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia, he told Reuters in an interview. “I hope that we will be able to conclude a contract by the end of the year,” he said, without elaborating on the size of the expected deal. Of the 10 billion euros ($12 billion) set aside for acquisitions until 2025, OMV has so far spent 2 billion. Pleininger declined to comment on a Reuters report last month that OMV was interested in the Malaysian gas fields of U.S. peer Hess Corp. However, he said any deal would have to be in cooperation with a strong regional player comparable to OMV’s partnership with Gazprom in Russia and with Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) in the United Arab Emirates. Such a partner was important to secure support in another country, said the Austrian, who has been working for OMV for more than 40 years. Hess is an equal partner with state-owned energy firm Petronas in the Malaysian fields. OMV’s focus on low costs, introduced when Rainer Seele took the group’s helm three years ago, requires further asset sales, Pleininger said. The partly state-owned group recently agreed to sell its stakes in the Norwegian Polarled gas pipeline project and in the Nyhamma gas processing plant to private equity-backed CapeOmega , he told Reuters. The supervisory board and the Norwegian government still had to approve the deal. A “high-priced asset in Tunisia”, where the Austrian company has been operating since 1971, and an asset in Madagascar were also on Pleininger’s list of assets to sell. Thanks to Seele’s focus on low-cost countries such as Russia, OMV’s production costs have more than halved since 2014. To produce one barrel of oil equivalent (boe) - or the amount of energy equivalent to that found in a barrel of crude oil - cost it $7.5 in the first half of this year. There is not too much room for further improvements, according to Pleininger, but the “internal goal” was “less than $7”, which would put OMV among the best in the industry. Regarding a long planned asset swap with Gazprom, Pleininger said he hoped for a solution by the end of the year. “Our priority is still the asset swap,” he said, when asked about a Reuters report that the group might prefer to simply buy some of its partner’s Siberian assets instead of swapping them after Norway criticized the plan to give Gazprom access to assets in Norway. But he also said the non-cash deal’s significance had been different when agreed in 2016, when OMV was struggling with weakening reserves and no financial buffer. Its cash position stood at 3 billion euros at the end of June. “For us it is important to have a solution,” Pleininger said. $1 = 0.8601 euros

2018-09-07,"VIENNA, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Austria’s OMV is confident Romania will establish an acceptable framework for its Black Sea exploration project in the autumn and that it will be able to give the green light for a billion euro investment soon after, its upstream chief said. The exploration of the Black Sea Neptun block is a joint venture between OMV’s Romanian subsidiary Petrom and U.S. major ExxonMobil and includes the first deep-water exploration well in Romanian waters. In 2012, the firms said they had discovered 1.5-3 trillion cubic feet (42-84 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas reserves at the ExxonMobil operated Domino-1 well, located around 170 km offshore. OMV needs reliable framework conditions regarding taxes and royalties before it can give the final nod on such a major investment, Johann Pleininger told Reuters in an interview. “It would be a billion euro investment.” OMV also needs the guarantee that it can export surplus gas, he said. Unlike other countries in the region, Romania is almost entirely energy independent. The state imports less than 10 percent of its gas needs from Russia, with the rest produced locally, largely by state producer Romgaz and Petrom. “I trust the Romanian government to make a sensible proposal that will be accepted by industry,” he said, adding he expected a decision in the autumn. The investment decision could follow “either this year or in the first quarter next year,” he said. OMV owns a 51 stake in OMV Petrom and the Romanian state holds 20.6 percent.

2018-09-07,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Rescue workers with dogs searched for survivors on Friday in debris-strewn landslides caused by an earthquake in Japan’s northern island of Hokkaido, as electricity was restored to just over half of households. Public broadcaster NHK put the death toll at 12, with five people unresponsive. Earlier, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said 16 had died, but Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga later clarified in updated numbers that nine had been confirmed dead and nine others were in a state of cardiopulmonary arrest, a term typically used before death is confirmed. Another 24 were still missing after Thursday’s pre-dawn magnitude-6.7 quake, the latest deadly natural disaster to hit Japan over the past two months, coming after typhoons, floods and a record-breaking heat wave. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2oJz6zd)     Nearly 5,000 Hokkaido residents spent the night in evacuation centers where food was distributed in the morning. “It was an anxious night with several aftershocks, but we took encouragement from being together and now we’re grateful for some food,” one woman told public broadcaster NHK.         Some 22,000 rescue workers had worked through the night to search for survivors, Abe told an emergency meeting on Friday. With rain forecast for Friday afternoon and Saturday, he urged people to be careful about loose soil that could cause unstable houses to collapse or further landslides. “We will devote all our energy to saving lives,” Abe said. As of Friday afternoon, Hokkaido Electric Power Co had restored power to 1.54 million of the island’s 2.95 million households. The utility aimed to raise that number to 2.4 million, or over 80 percent, by the end of Friday, industry minister Hiroshige Seko said. Flights resumed from midday at Hokkaido’s main airport, New Chitose. The island, about the size of Austria and with 5.3 million people, is a popular tourist destination known for its mountains, lakes, rolling farmland and seafood. Soldiers in fatigues and orange-clad rescue workers searched for survivors, picking through debris on huge mounds of earth near the epicenter in Atsuma in southern Hokkaido. Aerial footage showed rescuers with dogs walking through the destruction. All the missing people are from the Atsuma area, where dozens of landslides wrecked homes and other structures and left starkly barren hillsides.  “I just hope they can find him quickly,” one unidentified man told NHK as he watched the search for his missing neighbor. The quake damaged the big Tomato-Atsuma plant, which normally supplies half of Hokkaido’s power and is located near the epicenter, forcing it to automatically shut down. That caused such instability in the grid that it tripped all other power stations on the island, causing a full blackout. Hokkaido Electric was bringing other smaller plants back on line and also receiving some power transferred through undersea cables from the main island of Honshu.     Kansai International Airport in western Japan has been shut since Typhoon Jebi ripped through Osaka on Tuesday, although some domestic flights operated by Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc’s low-cost carrier Peach Aviation resumed on Friday, the carriers said. JR Hokkaido planned to resume bullet train operations from midday. It was also trying to resume other train services on Friday afternoon, a spokesman said. Manufacturers were still affected by power outages. Toyota Motor Corp’s Tomakomai factory, which makes transmissions and other parts, said operations remained suspended indefinitely until power was restored, a spokesman said. Toppan Printing Co Ltd’s operations at a plant in Chitose, which makes food packages, would remain suspended until it regained power, a spokesman said. The quake prompted Japan’s Self-Defense Forces to cancel two joint military exercises in Hokkaido, including the first-ever drill with Australian fighter jets, and a training exercise with the U.S. Marine Corps. A soccer friendly between Japan and Chile scheduled for Friday in Hokkaido’s main city of Sapporo was also called off.

The FTSE 100 was down 0.1 percent at 7,310 points by 0808 GMT. That was its lowest level since mid-April and translates to a 4.9 percent decline this year. “Concerns over emerging markets and another U.S.-China tariff clash are pushing traders towards risk-off sentiment into the weekend,” analysts at Accendo Markets said in a note. Caution was also palpable ahead of the publication of U.S. non-farm payroll data, one of the most-watched economic indicators worldwide. Shares in British Airways’ parent International Airlines Group fell 2.7 percent after the UK flag carrier reported the theft of financial and personal data of potentially hundreds of thousands of customers. Among mid-caps, British pub operator Greene King surged 11 percent after reporting a boost in sales thanks to exceptionally warm weather and the soccer World Cup. The company, which owns ale brands such as Greene King IPA, Old Speckled Hen and Abbot Ale, said it sold 3.7 million pints of beer during England’s seven World Cup matches. Shares in Ashmore rose 2 percent after the emerging markets asset manager published full-year results. UK-focused oil company EnQuest fell more than 12 percent after announcing plans for a rights issue to finance acquisition of an oilfield from BP. Online retail trading platform Plus500 lost about 4 percent to 15.44 pounds after Playtech said it has sold its entire 10 percent shareholding for about 176 million pounds ($227.6 million), equating to 15.50 pence per share.

2018-09-07,"TOKYO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake that rattled the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido doubled to at least 16, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday, with more than half the island’s 5.3 million residents still without power. The 6.7-magnitude quake, which hit before dawn on Thursday, triggered landslides that buried houses and paralysed Hokkaido with widespread power and transport cuts. The death toll had been put at eight overnight but NHK cited Abe in reporting the new total soon after he held an emergency meeting early on Friday. Another 26 people were missing, disaster management authorities said. The island, a tourist destination about the size of Austria known for its mountains, lakes and seafood, lost all power after the quake when Hokkaido Electric Power Co shut its fossil fuel-fired power plants as a precaution. The utility had restored power to about 1.31 million of 2.95 million customers by early Friday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. It could take at least a week to restore power fully, Industry Minister Hiroshige Seko has said. The quake was the second disaster to hit Japan this week alone after a summer during which the country has been battered by deadly typhoons, flooding and a record heat wave. Kansai International Airport has been shut since Typhoon Jebi ripped through Osaka on Tuesday, although some domestic flights operated by Japan Airlines (JAL) and ANA’s low-cost carrier Peach Aviation resumed on Friday, the carriers said. At Hokkaido’s main airport, New Chitose, JAL was preparing to restart some flights from around 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Friday, a spokesman said.

International Brent crude futures climbed 12 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $76.62 a barrel. “Oil inventory data released last night showed a larger-than-expected draw in crude inventories,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. U.S. commercial crude oil inventories fell by 4.3 million barrels to 401.49 million barrels C-STK-T-EIA in the week to Aug. 31, the lowest since February 2015, U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data showed on Thursday. Despite that, analysts said prices were curbed by a rise in refined product stocks and a relatively weak U.S. peak fuel consumption season this summer. Gasoline stocks rose by 1.8 million barrels, while distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, climbed by 3.1 million barrels, the EIA data showed. “Gasoline and distillates inventories both rose substantially. The U.S. summer driving season has proven to be a lacklustre one in terms of gasoline demand,” said O’Loughlin. U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA last week remained at a record 11 million barrels per day (bpd), a level it has largely been at since July. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.34 percent to reach its lowest since mid-July last year. The Nikkei fell 0.9 percent, undermined by a rising yen and reports U.S. President Donald Trump could be contemplating taking on Japan over trade. Nerves were already frayed as the public comment period for proposed tariffs on an additional $200 billion worth of Chinese imports ends at 0400 GMT, and the tariffs could go into effect shortly afterward. China has warned of retaliation if Washington implements any new measures. “It seems unlikely the tariffs are not implemented as the U.S. administration believes that they are winning the trade war and will be in a stronger position to negotiate if they put more pressure on China,” JPMorgan analysts wrote in a note. “The tech sector was also very weak overnight, with a slide in Micron of almost 10 percent and further weakness in the Chinese Internet ADRs.” Wall Street saw sharp losses in chipmakers and concerns about increased regulation of social media companies. The S&P 500 lost 0.37 percent and the Nasdaq 0.91 percent, while the Dow eked out a 0.08 percent gain. Eyes were now turned to the U.S. payrolls report for August which is expected to show a robust rise of 191,000, in part as July was temporarily depressed by the closure of the Toys R Us chain that month. Still, analysts at NatWest Markets cautioned that: “Despite employment indicators pointing to another strong report, it is worth noting that there is a tendency for August payrolls to initially disappoint and then be revised up noticeably later.” Just as important will be figures on wages where a rise above the 0.2 percent forecasted would likely boost the dollar and pressure Treasury prices. The dollar could do with the lift having lost out to the safe-haven yen and Swiss franc overnight. It was changing hands at 110.43 yen after shedding 0.7 percent on Thursday, the sharpest one-day loss in seven weeks. Part of the losses came after a Wall Street Journal columnist reported Trump had mused about starting a trade fight with Japan. The dollar also hit a four-month low on the franc at $0.9646 . Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was down at 95.021 and off the week’s top of 95.737. The euro was holding steady at $1.1619, while sterling idled at $1.2921 amid ongoing uncertainty over Brexit negotiations. In commodity markets, the dip in the dollar left gold a whisker higher at $1,201.21 an ounce. Crude oil steadied after falling more than 1 percent on Thursday after U.S. data showed gasoline inventories rose unexpectedly last week. Brent was 5 cents firmer at $76.55 a barrel, while U.S. crude edged up 9 cents to $67.86.",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-markets/global-markets-asia-shares-hit-14-mth-lows-yen-advances-on-trade-jitters-idUKL3N1VS6G1,07 Sep 2018,"Asian shares slipped to a

2018-09-07,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Pacific island nations declared climate change to be their “single greatest threat”, urging Washington to return to the Paris Agreement on climate, just as Western powers seek to check China’s rising influence in the region.      Australia, which has backed away from its own commitment to Paris without exiting the pact, was among the 18 nations of the Pacific Islands Forum that made the call at a meeting of leaders on the tiny island state of Nauru. “Climate change presents the single greatest threat to the livelihood, security and well-being of Pacific people,” the leaders said in a communique, asking the United States to return to the climate pact. Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga told a news conference: “The aspiration is for the U.S. to be in the Paris Agreement again because we cannot have comprehensive robust emission reduction unless the biggest emitter of greenhouse gas is there in the process, we cannot leave the U.S. out.” However, participants said one country would not agree to even stronger language in the communique and Sopoaga made clear which it was, although he stopped short of naming it. “The name of the qualifier (started with) alphabetical A, capital A,” Sopoaga told Wednesday’s news conference, held after the leaders’ meeting. No forum member’s name, apart from Australia’s, begins with the letter ‘A’. Australia’s representative at the meeting, Foreign Minister Marise Payne, declined to answer questions about Sopoaga’s comments. “It is not appropriate to discuss the internal talks of the private Leaders’ Retreat,” Payne said in an emailed statement. “Australia understands the importance that Pacific Countries place on effective global action to combat climate change,” she said. The demand for action over the low-lying islands of the Pacific, seen as the front line of global climate change, comes as rising sea levels and other climate-related crises force residents to move to higher ground. Against this backdrop, China’s vocal support for tackling global warming aids its drive to win allies and influence in the strategically significant and resource-rich area. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change a hoax, pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement in 2017, saying it favored other countries and put the United States at a disadvantage. Climate change is domestic political dynamite in Australia, one of the world’s largest coal exporters which has also sought to push back against China’s influence in the Pacific. Wednesday’s communique endorsed “with qualification” a separate, stronger statement from seven small Pacific Island states seeking “urgent resolution” of Paris rules to cap the rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius.     “If that cap is not reached, there are going to be serious problems on islands like Tuvalu,” Sopoaga said, citing an estimate of island submergence by 2030 from the U.S. Geological Survey. “2030 is not far away, our grandchildren would still be growing up and the islands of Tuvalu and Kiribati and, maybe, part of Nauru would be submerged,” he said.
