2018-08-17,"BERLIN, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday for talks about the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that has drawn U.S. ire. Putin arrives in Germany after a stop at an Austrian vineyard to attend Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl’s wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger. Merkel warned on Friday against expecting too much from her discussions with Putin at the government’s Meseberg palace, but said the two countries needed to remain in “permanent dialogue” on the long list of problems they face. “It’s a working meeting from which no specific results are expected,” she told reporters. The two leaders last met in Sochi in May and struggled to overcome differences. But both Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Merkel’s conservative bloc, and Achim Post, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in the coalition government, were more upbeat. “We can be cautiously optimistic,” Hardt told the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspapers in an interview published on Saturday. “The Russian president has manoeuvred himself into a dead end on Syria and eastern Ukraine, and needs international partners. For that he has to move.” A senior German official told the papers: “There has been some movement,” but gave no details. Post said in a statement that he expected both Merkel and Putin to look for pragmatic solutions based on common interests. “In a world that is increasingly uncertain, we must speak particularly with difficult partners like Russia,” he said. Russia and the West remain at loggerheads over Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and the ensuing conflict between Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east and the Ukrainian army. On Syria, Germany wants Putin to finalise a lasting ceasefire there in agreement with the United States. Merkel on Friday said a four-way meeting on Syria involving Germany, Russia, Turkey and France was possible. Germany is also under strong pressure from the United States to halt work on the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The United States says it will increase Germany’s dependence on Russia for energy. Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business. Germany’s eastern European neighbours, nervous of Russian encroachment, have also raised concerns about the project. Merkel and Putin will each make statements at 1600 GMT on Saturday before the start of the talks. They do not plan to take questions.

2018-08-17,"(Reuters) - China will continue its cooperation and relations with Iran, state news agency Xinhua reported on Friday, citing a statement from Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions, is in line with the international community’s “common interest”, the Chinese diplomat said in a phone conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, according to Xinhua. “We have openly indicated that we oppose the wrong practices of unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ in international relations,” Wang Yi was quoted as saying.  Beijing has cultivated close commercial links with Tehran, especially in the energy sector. China’s ties with Tehran are open, transparent and lawful, its foreign ministry said earlier in August, after U.S. President Donald Trump said companies doing business with Iran would be barred from the United States. Earlier this year, Trump took the call to pull the United States out of the JCPOA, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK - Another steep decline in the Turkish lira on Friday pushed emerging market equities lower and kept other world markets cautious, overshadowing hopes that an upcoming U.S.-China meeting would resolve concerns over trade tariffs.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Chinese and U.S. negotiators are drawing up a road map for their trade talks next week. Both countries aim to resolve an escalating tariff war. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives, China’s Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday.   The world’s two largest economies are due to impose tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods on Aug. 23, in addition to levies that took effect on July 6. “There is still a great deal of difference between agreeing to talk and coming to an agreement,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson.  “For now it appears an escalation has become less likely, hence (Thursday’s) rebound in equity markets,” he added, referring to an overnight rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 110.59 points, or 0.43 percent, to 25,669.32, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 9.44 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,850.13 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 9.81 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,816.33. U.S. stocks climbed in afternoon trading after a Mexican economic official told reporters that trade talks between the United States and Mexico were “advancing well.”  “Any conversations we have with China to come up with a deal and any conversations we have with Mexico would be seen as a win for the U.S.” said Jeffrey Frankel, president at Stuart Frankel & Co in New York.  The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 0.09 percent.  MSCI’s All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS, which follows shares in 47 countries, rose 0.3 percent, notching its  first weekly gain in two weeks. Turkey's lira tumbled as much as 8.5 percent to 6.3 per dollar TRY=D3, having recovered ground rapidly in recent days. It was last down by about 4 percent. The currency plunged to a record low of 7.24 per dollar at the start of the week as worsening relations between Turkey and the United States added to losses driven by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy. The currency has lost a third of its value this year. The United States warned Turkey to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson, as relations between the two countries took a further turn for the worse. Memories of past emerging market crises, such as the Asian financial turmoil of 1997 and Turkey’s 2001 crisis, haunted investors this week and prompted selling across emerging market assets as a whole. That left emerging market stocks in a technical bear market, or down 20 percent from recent highs.  European banks .SX7P and copper CMCU3 also fell into bear market territory.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Friday, but declined on the week on worries that oversupply would weigh on the U.S. market while trade disputes and slowing global economic growth would dampen demand for oil.  U.S. crude declined for the seventh consecutive week, and global benchmark Brent was dropped for a third week. “One of the biggest concerns out there is that China’s demand numbers are coming down if China’s GDP growth is slowing,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 settled up 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $71.83 a barrel, after touching a high of $72.49 earlier in the session.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI)CLc1 rose 45 cents , or 0.7 percent, to $65.91, after touching a session high of $66.39.  For the week, Brent was down 1.4 percent, and U.S. crude fell 2.6 percent.  Falling prices have weighed on funds with oil exposure. Two of the world’s largest energy-focused hedge funds, Andurand Capital and BBL Commodities, suffered double-digit percentage losses in July as oil prices plunged by the most in two years, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions to the lowest in nearly two months in the week to Aug. 14, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Friday’s pull back from session highs came on mounting worries that U.S. crude inventories would post another consecutive gain, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Americas. U.S. government data this week showed a large build up in crude inventories C-OUT-T-EIA, with production C-OUT-T-EIA also increasing. [EIA/S]  “Investors remain cautious as Wednesday’s surprise gain in U.S. stockpiles remained fresh in their minds,” ANZ bank said on Friday.  The number of U.S. oil drilling rigs, an indicator of future production, was unchanged this week at 869 rigs, much higher than the 763 rigs operating a year ago, according to energy company Baker Hughes.[RIG/U]   Another major drag on prices was the darkening economic outlook on trade tensions between the United States and China, and weakening emerging market currencies that are weighing on growth and fuel consumption, traders and analysts said.  U.S. investment bank Jefferies said there was a “lack of demand” for crude oil and refined products from emerging markets, while Singapore’s DBS bank said that Chinese data showed a “steady decline” in activity and that “the economy is facing added headwinds due to rising trade tensions”. Japan’s MUFG Bank, meanwhile, said that the weakening Turkish lira will constrain further growth in gasoline and diesel demand this year. “Although emerging market contagion and China slowdown fears seem somewhat overstated, neither fundamental nor sentiment should provide support for higher commodity prices,” Julius Baer Head of Macro and Commodity Research Norbert Rücker said. Furthermore, just as demand seems to be slowing, supply looks to be rising, increasing the drag on markets.  Despite the bearish factors, analysts said prices were prevented from falling further because of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which target the financial sector from August and will include petroleum exports from November. “Iranian crude exports were still near 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in July and will likely begin to fall dramatically in August with financial sanctions taking effect. With oil export sanctions now three months out, we expect exports to fall by more than 500,000 bpd by the end of 3Q,” Jefferies said.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A co-owner of the Come By Chance oil refinery in Canada is suing his partner for about $5.8 million in a New York state court over allegations of unpaid dividends and misused investments, according to court papers filed on Friday. Neal Shear, who bought the struggling 130,000 barrel-per-day Come By Chance refinery in Newfoundland in 2014, accused Kaushik Amin, his partner in the plant, of failing to pay him a $5.45 million shareholder dividend as well as $326,000 under a separate agreement. Amin may have diverted refinery proceeds for his own personal investments, the court papers alleged. Reuters reported last month that the former oil traders were at odds over a potential sale of the refinery amid a disagreement over the sale price. Before teaming up to acquire the refinery, Shear ran Morgan Stanley’s commodities business and Amin traded commodities at Lehman Brothers and UBS. Earlier this year, their company, North Atlantic Refining Limited (NARL), paid a dividend of about $25 million to some but not all of the shareholders, Shear alleges. Shear also alleges that Amin diverted monies paid from the refinery to a consulting company called Silverpeak Partners for unrelated financial investments, according to the civil court papers. The court dispute is not related to the operation or performance of the refinery, Shear said in a phone interview on Friday. He noted the filing is a summons, and not a full civil complaint. “I hope and intend to resolve these disputes without ever needing to file a complaint,” Shear said. Amin did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The pair were once on the same side of the legal table. In 2016, oil major BP alleged that NARL violated its crude and product supply agreement by failing to maximize yields at the refinery in Come by Chance, Newfoundland. Among other things, BP alleged that NARL ran the refinery at high rates when it was not economical in order to exploit a unique clause in their contract that allowed NARL to earn a higher profit on oil refined in excess of 90,000 barrels. NARL won a partial victory in arbitration before the case was eventually settled. The case is Shear et al v Amin et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 654104/2018.

The United States and Turkey have exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs in an attempt by Trump to pressure Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan into releasing detained American pastor Andrew Brunson, who denies charges that he was involved in a coup attempt against Erdogan two years ago. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin assured President Donald Trump at a cabinet meeting that sanctions were ready to be put in place unless Brunson was freed.

2018-08-17,"SYDNEY, Aug 17 (Reuters) - An Australian court quashed an indigenous group’s bid to block Indian resource conglomerate Adani Enterprises Ltd from developing its controversial Carmichael coalmine on Friday, clearing one of the final legal hurdles to its development. The company is still securing financing for the A$4 billion ($2.9 billion) first stage of the huge mine, but the company said the verdict allows it to secure land tenure for the site. The Carmichael mine has faced years of delays amid opposition from environmental groups who argue it will contribute to global warming and damage the Great Barrier Reef, leading some banks to rule out any role in funding. It was also challenged in Australia’s Federal Court by the some members of the Wangan and Jagalingou indigenous groups, who argued the company did not properly negotiate indigenous permission for the mine because their views weren’t sought. None of their grounds of challenge had any merit, Justice John Reeves said in a written judgment he handed down in Brisbane. The project is located in the remote Galilee Basin, a 247,000 square-kilometre (95,000 square mile) expanse in the central outback that some believe has the potential to become Australia’s largest coal-producing region. Adani said in a statement it will now work with the Wangan and Jagalingou, other indigenous landowners and government authorties “take the next steps in order to finalise land tenure”. A spokesman for the Wangan and Jagalingou flagged an appeal. “Unless there’s some serious counter-advice from our legal team upon reading it in detail, the thing’s going to go to an appeal for sure,” Anthony Esposito, an adviser to the Wangan and Jagalingou, told Reuters by phone. Environmental challenges and funding also still remain as stumbling blocks. They were compounded when Australian hauler operator Aurizon Holdings Ltd in February scrapped plans for a rail line that could have served the mine. Adani had hoped to start shipping coal from Carmichael by March 2020 in the first stage of the project, which it bought amid a coal boom in 2010.

2018-08-17,"BENGHAZI, Libya/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Lengthy power outages have left tradesmen and small businesses in Libya struggling to survive in an economy already crippled by a liquidity crisis and high inflation. For several years, power cuts lasting most of the day have become common across the North African country during the hot summer months, when air conditioning drives up electricity demand. Bill payment for heavily subsidized electricity is rarely enforced, so there is little incentive to limit consumption. Plans to boost capacity at power stations have stalled due to security problems and political turmoil, meaning a shortfall of at least 1,000 MW at times of high demand. That leaves small businesses facing constant disruption. In Libya’s second city, Benghazi, café owner Ibrahim Elumami says power cuts nearly halve the rate at which he sells coffee, and have also forced him to stop offering fresh juice. “Frankly the power cuts in Benghazi have become unbearable. There are long cuts and short cuts and in both cases we take losses,” he said. “I have a generator but it’s not good, it works for four hours, then can’t keep going because of the coffee machines.”  At metal workshops in the city, owners say they reopen at night when power returns, or work by hand. Power surges that occur when the electricity is switched back on can break their machines, and industrial generators cost around 60,000 Libyan dinars ($9,000 (£7082) at black market rates).  Generator repair work is one of Libya’s few flourishing trades. The oil-dependent economy has been crippled by the conflict that developed after a 2011 uprising, as well as by the competition between rival factions and governments. Power supply is overseen by separate administrations in the east and west. The east was receiving about 60 MW from neighbouring Egypt last week, a power official said, but still faced a supply shortfall of up to 250 MW. In the capital Tripoli, in the more populous west, power outages have been lasting 7-10 hours a day, but sometimes stretch to more than 12 hours. GECOL, the state power supplier based in Tripoli, has blamed the crisis on problems including lack of funding for regular maintenance and on theft and vandalism. It frequently reports the theft of copper from power facilities and recently deployed technicians to remove illegal connections, cutting more than 500 in the first six days of the campaign in Tripoli. Militias have also manipulated the power network to ensure supplies for their neighbourhoods, officials say. On both sides of the country, living standards have declined steeply as the dinar has lost value on the parallel market, inflation has climbed to around 30 percent, and banks have run out of cash. A divided central bank and an internationally recognised government in Tripoli have failed to deliver on promised reforms, deepening resentment among citizens forced to queue at banks for hours or even days to make withdrawals. Residents also vent their anger against a largely powerless, parallel government in the east, where prices for sheep ahead of next week’s Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha have risen to record levels.  Hopes that the power supply crisis will be resolved have dimmed. “I use an electric oven, and if there’s no power it means I cannot serve my customers,” said Tripoli restaurant owner Mohamed Zighaale, who fears he may have to close. “I pay for rent, the salaries of eight employees, supplies, but at the end I find nothing to pay myself because I’m losing money.” Writing by Aidan Lewis; Editing by Hugh Lawson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/libya-economy-power/rolling-summer-blackouts-weigh-on-libyas-struggling-traders-idUKL5N1V76G3,17 Aug 2018,"Lengthy power

2018-08-17,"(Adds details) By Sudarshan Varadhan and Abinaya Vijayaraghavan NEW DELHI/BENGALURU, Aug 17 (Reuters) - India on Friday allowed import of petcoke for use as feedstock in some industries, sending shares of cement manufacturers higher. Cement companies, which account for about three-fourths of the country’s petcoke use, were impacted by petcoke-related policy flip-flops, which began with a supreme court judgment banning use of the fuel in and around capital New Delhi last year. The directorate general of foreign trade banned the use of imported petcoke as fuel, but said shipments for use as feedstock in certain industries were allowed. ""Import of Petcoke is allowed for only cement, lime kiln, calcium carbide and gasification industries, when used as the feedstock or in the manufacturing process on actual user condition,"" the directorate general of foreign trade said. (bit.ly/2MyltjZ) Shares of cement companies such as Ultratech Cement Ltd , Shree Cement Ltd, Ambuja Cements and ACC Ltd rose following the announcement. Shree Cement, one of the country’s significant users of petcoke, saw its shares rise as much as 3.6 percent to 17,898 rupees ($255.36), its highest level this month. Usage of petcoke, a dirtier alternative to coal, in the energy-hungry country has come under scrutiny due to rising pollution levels in major cities. India’s imports of petcoke have declined this year as cement companies substituted some of their petcoke with coal to avoid production delays due to pollution-related policy changes. As the world’s largest consumer of petcoke, India imports over half its annual petcoke consumption of about 27 million tonnes, mainly from the United States.

2018-08-17,"(Repeats for wider distribution.) * Key Iowa races could determine control of Congress * Rural support for Trump still strong, but waned in recent weeks * Levies on agricultural products hit Iowa farmers * Ethanol relief, sought by corn industry, in limbo By Jarrett Renshaw DES MOINES, Iowa, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Warren Bachman, a 72-year-old Iowa soybean farmer, is one of many who turned Clarke County into Donald Trump country, as the Republican president took 61 percent of the votes in 2016 in a county that went for Democrat Barack Obama four years earlier. But Bachman’s loyalty to Trump is wavering under the weight of a trade war that has disproportionately hurt farmers due to big tariffs on agricultural exports. Other farmers, meanwhile, are upset that the White House has not yet followed through on a promise to reform rules that would boost demand for corn-based ethanol, one of the state’s biggest businesses. “I still support him, but not as much,” Bachman said between bites of pork chops and baked beans at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines last week. “I am afraid we are close to seeing a repeat of the 1980s, where farmers across Iowa lost their land because they ran out of money and couldn’t get loans.” November’s congressional elections represent the first nationwide response to Trump’s aggressive trade policies, particularly in the Farm Belt, which runs roughly from Indiana to Kansas and the Dakotas, which favored Trump heavily two years ago. The administration’s move to impose numerous tariffs on imports has sparked retaliation, particularly from top agricultural buyer China, which put levies on products like hogs, corn and soybeans, hammering those markets. Soybeans are among the hardest-hit, with prices down 15 percent since May 1. The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion in soybeans, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Farmers say they are growing impatient as harvest season approaches. Trump is more popular in the Farm Belt than in the nation overall, but his support there has dipped from 59 percent approval in mid-June to 52 percent in early August, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Trump won Iowa by 10 percentage points in 2016 after Obama carried the state twice. (For a graphic on how Trump's Farm Belt approval rating has fallen with soybean and hog prices, see: (tmsnrt.rs/2w8Hyv8) ) “The anxiety is starting to escalate,” said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican locked in a tight race with Democrat Fred Hubbell. “They are willing to give him some more time, but the window is closing and they have to see some movement somewhere to alleviate the pressure.” Bachman said he is a registered Republican, but has not decided whether to vote for Reynolds in November, saying he will pull the lever for whoever will best protect the state’s agricultural industry. He said the tariffs on imported metals have increased the costs for farming equipment, but that he had saved money for a down cycle. But his wife, Linda Bachman, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said her husband is too proud to acknowledge the burden on their family, including their son, who is just starting out as a farmer. “He’s stressed out. I see it every day, and we are worried about our son,” she said. Democrats are hoping to pick up two congressional seats in Iowa as part of their quest to win the U.S. House of Representatives; they need to win a net 23 seats to regain control of the 435-seat chamber. “The president is using Iowa farmers and its families as poker chips in a trade war,” said Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old Democrat running against Republican incumbent Rod Blum in a race for a House seat in eastern Iowa that forecasters rate a toss-up. Blum, 63, has been a staunch Trump supporter in a region that generally leans to Democrats in presidential elections, but which flipped to Trump in 2016. Last month in Iowa, Blum publicly thanked Trump for his trade stance. “You’ve taken some heat for it in the short-term, but in the long run, the farmers, the manufacturers, the employers are all going to be better off,” said Blum, who did not respond to interview requests. The administration last month announced $12 billion in aid for farmers hurt by tariffs. Finkenauer, however, said the state needs someone to stand up to the president, not pat him on the back. China’s tariffs are a direct hit to Iowa, the nation’s top exporter of corn and pork, and No. 2 exporter of soybeans behind Illinois. Iowa exported nearly $11 billion in agricultural goods in 2016, trailing only California, according to USDA data. China is the world’s biggest importer of soybeans and among the largest pork buyers. But Iowa farmers are also getting hit by levies imposed by Mexico, the leading importer of U.S. pork. Dean Hamblin, 63, owns a farm in Buchanan County, which also flipped to Trump from Obama. In an August “town hall” event he urged U.S. Republican Senator Joni Ernst to push the president to act quickly. “We can’t wait for a year to settle this tariff business. If we lose those markets, they will be gone forever,” Hamblin told Ernst, who agreed. Prices for lean hog futures have fallen 14 percent since May 1. Ernst noted farmers are throwing away pigs’ heads for the first time because the tariffs wiped out the market for them. Hog parts such as feet, tongue and heads are shunned by most Americans, but are considered a delicacy in China, and Iowa farmers had profited handsomely by exporting those products. Trump’s energy policies also factor in to the election outlook. Iowa is the top producer of corn-based ethanol; it produced 95.5 million barrels in 2016, a quarter of the nation’s total, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and as such, federal policy regarding this biofuel is a sensitive topic in the state. Refiners are required by law to blend 15 billion gallons of biofuels yearly into the fuel supply, but the government has not increased that level for several years, causing domestic ethanol demand to flatline. To increase demand, farmers have asked Washington to rescind a ban on selling E15, a gasoline with higher levels of ethanol, in the summer. That has not happened yet. Instead, over the last year, the industry has become embroiled in a related dispute with Washington. The White House has become more aggressive than the Obama administration in granting numerous requests from refiners seeking relief from having to blend, or pay for, the cost of adding biofuels to the nation’s fuel supply. That undercuts demand for ethanol, farmers say. Last month, Trump attempted to mollify the corn industry, telling a roomful of Iowa farmers that he was close to lifting the ban, drawing cheers in the state and surprise in Washington from those unaware of the plans. Trump in recent weeks has told U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and others to strike a deal with the oil industry that will lift the ban, according to three sources briefed on the meetings. Oil companies have opposed these efforts. The goal was to get something done in August to help embattled incumbents like Blum. But summer is nearly over, and farmers have not seen the relief they expected. “We are sick of the runaround on the E15,” said Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer from Pottawattamie County, which Trump won with 58 percent of the vote. “This is something that has gone on way too long.” Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in Des Moines, Iowa

2018-08-17,"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - An Indonesian court has rejected a legal challenge from local residents attempting to halt the expansion of a coal power plant on the holiday island of Bali, the environmental group Greenpeace said on Friday. Three residents near the Celukan Bawang power plant, about 120 km (75 miles) from the main tourism hub of Denpasar, had tried to stop the planned expansion due to pollution fears. “The judge only used the perspective of our opponents,” said Didit Wicaksono, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace Indonesia, which backed the legal challenge. “We are very sad about the decision,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that an appeal in a higher court was now planned. The legal bid claimed that the expansion - which would more than double power capacity at the site - would be a setback to the remote area’s tourism and fishing industries. The expansion would lead to increased air and water pollution, damage crops, and have a negative effect on wildlife at a nearby national park, argued the plaintiffs. In its ruling on Thursday, the Denpasar administrative court said the action “had no legal standing” and that new technology would be able to mitigate the risk of pollution, according to Greenpeace. The court also ruled that expansion work should not be halted during any appeal process, Wicaksono said, adding that activists and community members are planning to protest near the plant. PT General Energy Bali, which runs the Celukan Bawang power plant, could not be reached for comment. Agung Pribadi, an energy ministry spokesman, said by phone that the government would respect the court’s ruling. In a statement, one of the plaintiffs, I Ketut Mangku, said that pollution from the coal plant has negatively affected the health of both his family and his crops. “The planned expansion is going to be even more harmful with far reaching impact,” he said. Indonesia is among the fastest-growing countries for energy consumption due to a steadily increasing population, economic development and a rise in urbanization. Like other Asian nations, the government faces the challenge of boosting electricity access while meeting its pledge to cut climate-changing emissions under the Paris Agreement. Indonesia's emissions targets can only be achieved by reducing its reliance on coal power and ramping up investment in clean, renewable energy projects, electricity experts say.

2018-08-17,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Global stocks up 0.2 percent * Lira falls back nearly 3 pct * Emerging stocks, European banks and copper enter bear market By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Aug 17 (Reuters) - World stocks rose on Friday as news of plans for U.S.-China trade talks soothed nerves over their tariff war, while the recovery in Turkey’s lira ran out of steam. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.2 percent but set for its third straight weekly fall. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that talks will take place in Washington on Aug. 21 and 22. The world’s two largest economies are due to slap tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods on Aug. 23 in addition to levies that took effect on July 6. “There is still a great deal of difference between agreeing to talk and coming to an agreement,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. “For now it appears an escalation has become less likely, hence yesterday’s rebound in equity markets,” he added, referring to an overnight rally on Wall Street. Turkey’s lira, meanwhile, dropped nearly 3 percent to almost 6 per dollar again, having recovered ground rapidly in recent days. The currency plunged to a record low of 7.24 per dollar at the start of the week as a worsening of relations between Turkey and the United States added to losses driven by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy. The currency has lost a third of its value this year. “To declare with confidence that the worst is over for the lira the central bank would have to act decisively on September 13 (or earlier if the selling pressure on the lira resurfaces), diplomatic tension with the US would have to ease and prudent fiscal measures and structural reforms would have to be swiftly implemented,” Rabobank strategists wrote in a note to clients. Turkey’s central bank meets next on Sept. 13. Ratings agency Standard & Poor’s is also scheduled to release a review of Turkey’s sovereign credit rating after the market close on Friday. Memories of past emerging market crises, such as the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and Turkey’s 2001 crisis, came back to haunt investors this week and prompted a wave of selling across emerging market assets as a whole. Global stocks also suffered this week as the sell-off spilled into developed markets, adding to the angst over U.S.-China trade relations and the fiscal prudence of Italy’s anti-establishment government. Emerging market stocks entered a technical bear market as the sell-off intensified, registering a 20 percent drop. There was more gloom elsewhere, with European banks and copper <CMCU3 > also falling into bear market territory. London copper slid 1 percent, declining for a fifth session in six and set for its biggest weekly decline since early July as supply disruption concerns eased. Pig prices dropped on concerns about an outbreak of African swine fever, which could hit demand in China, where retail sales top $840 billion a year. Elsewhere, the dollar dipped against a basket of currencies , moving further away from its highest levels since June 2017, hit earlier in the week as investors bought the U.S. currency in a flight to safety. The euro rose nearly 0.4 percent to its highest since Tuesday. Brent crude oil futures rose 0.4 percent to $71.72 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 0.3 percent at $65.66. Reporting by Ritvik Carvalho

2018-08-17,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said on Friday it would spin off its offshore drilling operation and list it in Copenhagen next year, the latest move by the Danish shipping company to focus entirely on transport and logistics. Maersk, which cut its full-year profit outlook this month, sold Maersk Oil to French oil major Total (TOTF.PA) last year in a $7.5 billion deal as part of a restructuring under Soren Skou, who became chief executive in 2016. Skou used to head Maersk’s container business and is a long-time veteran of the Danish firm whose mainstay industry is emerging from a fierce price war as too many ships chased too little business, denting profitability.  However, a slower-than-expected rise in freight rates combined with ballooning bunker fuel costs have triggered recent profit warnings from Maersk and rival Hapag-Lloyd (HLAG.DE).  Skou said on Friday that the development in freight rates had been positive and that the company had regained control of its costs in the second quarter after a rise linked to its acquisition of Hamburg Sud shipping line. But Maersk said that its second-quarter profitability had been hit by an almost 30 percent spike in the price of bunker fuel, which is used to power its ships. By divesting its oil and gas business, Maersk can no longer use oil as a hedge against downturns in the container market, although it said it was looking at a recovery for the remainder of the year, driven by lower costs and higher freight rates. Maersk said that following the demerger of Maersk Drilling, in which the Maersk family’s holding company will retain a significant stake, a “material part” of its remaining shares in France’s Total, which it acquired as part of the oil unit sale, will be distributed to shareholders. In March Maersk took a 3.7 percent stake, or 97.5 million shares, in Total. It sold stock worth $1.2 billion in July, leaving it with 78.3 million Total shares. Shares in Maersk were up 4 percent at 0832 GMT, while Total was little changed. LONG-TERM PROSPECTS  Maersk said it had evaluated different options for Maersk Drilling and decided that it offered the best long-term prospects for shareholders as a stand-alone company. An outright sale of Maersk Drilling has been made difficult by an oversupplied drilling rig market, which has not yet recovered despite a recent gain in oil prices. Maersk has not publicly put a price tag on the drilling division, but analysts have previously valued it at around $4.8 billion. It reported a 2 percent increase in second-quarter EBITDA to $159 million, while sales grew around 5 percent in the quarter to $366 million. The spin-off would release cash proceeds of around $1.2 billion, Maersk said, which Fearnley analysts said was above the $0.5-1.0 billion expected by the market. The Danish firm also said it had secured debt financing of $1.5 billion from a consortium of international banks “to ensure a strong capital structure after a listing”.     Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s both cut Maersk’s credit rating to close to the lowest investment grade levels in 2016 and the company  has vowed to do “whatever it takes” to protect its rating.  Fearnley’s analysts said Maersk’s plans to hand over shares in Total to its investors improved its dividend prospects. “The distribution of Total shares supports our view of an extraordinary dividend potential of around 5-8 percent in both 2019/ 2020,” they said. Maersk confirmed its preliminary second-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $883 million.

2018-08-17,"BERLIN, Aug 18 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Saturday for talks about the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that has drawn U.S. ire. Putin arrives in Germany after a stop at an Austrian vineyard to attend Foreign Minister Karin Kneissl’s wedding to entrepreneur Wolfgang Meilinger. Merkel warned on Friday against expecting too much from her discussions with Putin at the government’s Meseberg palace, but said the two countries needed to remain in “permanent dialogue” on the long list of problems they face. “It’s a working meeting from which no specific results are expected,” she told reporters. The two leaders last met in Sochi in May and struggled to overcome differences. But both Juergen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Merkel’s conservative bloc, and Achim Post, a senior member of the Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in the coalition government, were more upbeat. “We can be cautiously optimistic,” Hardt told the Stuttgarter Zeitung and Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspapers in an interview published on Saturday. “The Russian president has manoeuvred himself into a dead end on Syria and eastern Ukraine, and needs international partners. For that he has to move.” A senior German official told the papers: “There has been some movement,” but gave no details. Post said in a statement that he expected both Merkel and Putin to look for pragmatic solutions based on common interests. “In a world that is increasingly uncertain, we must speak particularly with difficult partners like Russia,” he said. Russia and the West remain at loggerheads over Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and the ensuing conflict between Russian-backed separatists in the country’s east and the Ukrainian army. On Syria, Germany wants Putin to finalise a lasting ceasefire there in agreement with the United States. Merkel on Friday said a four-way meeting on Syria involving Germany, Russia, Turkey and France was possible. Germany is also under strong pressure from the United States to halt work on the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The United States says it will increase Germany’s dependence on Russia for energy. Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business. Germany’s eastern European neighbours, nervous of Russian encroachment, have also raised concerns about the project. Merkel and Putin will each make statements at 1600 GMT on Saturday before the start of the talks. They do not plan to take questions.

2018-08-17,"(Reuters) - China will continue its cooperation and relations with Iran, state news agency Xinhua reported on Friday, citing a statement from Chinese State Councillor Wang Yi. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the 2015 deal in which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of most Western sanctions, is in line with the international community’s “common interest”, the Chinese diplomat said in a phone conversation with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, according to Xinhua. “We have openly indicated that we oppose the wrong practices of unilateral sanctions and ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ in international relations,” Wang Yi was quoted as saying.  Beijing has cultivated close commercial links with Tehran, especially in the energy sector. China’s ties with Tehran are open, transparent and lawful, its foreign ministry said earlier in August, after U.S. President Donald Trump said companies doing business with Iran would be barred from the United States. Earlier this year, Trump took the call to pull the United States out of the JCPOA, ignoring pleas from the other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK - Another steep decline in the Turkish lira on Friday pushed emerging market equities lower and kept other world markets cautious, overshadowing hopes that an upcoming U.S.-China meeting would resolve concerns over trade tariffs.  The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday afternoon that Chinese and U.S. negotiators are drawing up a road map for their trade talks next week. Both countries aim to resolve an escalating tariff war.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices rose on Friday, but declined on the week on worries that oversupply would weigh on the U.S. market while trade disputes and slowing global economic growth would dampen demand for oil.  U.S. crude declined for the seventh consecutive week, and global benchmark Brent was dropped for a third week. “One of the biggest concerns out there is that China’s demand numbers are coming down if China’s GDP growth is slowing,” said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital in New York. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 settled up 40 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $71.83 a barrel, after touching a high of $72.49 earlier in the session.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures (WTI)CLc1 rose 45 cents , or 0.7 percent, to $65.91, after touching a session high of $66.39.  For the week, Brent was down 1.4 percent, and U.S. crude fell 2.6 percent.  Falling prices have weighed on funds with oil exposure. Two of the world’s largest energy-focused hedge funds, Andurand Capital and BBL Commodities, suffered double-digit percentage losses in July as oil prices plunged by the most in two years, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Money managers cut their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions to the lowest in nearly two months in the week to Aug. 14, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Friday’s pull back from session highs came on mounting worries that U.S. crude inventories would post another consecutive gain, said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho Americas. U.S. government data this week showed a large build up in crude inventories C-OUT-T-EIA, with production C-OUT-T-EIA also increasing. [EIA/S]  “Investors remain cautious as Wednesday’s surprise gain in U.S. stockpiles remained fresh in their minds,” ANZ bank said on Friday.  The number of U.S. oil drilling rigs, an indicator of future production, was unchanged this week at 869 rigs, much higher than the 763 rigs operating a year ago, according to energy company Baker Hughes.[RIG/U]   Another major drag on prices was the darkening economic outlook on trade tensions between the United States and China, and weakening emerging market currencies that are weighing on growth and fuel consumption, traders and analysts said.  U.S. investment bank Jefferies said there was a “lack of demand” for crude oil and refined products from emerging markets, while Singapore’s DBS bank said that Chinese data showed a “steady decline” in activity and that “the economy is facing added headwinds due to rising trade tensions”. Japan’s MUFG Bank, meanwhile, said that the weakening Turkish lira will constrain further growth in gasoline and diesel demand this year. “Although emerging market contagion and China slowdown fears seem somewhat overstated, neither fundamental nor sentiment should provide support for higher commodity prices,” Julius Baer Head of Macro and Commodity Research Norbert Rücker said. Furthermore, just as demand seems to be slowing, supply looks to be rising, increasing the drag on markets.  Despite the bearish factors, analysts said prices were prevented from falling further because of U.S. sanctions against Iran, which target the financial sector from August and will include petroleum exports from November. “Iranian crude exports were still near 2 million barrels per day (bpd) in July and will likely begin to fall dramatically in August with financial sanctions taking effect. With oil export sanctions now three months out, we expect exports to fall by more than 500,000 bpd by the end of 3Q,” Jefferies said.

2018-08-17,"NEW YORK, Aug 17 (Reuters) - A co-owner of the Come By Chance oil refinery in Canada is suing his partner for about $5.8 million in a New York state court over allegations of unpaid dividends and misused investments, according to court papers filed on Friday. Neal Shear, who bought the struggling 130,000 barrel-per-day Come By Chance refinery in Newfoundland in 2014, accused Kaushik Amin, his partner in the plant, of failing to pay him a $5.45 million shareholder dividend as well as $326,000 under a separate agreement. Amin may have diverted refinery proceeds for his own personal investments, the court papers alleged. Reuters reported last month that the former oil traders were at odds over a potential sale of the refinery amid a disagreement over the sale price. Before teaming up to acquire the refinery, Shear ran Morgan Stanley’s commodities business and Amin traded commodities at Lehman Brothers and UBS. Earlier this year, their company, North Atlantic Refining Limited (NARL), paid a dividend of about $25 million to some but not all of the shareholders, Shear alleges. Shear also alleges that Amin diverted monies paid from the refinery to a consulting company called Silverpeak Partners for unrelated financial investments, according to the civil court papers. The court dispute is not related to the operation or performance of the refinery, Shear said in a phone interview on Friday. He noted the filing is a summons, and not a full civil complaint. “I hope and intend to resolve these disputes without ever needing to file a complaint,” Shear said. Amin did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. The pair were once on the same side of the legal table. In 2016, oil major BP alleged that NARL violated its crude and product supply agreement by failing to maximize yields at the refinery in Come by Chance, Newfoundland. Among other things, BP alleged that NARL ran the refinery at high rates when it was not economical in order to exploit a unique clause in their contract that allowed NARL to earn a higher profit on oil refined in excess of 90,000 barrels. NARL won a partial victory in arbitration before the case was eventually settled. The case is Shear et al v Amin et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 654104/2018.

2018-08-17,"(Updates with U.S. mid-afternoon trading) By David Randall NEW YORK, Aug 17 - Another steep decline in the Turkish lira on Friday pushed emerging market equities lower and kept other world markets cautious, overshadowing hopes that an upcoming U.S.-China meeting would resolve concerns over trade tariffs. MSCI’s All-Country World index, which follows shares in 47 countries, rose 0.3 percent, though the index remained on track for its third straight weekly decline. A Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives, China’s Ministry of Commerce said in a statement. The Wall Street Journal reported that talks will take place in Washington on Aug. 21 and 22. The world’s two largest economies are due to slap tariffs on billions of dollars of each other’s goods on Aug. 23, in addition to levies that took effect on July 6. “There is still a great deal of difference between agreeing to talk and coming to an agreement,” said CMC Markets analyst Michael Hewson. “For now it appears an escalation has become less likely, hence (Thursday’s) rebound in equity markets,” he added, referring to an overnight rally on Wall Street. In mid-afternoon trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 148.97 points, or 0.58 percent, to 25,707.7, the S&P 500 gained 11.67 points, or 0.41 percent, to 2,852.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 12.96 points, or 0.17 percent, to 7,819.48. U.S. stocks climbed higher in afternoon trading after a Mexican economic official told reporters that trade talks between the United States and Mexico were “advancing well.” “Any conversations we have with China to come up with a deal and any conversations we have with Mexico would be seen as a win for the U.S.” said Jeffrey Frankel, president at Stuart Frankel & Co in New York. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index lost 0.09 percent. Turkey’s lira tumbled as much as 8.5 percent to 6.3 per dollar, having recovered ground rapidly in recent days. It was last down by about 4 percent. The currency plunged to a record low of 7.24 per dollar at the start of the week as worsening relations between Turkey and the United States added to losses driven by concerns over President Tayyip Erdogan’s influence over monetary policy. The currency has lost a third of its value this year. The United States warned Turkey to expect more economic sanctions unless it hands over detained American pastor Andrew Brunson, as relations between the two countries took a further turn for the worse. Memories of past emerging market crises, such as the Asian financial turmoil of 1997 and Turkey’s 2001 crisis, haunted investors this week and prompted selling across emerging market assets as a whole. That left emerging market stocks in a technical bear market, or down 20 percent from recent highs. European banks and copper also fell into bear market territory. The dollar dipped against a basket of six major currencies , moving further away from its highest levels since June 2017 hit earlier in the week as investors bought the U.S. currency in a flight to safety. U.S. crude rose 0.75 percent to $65.95 per barrel and Brent was last at $71.84, up 0.57 percent on the day. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last rose 1/32 in price to yield 2.8677 percent, from 2.871 percent late on Thursday. (Reporting by David Randall.

2018-08-17,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned against expectations that her meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday will produce any breakthrough on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria. Speaking on the eve of talks with the Russian leader, Merkel pitched the meeting as the product of necessity rather than choice: Russia and Germany must engage in dialogue on the long list of problems they have an interest in solving. “It’s a working meeting from which no specific results are expected - but the number of problems that occupy us - from Ukraine and Syria to the issue of economic cooperation - is so big that it is justified to be in a permanent dialogue,” Merkel said. Merkel spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, ahead of her meeting with Putin, and discussed the situation in Ukraine and Syria, Macron’s office said Friday in a statement, without elaborating. Merkel and Putin last met in Sochi in May, when they struggled to overcome differences during the German chancellor’s first visit to Russia since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula in 2014. The annexation and ensuing conflict between Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and the Ukrainian army set off the worst confrontation between Russia and the West since World War Two. Russia and Germany agree that an internationally brokered peace deal known as the Minsk agreement must be fully implemented to end the conflict, but cannot agree on the mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping mission. Germany and France want U.N. troops deployed in all areas controlled by Russian-backed rebels, including on the Ukraine-Russia border. Russia opposes this idea. Relations between the two countries have also been strained by the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will carry gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The United States says it will increase Germany’s dependence on Russia for energy. Ukraine fears the pipeline will allow Russia to cut it off from the gas transit business. Germany’s eastern European neighbours, nervous of Russian encroachment, have also raised concerns about the project. A spokesman for Merkel said this week that the European Union was still in talks with Russia to ensure that Ukraine continues to play a role in the lucrative energy transit business even after Nord Stream 2 is completed. On Syria, Germany wants Putin to finalise a lasting ceasefire there with the United States.    Speaking at a news conference with Montenegrin Prime Minister Dusko Markovic, Merkel said a four-way meeting on Syria involving Germany, Russia, Turkey and France was possible. Merkel and Putin will each make statements at 1600 GMT on Saturday before the start of the talks at the government’s Meseberg palace outside Berlin. They will take no questions.

2018-08-17,"(Reuters) - An ExxonMobil-operated gas project in Papua New Guinea has agreed a deal to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) to a unit of British oil giant BP (BP.L), said Australia’s Oil Search Ltd (OSH.AX), a partner in the development.  The agreement, starting this month, will provide BP with about 450,000 tonnes of LNG annually over an initial three-year period, rising to about 900,000 tonnes for the following two years, Oil Search said in a statement on Friday.  It did not give any value for the deal. “(The move) takes the total contracted volumes from the Project to approximately 7.5 MTPA (million tonnes per annum)”, said Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten. The agreement comes a month after Oil Search announced a similar deal with PetroChina Co Ltd (601857.SS). The company also said that, on behalf of the project, ExxonMobil was in negotiations with several other parties over an additional 450,000 tonnes per year of supply. Earlier this month, Oil Search resumed operations to produce oil at the Agogo Production Facility, which was knocked out by a major earthquake in Papua New Guinea in February.

2018-08-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas environment regulators should coordinate shutdowns of oil refineries and other petrochemical plants during major storms to avoid big releases of air pollution like during last year’s Hurricane Harvey, a report said on Thursday.   A year ago Harvey dumped more than 60 inches (1.5 meters) of rain on southeastern Texas, halting refineries that produce a quarter of U.S. fuel and damaging infrastructure. Texas industry, including refineries and petrochemical plants, released an extra 8.3 million pounds (3.8 million kg) of air pollutants including cancer-causing benzene, during Harvey, said the report by the Washington-based Environmental Integrity Project.  (The report, called ""Preparing for the Next Storm"" can be seen at: bit.ly/2Mkw1Ur) Most of that pollution was released in the Houston area, where refineries did not shut until the rains arrived, three days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a warning for coastal counties. Much of that pollution resulted from equipment malfunctions and electrical outages, emissions that could have been avoided if the state coordinated early shutdowns, the report said. In Corpus Christi, refineries that shut before rains came released less pollution on average, the report said.   Houston suffered three high ozone days, which can be dangerous for people with lung and heart conditions, following Harvey, including the worst day for smog in Texas in 2017.  “The state should take a more hands-on approach for future storms because with climate change we are going to have more storms like this,” said Tom Pelton, a spokesman at the EIP, headed by former Environmental Protection Agency director of civil enforcement, Eric Schaeffer.  The report recommended that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality “plan, coordinate and stagger the often- complicated shutdowns of major industrial facilities during hurricanes and other disasters, as well as the subsequent restarting of plants,” to reduce pollution. It also recommended that the state not suspend pollution reporting requirements during future natural disasters as it did for months after Harvey. TCEQ spokesman Brian McGovern said every storm is unique and every plant is unique, so developing a one-size-fits-all approach “would be a virtually impossible task.”   Refining companies should invest in robust backup power generation systems and the best available pollution controls to reduce emissions during storms, EIP said. Chet Thompson, the head of the industry group the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said refineries and petrochemical plants have already put generators on higher land, hardened infrastructure, and will apply lessons learned from Harvey. He did not directly address EIP’s recommendations about investing in extra backup power systems or better pollution controls.

2018-08-17,"(Adds details, construction update) VANCOUVER, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator on Thursday said it had given the go-ahead for the construction of a large portion of the Trans Mountain expansion project, which will nearly triple capacity on the oil pipeline from Alberta to a Vancouver area port. The National Energy Board (NEB) said all conditions had been met for construction to go ahead on Segments 1-4, which cover a vast swath of land from Edmonton, Alberta to Kamloops, British Columbia. Kinder Morgan Canada, which announced a deal to sell the project to the Canadian government in May, separately said in a blog post that preliminary work was under way in Alberta ahead of the arrival of pipeline construction crews in the spring of 2019. It did not provide an update on when construction would be completed. There are concerns the project could cost more than its C$7.4 billion ($5.6 billion) budget, and be delayed past its current in-service date of December 2020. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has backed the project, which faces intense environmental and political opposition but would bring much needed relief to Canadian oil producers who are struggling to get their crude to market. The discount on Canada’s heavy crude hit a near five-year high earlier this month as rising production continued to outstrip space on congested pipelines. The Trans Mountain expansion, which would nearly triple capacity on the line to 890,000 barrels per day, is one of three major Canadian crude export pipeline projects in the works. Construction is already under way on an expansion at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Vancouver, with preliminary work being done at Kinder Morgan’s nearby terminal and tank farm. The NEB said 72 percent of the detailed final route for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion had been approved, with hearings on the last segment set for October. Canada agreed in May to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and project for C$4.5 billion, with the deal expected to close later this year. $1 = 1.3158 Canadian dollars

2018-08-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday named senior policy adviser Brian Hook as Washington’s special representative for Iran. The move came as the Trump administration prepared to increase economic pressure on Iran by restoring sanctions to force Tehran to end its nuclear weapons program and support for militant groups in the Middle East. Hook will lead a newly established Iran Action Group to coordinate the State Department’s pressure campaign on Iran, Pompeo told a news conference. The announcement was not a surprise. Hook, who has pushed for tough action against Iran, has been leading the department’s talks with allies in Europe and Asia to persuade them to support U.S. sanctions and cut off Iran’s oil supplies as of November. “The Iran Action Group will be responsible for directing, reviewing and coordinating all aspects of the State Department’s Iran-related activity, and will report directly to me,” Pompeo said. “We are committed to a whole-of-government effort to change the Iranian regime’s behavior, and the Iran Action Group will ensure that the Department of State remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners,” he added. President Donald Trump announced in May the United States was withdrawing from an Iran nuclear deal sealed in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. The United States has said it would only end the sanctions if Iran allowed the negotiation of a tougher deal. Hook, who was a close adviser to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, worked with U.S. national security advisor John Bolton on Iran sanctions while Bolton was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush. Hook also served as an assistant secretary of state during Bush’s administration and was an adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty. Trump has said he would be willing to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, although Tehran said the way back to talks was for the United States to return to the nuclear deal. Asked whether he supported such a meeting and whether his brief would be to set up those talks, Hook said if Iran showed that it was willing to change its behavior, then Trump “was prepared to engage in dialogue in order to find solutions.” Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria. Iran and other signatories, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement, even as the United States has started reimposing some sanctions on Iran. Dennis Ross, a former U.S. official in Democratic and Republican administrations, said Hook’s new post might be a bureaucratic maneuver to try to inject more clarity into Washington’s policy toward Tehran. “It creates an address within the administration for ... making the approach a more coherent one, with someone being given broader responsibility across departments to try to shape the policy,” said Ross, now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. “At least that would be theory.” “The real question is ... is the policy going to continue to be just, basically, strong tough rhetoric and sanctions ... or is it going to be something more” to curtail what Washington sees as Iran’s destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq?” he added.

2018-08-17,"* Asian shares up slightly, developed markets shares outperform * Turkish lira maintains gains but seen vulnerable * Shanghai shares on course to close at 2-1/2-year low * European shares seen almost flat By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Asian shares won a modest reprieve on Friday after China and the United States agreed to hold their first trade talks since June next week and as the Turkish lira extended gains from its record low earlier this week. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.46 percent, a day after it hit its lowest level in a year. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.5 percent. European shares are expected to be little changed, with financial spreadbetters looking at an almost flat opening in three major European bourses  . In U.S. markets on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.58 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.79 percent. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.63 percent on Thursday, the biggest gain in a month. News that a Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives helped to improve the mood. The meeting is set to take place as the world’s two largest economies are due to slap tariffs on billions of dollars of eachother’s goods on Aug. 23, in addition to levies that took effect on July 6. But there are doubts over whether lower-level talks can resolve the trade dispute given what is at stake. White House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned Beijing not to underestimate President Donald Trump’s resolve in pushing for changes in China’s economic policies. Indeed, Chinese share markets were hardly impressed by the news. The Shanghai composite index fell 0.5 percent by early afternoon for a weekly fall of 3.7 percent, risking a close below a 2-1/2 year low set on Aug. 6. MSCI China, mostly made up of Chinese shares listed in Hong Kong and the United States, has fallen 5.9 percent so far this week. That weighed on MSCI emerging markets index, which closed at a 13-month low on Thursday. That weakness also stemmed from falls in emerging market currencies after the Turkish lira plunged this month on concerns about diplomatic rifts between Ankara and Washington. “Because of the currency crisis in Turkey, investors are shifting funds from emerging markets to developed markets,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. “But if you look at longer-term prospects, the U.S. could be affected if the trade disputes linger. Given a U.S. president tends to do badly in his first mid-term election, he might do more on trade issues after the election,” he added. In the currency market, the lira slipped 0.8 percent to 5.84 per dollar but it retained much of its rebound this week and up almost 25 percent from its record low of 7.2400 hit early on Monday, despite threats of more sanctions from Washington. It has gained some support from the announcement late on Wednesday of a Qatari pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey. The offshore Chinese yuan weakened slightly after a 1.2 percent climb on Thursday, the biggest daily gain since January 2017 following the trade talks news. The yuan last stood at 6.8770 per dollar, down 0.25 percent on the day but still off Wednesday’s 19-month low of 6.9587. “We believe that the wave of RMB depreciation is probably over and that renewed fiscal stimulus (in China) will bring a halt to decelerating growth as well as higher interest rates supporting a stronger RMB,” Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, said in a note. The euro, which has been affected by concerns about European banks’ exposure to Turkey, traded at $1.1375, almost flat on the day and off a 13-1/2-month low of $1.1301 on Wednesday. The yen changed hands at 110.97 per dollar, unchanged from Thursday. The pound rose 0.12 percent on Thursday after 10 straight days of falls though concerns about a hard Brexit continued to undermine the sterling. Oil prices were on the defensive, on a weakening outlook for crude demand despite their gains on Thursday thanks in part to a recovery in global shares. Brent crude oil futures fetched $71.36 a barrel, down 0.1 percent in Asia on Friday after a 0.69 percent rise the previous day. They are on course to log the seventh straight week of losses. U.S. crude futures stood at $65.43 a barrel, down 0.05 percent. Additional reporting by Winni Zhou in Shanghai

2018-08-17,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Stiff new U.S. sanctions against Russia would only have a limited impact on its oil industry because it has drastically reduced its reliance on Western funding and foreign partnerships and is lessening its dependence on imported technology. Western sanctions imposed in 2014 over Russia’s annexation of Crimea have already made it extremely hard for many state oil firms such as Rosneft (ROSN.MM) to borrow abroad or use Western technology to develop shale, offshore and Arctic deposits. While those measures have slowed down a number of challenging oil projects, they have done little to halt the Russian industry’s growth with production near a record high of 11.2 million barrels per day in July - and set to climb further. Since 2014, the Russian oil industry has effectively halted borrowing from Western institutions, instead relying on its own cash flow and lending from state-owned banks while developing technology to replace services once supplied by Western firms. Analysts say this is partly why Russian oil stocks have been relatively unscathed since U.S. senators introduced legislation to impose new sanctions on Russia over its interference in U.S. elections and its activities in Syria and Ukraine. The measures introduced on Aug. 2, dubbed by the senators as the “bill from hell”, include potential curbs on the operations of state-owned Russian banks, restrictions on holding Russian sovereign debt as well as measures against Western involvement in Russian oil and gas projects. While the ruble has fallen more than 10 percent and Russian banking stocks have slumped 20 percent since the legislation was introduced, shares in Russian oil firms have climbed 2 percent, leaving them 27 percent higher so far in 2018 .TRXFLDRUPOILI. “The main driver of the Russian oil industry’s profitability is the oil price denominated in roubles and it is currently posting new records as the rouble is getting weaker. Hence the sanction noise often even has a positive impact on Russian oil stocks,” said Dmitry Marinchenko at Fitch Ratings. The prospects for the latest U.S. sanctions bill are not immediately clear. It would have to pass both the Senate and House of Representatives and then be signed into law by President Donald Trump. To be sure, Washington could really hurt the Russian oil industry if it introduced Iran-like measures forbidding oil purchases from the country. But given Russia produces more than 11 percent of global crude, such a measure would lead to a major spike in oil prices and hit the United States itself hard as it is the world’s largest oil consumer. Russian gas exporting monopoly Gazprom (GAZP.MM), for example, has maintained its output since 2014 and actually increased exports to Europe to an all-time high in 2017, securing a 34 percent share of EU markets amid rising demand. But of all Russian oil and gas companies, it is the only one to have borrowed significant sums from the West - about $5 billion in 2017 and $3 billion in 2018 so far - using Eurobonds and syndicated loans. What’s more, those amounts are only equivalent to a small proportion of Gazprom’s annual capital spending of $22 billion. The rest of the Russian oil industry invests a similar amount each year as well, mostly without Western funding. That represents a major departure from the years prior to the sanctions when the lion’s share of Russian oil industry’s borrowing came from Western banks or export-backed facilities with trading houses and major oil companies. In 2013, for example, a year before the first Western sanctions, Rosneft alone borrowed more than $35 billion from Western institutions to buy smaller rival TNK-BP and to fund its capital spending. There has been a similar shift in joint ventures between Russian and Western companies. A decade ago, dozens of projects were planned but the number has shrunk to just a few ventures, which are important but not critical to help Russia maintain its output growth. U.S. oil giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI), for example, have dropped plans to help Russia develop offshore fields and U.S. company ConocoPhillips (COP.N) sold out from Russia’s biggest private oil firm Lukoil (LKOH.MM). The key remaining ventures involving Western companies are three projects between BP (BP.L) and Rosneft in East and West Siberia and a gas venture between Rosneft and Exxon Mobil on Sakhalin island. Also on the gas front, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and France’s Total (TOTF.PA) have been considering new liquefied natural gas projects with Gazprom and Novatek (NVTK.MM), as well as a new pipeline to Europe under the Baltic Sea. But to put the projects in perspective, the combined cost of all of them is about $50 billion - less than a 10th of the Russian oil industry’s investment program for the next decade. And if Western institutions are wary of lending to Russia, other countries such as China have been prepared to step in. Novatek and Total, for example, launched the $27 billion Yamal LNG plant this year with Beijing’s financial support. The weakest link in the Russian oil industry in the face of sanctions has traditionally been high-end Western technology such as complex drilling, hydraulic fracturing or IT, said Denis Borisov, director of EY’s oil and gas center in Moscow. Russia’s drilling and oil servicing market is worth about $20 billion a year and the share of the market held by Western service companies has remained fairly steady over the last few years and at about a fifth.  “But the process of replacing foreign equipment with local production has gathered pace,” said Borisov. Rosneft, which produces 40 percent of Russian oil, has recently tested its own simulated hydraulic fracturing technology - the extraction technique that spurred the boom in U.S. shale oil production. The technology first came to Russia mainly via major Western oil services firms such as Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N). Companies such as Schlumberger are still doing a lot of complex drilling work in the Caspian Sea and West Siberia for Lukoil, as well as working on the world’s longest extended reach well for Exxon and Rosneft off the Sakhalin island. But Fitch’s Marinchenko said the reliance of Russian oil firms on Western technology has declined since 2014 thanks to imports from China and local production of drilling equipment. Since 2014, Rosneft’s own drilling subsidiary has doubled its market share to 25 percent, meaning the company has become almost self sufficient. “It is clear that new wide-scale sanctions on technology will not become the start of an end for the Russian oil industry, especially if Europe doesn’t join them,” said Marinchenko. “But it will complicate the development of hard to extract or depleted deposits.” Additional reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin; writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/russia-oil-sanctions/analysis-russian-oil-industry-would-weather-u-s-bill-from-hell-idUKL5N1V44VK,17 Aug 2018,"Stiff new U.S. sanctions against

2018-08-17,"DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Warren Bachman, a 72-year-old Iowa soybean farmer, is one of many who turned Clarke County into Donald Trump country, as the Republican president took 61 percent of the votes in 2016 in a county that went for Democrat Barack Obama four years earlier. But Bachman’s loyalty to Trump is wavering under the weight of a trade war that has disproportionately hurt farmers due to big tariffs on agricultural exports. Other farmers, meanwhile, are upset that the White House has not yet followed through on a promise to reform rules that would boost demand for corn-based ethanol, one of the state’s biggest businesses. “I still support him, but not as much,” Bachman said between bites of pork chops and baked beans at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines last week. “I am afraid we are close to seeing a repeat of the 1980s, where farmers across Iowa lost their land because they ran out of money and couldn’t get loans.” November’s congressional elections represent the first nationwide response to Trump’s aggressive trade policies, particularly in the Farm Belt, which runs roughly from Indiana to Kansas and the Dakotas, which favoured Trump heavily two years ago.  The administration’s move to impose numerous tariffs on imports has sparked retaliation, particularly from top agricultural buyer China, which put levies on products like hogs, corn and soybeans, hammering those markets. Soybeans are among the hardest-hit, with prices down 15 percent since May 1.  The United States exported $138 billion in agriculture products in 2017, including $21.5 billion in soybeans, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Farmers say they are growing impatient as harvest season approaches. Trump is more popular in the Farm Belt than in the nation overall, but his support there has dipped from 59 percent approval in mid-June to 52 percent in early August, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Trump won Iowa by 10 percentage points in 2016 after Obama carried the state twice.  (For a graphic on how Trump's Farm Belt approval rating has fallen with soybean and hog prices, see: (tmsnrt.rs/2w8Hyv8) ) “The anxiety is starting to escalate,” said Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican locked in a tight race with Democrat Fred Hubbell. “They are willing to give him some more time, but the window is closing and they have to see some movement somewhere to alleviate the pressure.” Bachman said he is a registered Republican, but has not decided whether to vote for Reynolds in November, saying he will pull the lever for whoever will best protect the state’s agricultural industry.  He said the tariffs on imported metals have increased the costs for farming equipment, but that he had saved money for a down cycle. But his wife, Linda Bachman, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said her husband is too proud to acknowledge the burden on their family, including their son, who is just starting out as a farmer.  “He’s stressed out. I see it every day, and we are worried about our son,” she said.  Democrats are hoping to pick up two congressional seats in Iowa as part of their quest to win the U.S. House of Representatives; they need to win a net 23 seats to regain control of the 435-seat chamber. “The president is using Iowa farmers and its families as poker chips in a trade war,” said Abby Finkenauer, a 29-year-old Democrat running against Republican incumbent Rod Blum in a race for a House seat in eastern Iowa that forecasters rate a toss-up.  Blum, 63, has been a staunch Trump supporter in a region that generally leans to Democrats in presidential elections, but which flipped to Trump in 2016. Last month in Iowa, Blum publicly thanked Trump for his trade stance. “You’ve taken some heat for it in the short-term, but in the long run, the farmers, the manufacturers, the employers are all going to be better off,” said Blum, who did not respond to interview requests. The administration last month announced $12 billion in aid for farmers hurt by tariffs. Finkenauer, however, said the state needs someone to stand up to the president, not pat him on the back.  China’s tariffs are a direct hit to Iowa, the nation’s top exporter of corn and pork, and No. 2 exporter of soybeans behind Illinois. Iowa exported nearly $11 billion in agricultural goods in 2016, trailing only California, according to USDA data.  China is the world’s biggest importer of soybeans and among the largest pork buyers. But Iowa farmers are also getting hit by levies imposed by Mexico, the leading importer of U.S. pork.  Dean Hamblin, 63, owns a farm in Buchanan County, which also flipped to Trump from Obama. In an August “town hall” event he urged U.S. Republican Senator Joni Ernst to push the president to act quickly. “We can’t wait for a year to settle this tariff business. If we lose those markets, they will be gone forever,” Hamblin told Ernst, who agreed. Prices for lean hog futures have fallen 14 percent since May 1. Ernst noted farmers are throwing away pigs’ heads for the first time because the tariffs wiped out the market for them. Hog parts such as feet, tongue and heads are shunned by most Americans, but are considered a delicacy in China, and Iowa farmers had profited handsomely by exporting those products. Trump’s energy policies also factor in to the election outlook. Iowa is the top producer of corn-based ethanol; it produced 95.5 million barrels in 2016, a quarter of the nation’s total, according to the U.S. Energy Department, and as such, federal policy regarding this biofuel is a sensitive topic in the state.  Refiners are required by law to blend 15 billion gallons of biofuels yearly into the fuel supply, but the government has not increased that level for several years, causing domestic ethanol demand to flatline. To increase demand, farmers have asked Washington to rescind a ban on selling E15, a gasoline with higher levels of ethanol, in the summer. That has not happened yet. Instead, over the last year, the industry has become embroiled in a related dispute with Washington. The White House has become more aggressive than the Obama administration in granting numerous requests from refiners seeking relief from having to blend, or pay for, the cost of adding biofuels to the nation’s fuel supply. That undercuts demand for ethanol, farmers say. Last month, Trump attempted to mollify the corn industry, telling a roomful of Iowa farmers that he was close to lifting the ban, drawing cheers in the state and surprise in Washington from those unaware of the plans. Trump in recent weeks has told U.S. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and others to strike a deal with the oil industry that will lift the ban, according to three sources briefed on the meetings. Oil companies have opposed these efforts.  The goal was to get something done in August to help embattled incumbents like Blum. But summer is nearly over, and farmers have not seen the relief they expected. “We are sick of the runaround on the E15,” said Kevin Ross, an Iowa farmer from Pottawattamie County, which Trump won with 58 percent of the vote. “This is something that has gone on way too long.”  Reporting by Jarrett Renshaw in Des Moines, Iowa; Editing by David Gaffen and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-election-iowa-farmers/pressure-mounts-on-trump-to-deliver-for-iowa-ahead-of-elections-idUKL1N1V40AE,17 Aug 2018,"* Rural support for Trump still strong, but waned in recent

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.4 percent, a day after it hit its lowest level in a year. Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.5 percent. In U.S. markets on Thursday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.58 percent and the S&P 500 gained 0.79 percent. MSCI’s index of world stocks rose 0.63 percent on Thursday, the biggest gain in a month. News that a Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of Commerce Wang Shouwen will meet U.S. representatives helped to improve the mood. But the impact could be short-lived as such lower-level talks alone are unlikely to resolve the trade dispute. White House Economic adviser Larry Kudlow warned Beijing not to underestimate President Donald Trump’s resolve in pushing for changes in China’s economic policies. Indeed, Chinese share markets were hardly impressed by the news. The Shanghai composite index rose 0.16 percent in early Friday trade after ending down 0.66 percent at 2,705.19 on Thursday, just 0.03 point above a 2-1/2 year closing low set on Aug. 6. That also weighed on MSCI emerging markets index, which closed at 13-month low on Thursday. Their weakness stemmed also from falls in their currencies after the Turkish lira plunged this month on concerns about diplomatic rifts between Ankara and Washington. “Because of the currency crisis in Turkey, investors are shifting funds from emerging markets to developed markets,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC Securities in Tokyo. “But if you look at longer-term prospects, the U.S. could be affected if the trade disputes linger. Given a U.S. president tends to do badly in his first mid-term election, he might do more on trade issues after the election,” he added. In the currency market, the lira bounced back to 5.815 per dollar, up almost 25 percent from its record low of 7.2400 hit early on Monday, despite threats of more sanctions from Washington. It gained some support from the announcement late on Wednesday of a Qatari pledge to invest $15 billion in Turkey. The offshore Chinese yuan weakened slightly after a 1.2 percent climb on Thursday, the biggest daily gain since January 2017 following the trade talks news. The yuan last stood at 6.8794 per dollar, down 0.25 percent on the day but still off Wednesday’s 19-month low of 6.9587. The euro, which has been affected by concerns about European banks’ exposure to Turkey, traded at $1.1375, almost flat on the day and off 13-1/2-month low of $1.1301 on Wednesday. The yen changed hands flat at 110.97 per dollar. The pound rose 0.12 percent on Thursday after 10 straight days of falls though concerns about a hard Brexit continued to undermine the sterling. Oil prices were on the defensive, on a weakening outlook for crude demand despite their gains on Thursday thanks in part to a recovery in global shares. Brent crude oil futures fetched $71.36 a barrel, down 0.1 percent in Asia on Friday after a 0.69 percent rise the previous day. They are on course to log the seventh straight week of losses.

2018-08-17,"KUALA LUMPUR, Aug 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - For the millions of sun seekers who head to Thailand’s resort island of Phuket each year in search of stunning beaches and clear waters, cutting down on waste may not be a top priority. But the island’s hotel association is hoping to change that with a series of initiatives aimed at reducing the use of plastic, tackling the garbage that washes up on its shores, and educating staff, local communities and tourists alike. “Hotels unchecked are huge consumers and users of single-use plastics,” said Anthony Lark, president of the Phuket Hotels Association and managing director of the Trisara resort. “Every resort in Southeast Asia has a plastic problem. Until we all make a change, it’s going to get worse and worse,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Established in 2016 and with about 70 members - including all Phuket’s five-star hotels - the association has put tackling environmental issues high on its to-do list. Last year the group surveyed members’ plastics use and then began looking at ways to shrink their plastics footprint. As part of this, three months ago the association’s hotels committed to phase out, or put plans in place to stop using plastic water bottles and plastic drinking straws by 2019. About five years ago, Lark’s own resort with about 40 villas used to dump into landfill about 250,000 plastic water bottles annually. It has now switched to reusable glass bottles. The hotel association also teamed up with the documentary makers of “A Plastic Ocean”, and now show an edited version with Thai subtitles for staff training. Meanwhile hotel employees and local school children take part in regular beach clean-ups. “The association is involved in good and inclusive community-based action, rather than just hotel general managers getting together for a drink,” Lark said. Phuket, like Bali in Indonesia and Boracay in the Philippines, has become a top holiday destination in Southeast Asia - and faces similar challenges. Of a similar size to Singapore and at the geographical heart of Southeast Asia, Phuket is easily accessible to tourists from China, India, Malaysia and Australia. With its white sandy beaches and infamous nightlife, Phuket attracts about 10 million visitors each year, media reports say, helping make the Thai tourism industry one of the few bright spots in an otherwise lacklustre economy. Popular with holiday makers and retirees, Phuket - like many other Southeast Asian resorts - must contend with traffic congestion, poor water management and patchy waste collection services. Despite these persistent problems, hotels in the region need to follow Phuket’s lead and step up action to cut their dependence on plastics, said Susan Ruffo, a managing director at the U.S.-based non-profit group Ocean Conservancy. Worldwide, between 8 million and 15 million tonnes of plastic are dumped in the ocean every year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain, UN Environment says. Five Asian countries - China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand - account for up to 60 percent of plastic waste leaking into the seas, an Ocean Conservancy study found. “As both creators and ‘victims’ of waste, the hotel industry has a lot to gain by making efforts to control their own waste and helping their guests do the same,” Ruffo said. “We are seeing more and more resorts and chains start to take action, but there is a lot more to be done, particularly in the area of ensuring that hotel waste is properly collected and recycled,” she added. Data on how much plastic is used by hotels and the hospitality industry is hard to find. But packaging accounts for up to 40 percent of an establishment’s waste stream, according to a 2011 study by The Travel Foundation, a UK-based charity. Water bottles, shampoo bottles, toothbrushes and even food delivered by room service all tend to use throw-away plastics. In the past, the hospitality industry has looked at how to use less water and energy, said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at the “Break Free From Plastic” movement in Manila. Now hotels are turning their attention to single-use plastics amid growing public awareness about damage to oceans. “A lot of hotels are doing good work around plastics”, adopting measures to eliminate or shrink their footprint, said Hernandez. But hotels in Southeast Asia often have to contend with poor waste management and crumbling infrastructure. “I’ve seen resorts in Bali that pay staff to rake the beach every morning to get rid of plastic, but then they either dig a hole, and bury it or burn it on the beach,” said Ruffo. “Those are not effective solutions, and can lead to other issues.” Hotels should look at providing reusable water containers and refill stations, giving guests metal or bamboo drinking straws and bamboo toothbrushes, and replacing single-use soap and shampoo containers with refillable dispensers, experts said. “Over time, this could actually lower their operational costs - it could give them savings,” said Hernandez. “It could help change mindsets of people, so that when they go back to their usual lives, they have a little bit of education.” Back in Phuket, the hotel association is exploring ways to cut plastic waste further, and will host its first regional forum on environmental awareness next month. The hope is that what the group has learned over the last two years can be implemented at other Southeast Asian resorts and across the wider community. ""If the 20,000 staff in our hotels go home and educate mum and dad about recycling or reusing, it's going to make a big difference,"" said Lark.

2018-08-17,"(Repeats Thursday’s column with no changes to the text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2vPGI7d By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 16 (Reuters) - If the global economy starts to grow more slowly, the impact will show up first in the price of refined fuels such as road diesel, marine gasoil and jet fuel that play a central role in the freight transport system. Middle distillate fuels are principally burned in the high-powered engines used in trucks, railroads, ships, barges and aircraft to move freight around the world, as well as in factories, on farms and at mines and oilfields. Mid-distillates account for more than a third of the oil used around the world every day, and are the single-largest category of refined products, (“Statistical review of world energy”, BP, 2018). Distillate fuels are closely correlated with the global economic and trade cycle, and at the moment they confirm other indications the rate of growth is slowing. U.S. distillate stocks, which had been drawing down faster than usual during the first four months of 2018, have now been building faster than normal since late May (tmsnrt.rs/2vPGI7d). European gasoil futures prices, which had been in substantial backwardation, have shifted towards flat or even contango since the end of May, reflecting improved availability. Gasoil futures still command a hefty premium over crude for deliveries in 2019, but the premium has been eroding over the same time frame. In line with these trends, hedge funds and other money managers have become markedly less bullish on the outlook for distillate prices over the last three months. Hedge fund managers have cut their bullish positioning in U.S. heating oil by 29 million barrels (33 percent) and in European gasoil by 53 million barrels (33 percent) since late May. Over the same period, bullish positions in U.S. gasoline have been cut by 14 million barrels (12 percent), according to regulatory and exchange data. Distillate markets are sending the same signal as a range of other indicators: the rate of global output growth has decelerated in recent months after a very strong expansion in 2017.

Brent crude oil futures were down 5 cents at $71.38 a barrel by 0050 GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures dropped 4 cents to $65.42 a barrel. Brent is heading for a 2 percent decline this week, a third consecutive weekly drop. WTI is on track for a seventh week of losses, with a fall of more than 3 percent. Data on Wednesday showing a large build in U.S. inventories fostered fears about the outlook for fuel demand, while crude was also pressured by broader selling of industrial commodities and by the Turkish financial crisis. China and the United States have implemented several rounds of trade tariffs and threatened further duties on exports worth hundreds of billions of dollars, which could knock global economic growth. At the same time, the crisis gripping the Turkish lira has rattled emerging markets and reverberated across equities, bonds and raw materials.

2018-08-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Texas environment regulators should coordinate shutdowns of oil refineries and other petrochemical plants during major storms to avoid big releases of air pollution like during last year’s Hurricane Harvey, a report said on Thursday.   A year ago Harvey dumped more than 60 inches (1.5 meters) of rain on southeastern Texas, halting refineries that produce a quarter of U.S. fuel and damaging infrastructure. Texas industry, including refineries and petrochemical plants, released an extra 8.3 million pounds (3.8 million kg) of air pollutants including cancer-causing benzene, during Harvey, said the report by the Washington-based Environmental Integrity Project.  (The report, called ""Preparing for the Next Storm"" can be seen at: bit.ly/2Mkw1Ur) Most of that pollution was released in the Houston area, where refineries did not shut until the rains arrived, three days after Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a warning for coastal counties. Much of that pollution resulted from equipment malfunctions and electrical outages, emissions that could have been avoided if the state coordinated early shutdowns, the report said. In Corpus Christi, refineries that shut before rains came released less pollution on average, the report said.   Houston suffered three high ozone days, which can be dangerous for people with lung and heart conditions, following Harvey, including the worst day for smog in Texas in 2017.  “The state should take a more hands-on approach for future storms because with climate change we are going to have more storms like this,” said Tom Pelton, a spokesman at the EIP, headed by former Environmental Protection Agency director of civil enforcement, Eric Schaeffer.  The report recommended that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality “plan, coordinate and stagger the often- complicated shutdowns of major industrial facilities during hurricanes and other disasters, as well as the subsequent restarting of plants,” to reduce pollution. It also recommended that the state not suspend pollution reporting requirements during future natural disasters as it did for months after Harvey. TCEQ spokesman Brian McGovern said every storm is unique and every plant is unique, so developing a one-size-fits-all approach “would be a virtually impossible task.”   Refining companies should invest in robust backup power generation systems and the best available pollution controls to reduce emissions during storms, EIP said. Chet Thompson, the head of the industry group the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said refineries and petrochemical plants have already put generators on higher land, hardened infrastructure, and will apply lessons learned from Harvey. He did not directly address EIP’s recommendations about investing in extra backup power systems or better pollution controls.

2018-08-17,"(Adds details, construction update) VANCOUVER, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator on Thursday said it had given the go-ahead for the construction of a large portion of the Trans Mountain expansion project, which will nearly triple capacity on the oil pipeline from Alberta to a Vancouver area port. The National Energy Board (NEB) said all conditions had been met for construction to go ahead on Segments 1-4, which cover a vast swath of land from Edmonton, Alberta to Kamloops, British Columbia. Kinder Morgan Canada, which announced a deal to sell the project to the Canadian government in May, separately said in a blog post that preliminary work was under way in Alberta ahead of the arrival of pipeline construction crews in the spring of 2019. It did not provide an update on when construction would be completed. There are concerns the project could cost more than its C$7.4 billion ($5.6 billion) budget, and be delayed past its current in-service date of December 2020. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has backed the project, which faces intense environmental and political opposition but would bring much needed relief to Canadian oil producers who are struggling to get their crude to market. The discount on Canada’s heavy crude hit a near five-year high earlier this month as rising production continued to outstrip space on congested pipelines. The Trans Mountain expansion, which would nearly triple capacity on the line to 890,000 barrels per day, is one of three major Canadian crude export pipeline projects in the works. Construction is already under way on an expansion at the Westridge Marine Terminal in Vancouver, with preliminary work being done at Kinder Morgan’s nearby terminal and tank farm. The NEB said 72 percent of the detailed final route for the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion had been approved, with hearings on the last segment set for October. Canada agreed in May to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline and project for C$4.5 billion, with the deal expected to close later this year. $1 = 1.3158 Canadian dollars

2018-08-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday named senior policy adviser Brian Hook as Washington’s special representative for Iran. The move came as the Trump administration prepared to increase economic pressure on Iran by restoring sanctions to force Tehran to end its nuclear weapons program and support for militant groups in the Middle East. Hook will lead a newly established Iran Action Group to coordinate the State Department’s pressure campaign on Iran, Pompeo told a news conference. The announcement was not a surprise. Hook, who has pushed for tough action against Iran, has been leading the department’s talks with allies in Europe and Asia to persuade them to support U.S. sanctions and cut off Iran’s oil supplies as of November. “The Iran Action Group will be responsible for directing, reviewing and coordinating all aspects of the State Department’s Iran-related activity, and will report directly to me,” Pompeo said. “We are committed to a whole-of-government effort to change the Iranian regime’s behavior, and the Iran Action Group will ensure that the Department of State remains closely synchronized with our interagency partners,” he added. President Donald Trump announced in May the United States was withdrawing from an Iran nuclear deal sealed in 2015 between Tehran and six world powers. The United States has said it would only end the sanctions if Iran allowed the negotiation of a tougher deal. Hook, who was a close adviser to former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, worked with U.S. national security advisor John Bolton on Iran sanctions while Bolton was the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush. Hook also served as an assistant secretary of state during Bush’s administration and was an adviser to the Republican presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Tim Pawlenty. Trump has said he would be willing to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, although Tehran said the way back to talks was for the United States to return to the nuclear deal. Asked whether he supported such a meeting and whether his brief would be to set up those talks, Hook said if Iran showed that it was willing to change its behavior, then Trump “was prepared to engage in dialogue in order to find solutions.” Washington aims to force Tehran to end its nuclear program and its support of militant groups in the Middle East, where Iran is involved in proxy wars from Yemen to Syria. Iran and other signatories, including Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, have been working to find a way to salvage the nuclear agreement, even as the United States has started reimposing some sanctions on Iran. Dennis Ross, a former U.S. official in Democratic and Republican administrations, said Hook’s new post might be a bureaucratic maneuver to try to inject more clarity into Washington’s policy toward Tehran. “It creates an address within the administration for ... making the approach a more coherent one, with someone being given broader responsibility across departments to try to shape the policy,” said Ross, now a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank. “At least that would be theory.” “The real question is ... is the policy going to continue to be just, basically, strong tough rhetoric and sanctions ... or is it going to be something more” to curtail what Washington sees as Iran’s destabilizing actions in Syria, Yemen and Iraq?” he added.
