2018-10-15,"Oct 15 (Reuters) - A group of young Americans suing the federal government over lack of action to fight climate change can proceed with their lawsuit, but President Donald Trump cannot be named as a defendant, a federal judge ruled on Monday. The decision by U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon, came just days before the case is scheduled to go to trial in federal court on Oct. 29. Twenty-one children and young adults, who were between eight and 19 when the lawsuit was filed in 2015 against the Obama administration, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of violating their due process rights by knowing for decades that carbon pollution poisons the environment, but doing nothing about it. Aiken said the case revealed a delicate balance of power between the judicial and other government agencies. The judge said those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case, but she concluded that the inclusion of Trump as the sitting U.S. president violated the proper separation of powers. The lawsuit still includes the heads of other U.S. agencies. The potentially far-reaching case is one of a handful seeking to have courts address global warming and its causes. The U.S. Justice Department and a spokeswoman for the young people did not immediately return a request for comment on Monday’s decision. The federal government in a court filing on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the case while it is seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The young adults say extreme weather events, such as flooding, caused them emotional trauma and damages to their health, safety, cultural practices, food security and economic stability. The government argued those injuries are widespread environmental phenomena affecting all other humans on the planet and said the issue did not belong in court. The federal defendants also contended that letting the case proceed would be too burdensome, would unconstitutionally pit the courts against the executive branch, and would require improper “agency decision-making” by forcing officials to answer questions about climate change. Aiken in her Monday decision rejected those arguments, saying the plaintiffs had offered extensive expert declarations to link their injuries to fossil fuel-induced climate change. She also said there was sufficient evidence that government actions, such as coal leasing, oil development and fossil fuel industry subsidies, led to the children’s injuries.

2018-10-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Monday, supported by geopolitical tension over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist that has stoked worries about supplies from Riyadh, but weighed by concern over long-term demand outlook. Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 35 cents to settle at $80.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 44 cents to settle at $71.78 a barrel. Last week, both contracts fell by more than 4 percent as U.S. stock markets tumbled. However, rising geopolitical tension between the United States, the world’s top oil consumer, and Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest crude producers, supported prices on Monday.  Riyadh has been under pressure since journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it is found that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. Saudi Arabia said it would retaliate for any action against it over the Khashoggi case, state news agency SPA reported on Sunday, quoting an official source. This comes at a critical time for global oil markets, which are bracing for U.S. sanctions against Iran due to come into force on Nov. 4.  The United States is still aiming to cut Iran’s oil sales to zero, Washington’s special envoy for Iran said on Monday.  Turkey and Italy are the last buyers of Iranian crude outside China, India and the Middle East, according to tanker data and an industry source, the latest sign that shipments are taking a major hit from the looming sanctions. Some producers are aiming to boost production amid the falling Iranian exports, with Iraq planning to increase oil exports from its southern ports to 4 millions barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2019. “If the Saudis don’t come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in ... it’s going to be a very undersupplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. However, some risk premium was taken out of the market when Trump on Monday raised the possibility that “rogue killers” could have been responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance. Exerting downward pressure on prices, Friday’s monthly report from the International Energy Agency said the market looked “adequately supplied for now” and cut its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next. [IEA/M] The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week said that the group saw the oil market as well supplied and that it was wary of creating a glut next year. Market participants also focused on a weakening gasoline crack spread. Gasoline’s premium to WTI sank to $9.49, the weakest since February 2017. “We are continuing to emphasize a virtual collapse in the NYMEX gasoline crack spreads as a bearish consideration to the crude markets that provided a significant offset to the weekend Saudi headlines in today’s trade,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

2018-10-15,"(Recasts with avoidance of power cuts) JOHANNESBURG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - South Africa’s state-owned power utility Eskom said on Monday it would not have to implement controlled power outages, after earlier warning these might be necessary due to pressure on the national grid. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power, was able to avoid controlled outages - known as load-shedding - after some power generating units were brought back into service and it was able to use diesel generators and renewable energy sources, spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. “The power system is currently stable, with no load-shedding being implemented despite a constrained national grid,” Phasiwe said on Twitter. Phasiwe warned of possible load-shedding earlier on Monday following power constraints due to maintenance and unplanned outages at several of its electricity-generating units. Last week, an employee was killed when the steam pressure from the boiler of a unit of Eskom’s Lethabo Power Station ruptured. The utility estimated the unit would be out of service for a minimum of three months. Eskom, which has a total national output of 45,000 megawatts, carried out load-shedding in 2015, denting economic output.

2018-10-15,"* Oil wobbles as West criticizes Saudi over missing journalist * Europe stocks tick higher after touching 22 month low * Safe havens shine: Yen, Swiss franc, gold rise (Updates prices, comments) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over the pace of global economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe-havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold. Oil prices were little changed as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term. The yen touched a one-month high versus the greenback and the Swiss franc rose for the fourth session in five while gold hit its highest since late July. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe into the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2. Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters. Over the weekend, prominent business people including JPMorgan’s CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference later this month in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter. U.S. crude rose 0.55 percent to $71.73 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.72, up 0.36 percent on the day. “If the Saudis don’t come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in... it’s going to be a very under-supplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed, with defensive sector stocks rising after soft retail sales data. Apple was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 126.36 points, or 0.5 percent, to 25,466.35, the S&P 500 lost 2.88 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,764.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.89 points, or 0.07 percent, to 7,492.01. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.20 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.05 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 0.72 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 1.04 percent lower. Japan’s Nikkei slumped 1.9 percent. Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan. The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after hitting last week their highest level in over seven years. The euro rose 0.16 percent to $1.1581. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.29 percent versus the greenback at 111.88 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3155, up 0.01 percent on the day. The Swiss franc rose 0.40 percent versus the greenback at 0.9873 per dollar. Turkey’s lira jumped 1.6 percent to its strongest since mid-August after Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations. Saudi Arabia’s riyal currency was still testing the boundaries of its peg at 3.7514 to the dollar - its weakest spot rate since June 2017. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 6/32 in price to yield 3.1633 percent, from 3.141 percent late on Friday. Last week, 10-year yield reached 3.261 percent, which was last seen in May 2011, while the 30-year yield hit a four-year peak at 3.446 percent. “The market will likely settle into its new range after the volatile trading of the past couple of weeks,” said Boris Rjavinski at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. Spot gold added 0.7 percent to $1,225.66 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 0.76 percent to $1,226.40 an ounce. Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, Stephanie Kelly, Karen Brettell

2018-10-15,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA is preparing to pay holders of its 2020 bond some $950 million this month, after failing to make interest payments on most other bonds this year, sources at the company and in the local financial sector said. PDVSA has fallen behind on more than $7 billion in principal and interest payments since the end of 2017, according to market sources and Refinitiv data, as an economic crisis in Venezuela has worsened.  But cash-strapped PDVSA has stayed current on the 2020 issue, which is backed by 50.1 percent of shares in U.S. refining network Citgo. “Quevedo gave his approval to arrange this payment,” said one person at PDVSA familiar with the plans, referring to Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela’s oil minister who is also president of PDVSA. “It will be paid in full.” Another source at PDVSA and three sources in Venezuela’s financial industry confirmed that the company plans to pay. The sources spoke last week and requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.   Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela’s oil ministry immediately responded to requests for comment. PDVSA must pay $840 million by Oct. 27 to cover an amortization payment on the bond, and then has 30 more days to make a $107 million interest payment.  “PDVSA has been making payments on the 2020 bond and they tell us they plan to keep doing so,” said one local financial operator who has spoken with the company about the plans. To be sure, this year PDVSA has made payments only on its 2020 and 2022 bonds, prompting ratings agencies to declare the company and Venezuela’s government in selective default. The drop in crude prices that began in 2014 and an ensuing decline in production have reduced the OPEC nation’s government revenue. Investors believe PDVSA will prioritize the 2020 bond because of the potential implications for Citgo. The remaining shares in the refiner are already pledged to Russia’s Rosneft as collateral on a $1.5 billion loan.  And it is also under threat from Canadian miner Crystallex, which has won a judge’s authorization to seize Citgo shares to collect on a $1.4 billion award stemming from a decade-long nationalization dispute. “PDVSA has demonstrated via its legal efforts a strong preference to maintain ownership of Citgo,” JP Morgan wrote in a note to clients last week.

2018-10-15,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry said on Monday it would order roughly 100,000 Opel vehicles to be recalled as part of an emissions probe, after prosecutors searched the carmaker’s offices earlier in the day. German motor vehicle authority KBA found four software programs capable of altering vehicle emissions in 2015, and ordered Opel to implement a software update in cars to remove them, Germany’s Transport Ministry said in a statement. “After a fifth software device was discovered in early 2018, which KBA found to be illegal, there is currently an official hearing going on with the goal of imposing a mandatory recall for the models Cascada, Insignia and Zafira,” the ministry said in a statement. The transport ministry said Opel had dragged its feet on the hearing. The KBA had told Frankfurt prosecutors about the software device in April, it said. “The official recall of the affected roughly 100,000 vehicles will take place shortly,” it added. Opel said in a statement it rejected any accusation of using illegal defeat devices that can manipulate exhaust emission tests, also denying it was procrastinating. “Should (a mandatory recall) be ordered, Opel will challenge it legally,” said the carmaker . German prosecutors searched offices at Opel’s sites in Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern earlier on Monday.  The Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said it was probing 95,000 vehicles equipped with Euro 6d engines. PSA Group, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, declined to comment.  The Opel Insignia, Zafira and Cascada were developed when Opel and its sister brand Vauxhall were still owned by General Motors. General Motors sold Opel to PSA Group in 2017. Opel admitted in 2016 that its Zafira model contained engine software which switched off exhaust emissions treatment systems under certain circumstances. Opel insisted at the time that it was making use of a legal loophole.

2018-10-15,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Sixty people were killed after a fire broke out on Friday on an oil pipeline in the southeast of Nigeria, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said on Monday, up from the tally of 16 dead given by officials three days earlier. The state oil company on Friday said pumping on the System 2E pipeline network had been halted.  “We will resume the pumping of products very soon,” NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu told Reuters on Monday. “We had put out the fire. We are now pumping water in the pipeline to detect other possible areas of leakages.” The System 2E pipeline is a key network that supplies imported gasoline and output from the Port Harcourt refineries to much of the southeast and north of the country. The two refining plants at Port Harcourt operate far below their 210,000 barrels per day capacity.  In an emailed statement, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it had been prevented from pumping fuel to the southeastern Enugu Depot “which has remained underutilised despite its recent rehabilitation by the NNPC”. Many oil spills in the southern oil production heartland of Africa’s biggest crude producer are caused by theft and pipeline sabotage. The methods used to steal the oil often result in accidents that cause fires. The state oil company , which on Friday gave a death toll of 16, said the fire had been caused by pipeline vandals who breached the pipeline in Ososioma near the southeastern city of Aba.

2018-10-15,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Global oil major BP (BP.L) said on Monday fuel price controls were “not good”, days after India asked state-run fuel retailers to shield customers from record-high costs by cutting margins. BP has a tie-up with Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, to enter India’s downstream sector, including natural gas marketing and retail fuel sales. “I think that price controls are a kind of thing that will not be good for the sector in the longer term,” Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP, said at the India Energy Forum organised by IHS CERA. He did not comment on when BP would open its first fuel retail outlet in India in partnership with Reliance. India cut taxes on diesel and gasoline this month and asked state companies, which account for the bulk of retail fuel sales in the country, to reduce the price of the two sensitive auto-fuels by one rupees on every litre of fuel sold. The move was widely seen as government intervention in local fuel pricing, although Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said the step should not be seen as going back to a regulated regime. The government has since said it would not interfere with market-determined prices of gasoline and diesel. “I have not heard any suggestions that India will go back to price controls. There have been some reductions on parts of the taxes,” Dudley told reporters in New Delhi on Monday.  BP, which has tied up with Reliance to explore gas fields in India, expects to have a 10 percent gas market share by 2022, Dudley said, adding he expected BP India’s gas production with Reliance to be 1 billion cubic feet per day in five years. He said he was hopeful that over that timeframe the company would have large retailing partnerships with Reliance and a strong presence in India’s solar market.  In 2011, BP paid $7.2 billion to buy a 30 percent stake in Reliance’s fields and promised an additional $1.8 billion for future performance payments. However, both companies held off from announcing any major investments in the field as the local natural gas price did not support a sufficient return on investment. The government allowed higher prices from deepwater natural gas reserves from October 2014.  Dudley said the low natural gas price in India before 2014 was a major factor that slowed down its investments in the country. Last year, Reliance and BP announced an investment of $6 billion to develop three fields in the east coast of India which would add around 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas between 2020 and 2022. “We plan for the long term and we’re here in India for the long term,” Dudley said on Monday, referring to BP’s plans for India.

2018-10-15,"(Adds poll showing Bolsonaro with wide lead) RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brazil’s far-right presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro could revise the country’s model of production-sharing contracts in its coveted pre-salt oil fields if he wins this month’s election, newspaper Valor reported on Monday. The poll leader ahead of the Oct. 28 run-off vote could also end overseas financing by state development bank BNDES , Valor reported, citing unnamed campaign sources, as Bolsonaro looks to overhaul the country’s state-run entities. A longstanding advocate of state control over key strategic assets like government-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, Bolsonaro has recently changed tack, falling more closely in line with key advisors who favor privatizing assets. But a rival camp of advisors, made up of military generals, have urged Bolsonaro to maintain control of Petrobras and other assets they consider strategic, Reuters reported last week, opening up a split that could disappoint investors who snapped up Petrobras shares in the wake of Bolsonaro’s first-round win. Bolsonaro’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Petrobras shares were up 2.2 percent in late morning trading. Bolsonaro maintained a wide lead over his leftist rival Fernando Haddad in a second election poll looking at voter intentions for the run-off vote that was published on Monday. The Ibope poll showed that Bolsonaro had 59 percent of voter support, compared to Haddad’s 41 percent. Brazil’s production-sharing contract model for its pre-salt oil fields was rolled out by the leftist Workers Party, which ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years, and has been blamed by many for a weak economy and endemic graft. Reformed by the center-right government of Michel Temer, who took office in 2016 after former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, the production-sharing model has proved successful in recent auctions, luring oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp Chevron Corp, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc , and BP Plc. Higher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted oil majors’ appetites for costlier offshore ventures, pumping much-needed money into Brazil’s coffers. The Valor article did not give details on how Bolsonaro would tweak the production-sharing model, but cited campaign sources who said the aim was to attack some of the political abuses perpetrated by previous administrations. Under Rousseff, Brazil’s government used the BNDES to offer loans to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and Mozambique that they would use to contract Brazilian firms. The Brazilian government, under Rousseff, had agreed to act as the guarantor of the loans. The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms. In May, Brazil said it would continue to insist Venezuela and Mozambique pay back nearly 1 billion reais ($281.05 million) in loans they defaulted on to BNDES and Switzerland’s Credit Suisse.

2018-10-15,"(Adds updates on Narrabri mine status, thermal coal outlook, details) Oct 16 (Reuters) - Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd on Thursday said equity coal sales fell 14 percent in the September quarter, as certain mechanical issues choked output from its Narrabri mine. Equity coal sales for the quarter came in at 4.1 million tonnes, compared to the 4.7 million tonnes clocked in the corresponding period a year ago. The figure overtook a UBS forecast of 3.84 million tonnes. This result follows a disappointing June quarter which saw equity coal sales decline 7.0 percent, again due to issues at Narrabri when the company had said longwall production at the mine is expected to recommence in September. The company said production at Narrabri has returned to normal and is currently ramping up on schedule. Whitehaven said it sold thermal coal for an average of $113 per tonne over the quarter, at a 4.0 percent discount to the Newcastle index price of $117.51 per tonne. Newcastle coal is thermal coal exported from the port of Newcastle in New South Wales and is the price benchmark for seaborne thermal coal in the Asia-Pacific region. “Thermal coal demand in the global power industry increased by 3.4 percent year-over-year in 2017 and is forecast to increase by a further 2.4 percent year-over-year in 2018,” said Whitehaven. Australian spot thermal coal prices have traded around six-year highs in recent months, pushed up by a summer heatwave across the northern hemisphere as well as output cuts in China, the world’s biggest consumer of coal. Whitehaven’s stock, which debuted on the Australian exchange in 2007, has advanced over 24 percent so far this year on the back of intensifying demand for coal.

2018-10-15,"(Adds coal industry comment) Oct 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration is considering using West Coast military facilities to export coal and natural gas to Asia, according to an Associated Press report on Monday, citing U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The move would help fossil fuel producers ship their products to Asia and circumvent environmental concerns in Democratic-leaning states like Washington, Oregon and California that have rejected efforts to build new coal ports. In an interview in Montana, Zinke told AP “it’s in our interest for national security and our allies to make sure that they have access to affordable energy commodities” and proposed using naval facilities or other federal properties for exports. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, said the former Naval Air Facility Adak in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands could be used to export natural gas. He did not specify any others. Asked to confirm the report, Interior Department spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said: “The President and Secretary are committed to the men and women of coal country, and it should come as no surprise that Secretary Zinke has put a number of options on the table to revitalize these communities and achieve American Energy Dominance.” The idea drew praise from the U.S. coal industry, which is eager to overcome a dearth of export terminals on the U.S. West Coast. Currently, U.S. coal exported into the Pacific basin must go through Canada’s British Columbia. “While we haven’t seen any specifics around this proposal, any move to support the export of U.S. coal to our allies would be welcome,” said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman for the National Mining Association, which represents U.S. coal mining companies. “The development of an export terminal in the Pacific Northwest of the United States would significantly enhance U.S. allies’ access to secure, high-quality, low-sulfur coal and should be welcomed on both sides of the Pacific,” Rick Curtsinger, a spokesman for Cloud Peak Energy, a Wyoming coal company, said in an emailed statement. U.S. President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry a central tenet of his administration and has rolled back environmental regulations to give the industry a boost. The coal industry has eyed the West Coast as a gateway to the global market for years, with plans for as many as seven terminals on the books a decade ago. Five of those projects were canceled though amid volatile Asian demand and state opposition. Coal producers are fighting for the remaining two proposed projects in California and Washington. Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, issued a statement calling the proposal “reckless.” “This effort is just the latest attempt at an end run around Washington’s authority to safeguard the health and safety of our people,” Inslee said.

2018-10-15,"(Reuters) - A group of young Americans suing the federal government over lack of action to fight climate change can proceed with their lawsuit, but U.S. President Donald Trump cannot be named as a defendant, a federal judge ruled on Monday. The decision by U.S. District Judge Ann Aiken in Eugene, Oregon, came before the case is scheduled to go to trial in federal court on Oct. 29. Twenty-one children and young adults, who were between 8 and 19 years of age when the lawsuit was filed in 2015 against the Obama administration, accused federal officials and oil industry executives of violating their due process rights by knowing for decades that carbon pollution poisons the environment, but doing nothing about it. Aiken said the case revealed a delicate balance of power between the judicial and other government agencies. The judge said those concerns were not enough to warrant a dismissal of the entire case, but she concluded that the inclusion of Trump as the sitting U.S. president violated the proper separation of powers. The original lawsuit had named President Barack Obama as a defendant. After Trump took office, the lawsuit was amended to instead name Trump as a defendant.  The lawsuit still includes the heads of other U.S. agencies. The names of the heads of those agencies were also amended with the change to the Trump administration. The potentially far-reaching case is one of a handful seeking to have courts address global warming and its causes. The U.S. Justice Department said it was reviewing Monday’s decision and in a statement called the lawsuit an unconstitutional attempt to control the entire country’s climate and energy policy through a single court. A spokeswoman for the plaintiffs did not return a request for comment on Monday’s decision. The federal government in a court filing on Friday asked the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to halt the case while it is seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The plaintiffs say in the lawsuit that extreme weather events, such as flooding, caused them emotional trauma and damage to their health, safety, cultural practices, food security and economic stability. The government argued those injuries are widespread environmental phenomena affecting all other people on the planet and said the issue did not belong in court. The federal defendants also contended that letting the case proceed would be too burdensome, would unconstitutionally pit the courts against the executive branch, and would require improper “agency decision-making” by forcing officials to answer questions about climate change. Aiken in her Monday decision rejected those arguments, saying the plaintiffs had offered extensive expert declarations to link their injuries to fossil fuel-induced climate change. She also said there was sufficient evidence that government actions, such as coal leasing, oil development and fossil fuel industry subsidies, led to the children’s injuries.

2018-10-15,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s plan to allow year-round sales of higher-grade corn ethanol would have limited impact on the depressed U.S. ethanol market, with record supplies and prices for the fuel hovering near the lowest in a decade, analysts said. President Donald Trump announced the decision last week ahead of a campaign trip to Iowa, the top producer of corn and ethanol. With mid-term elections looming, Trump aimed to give a boost to corn producers in the Farm Belt, who helped secure his narrow 2016 election victory. He said his administration would allow a waiver for sales of E15, which was banned from June 1 to Sept. 15 and has about 5 percent more ethanol than the most common E10 gasoline formulation. The cheaper E15 variety is not allowed in some U.S. states during the summer because its higher alcohol content can make it evaporate more quickly in warmer temperatures, increasing smog. Oil refiners are opposed to the move and have vowed to sue, arguing that only Congress can lift the ban. Even if the plan moves forward by next summer and hundreds of mostly small and rural gasoline station chains install new dispensers to sell E15, overall sales likely would increase only slightly.     There are more than 1,300 stations with pumps that can dispense E15, according to the Renewable Fuels Association trade group. That is a small portion of the estimated 122,000  stations in the country, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores.     RFA said the number of stations offering E15 could double to around 2,700 by late 2019 to early 2020, or 2.2 percent of the total. Analysts said large oil refiners were unlikely to build new infrastructure for E15. Major fuel sellers, including BP, Exxon Mobile Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Valero Energy did not respond to requests for comment. Mark Lytle, a vice president at pipeline and terminal operator Pro Petroleum, said his company would consider adding ethanol tank storage if fueling stations start demanding more of the biofuel. But due to the uncertainty regarding challenges to the measure, expansions in the short-term were unlikely. Lytle said it can cost $250,000 to add fuel pumps, tanks and other equipment - investments that could take about six years to pay off with sales of E15.   “There’s a lot of capital investment that’s required,” Lytle said. “It’s simply return on investment – can I sell enough E15 to pay for my project?”   Ethanol makers are desperate for any demand boost. U.S. supplies last week swelled to 24 million barrels, just below a record from March. The market has been under pressure since China, formerly the top importer of U.S. ethanol, imposed tariffs on shipments as part of the Washington-Beijing trade spat. J.P. Morgan analyst Ann Duignan said infrastructure to dispense E15 is insufficient. “The likely impact on U.S. ethanol and corn demand in the foreseeable future is immaterial, in our view,” she said in a note.  Casey’s General Stores Inc said in a statement that it would expand E15 offerings to as many as 500 of its 2,000 stores over the next few years. The Sheetz Inc gas station chain will add E15 pumps at each of the 20 to 25 new stores it builds annually during the coming years, said Michael Lorenz, vice president of petroleum supply at Sheetz. Sheetz already offers E15 at 240 of its 580 locations in the eastern United States. Ethanol prices of $1.30 per gallon were 64 cents cheaper than gasoline on Monday. Sheetz sells E15 at about 5 cents less than regular gasoline. “The consumer is sensitive to price when it comes to gasoline. They appreciate (E15) being offered at a lower price,” Lorenz said.

2018-10-15,"Oct 15 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering using West Coast military facilities to export coal and natural gas to Asia, according to an Associated Press report on Monday citing U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. The move would help fossil fuel producers ship their products to Asia and circumvent environmental concerns in Democratic-leaning states like Washington, Oregon and California that have rejected efforts to build new coal ports. In an interview in Billings, Montana, Zinke told AP “it’s in our interest for national security and our allies to make sure that they have access to affordable energy commodities” and proposed using naval facilities or other federal properties for exports. Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, said the former Naval Air Facility Adak in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands could be used to export natural gas. He did not specify any others. Asked to confirm the report, Interior Department spokeswoman Faith Vander Voort said: “The President and Secretary are committed to the men and women of coal country, and it should come as no surprise that Secretary Zinke has put a number of options on the table to revitalize these communities and achieve American Energy Dominance.” U.S. President Donald Trump has made reviving the coal industry, and the declining communities that depend upon its jobs, a central tenet of his administration and has rolled back Obama-era environmental regulations to give the industry a boost. Jay Inslee, the Democratic governor of Washington state, issued a statement calling the proposal “reckless.” “The men and women who serve at our military bases are there to keep our country safe, not to service an export facility for private fossil fuel companies,” Inslee said, adding the state had learned about the proposal via news reports and not from the administration. “This effort is just the latest attempt at an end run around Washington’s authority to safeguard the health and safety of our people.” (Reporting by Nichola Groom in Los Angeles Editing by Matthew Lewis)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-coal/u-s-eyes-west-coast-military-bases-to-export-coal-gas-report-idUKL2N1WV1GZ,15 Oct 2018,"The Trump administration is considering

2018-10-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Monday, supported by geopolitical tension over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist that has stoked worries about supplies from Riyadh, but weighed by concern over long-term demand outlook. Brent crude futures for December delivery rose 35 cents to settle at $80.78 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 44 cents to settle at $71.78 a barrel. Last week, both contracts fell by more than 4 percent as U.S. stock markets tumbled. However, rising geopolitical tension between the United States, the world’s top oil consumer, and Saudi Arabia, one of the biggest crude producers, supported prices on Monday.  Riyadh has been under pressure since journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it is found that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. Saudi Arabia said it would retaliate for any action against it over the Khashoggi case, state news agency SPA reported on Sunday, quoting an official source. This comes at a critical time for global oil markets, which are bracing for U.S. sanctions against Iran due to come into force on Nov. 4.  The United States is still aiming to cut Iran’s oil sales to zero, Washington’s special envoy for Iran said on Monday.  Turkey and Italy are the last buyers of Iranian crude outside China, India and the Middle East, according to tanker data and an industry source, the latest sign that shipments are taking a major hit from the looming sanctions. Some producers are aiming to boost production amid the falling Iranian exports, with Iraq planning to increase oil exports from its southern ports to 4 millions barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2019. “If the Saudis don’t come to the rescue when the Iranian sanctions kick in ... it’s going to be a very undersupplied market. That was the fear that was initially driving prices higher,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. However, some risk premium was taken out of the market when Trump on Monday raised the possibility that “rogue killers” could have been responsible for Khashoggi’s disappearance. Exerting downward pressure on prices, Friday’s monthly report from the International Energy Agency said the market looked “adequately supplied for now” and cut its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next. [IEA/M] The secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last week said that the group saw the oil market as well supplied and that it was wary of creating a glut next year. Market participants also focused on a weakening gasoline crack spread. Gasoline’s premium to WTI sank to $9.49, the weakest since February 2017. “We are continuing to emphasize a virtual collapse in the NYMEX gasoline crack spreads as a bearish consideration to the crude markets that provided a significant offset to the weekend Saudi headlines in today’s trade,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

2018-10-15,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-owned oil company PDVSA is preparing to pay holders of its 2020 bond some $950 million this month, after failing to make interest payments on most other bonds this year, sources at the company and in the local financial sector said. PDVSA has fallen behind on more than $7 billion in principal and interest payments since the end of 2017, according to market sources and Refinitiv data, as an economic crisis in Venezuela has worsened.  But cash-strapped PDVSA has stayed current on the 2020 issue, which is backed by 50.1 percent of shares in U.S. refining network Citgo. “Quevedo gave his approval to arrange this payment,” said one person at PDVSA familiar with the plans, referring to Manuel Quevedo, Venezuela’s oil minister who is also president of PDVSA. “It will be paid in full.” Another source at PDVSA and three sources in Venezuela’s financial industry confirmed that the company plans to pay. The sources spoke last week and requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.   Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela’s oil ministry immediately responded to requests for comment. PDVSA must pay $840 million by Oct. 27 to cover an amortization payment on the bond, and then has 30 more days to make a $107 million interest payment.  “PDVSA has been making payments on the 2020 bond and they tell us they plan to keep doing so,” said one local financial operator who has spoken with the company about the plans. To be sure, this year PDVSA has made payments only on its 2020 and 2022 bonds, prompting ratings agencies to declare the company and Venezuela’s government in selective default. The drop in crude prices that began in 2014 and an ensuing decline in production have reduced the OPEC nation’s government revenue. Investors believe PDVSA will prioritize the 2020 bond because of the potential implications for Citgo. The remaining shares in the refiner are already pledged to Russia’s Rosneft as collateral on a $1.5 billion loan.  And it is also under threat from Canadian miner Crystallex, which has won a judge’s authorization to seize Citgo shares to collect on a $1.4 billion award stemming from a decade-long nationalization dispute. “PDVSA has demonstrated via its legal efforts a strong preference to maintain ownership of Citgo,” JP Morgan wrote in a note to clients last week.

2018-10-15,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany’s Transport Ministry said on Monday it would order roughly 100,000 Opel vehicles to be recalled as part of an emissions probe, after prosecutors searched the carmaker’s offices earlier in the day. German motor vehicle authority KBA found four software programs capable of altering vehicle emissions in 2015, and ordered Opel to implement a software update in cars to remove them, Germany’s Transport Ministry said in a statement. “After a fifth software device was discovered in early 2018, which KBA found to be illegal, there is currently an official hearing going on with the goal of imposing a mandatory recall for the models Cascada, Insignia and Zafira,” the ministry said in a statement. The transport ministry said Opel had dragged its feet on the hearing. The KBA had told Frankfurt prosecutors about the software device in April, it said. “The official recall of the affected roughly 100,000 vehicles will take place shortly,” it added. Opel said in a statement it rejected any accusation of using illegal defeat devices that can manipulate exhaust emission tests, also denying it was procrastinating. “Should (a mandatory recall) be ordered, Opel will challenge it legally,” said the carmaker . German prosecutors searched offices at Opel’s sites in Ruesselsheim and Kaiserslautern earlier on Monday.  The Frankfurt prosecutor’s office said it was probing 95,000 vehicles equipped with Euro 6d engines. PSA Group, which owns the Opel and Vauxhall brands, declined to comment.  The Opel Insignia, Zafira and Cascada were developed when Opel and its sister brand Vauxhall were still owned by General Motors. General Motors sold Opel to PSA Group in 2017. Opel admitted in 2016 that its Zafira model contained engine software which switched off exhaust emissions treatment systems under certain circumstances. Opel insisted at the time that it was making use of a legal loophole.

2018-10-15,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Sixty people were killed after a fire broke out on Friday on an oil pipeline in the southeast of Nigeria, a spokesman for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said on Monday, up from the tally of 16 dead given by officials three days earlier. The state oil company on Friday said pumping on the System 2E pipeline network had been halted.  “We will resume the pumping of products very soon,” NNPC spokesman Ndu Ughamadu told Reuters on Monday. “We had put out the fire. We are now pumping water in the pipeline to detect other possible areas of leakages.” The System 2E pipeline is a key network that supplies imported gasoline and output from the Port Harcourt refineries to much of the southeast and north of the country. The two refining plants at Port Harcourt operate far below their 210,000 barrels per day capacity.  In an emailed statement, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said it had been prevented from pumping fuel to the southeastern Enugu Depot “which has remained underutilised despite its recent rehabilitation by the NNPC”. Many oil spills in the southern oil production heartland of Africa’s biggest crude producer are caused by theft and pipeline sabotage. The methods used to steal the oil often result in accidents that cause fires. The state oil company , which on Friday gave a death toll of 16, said the fire had been caused by pipeline vandals who breached the pipeline in Ososioma near the southeastern city of Aba.

2018-10-15,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Global oil major BP (BP.L) said on Monday fuel price controls were “not good”, days after India asked state-run fuel retailers to shield customers from record-high costs by cutting margins. BP has a tie-up with Reliance Industries (RELI.NS), owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, to enter India’s downstream sector, including natural gas marketing and retail fuel sales. “I think that price controls are a kind of thing that will not be good for the sector in the longer term,” Bob Dudley, Group Chief Executive of BP, said at the India Energy Forum organised by IHS CERA. He did not comment on when BP would open its first fuel retail outlet in India in partnership with Reliance. India cut taxes on diesel and gasoline this month and asked state companies, which account for the bulk of retail fuel sales in the country, to reduce the price of the two sensitive auto-fuels by one rupees on every litre of fuel sold. The move was widely seen as government intervention in local fuel pricing, although Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said the step should not be seen as going back to a regulated regime. The government has since said it would not interfere with market-determined prices of gasoline and diesel. “I have not heard any suggestions that India will go back to price controls. There have been some reductions on parts of the taxes,” Dudley told reporters in New Delhi on Monday.  BP, which has tied up with Reliance to explore gas fields in India, expects to have a 10 percent gas market share by 2022, Dudley said, adding he expected BP India’s gas production with Reliance to be 1 billion cubic feet per day in five years. He said he was hopeful that over that timeframe the company would have large retailing partnerships with Reliance and a strong presence in India’s solar market.  In 2011, BP paid $7.2 billion to buy a 30 percent stake in Reliance’s fields and promised an additional $1.8 billion for future performance payments. However, both companies held off from announcing any major investments in the field as the local natural gas price did not support a sufficient return on investment. The government allowed higher prices from deepwater natural gas reserves from October 2014.  Dudley said the low natural gas price in India before 2014 was a major factor that slowed down its investments in the country. Last year, Reliance and BP announced an investment of $6 billion to develop three fields in the east coast of India which would add around 30-35 million standard cubic metres per day (mscmd) of gas between 2020 and 2022. “We plan for the long term and we’re here in India for the long term,” Dudley said on Monday, referring to BP’s plans for India.

2018-10-15,"* Oil wobbles as West criticizes Saudi over missing journalist * Europe stocks tick higher after touching 22-month low * Safe havens shine: Yen, Swiss franc, gold rise (Updates after U.S. market open, changes dateline; previous LONDON) By Rodrigo Campos NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Major stock markets slipped on Monday as rising tensions between Western powers and Saudi Arabia added to concerns over economic growth, with investors flocking to traditional safe havens like the Japanese and Swiss currencies, as well as gold. Oil prices were little changed as the Saudi-West rift more than offset concerns over slowing demand for oil in the long term. The yen touched a one-month high versus the greenback and the Swiss franc rose for the fourth session in five while gold hit its highest since late July. Saudi Arabia’s King Salman on Monday ordered an internal probe of the unexplained disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi as a joint Turkish-Saudi team was expected at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where the journalist and dissident was last seen on Oct. 2. Turkish police have audio showing Khashoggi was killed at the consulate, sources told Reuters. Over the weekend, prominent business people, including JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Ford Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend an investor conference later this month in Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter. U.S. crude fell 0.32 percent to $71.11 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.15, down 0.35 percent on the day. “People had thought the Saudis would make up for the fall in Iran’s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter,” said Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, a think-tank affiliated with the Japanese government. On Wall Street, major indexes were mixed after soft U.S. retail sales data. Apple was among the largest drags after a warning from Goldman Sachs regarding overall consumer demand from China. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 59.82 points, or 0.24 percent, to 25,280.17, the S&P 500 gained 0.97 points, or 0.04 percent, to 2,768.1 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 25.43 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,471.47. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.27 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.10 percent. Emerging market stocks rose 2.66 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.35 percent higher. Japan’s Nikkei slumped 1.8 percent after Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan. The dollar softened against major currencies after the weak U.S. retail sales data for September while Treasury yields were little changed after last week hitting their highest level in over seven years. The euro rose 0.26 percent to $1.1592. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.37 percent versus the greenback at 111.81 per dollar, while Sterling was last trading at $1.3161, up 0.05 percent on the day. The Swiss franc rose 0.4300 percent versus the greenback at 0.99 per dollar. Turkey’s lira jumped 1.5 percent to its strongest since mid-August after U.S. President Donald Trump cheered the release of a U.S. pastor who had been under house arrest in Turkey. Investors hope his release can lead to an improvement in strained U.S.-Turkey relations. Saudi Arabia’s riyal currency was still testing the boundaries of its peg at 3.7514 to the dollar - its weakest spot rate since June 2017. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 5/32 in price to yield 3.1576 percent, from 3.141 percent late on Friday. Last week, the 10-year yield reached 3.261 percent, which was last seen in May 2011, while the 30-year yield hit a four-year peak at 3.446 percent. “This (Treasury) market sell-off is far from over. The economy is still very strong,” said Bryce Doty, senior portfolio manager at Sit Fixed Income Advisors LLC in Minneapolis. Spot gold added 0.9 percent to $1,227.84 an ounce. U.S. gold futures gained 1.17 percent to $1,232.30 an ounce. Reporting by Rodrigo Campos, Karen Brettell and Richard Leong

2018-10-15,"(Reuters) - Battered oil and gas drilling companies are finally seeing piecemeal signs that the prices they charge for offshore rigs are bottoming out with Brent crude LCoc1 selling for more than $80 a barrel and some are forecasting a full turn in the market by 2020. At the depths of a global slide that took oil below $27 a barrel in early 2016, daily rates for leasing the most sophisticated floating drilling rigs had fallen to just $180,000 from $500,000 a day, as producer returns from North Sea, Latin America and Canadian drilling evaporated. Transocean Ltd (RIGN.S), a top supplier of drilling vessels, said last month that rates for its new high-spec vessels in the North Sea are now fetching $300,000 a day. Drillers have been predicting an upturn for more than a year only to disappoint but debt ratings firm Moody’s Investors Services said last month that it believed 2018 could mark the low point for industry earnings. In addition to higher crude prices, analysts and industry players say a wave of consolidation is expected to help remove excess capacity from the market. Transocean last year acquired rival Songa Offshore SE [SONG.UL] and recently agreed to buy deep water expert Ocean Rig UDW ORIG.O for $2.7 billion. London-based Ensco Plc (ESV.N) took over Atwood Oceanics for $1.76 billion last year and this month struck a $2.38 billion deal to buy smaller rival Rowan Cos Plc (RDC.N) and its stake in a joint venture with Saudi Arabia’s Aramco. Tie-ups with state run giants like Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE and Qatar Petroleum [QATPE.UL] are expected to boost rates in the Middle East for drillers in the jack-up - or shallow water - rig market, while the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and West Africa are already showing signs of recovery, Rystad Energy analyst Oddmund Fore said. “A significant number of units need to be re-activated to meet the growing demand and also an upwards pressure on utilization so ... we will see a substantial uptick in rig rates,” he added. North American oil producers are facing pipeline constraints in their onshore operations, particularly at the United States’ largest oil field in the Permian basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The U.S. rig count, which hit 869 on Oct. 12, has largely been flat since June. Recent auctions of offshore blocks in Brazil, Mexico and large discoveries off Guyana point to future demand for drill ships. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.AS) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) bid heavily to clinch stakes nL2N1WE0B6 in Brazil’s offshore oil play last month and research firm IHS Markit expects 2020 global offshore rig demand to average 521 units, up from a 2018 estimate of 453 units. “We really see (the) ultra-deepwater drilling market turning up,” Transocean CEO Jeremy Thigpen said during a conference call in Oslo last month. In September, Transocean extended a crucial rig deal with Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA), while Noble Corp (NE.N) has signed a new drilling contract in the Middle East for its new jack-up rig and expects rising demand into 2019. “I think the path to recovery is quite clear for us all now ... and, dare I say it, we are seeing the green shoots of a recovery,” Diamond Offshore CEO Marc Gerard told a Barclays energy conference last month.

2018-10-15,"(Reuters) - Kazatomprom [KZTPR.UL], the world’s biggest uranium producer, said it will float up to a 25 percent stake in its planned initial public offering in London and Kazakhstan, as it looks to cash in on robust demand for the rare metal. The Kazakh company said in an IPO registration document, seen by Reuters, that it plans to publish the prospectus for the offering on Nov. 13. However, the global market for IPOs has been hit by recent turmoil in financial markets, prompting a number of companies to put listing plans on hold and Kazatomprom’s plans are also subject to market conditions. The IPO is part of an ambitious privatisation programme set by Kazakhstan after Central Asia’s biggest economy was hard hit by the fall in world oil prices. Kazatomprom said in a statement on Monday that Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, its sole shareholder, would sell shares in the offering in London and Astana but would still hold at least 75 percent of the company’s issued share capital after the IPO.  Kazatomprom accounts for 20 percent of the world’s uranium production and seven years on from Japan’s Fukushima nuclear disaster, the beaten down uranium sector is attracting interest again. “The company believes that the supply side of the uranium market is undergoing a structural shift, following a prolonged period of depressed spot prices and oversupply, underpinned by the prevalence of legacy long-term contracts, the majority of which were concluded in the period between years 2005 and 2012,” Kazatomprom said on Monday. “As a significant portion of such (legacy long-term) contracts are set to expire in early 2020s, many utilities are likely to return to the market in the near-to medium-term to begin covering their future fuel needs,” it said. Fifty six new nuclear reactors were under construction in 17 countries at the end of August, it added. Kazakhstan’s close economic links with Russia could pose risks as Western sanctions imposed on Russia, or any future sanctions, could have an adverse effect on Kazakhstan’s economy and the group’s business, but the IPO is still expected to be keenly awaited.  “It (Kazatomprom IPO) is only going to generate further interest and introduce new investors to the commodity,” Andre Liebenberg, CEO of uranium fund Yellow Cake (YCA.L), said.     Kazatomprom said it has hired Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners for the share offering. China International Capital Corporation, Halyk Finance and Mizuho International plc were joint bookrunners.  Kazatomprom was one of four large Kazakh companies slated to make public share offerings this year and next, alongside telecommunications firm Kazakhtelecom KZTK.KZ, flagship carrier Air Astana and state oil company KazMunayGaz. In a bid to develop Kazakhstan's domestic equities market, the government also wants here shares of newly privatised firms to be listed on its Astana bourse. As well as listing in London, Kazatomprom said it would list shares and potentially GDRs on the Astana International Exchange (AIX).  Following recent global market turmoil, Spanish oil company Cepsa became on Monday the latest firm to postpone listing plans, in what would have been the biggest oil IPO in a decade.

2018-10-15,"RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brazil’s far-right presidential front-runner Jair Bolsonaro could revise the country’s model of production-sharing contracts in its coveted pre-salt oil fields if he wins this month’s election, newspaper Valor reported on Monday. The poll leader ahead of the Oct. 28 run-off vote could also end overseas financing by state development bank BNDES , Valor reported, citing unnamed campaign sources, as Bolsonaro looks to overhaul the country’s state-run entities. A longstanding advocate of state control over key strategic assets like government-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, Bolsonaro has recently changed tack, falling more closely in line with key advisors who favor privatizing assets. But a rival camp of advisors, made up of military generals, have urged Bolsonaro to maintain control of Petrobras and other assets they consider strategic, Reuters reported last week, opening up a split that could disappoint investors who snapped up Petrobras shares in the wake of Bolsonaro’s first-round win. Bolsonaro’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Petrobras shares were up 2.2 percent in late morning trading. Brazil’s production-sharing contract model for its pre-salt oil fields was rolled out by the leftist Workers Party, which ran Brazil for 13 of the last 15 years, and has been blamed by many for a weak economy and endemic graft. Reformed by the center-right government of Michel Temer, who took office in 2016 after former President Dilma Rousseff was impeached, the production-sharing model has proved successful in recent auctions, luring oil majors like Exxon Mobil Corp Chevron Corp, Repsol SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc , and BP Plc. Higher oil prices and the need to replace shrinking reserves have boosted oil majors’ appetites for costlier offshore ventures, pumping much-needed money into Brazil’s coffers. The Valor article did not give details on how Bolsonaro would tweak the production-sharing model, but cited campaign sources who said the aim was to attack some of the political abuses perpetrated by previous administrations. Under Rousseff, Brazil’s government used the BNDES to offer loans to countries like Venezuela, Cuba and Mozambique that they would use to contract Brazilian firms. The Brazilian government, under Rousseff, had agreed to act as the guarantor of the loans. The funds were used by Venezuela and Mozambique to pay works carried out by Brazilian firms. In May, Brazil said it would continue to insist Venezuela and Mozambique pay back nearly 1 billion reais ($281.05 million) in loans they defaulted on to BNDES and Switzerland’s Credit Suisse.

2018-10-15,"LAGOS (Reuters) - It looked like the end had arrived for Adewale Fatai’s chicken farm. Money was running out. Built to house 30,000 chickens, the farm was producing fewer than 2,000 chicks. His family had no funds to lend, and Nigeria’s banks weren’t interested. Instead, he went online. Two years later, Fatai now has 20,000 chickens. Flanked by thousands of chirping birds at his farm in Nigeria’s southwestern Ogun state, Fatai says his operation was saved by Farmcrowdy, one of a breed of new peer-to-peer lending companies aiming to match farmers with small investors. Farmcrowdy uses videos and photographs to show off farms to prospective investors, willing to tie up a bit of cash until harvest time and collect a small return. Its co-founder and CEO Onyeka Akumah says the company has so far helped 7,000 small-scale farmers receive a total of $6 million from 2,000 investors since it launched two years ago. He said 95 percent of investment comes from within Nigeria. The typical investment starts from around 90,000 naira - $300 - too little to interest many banks but enough to help keep a small farm going until harvest. Since taking office in 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari has said he aims to revitalize the agriculture sector in Africa’s most populous nation to reduce the OPEC member’s reliance on oil exports and cut down on costly food imports. But local farmers face multiple challenges - from floods, to a lack of electricity to regulate irrigation, to fighting with semi-nomadic cattle herdsmen that has claimed hundreds of lives this year. Most of the tens of millions of farmers work on a subsistence basis and live on less than $2 a day. Farmers complain that they lack the access to affordable loans needed to cover their costs until harvest time. Farmcrowdy and another firm, Thrive Agric, allow investors to choose a farm on the internet and decide how much to invest. They advertise returns of around 12-20 percent for investments in soybeans, maize, tomatoes, poultry and cattle. Investors buy a funding stake and are kept updated on the progress of crops.  “One of the primary problems we were trying to solve was solving the problem of access to funds for farmers: giving them the right expertise for them to grow and also linking them to markets,” said the CEO of Thrive Agric, Uka Eje, at his office in Abuja.  He said some $2.7 million had been raised by 1,670 investors for nearly 10,000 farmers since the company’s launched in 2017. His company provides farmer clients with expertise as well as fundraising, he said.

2018-10-15,"PARIS (Reuters) - The United States still aims to cut Iran’s oil sales to zero and does not expect restored oil sanctions against Tehran to have a negative impact on a market that is well-supplied and balanced, a senior U.S. official said on Monday. U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, was talking to reporters after a visit to India, a major importer of Iranian oil, and talks with officials from France, Britain and Germany before the start of a new round of U.S. sanctions on Nov. 4. The three European countries have been trying to save the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and multiple global powers since U.S. President Trump announced in May that the United States would withdraw from the pact. In a conference call from Luxembourg, where Hook was meeting European officials, he said that Iran uses oil revenue to support and fund terrorist proxies throughout the Middle East and that the U.S. goal is for countries to cut Iranian oil imports to zero as quickly as possible. “We are working with countries that are reducing their imports to ensure that this happens,” he said.  Hook declined to answer questions on possible waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports but said the U.S. is confident that energy markets will remain stable. “We are seeing a well-supplied and balanced oil market right now. We should focus on these fundamentals and not be distracted by the emotional and unbalanced claims coming from Tehran.” Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer, has repeatedly said that its oil exports cannot be reduced to zero because of high demand in the market.   Washington, meanwhile, plans to continue co-ordinating with oil producers and maintain U.S. supply. “Our crude oil production increased by 1.65 million barrels in August compared to one year ago and that is expected to continue rising by as much as 1 million barrels a day within the next year,” he said.  Hook also said that European efforts to create a special purpose vehicle for trade with Tehran would find no demand because more than 100 foreign firms have indicated that they would be leaving the country.

2018-10-15,"JOHANNESBURG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Thousands of South African plastics sector workers began a strike on Monday over pay and benefits, halting operations at some companies, the union and firms said. The workers, represented by the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA), are demanding the same rights as those in the engineering sector represented by the Metal and Engineering Industries Bargaining Council (MEIBC). NUMSA’s spokeswoman Phakamile Hlubi-Majola said the union members’ grievances included a reduction in the minimum wage from 40 rand ($3) to 20 rand per hour, lack of bonuses as well as increased working hours without overtime pay. Five unions, including NUMSA and the United Association of South Africa, collectively represent about 30,000 workers in the plastics sector. The NUMSA represents 10,000 of the workers. The South African plastics industry employs roughly 60,000 workers in companies across different sectors including paper and packaging as well as textiles. Swan Plastics, a Durban-based pipe manufacturing business, said its operations had been put on hold. Other manufacturers said their operations had not been affected. Paper and plastics packaging maker Mpact said it was still assessing the situation and could not provide a comment at this stage. The National Employers Association of South Africa (NEASA) and the Plastic Convertors Association of South Africa (PCSA) have called for the strike to be stopped. A NEASA official, Jaco Swart, said a court challenge against the strike would be heard on Wednesday.

2018-10-15,"NEW DELHI, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Global oil major BP said on Monday fuel price controls are “not good”, days after India asked state-run fuel retailers to shield customers from record-high costs by cutting margins. BP has a tie-up with Reliance Industries, owner of the world’s biggest refining complex, to enter India’s downstream sector including retail fuel sales. “Price controls will not be good for the fuel sector,” Dudley said at the IHS CERA conference. He declined to say when BP would open its first fuel retail outlet in India in partnership with Reliance. India cut taxes on diesel and gasoline this month and asked state companies, which account for the bulk of retail fuel sales in the country, to reduce marketing margins after a public backlash against record-high pump prices. The move was widely seen as government intervention in local fuel pricing, although Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan had said the step should not be seen as going back to a regulated regime. The government has since said it would not interfere with market-determined prices of gasoline and diesel. BP, which has tied up with Reliance to explore gas fields in India, expects to have a 10 percent gas market share by 2022, Dudley said, adding that he expects BP India’s gas production with Reliance to be 1 billion cubic feet in five years. Dudley said slow decision-making had in the past curbed its investment in the country and was not good for “brand India”.

The last time South Korea did not import oil from Iran was September 2012, according to customs data. South Korean buyers, among major Asian buyers of Iranian oil, suspended Iranian oil loading from July due to the uncertainty of getting a waiver from the U.S. government. The South Korean government has been in talks with the U.S. government to get exemptions on Iran crude imports. During the previous rounds of sanctions from 2012 to 2015, South Korea could buy Iranian oil by capping its Iranian oil imports volume. A U.S government official said in early October that the U.S. government was actively considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are lowering their imports of Iranian oil. Oil imports from Iran have declined for the past months. In the first nine months of the year, South Korea’s imports of Iranian oil dropped 49.1 percent to 7.15 million tonnes, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the data. In total, the world’s fifth-largest crude buyer, imported 10.83 million tonnes of crude oil in September, down 11.8 percent from 12.28 million tonnes a year earlier. Imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude supplier, were 3.41 million tonnes in September, down 6.9 percent from 3.67 million tonnes a year earlier. Meanwhile, South Korea’s imports of U.S. crude increased five-fold to 668,704 tonnes in September from 131,125 tonnes last year, the data showed. In the January-September period of the year, 110.45 million tonnes of crude oil, were imported into South Korea, nearly unchanged from 110.44 million tonnes over the same period last year. State-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) will release South Korea’s final September crude oil imports data later this month.

2018-10-15,"* Asian shares resume descent after rebound Friday * Oil jumps, Saudi shares tumble on Khashoggi’s disappearance * Pound falls after no agreement reached ahead of EU summit By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Asian shares slipped on Monday as worries over Sino-U.S. trade disputes, a possible slowdown in the Chinese economy and higher U.S. borrowing costs tempered optimism despite a rebound in global equities late last week. Not helping the mood, oil prices jumped and Saudi Arabian shares tumbled on rising diplomatic tensions between Riyadh and the West after the monarchy warned against threats to punish it over disappearance of a journalist. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.3 percent while Japan’s Nikkei dropped 0.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets , was off 0.1 percent after a sizable 3.87 percent decline last week to a one-year nadir, and marking its biggest weekly fall since March. The market shakeout has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields this week and caution ahead of earnings season. Although selling appeared to have abated on Friday, partly after Chinese trade data showed strong growth in September, many investors remained cautious. “Some people say markets drew comfort from China’s exports data. But to me it seems so obvious the numbers were inflated by front-loading ahead of the introduction of tariffs,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Fujito said the trade war is starting to take a toll on growth in China, noting that data released later on Friday showed auto sales in China posted the biggest drop in seven years. Over the weekend China central bank governor Yi Gang said he still sees plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), as downside risks from trade tensions with the United States remain significant. Rises in U.S. borrowing costs are also seen hurting weak borrowers, especially those in emerging markets. Although the U.S. 10-year yield posted its first major fall in about two months last week, any signs of inflation could push them up again. The yield rose 1.5 basis points on Monday to 3.156 percent. Also starting to attract wider attention, Saudi Arabia doubled down on pressure from the West on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. Saudi Arabia’s shares plunged as much as 7 percent on Sunday, and closed down 3.5 percent at their lowest levels since early January. Shares in Dubai, a regional economic hub, slid 1.5 percent to a low last seen in January 2006. Oil prices reversed their downtrend since early this month. Brent crude futures rose 1.7 percent to $81.82 per barrel, bouncing back from Friday’s near-three-week low of $79.23. Investors were also bracing for a European Union summit meeting from Wednesday. The British pound shed 0.4 percent in early Asian trade on Monday to $1.3096 after negotiators from the European Union and the UK failed to clinch a Brexit deal ahead of the crucial summit. The euro traded at $1.1593, down slightly after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Bavarian allies suffered their worst election result since 1950 on Sunday. On the other hand, the dollar is seen under pressure against the yen after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that Washington wants to include a provision to deter currency manipulation in future trade deals, including with Japan. That raised worried among Japanese policy circles that this would give Washington the right to label as currency manipulation any future foreign exchange market interventions by Tokyo to keep sharp yen rises in check. In early trade, the yen is little changed at 112.20 per dollar.

2018-10-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has asked its climate change experts to advise on whether it should set a date to meet a net zero emissions target, the government said on Monday. Britain has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2050, but campaigners have warned this does not go far enough to meet pledges made under the Paris climate agreement. The move comes a week after a United Nations report warned the world needs to make unprecedented changes in the way people use energy to curb global temperature rises and limit the worst effects of climate change such as more extreme weather and loss of species. Britain’s Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry has asked the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) to examine whether the target should be reviewed and if the country should set a date to meet net zero emissions. “The evidence is clear – governments, businesses and communities must take further action to confront one of the greatest global challenges we’ve ever faced,” Perry said in a statement on Monday. Under the Paris agreement more than 190 nations agreed in 2015 to pursue efforts to limit a rise in global temperatures this century to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The CCC said it would consider how and by when Britain can eliminate carbon emissions from its economy and look at whether the country’s 2050 target is still fit for purpose. The committee is planning to deliver its advice within six months.

2018-10-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s banks and insurers must come up with credible plans for protecting themselves against risks from climate change and may need to hold more capital, the Bank of England said on Monday. “Financial risks from climate change will be minimized if there is an orderly market transition to a low-carbon world, but the window for an orderly transition is finite and closing,” the central bank said in a policy proposal document. Governor Mark Carney, who has put climate change issues on the BoE’s regulatory radar, said last month that lenders had failed to grasp the scale of the challenge. The BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority said it expects firms to understand how climate risks will affect their business model.” Insurers are facing heavier payouts for increased flooding caused by climate change and tougher energy efficiency standards for homes and commercial property could affect repayments on mortgages and thereby hit banks, it said. If the risks are material, the PRA said firms should show how they will mitigate them “and to have a credible plan or policies in place for managing exposures.” In Monday’s statement setting out its guidance for the consultation, the BoE explained how it expected banks, insurers and building societies to “identify, measure, monitor, manage and report on their exposure” to climate change risks. It called on firms to help it work out what good measurement and public disclosure of risks would look like. Some banks have agreed to disclose information regarding climate change already, something which has the potential to become mandatory in the future. Separately, the Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates asset managers and trading platforms in Britain, published a discussion paper on managing climate change risks. It asks if investment managers should be required to take risks from climate change into account, and whether there should be a new requirement for firms to report publicly on how they manage climate risks. The FCA wants to ensure competition and growth in green investments that provide environmental benefits, and will look at how to improve investor information on climate risks faced by a company listing on the stock market. “We are seeing increasing interest from issuers and investors in the green and sustainable finance space and as a result, greater transparency on sustainable capital flows, but today’s publication shows that the regulators want to see much more,” said Amrita Ahluwalia, a lawyer at Linklaters. The BoE expects to issue further guidance on best practice 12-18 months after the supervisory statement has been finalised.

2018-10-15,"HAMBURG, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Germany’s second largest sugar refiner Nordzucker said on Monday it expects to plunge into the red because of continued low sugar prices following EU market deregulation. Unlisted Nordzucker said its net profit tumbled 86 percent in the six months to Aug. 31, from a year earlier, to 11.6 million euros ($13 million). Sales fell 18 percent to 689.6 million euros. “A loss is now inevitable for the Nordzucker Group in the current financial year due to the low sugar prices,” Nordzucker said in a statement. “Given the anticipated prices, an even more substantial loss is to be expected in the (next) 2019/2020 financial year.” The EU liberalised its sugar market in September 2017, ending its system of guaranteed minimum prices and protected production quotas and giving producers freedom to expand and export more and linking EU prices to world markets. But a worst-case scenario has emerged with European producers exposed to global prices, which hit 10-year lows in September in an oversupplied world market. Germany’s largest sugar producer Suedzucker has also warned its earnings will fall because of low sugar prices. “The main reason for the decline in business was a significant drop in selling prices for sugar,” Nordzucker said. “We expected prices to fall.” “The extent of this decline was driven by overproduction and subsidies - particularly in India.” Meanwhile, dry hot weather in Germany and elsewhere in Europe this autumn has hindered the start of this year’s sugar beet harvest. “This year’s harvest and beet processing, which started in mid-September, will be affected by the unusually dry weather conditions,” Nordzucker added. “Because of these conditions, the campaign got off to a late start in several regions compared to the previous year, and is expected to end in January.” “Great regional yield disparities are anticipated.

2018-10-15,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global energy trader Gunvor Group has secured a $745 million loan from banks with an interest rate that depends on meeting targets to reduce pollution and improve transparency, the company said. In what Gunvor said was the first loan of its kind, the company will receive a discount on the interest for the borrowing base facility if its sustainability targets are met but will be penalized if it severely misses them.  The savings on the interest, which are expected to total hundreds of thousands of dollars, will go to the recently launched Gunvor Foundation, a non-profit, philanthropic arm of Gunvor, the company said in a statement. The foundation works with several international aid groups. Its biggest projects are in job creation in Tanzania and Kenya as well as eco-farming in Tanzania. The Geneva-headquartered firm did not detail precise targets but said they were focused on carbon dioxide emissions, waste and water management, refinery safety and transparency reporting relating to its support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Gunvor joined the EITI in April, the second trading house to do so after Swiss-based Trafigura.

2018-10-15,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germany will cut a green energy surcharge on consumers’ electricity bills by 5.7 percent next year, but savings for households will be limited as other fees are expected to rise. Germans pay the highest electricity bills in Europe as state-induced taxes and fees account for over 50 percent of power bills. German power network operators (TSOs) said on Monday that revenues collected to support green electricity are high and wholesale market prices have risen, allowing renewables producers to rely less on subsidies. Next year the surcharge under the renewable energy act (EEG) - a fee that accounts for over a fifth of energy bills - will fall to 6.405 euro cents (7.4 US cents) per kilowatt hour (kWh), from 6.792 cents this year, TSOs said in a statement. That was a steeper cut than forecast by industry group BEE last week, but may be offset by rises in other levies such as those on use of transport grids. “Consumers should not pin too much hope on noteworthy price cuts by their electricity suppliers,” said Arik Meyer, managing director of SwitchUp, an online service for supplier switches. The portal calculated that a typical household consuming 3,500 kWh per year would save just 13.72 euros through the move. Another portal, Check24, said the bulk of network fees charged for use of transport lines for power, another big cost element accounting for a quarter of bills, look set to rise by 3.5 percent, likely eating up much of the EEG savings. The EEG fee makes up around 23 percent of consumers’ final bills, making it the biggest and most symbolic spending under Germany’s Energiewende policy to transition to renewables. Payouts under the EEG this year are expected to amount to over 25 billion euros, according to industry estimates. The eventual cost depends on weather patterns — which determine how much renewable energy is produced and entitled to support under the EEG once it is fed into the grid. EEG payouts partly reflect the ongoing increase in renewable installations, mainly wind turbines and solar panels. These receive above-market state support in order to make them competitive with conventional energy generation, whose output is priced by the wholesale market. While reforms to the EEG are gradually scaling back subsidies, units constructed in recent years still fall under a rolling 20-year price guarantee that could continue to boost spending over the next few years, analysts say.

2018-10-15,"KISII, Kenya, Oct 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Like many small-scale farmers in densely populated Kisii County in western Kenya, James and Janet Torori long depended on bananas, maize and a single dairy cow for food and income. “Like everyone else around here we have relied on two crops to support our family and it has not been easy earning a decent income considering that what we have been producing is what everyone else produces,” James Torori said. But over the last year they’ve found another promising source of cash: Using green electricity from a local solar micro-grid to power a hatchery and raise chicks for sale. As part of the Kuka Poa (“smart poultry” in Swahili) project they now earn about $80 a month more than they once did, said the couple from Kebaracho village. Commercial-scale solar power - sufficient to run businesses as well as lights - could help many more rural people across East Africa earn a better living, say officials at Powerhive, a microgrid power company that provided the Kuka Poa panels. But installing clean power requires cash - and for that the company is turning to a partnership with The Sun Exchange, a South Africa-based solar energy financier. The Sun Exchange runs an online buy-to-lease marketplace for solar cells, where investors can buy solar equipment that is then leased to rural communities to help them run businesses. As the businesses make a profit, investors get a rental income over 20 years - and poor communities get access to clean energy without the big upfront costs often associated with installing renewable energy, said Abe Cambridge, The Sun Exchange’s CEO. Investors can use anything from credit cards to cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin to buy solar cells, with transactions managed via blockchain, he said. “With cryptocurrencies, the market is large and you access the whole world since you are using the internet. And the investor can put in as little as $10, which may not be possible in traditional markets,” Cambridge explained. Since it was founded in 2015, the company has raised about $800,000 via the model to fund five projects in South Africa, generating a total of 700 kilowatts of power. It has sold over 150,000 solar cells to more than 1,000 buyers in 90 countries, Cambridge said. One project powers the Cape Town offices of SouthSouthNorth, a South Africa-based environmental group. “What is fantastic about The Sun Exchange model is that it benefits us as the recipient of power and it benefits the people buying the solar cells - and it’s also a win for the environment,” said Carl Wesselink of SouthSouth North. The Sun Exchange’s model of financing solar, he said, could help drive wider installation of solar panels and be “the catalyst required for realising our (distributed) energy revolution”. Cambridge said The Sun Exchange’s new partnership with Powerhive, which has operated in Kenya since 2011, would aim to fund about 150 solar projects “and then hopefully grow from there”. He said he hopes to raise enough cash to generate up to 10,000 kilowatts of new clean power over the next five years. Chris Honor, Powerhive’s CEO, said his aim is to connect about 20,000 new households to power by the end of 2019. The combined attraction of earning an income and helping some of the 600 million people living without electricity in sub-Saharan Africa should draw investors, particularly those who “want to be part of the energy revolution”, he said. He said micro-grids his company has put in place in Kenya have so far powered things such as hatcheries and welding shops - commercial uses of energy rather than power for lights and charging mobile phones. According to William Brent of Power for All, an organisation that promotes broader access to clean electricity, crowdsourcing has become central in financing energy projects in Africa and Asia, raising millions of dollars. “In the past three years, crowdsourcing has become an important tool for many companies to raise capital to connect people to electricity for the first time,” he said. Several platforms are now offering crowdfunding for clean energy and that “will continue to grow, and to explore new and innovative financing models”, he predicted. Such methods of raising funds are particularly important when “many investors are still learning to fully embrace the energy systems of the future”, he said.

2018-10-15,"(Reuters) - Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) said it would cut about 30 percent of its workforce at its Hail Creek coal mine in Australia, following a review of its operations.  The mine’s workforce will be reduced to 930 from 1360, said Glencore, which bought the mine from Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) (RIO.L) in March.  The miner, which began operational management of Hail Creek from Aug. 1, said it would introduce a seven days on, seven days off roster system, meaning that employees at the mine would work 7 days and take the next 7 days off. The company also said it would reconfigure the mining methods it uses at Hail Creek and expects the process to be phased in over the next 18 months, with majority of the changes expected to be in place by the second quarter of 2019. Glencore is already the world’s biggest exporter of thermal coal used for power stations, and the Hail Creek acquisition gave it a bigger stake in metallurgical coal used for steelmaking.  In 2017, the mine produced about 9.4 million tonnes of hard coking and thermal coal for export.

2018-10-15,"* Tensions mount over disappearance of Saudi journalist * IEA cuts forecasts for oil consumption and demand for OPEC crude * SocGen raises Brent forecast for fourth quarter (Updates throughout, changes dateline from BEIJING) By Christopher Johnson LONDON, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures rose on Monday as geopolitical tensions over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist stoked supply worries, though concerns over the long-term demand outlook dragged on prices. Benchmark Brent crude oil jumped by $1.49 a barrel to a high of $81.92 before slipping to $80.83, up 40 cents, by 0745 GMT. U.S. crude was last up 20 cents at $71.54. “Growing tensions over the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul has proved supportive for oil prices,” said ING commodities strategist Warren Patterson. Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since Khashoggi, a critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. U.S. President Donald Trump threatened “severe punishment” if it is found that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate. The kingdom said it would retaliate to any action against it over the Khashoggi case, state news agency SPA reported on Sunday, quoting an official source. “This has raised concerns that the Saudis may use oil as a tool for retaliation if any sanctions or other action is taken against it,” Patterson said. Exerting downward pressure on prices, Friday’s monthly report from the International Energy Agency, the West’s energy watchdog, said that the market looked “adequately supplied for now” and the agency cut its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next. OPEC, Russia and other oil producers, such as U.S. shale companies, had increased production sharply since May, the IEA said, raising world crude output by 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd). “I just looked at the IEA numbers in detail and these are very bearish for oil prices,” said Commerzbank commodities analyst Carsten Fritsch. The IEA report came after the secretary general of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said that the group saw the oil market as well supplied and that it was wary of creating a glut next year. Societe Generale on Monday raised its forecast for Brent crude in the final quarter of this year to $82 a barrel, up from a previously forecast $78, after a sharp rise in prices over the past couple of months pushed Brent up from about $70. The French wrote that there were “high levels of risk and uncertainty in the oil markets”.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open mixed, with Britain’s FTSE edging up 0.15 percent, Germany’s DAX dipping 0.1 percent and France’s CAC losing 0.3 percent. Not helping the mood, oil prices jumped and Saudi Arabian shares tumbled on rising diplomatic tensions between Riyadh and the West after the monarchy warned against threats to punish it over disappearance of a journalist critical of its policies. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1 percent while Shanghai shares were down 0.75 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slumped 1.8 percent, with carmaker shares hitting 13-month lows after Washington said it would seek a provision about currency manipulation in future trade deals with Japan. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets was off 0.25 percent after a sizable 3.87 percent decline last week - its biggest since March - to a one-year nadir. The market shakeout has been blamed on a series of factors, including worries about the impact of a U.S.-China trade war, a spike in U.S. bond yields and caution ahead of the earnings season. Although selling appeared to have abated on Friday, partly after Chinese trade data showed strong growth in September, many investors remained cautious. “Some people say markets drew comfort from China’s exports data. But to me it seems so obvious the numbers were inflated by front-loading ahead of the introduction of tariffs,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment analyst at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Fujito said the trade war is starting to take a toll on growth in China, noting that data released later on Friday showed Chinese auto sales posted the biggest drop in seven years. Over the weekend, China central bank governor Yi Gang said he still sees plenty of room for adjustment in interest rates and the reserve requirement ratio (RRR), as downside risks from trade tensions with the United States remain significant. Also starting to attract wider attention, Saudi Arabia doubled down on pressure from the West on the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it turns out Khashoggi was killed while many company executives have cancelled their plans to attend a Saudi investor conference later this month. Investors suspect the latest development could undermine the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and has the risk of eventually destabilising the oil-rich kingdom. Saudi Arabia’s shares plunged as much as 7 percent on Sunday, and closed down 3.5 percent at their lowest levels since early January. Oil prices reversed their downtrend since early this month. Brent crude futures rose 1.3 percent to $81.50 per barrel, bouncing back from Friday’s near-three-week low of $79.23. “Oil prices could rise to $100 on worries about Saudi Arabia,” said Kazuhiko Fuji, senior fellow at Research Institute of Economy, Trade and Industry, a think tank affiliated with the Japanese government. “People had thought the Saudis will make up for fall in Iran’s output. If they are starting to use oil as their weapon, that will be a whole new chapter,” he said. Higher oil prices could boost inflation around the world and spark rises in U.S. borrowing costs, which are also seen hurting weak borrowers, especially those in emerging markets. Although the U.S. 10-year yield posted its first major fall in about two months last week on stock market rout, the yield rose a tad on Monday to 3.15 percent. Investors were also bracing for a European Union summit meeting from Wednesday. The British pound shed 0.3 percent to $1.3114 after negotiators from the European Union and the UK failed to clinch a Brexit deal ahead of the  crucial summit. The euro traded at $1.1552, down slightly after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s Bavarian allies suffered their worst election result since 1950 on Sunday. On the other hand, the dollar is seen under pressure against the yen after U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Saturday that Washington wants to include a provision to deter currency manipulation in future trade deals, including with Japan. That raised worried among Japanese policy circles that this would give Washington the right to label as currency manipulation any future foreign exchange market interventions by Tokyo to keep sharp yen rises in check.

2018-10-15,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It’s tempting to look at the relative resilience of China’s imports of major commodities in September and conclude that the world’s second-biggest economy is weathering the trade dispute with the United States quite well. The problem with this view is that while the trade conflict certainly looms as an issue in China’s commodity trade, it’s not yet the driving factor and any strength, or weakness, in various imports is largely a result of different dynamics. Take copper for example, where imports of unwrought metal in September were 521,000 tonnes, up 24 percent from the 420,000 tonnes in August to the highest in 2-1/2 years. This looks like an extremely strong monthly gain, and would seem to be at odds with the narrative of a loss of momentum in the Chinese economy as trade war fears escalate. But the main driver of September’s strong result is as a result of a crackdown on the use of copper scrap, part of government efforts to limit the importation of waste products. This has forced China’s smelters to turn to other sources of the industrial metal in order to satisfy demand. There may be an element of the trade dispute with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump insofar as Beijing has imposed a 25 percent import tax on scrap imports from the United States as part of its tit-for-tat tariffs measures. But this would only eliminate a small amount of copper scrap from the overall Chinese market, meaning the trade war has yet to emerge as a major factor in the copper supply and demand story. Iron ore was another commodity that appeared to have a relatively strong September, with imports gaining 4.6 percent from the prior month to hit 93.5 million tonnes. Similar to copper, one would expect that iron ore would be vulnerable to trade tensions, given the use of steel in many of China’s manufactured exports. It appears that steel mills have been ramping up output ahead of pollution-related winter production curbs, which has in turn driven demand for iron ore. Coal was one of the commodities to have a weaker September, with imports dropping 12 percent from August to 24.1 million tonnes, but this was likely because of softer energy demand in the season between summer and winter peaks. Crude oil imports improved a touch to their strongest level since May, reaching 9.05 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, up from 9.04 million bpd in August. This marginal gain came as refinery runs rose and refiners also looked to build inventories ahead of winter. One factor that doesn’t gain as much attention as it should in analysis of China’s commodity imports is price. While price isn’t the most important factor, it does often help explain some of the monthly movements in commodity imports. Copper imports may have been boosted by the fact that at the time when cargoes for September arrivals were being arranged, London prices were weak, with the close of $5,801 a tonne on Aug. 15 marking the low point for the year so far. Similarly, benchmark 62-percent iron ore, as assessed by Argus Media, was also soft in August, falling steadily from a peak early in the month, before starting to recover again in the last couple of days. In contrast, benchmark Australian thermal coal prices at Newcastle port were close to year highs in the late July and August period, when cargoes for September were being booked. Prices rose to the highest in more than six years in late July and remained elevated through August, potentially crimping demand for imports of the polluting fuel. With prices having dropped recently, slipping to $100.51 a tonne in the week ended Oct. 12, it’s possible that coal imports may increase in coming months. Overall, China’s commodity imports are still being driven by factors other than the trade dispute, but this remains a potential game-changer in the months ahead. The problem is that it’s unlikely to have the same impact across the commodity spectrum, as some imports may actually gain, especially if the government takes steps to boost infrastructure spending in order to shore up economic growth.

2018-10-15,"TOKYO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Japan’s Kyushu Electric Power Co said on Monday it restricted third-party solar power supplies over the weekend, marking the first time a Japanese utility has curbed the use of renewable energy to avoid a sudden blackout. The move underscores the need for the country to boost its transmission capacity between regions, to allow it take full advantage of the growth in renewable energy in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011. The Fukushima disaster prompted a shift toward renewable energy, backed by mandatory preferential rates for solar, wind and other supplies. However, the government changed regulations in 2015, allowing the old utilities, which control the country’s transmission grids, to restrict supplies of renewable energy from solar or wind farms if needed to maintain grid stability. Kyushu, Japan’s fifth-biggest utility by sales said in August that the restart of a fourth nuclear reactor could lead to possible restrictions on the purchase of renewable energy. The curtailment can be made at short notice and without having to pay compensation, however, the restrictions can only be made after first curbing hydro and fossil fuel power output or transferring excess supplies to other regions. Solar power has grown fast on the island of Kyushu, but the unstable output during the day depends on weather patterns and can create a headache for Kyushu Electric to stabilise the grid. Kyushu had 8.07 gigawatts of solar capacity connected to the grid at end-August, just shy of the 8.2 gigawatts that a government committee estimated in 2016 would be the maximum the utility could take without curtailment.

2018-10-15,"* Tensions mount over disappearance of Saudi journalist * South Korea imported no Iranian crude in Sept * IEA has trimmed its demand outlook BEIJING, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Crude oil futures rose sharply on Monday as geopolitical tensions over the disappearance of a prominent Saudi journalist stoked worries about supply, although concerns about the long-term outlook for demand dragged on prices. Crude markets were also supported in the wake of data that showed South Korea did not import any oil from Iran in September for the first time in six years, before U.S. sanctions against the Middle East country take effect in November. Brent crude had risen 98 cents, or 1.22 percent, to 81.41 a barrel by 0124 GMT, on track for its biggest daily gain since Oct. 9. U.S. crude futures climbed 80 cents, or 1.12 percent, to $72.15 a barrel, extending gains they racked up on Friday after hefty losses on Wednesday and Thursday. “The market has again expressed concerns over geopolitical tensions in the Middle East after U.S. and Saudi traded comments over the disappearance of the Saudi journalist, leading to a jump in prices,” Wang Xiao, head of crude research with Guotai Junan Futures, wrote in a research note. Saudi Arabia has been under pressure since Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Riyadh and a U.S. resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The kingdom would retaliate against possible economic sanctions taken by other states over the case, its state news agency SPA reported on Sunday quoting an official source. Meanwhile, South Korea stopped importing Iranian oil for the first time in years. “South Korea’s move to stop Iran oil imports is giving the market confidence on prices,” said Chen Kai, head of research with futures brokerage Shengda Futures. Lingering geopolitical worries, trade concerns and a weaker economic outlook may pave the way for another week of volatile trading, Chen said, adding that Monday’s recovery in prices was “fragile”. Putting downward pressure on oil prices, the International Energy Agency, the West’s energy watchdog, said in its monthly report that the market looked “adequately supplied for now” and trimmed its forecasts for world oil demand growth this year and next.
