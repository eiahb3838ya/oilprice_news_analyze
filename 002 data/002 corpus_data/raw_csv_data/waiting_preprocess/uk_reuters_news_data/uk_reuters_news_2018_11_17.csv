2018-11-17,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government will hold a national public consultation on Nov. 24-25 for residents to voice their opinion on 10 key policy proposals ranging from a new rail line and oil refinery to reforestation and free public internet initiatives. The new consultation comes on the heels of another informal referendum that called for cancelling the construction of a partially-built $13 billion(10.13 billion pounds) new airport for Mexico City. President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador used the results of that consultation to say his administration, which takes office on Dec. 1, would halt the airport project. That decision left investors fretting over how he would manage the economy, with the peso currency and stock market reeling. It was unclear whether the results of the new consultation would be binding. The incoming administration will set up 1,102 polling stations across the nation where residents will be asked to fill out a form and answer “yes” or “no” on the 10 policy points. They include whether to guarantee access to healthcare to residents that currently lack those services, offer training and scholarships to 2.6 million youth, and double pensions for citizens over 68 years old. Residents will vote on the construction of the so-called “Mayan Train”, a rail line that will run 1,500 kilometres and connect five southern Mexican states. Another point on the consultation is the construction of a $2.5 billion refinery in Tabasco state, which the incoming government has said will boost gasoline production and help cut growing fuel imports.

2018-11-17,"(Corrects typographical error in number of evacuees in shelters to 1,100, instead of 11,000, paragraph 6) By Terray Sylvester PARADISE, Calif., Nov 16 (Reuters) - Recovery workers with cadaver dogs pressed on with their search for more victims in a flame-ravaged northern California town on Friday as authorities sought clues to the fate of more than 600 people reported missing in the deadliest wildfire in state history. Remains of at least 63 people have been recovered so far in and around the Sierra foothills hamlet of Paradise, which was home to nearly 27,000 residents before the town was largely incinerated by the deadly Camp Fire on the night of Nov. 8. More than a week later, firefighters have managed to carve containment lines around 45 percent of the blaze’s perimeter, up from 35 percent a day earlier, even as the burned landscape grew slightly to 142,000 acres (57,000 hectares). Besides the staggering toll on human life, property losses from the blaze make it California’s most the destructive on record, posing a challenge of providing long-term shelter for many thousands of displaced residents. With nearly 12,000 homes and buildings up in smoke, many refugees from the fire have taken up temporary residence with friends and family, while others have pitched tents or were camping out of their vehicles. More than 1,100 evacuees were being housed in 14 emergency shelters set up in churches, schools and community centers around the region, American Red Cross spokeswoman Greta Gustafson said. Search teams, meanwhile, combed through charred, rubble-strewn expanses of burned-out neighborhoods looking for bodies - or anything else that might carry human DNA for identification purposes. On Thursday night, Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said the official roster of people reported unaccounted for by loved ones had grown to 630, more than double the number counted as missing earlier in the day. Meanwhile, the remains of seven more people were found, bringing the death toll to 63, he said. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Miranda Bowersox said the missing-persons list would likely fluctuate greatly. “The overall number will go down, but in the short term we expect we will see new reports of people missing,” she said. Some of those still unaccounted for have likely survived but not yet notified family or authorities that they are alive, either because they lack telephone service or are unaware anyone is looking for them. On the other hand, there may be some people who perished but whose relatives have yet to report them missing. Communication disruptions after the fire have added to the confusion. The disaster already ranks among the deadliest wildfires in the United States since the turn of the last century. Authorities attribute the death toll partly to the speed with which flames raced through the town with little advance warning, driven by howling winds and fueled by drought-desiccated scrub and trees. Weather conditions have since turned more favorable to the firefighting effort, Nick Pimlott, a Cal Fire engineer, told KRCR-TV. He said winds had died down, allowing crews around Lake Oroville to the southeast of Paradise to extend and shore up containment lines around the blaze. Many on the missing-persons list are over the age of 65, in keeping with the town’s recent history as a haven for retirees. Family of retired U.S. Navy veteran David Marbury, 66, have not heard from him since the wildfire erupted. On Thursday, Marbury’s landlord confirmed to relatives that his Paradise duplex had burned down. His car was still in the garage. “I really hope he’s still alive and we’re going to be able to see him,” Marbury’s niece, Sadia Quint, 30, told Reuters by phone. Some said they were experiencing survivors’ guilt. “You’re like, ‘Why am I here?’” Sam Walker, a pastor at the First Baptist Church of Paradise, told WBUR radio. “‘Why is my family all here? Why are our churches still standing?’ I don’t know. My house is gone, like so many others.” More than 300 California National Guard troops have been deployed to the fire zone to help search for victims, and to fill logistical, medical and administrative roles. Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Angle said seven soldiers from his battalion lost their homes in the fire, including one woman who asked to help with the recovery effort because it was “better for her piece of mind to be part of it.” The Camp Fire coincided with a series of smaller blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which is linked to three fatalities and has destroyed at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. It was 57 percent contained on Friday. Scientists have said the growing frequency and intensity of wildfires in California and elsewhere across the West are largely attributable to prolonged drought that is symptomatic of climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump is due to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Critics say Trump, a Republican, has politicized the fires by blaming them, without supporting evidence, on forest mismanagement by California. Governor Jerry Brown and Governor-elect Gavin Newsom, both Democrats, planned to join Trump on his tour. “Now is a time to pull together for the people of California,” Brown and Newsom said in a joint statement. Smoke from the Camp Fire has spread broadly. Public schools in Sacramento 90 miles (150 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, canceled classes for Friday because of poor air quality.

2018-11-17,"CHICO, Calif. (Reuters) - Thousands of people displaced by California’s most destructive wildfire, including hundreds living in tents and cars, face heavy rains next week that could trigger dangerous floods and mudslides, while helping douse the flames. At least 300 people who fled the Camp Fire were sheltering on Friday in the flood-prone parking lot of a Walmart in Chico, about 15 miles (24 km) west of where the blaze consumed the mountain town of Paradise on Nov. 8. More than 1,000 are missing, according to police. The remains of at least 71 people have been identified so far. A rain storm is forecast to hit next week and so authorities are asking people to leave the Walmart lot by Sunday afternoon, said Bryan May, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services. Hillsides that have been scorched by a wildfire are at risk for mudslides when it rains, experts say. The flames burn away vegetation that holds the soil in place and bake a waxy layer into the earth that prevents water from sinking more than a few inches into the ground. Authorities say they have enough shelter space to provide a bed for everyone who wants one, but they acknowledge challenges ahead in finding more long-term housing for the displaced. May said it was not clear exactly how many people are in need of housing, but at the height of the Camp Fire authorities had ordered more than 52,000 people to evacuate. A survey found only 100 housing units available for rent in all of Butte County, where the fire has been burning, May said.  Already, more than 1,100 people are bunking at shelters in the area, according to the Red Cross, and countless more are staying with friends and family. The fire forced caregiver Robin Tompkins, 43, and her family from their home in the town of Magalia, north of Paradise. Friends let them stay for a week, but now the family needs to find other accommodation, she said at an evacuee relief station in the Chico Walmart parking lot.  Her husband Timothy, who works as a cook at a Chico cafe, was frustrated by the lack of information about how long he might be kept from returning to Magalia. “I keep hearing different things: a month, four months, a year. We just want to get home,” he said. Randy Greb, 61, was camping in a tent in the parking lot after his home in Paradise was destroyed. “I lost everything. I’ve got the clothes I got, but people have been nice and really helping us,” Greb said. “Everybody has been doing their best.” The Walmart tent village is the largest of several outdoor encampments of refugees from the Camp Fire. Some displaced people prefer to remain outdoors because they want to stay with their pets, which many shelters say they cannot accept, or are concerned about losing their privacy, May said.  But authorities are encouraging them to camp near a shelter so they can access services for hygiene and other needs, such as free diapers and Clorox wipes. Given the shortage of suitable housing, attention has turned to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  It has said that it is working with state and local officials to evaluate options, and is considering using travel trailers to house some of the displaced. Last year, after a deadly wildfire destroyed hundreds of homes in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Santa Rosa, FEMA trailers were used to house some of the displaced. Among the thousands who have applied for help from FEMA is Linda Harned, 63, a retired caregiver who lost the home that she shared with her husband and several relatives in Magalia.  “I’m depressed and upset,” Harned said at the relief station outside the Walmart in Chico. “It’s hard. I never knew how much I loved my house.” Reporting by Terray Sylvester; Additional reporting and writing by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Nick Zieminski",https://uk.reuters.com/article/california-wildfires-shelter/rain-storms-could-bring-more-misery-for-california-fire-evacuees-idUKL2N1XS018,17 Nov 2018,"Thousands of people

2018-11-17,"(Recasts wth closure of unit, estimated output) By Natalia Chumakova MOSCOW, Nov 17 (Reuters) - A fire broke out in an oil refinery in Moscow on Saturday morning, shutting down a unit that Thomson Reuters data said produced more than half the plant’s gasoline output. Fire crews battled for more than three hours before extinguishing the blaze at the refinery in the capital’s Kapotnya district, the emergency ministry said. The plant’s owner - Gazprom Neft, the oil arm of Russian gas giant Gazprom - said the refinery was back working as usual apart from a catalytic cracking unit which was offline. The unit has a daily production capacity of 6,900 tonnes of gasoline that accounts more than a half of the gasoline produced by the plant, according Thomson Reuters data. There was no immediate comment from the company on the impact of the unit’s shutdown. Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Twitter the fire would not lead to any fuel shortages in the city. The fire was out by 11 a.m. local time (0800 GMT), the ministry said, and there were no reports of any casualties or injuries at the plant. The Russian government and oil companies have agreed to cut wholesale domestic fuel prices in October as a temporary measure aimed at stemming an increase in the cost of petrol and diesel, a politically sensitive issue for voters.
