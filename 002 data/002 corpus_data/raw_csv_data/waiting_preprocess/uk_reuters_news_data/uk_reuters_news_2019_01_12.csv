2019-01-12,"GWADAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to set up a $10 billion oil refinery in Pakistan’s deepwater port of Gwadar, the Saudi energy minister said on Saturday, speaking at the Indian Ocean port that is being developed with the help of China. Pakistan wants to attract investment and other financial support to tackle a soaring current account deficit caused partly by rising oil prices. Last year, Saudi Arabia offered Pakistan a $6 billion package that included help to finance crude imports. “Saudi Arabia wants to make Pakistan’s economic development stable through establishing an oil refinery and partnership with Pakistan in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor,” Saudi Energy Khalid al-Falih told reporters in Gwadar. He said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman would visit Pakistan in February to sign the agreement. The minister added that Saudi Arabia would also invest in other sectors. Beijing has pledged $60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that involves building power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world. “With setting up of an oil refinery in Gwadar, Saudi Arabia will become an important partner in CPEC,” Pakistan Petroleum Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said. The Saudi news agency SPA earlier reported that Falih met Pakistan’s petroleum minister and Maritime Affairs Minister Ali Zaidi in Gwadar to discuss cooperation in refining, petrochemicals, mining and renewable energy. It said Falih would finalize arrangements ahead of signing memorandums of understanding. Since the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan came to power in August, Pakistan has secured economic assistance packages from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and China. In November, Pakistan extended talks with the International Monetary Fund as it seeks its 13th bailout since the late 1980s to deal with a looming balance of payments crisis. The Pakistani prime minister’s office had said on Thursday that Islamabad expected to sign investment agreements with Saudi Arabia and the UAE in coming weeks.

2019-01-12,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s chief justice will face trial on Monday for allegedly breaching asset-declaration rules, the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) said on Saturday, a month before a presidential election in Africa’s most populous country. Chief Justice Walter Onnoghen is the head of Nigeria’s judiciary, which plays a key role in election matters and has helped resolve disputes in past votes. The conduct tribunal, which tries asset-declaration misdemeanors, said in a statement on Saturday that Onnoghen would face six separate counts, without giving further details. Onnoghen could not be reached for comment. Under Nigerian law, state officials must declare their assets before taking office and after they leave. The court did not say why it had brought the charges against Onnoghen almost two years into his tenure. The Opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the ruling party of plotting to destabilize the judiciary ahead of elections by seeking to remove Onnoghen, which could cause a constitutional crisis. Nigerians go to the polls on Feb. 16 to elect a new president in an election where incumbent Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term and is campaigning on his anti-corruption record. In 2016, the tribunal charged the Senate President Bukola Saraki, the country’s third most-powerful politician, for false asset declaration. Saraki was later cleared of wrongdoing.

2019-01-12,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The chief justice of Brazil’s Supreme Court has restored a presidential decree regulating how state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) can carry out an ambitious divestment program meant to reduce the company’s significant debt.  Judge Dias Toffoli’s decision, signed on Friday, overturned an injunction issued by a colleague last month. Toffoli’s ruling should hold until Feb. 27, when the full Supreme Court will hear the case. The December injunction, following a lawsuit filed by the opposition Workers Party, raised doubts about the ability of Petrobras, as the company is known, to carry out the divestments as planned. Petrobras is planning asset sales of $26.9 billion over the next five years, according to a strategic outlook released late last year.

2019-01-12,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The mood at Latin America’s largest wholesale market, the Central de Abastos in Mexico City, has morphed from typically cacophonous and bustling to cloudy and anxious as deliveries and sales grow sluggish amid a days-long fuel shortage. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador late last month launched a sweeping plan to stanch rampant fuel theft, the first major move of his young administration against widespread corruption and organised crime. But the move to close key fuel pipelines that have been tapped by criminals and instead re-route distribution via trucks has prompted hours-long lines at gas stations, while threatening to crimp the economy and damage the president’s popularity if shortages persist. The effects of the crackdown have grown noticeably in the past week. At the Central de Abastos, where 62,000 cars and trucks converge daily to buy and sell fruits, plants and other goods, according to figures provided by the market, vendors say many have been staying home. “Forty to 50 percent of supply has been affected,” said Rafael Perez, 43, the purchasing director for Drinks Depot, a beverages wholesaler. “We are talking about suppliers from [the states of] Hidalgo, Guerrero, Cuernavaca, Puebla and Tlaxcala.”     “Our suppliers’ deliveries have been impacted,” Perez added. “Customers are not coming.”  Avocado vendor Juan Carlos Ximil, 35, said he had seen a drop of about 30 to 40 percent in sales of his stock, which he normally purchases from suppliers outside the capital, including Morelos, Edomex and the avocado-producing state of Michoacan. His customers, modest street-side vendors and grocery stores with limited means of transport, have stayed away too, he said, most likely because fears of long waits to stock up on gasoline, or a shortage itself, would hit hard at their carefully calibrated daily routines. “I feel like, more than a shortage, there is a kind of collective panic,” said Ximil. “If you were used to consuming 200 pesos ($10.45) of gas you go and load up even if you don’t need it, for fear that you’ll run out.” Reporting by Sharay Angulo in Mexico City; Writing by Anthony Esposito; Editing by Delphine Schrank and Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-oil-theft/mexico-citys-massive-wholesale-market-quiets-amid-fuel-shortage-idUKL1N1ZC02Q,12 Jan 2019,"The mood at Latin America's

2019-01-12,"ADEN (Reuters) - A fire at a refinery in Yemen’s southern port city of Aden spread to a second storage tank on Saturday, injuring six people, sources at the refinery said. They told Reuters that civil defence forces had failed to contain the fire sparked by an explosion on Friday. The cause of the blast is still unknown. Aden is under the control of the internationally recognised government, which is backed by a Saudi-led and Western-backed coalition and which is battling the Iranian-aligned Houthi movement that seized the capital Sanaa in 2014. The United Nations launched peace talks last month to try to end the nearly four-year-old war that has killed tens of thousands of people, devastated the economy and left millions facing severe hunger. But tensions have resurged since then. A Houthi drone attack on Thursday on a government military parade in Lahaj, a province next to Aden, killed several people. Saudi state television said on Friday the coalition destroyed a base used by Houthis to direct their unmanned aircraft. The Houthis deny receiving help from Tehran and say they are fighting against corruption. The conflict is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite Muslim Iran.

2019-01-12,"PARIS, Jan 12 (Reuters) - France’s CRE energy regulator said on Saturday that grid operator RTE had called on Thursday evening on factories with high power usage to curb their output and electricity consumption in order to prevent blackouts. The regulator said that on Jan. 10 at about 2000 GMT French and European power frequencies had fallen well below the normal level of 50 hertz, which can lead to major power cuts or blackouts. It said RTE, which is a unit of French state-controlled utility EDF, had called on companies that are part of its demand-response programme to reduce power consumption by about 1,500 MW — the equivalent of about one and a half nuclear plants’ output — to restore grid frequency. “Thanks to their quick response, these companies have helped ensure security of power supply in France and more broadly in Europe,” the regulator said. European power grids are all closely interlinked and major blackouts in one country could lead to blackouts in neighbouring countries.

2019-01-12,"LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon’s President Ali Bongo, who has been out of the country for two months recovering from a stroke, named a new prime minister on Saturday in an apparent effort to shore up his political base days after a failed coup attempt.   The plotters of Monday’s coup attempt were arrested or killed within hours of seizing the national radio station, but the move reflected growing frustration with a government weakened by Bongo’s secretive medical leave in Morocco.  In a decree read by the secretary-general of the presidency on national television early on Saturday morning, Bongo named Julien Nkoghe Bekale as prime minister, replacing Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet, who has served since 2016.  Issoze-Ngondet’s tenure was marked by a sharp drop in oil output and prices that has squeezed revenues, raised debt and stoked discontent in the OPEC member state. Oil workers’ strikes have become more common, and economic growth was 2 percent last year, down from over 7 percent in 2011.  The nomination of Nkoghe Bekale, 56, who has held several ministerial posts since 2009, represents a return to a tradition begun by Bongo’s father, Omar, of choosing prime ministers from the Fang, Gabon’s largest ethnic group. Omar Bongo ruled Gabon from 1967 until his death in 2009, establishing the country as a pillar of “Francafrique”, a web of influence that gave companies from former colonial power France favoured access to African autocrats.      The Bongos come from a smaller ethnic group, and the appointments were a way of broadening the president’s base. But Ali Bongo, who succeeded his father when he died, bucked tradition in 2016 by choosing Issoze-Ngondet, who comes from a different ethnic group.  Bongo’s absence from Gabon since his Oct. 24 stroke in Saudi Arabia has raised questions about his ability to continue carrying out his official functions, although the government has insisted he is recovering well.  A Dec. 31 address from Morocco in which the 59-year-old president slurred his speech and appeared unable to move his right arm failed to reassure many Gabonese and was cited as one of the coup plotters’ reasons for acting.    Bongo won re-election in 2016 by fewer than 6,000 votes amid widespread accusations of fraud, sparking deadly clashes between protesters and police during which the parliament was torched.

2019-01-12,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A major fuel pipeline that supplies Mexico City remained closed after two ruptures in a single day, the president said on Friday, as the government works to stem shortages that have frustrated motorists and triggered economic risks.  President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s offensive against fuel robbers marks the leftist’s first attempt to tackle entrenched corruption since taking office on Dec. 1. Criminal groups have tapped pipelines and stolen tanker trucks carrying diesel and gasoline in the oil-producing country for years, costing the government billions of dollars. The government will assign 8,300 police and 1,400 security vehicles over the next 48 hours to safeguard fuel trucks so they can deliver to gas stations, said Mexico’s National Chamber of Freight Transport (CANACAR). A key pipeline running from the port of Tuxpan in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz to Mexico City was shut down on Thursday night and repairs were underway, Lopez Obrador said on Friday.  The pipeline was hit at daybreak on Thursday and repaired, only to suffer another rupture at 11 p.m., he said.   “There’s sabotage,” he said. “Let’s see who gets tired first.”         The series of disruptions to the pipeline in recent days had caused shortfalls in supply for Mexico City and surrounding states. Cars lined up by the dozen at stations throughout the capital on Friday, many before dawn, fearing that the shortages that fanned into the megacity this week from nearby states could persist.  Local television showed angry protesters blocking a major roadway in Mexico City’s Iztapalapa neighbourhood. The head of Mexico’s central bank said on Thursday that the economy and inflation rate could be negatively affected if fuel distribution problems persist. The closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato last weekend cut off supply for numerous gas stations.  Lopez Obrador later said the military had discovered a 3-km (1.9 mile)-long “hose” that was funnelling fuel out of storage tanks from the facility to a secret storage area.   The president also confirmed some congestion at key ports where imported motor fuels arrive, noting that some tanker ships were awaiting to discharge cargos, but he did not provide details.  Bottlenecks at Mexico’s main Gulf coast and Pacific coast ports have increased during this week, and now prevent almost 10 million barrels of gasoline and diesel from discharging on schedule, further complicating distribution, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. On Tuesday, 24 vessels were backed up at ports, while that number has grown to 39 by Friday. Six tankers loaded with liquefied petroleum gas, used mostly for heating, are also waiting to discharge.

2019-01-12,"CARACAS (Reuters) - The leader of Venezuela’s opposition-led congress said on Friday he was prepared to assume the country’s presidency on an interim basis and call elections, just one day after leftist President Nicolas Maduro was sworn in for a disputed second term. Juan Guaido, a lawmaker from the hard-line Popular Will opposition party who was elected to head the National Assembly on Jan. 5, said he would only take office with support of the armed forces. He also called for protests on Jan. 23, the anniversary of the fall of a military dictatorship in 1958. “It should be the people of Venezuela, the armed forces, and the international community that give us a clear mandate to assume” the presidency, Guaido said in a speech to supporters outside the United Nations (U.N.) program office in Caracas. Maduro was re-elected last year in a vote that was widely dismissed as fraudulent, and countries around the world have called his continued leadership illegitimate. Ruling Socialist Party leaders have described the criticism as colonialist interference led by the United States. The Supreme Court and an all-powerful legislature called the Constituent Assembly have stripped Congress of its powers, meaning it does not have the capacity to remove the president as would a legislature in many countries. Guaido’s comments, however, caused some confusion. Luis Almagro, head of regional diplomatic group the Organization of American States, tweeted that Guaido had assumed the interim presidency of Venezuela. Guaido did not respond to a message seeking clarification. The country’s perennially fractured opposition has made numerous failed attempts over the past 20 years to remove the ruling socialists. Now, opposition leaders have disavowed Maduro’s second term as illegitimate, and have called for the National Assembly to declare the presidency vacant.  The country’s constitution says a presidential vacancy can be filled by the head of the legislature, and some opposition activists have called on Guaido to assume the presidency. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said in a statement that the United States “resolutely supports” the National Assembly, which he called “the only legitimate branch of government duly elected by the Venezuelan people.” “In particular, we support the courageous decision of the National Assembly President, Juan Guaido, to invoke protections under Venezuela’s constitution and declare that Maduro does not legitimately hold the country’s presidency,” Bolton said. Maduro’s allies were quick to denounce Guaido. Prisons Minister Iris Varela appeared to threaten to jail him, although she has previously threatened other opposition members who remain free. “Guaido, I already got your cell ready, with your uniform,” Varela wrote on Twitter.  The opposition has promised to keep up the pressure. Some 2,000 people gathered outside the U.N. site listening to opposition lawmakers and civil society leaders denounce Maduro as a “usurper.” “[Congress] is the only legitimate power that we have,” said Servando Valecillos, a 67-year-old salesman and one of the protesters.  Maduro’s critics accuse him of creating a dictatorship and destroying the OPEC nation’s economy. Venezuela is experiencing the worst economic crisis in its history, with inflation headed toward 2 million percent. Some three million people have left the country amid chronic shortages of food and medicine. Maduro says the country is victim of an “economic war” led by his political adversaries with the help of Washington.
