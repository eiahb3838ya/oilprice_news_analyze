2018-08-09,"(Repeats to widen distribution, no change to text) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Australia’s states are set to vote on Friday on a policy to end more than a decade of climate and energy wars and spur investment in new power supply, but the plan may be killed by states that want tougher emissions targets. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pushing the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) in a desperate bid to bring down electricity prices, which have more than doubled over the past decade, and ensure the lights stay on following a string of blackouts in 2016 and 2017. “The National Energy Guarantee is a historic reform. It should be supported in the national interest. It will deliver lower prices, cleaner energy and a much more reliable energy system,” Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said. Under the NEG, power retailers, led by Origin Energy , AGL Energy and Energy Australia, would be required to meet reliability and emissions targets. The aim is to ensure there is enough “dispatchable” energy, power that can back up intermittent wind and solar power, and cut carbon emissions from the sector by 26 percent from 2005 levels, in line with Australia’s Paris Climate Accord target. Modelling showed the National Energy Guarantee would bring down wholesale power prices by more than 20 percent from where they would be without the policy. The framework has won broad support from power producers clamouring for clarity on carbon policy to support new power plant investments, as well as from businesses, farmers and consumer groups battling high and volatile electricity prices. “It’s not perfect. But what it does do is present Australia and investors with certainty...I sincerely hope that reason prevails on Friday and we get an agreement on the NEG,” Nigel Garrard, managing director of packaging manufacturer Orora Ltd , told reporters on Thursday. The framework was designed by independent experts on the Energy Security Board to be technology-neutral and not involve setting any price on carbon emissions, in order to secure support from the Coalition government’s right wing. Negotiated over nearly a year, the plan needs unanimous assent from all six states to go ahead. But the state of Victoria, where the Labor government faces an election in November and stands to lose seats to the Greens, has thrown up last-minute hurdles which will be tough for  the governing coalition to overcome. Victoria wants emissions reduction targets that can only be strengthened over time, with targets to be reviewed every three years and future targets to be set by regulation rather than legislation. Pro-coal former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and rural-party Nationals members in Turnbull’s coalition do not want to give any future Labor government the power to easily raise emissions reduction targets and make coal-fired electricity less competitive. “We can still get this right — but only if Malcolm Turnbull stares down the climate-crazies in his party,” Victoria’s energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio said on Wednesday.

2018-08-09,"ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo replaced his sacked energy minister on Thursday in a reshuffle that still maintained the West African country’s high number of ministers — 110 in total. Akufo-Addo sacked Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko on Monday, and in the reshuffle he replaced him with John Peter Amewu, former minister of lands and natural resources. Press reports said Agyarko was removed because the president was unhappy with his handling of an extension to a five-year deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy for a 300MW emergency power plant. Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh, former regional minister for the Brong Ahafo region, was named minister for lands and natural resources, while Kofi Adda, a former minister of sanitation and water resources, was appointed the minister of aviation. Critics and local media say the number of Ghana’s ministers is bloated and is a drain on the public purse, but the government has resisted calls to axe some of them. Ghana, one of the region’s most dynamic economies, became an energy producer in late 2010, and pumps out around 180,000 barrels of oil per day from three main fields. But large amounts of this revenue are spent on government salaries, while Ghana has suffered from falls in commodity prices in the past three years that forced it to go to the IMF for a bailout. It is now in its final year of the $918 million credit deal signed in April 2015 to fix its economy, dogged by high deficits, inflation and public debt.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions against Moscow drove down Russia’s ruble, while worries that Turkey was sliding into a full-blown economic crisis battered the lira on Thursday, but global equity markets largely shrugged off the turmoil to edge higher.  The Russian ruble slid 1 percent after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin denies. The ruble slid to its lowest since late 2016, hitting 66.7099 rubles to the dollar, leaving it after a second day of declines more than 4 percent weaker than it had been late on Tuesday. Turkey’s lira touched a record low against the dollar, weakening 4 percent in 24 hours after meetings in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. “Politics continues to wreak short-term havoc in global FX markets,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at Dutch bank ING. “We’re questioning whether any currency is truly safe.”  MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell  0.22 percent after trading flat for most of the session.  European shares earlier in the session were lower but later pared most losses. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.02 percent, as did the blue-chip EURO STOXX 50. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index edged lower but remained about half a percentage point from breaching an all-time high that was set in January, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was about a quarter of a percent away from a record peak. With the second-quarter U.S. earnings season mostly over, investors have turned their attention from solid economic growth and corporate profits to other risks, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. The latter half of August into September is notoriously volatile and associated with potential market hiccups, he said. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see the market struggle to move much higher from here, even if we do breach the all-time highs, until we get around to the next earnings seasons,” Arone said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.52 points, or 0.29 percent, to 25,509.23. The S&P 500 lost 4.12 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,853.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.46 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,891.78. Emerging market securities were mostly weaker as the lira and ruble tumbled, but analysts didn’t see the sell-off in Latin American and other currencies as an asset-class spillover. “I don’t necessarily see this as the start of something broader. But yes, today what seemed to be a few pockets of weakness has spread across the board,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “The reason I don’t expect EM to start rolling over is investor concerns from a few months ago have abated a bit,” he said. Oil prices were down slightly as the escalating China-U.S. trade dispute cast doubt on the outlook for crude demand. Brent crude futures fell 21 cents to settle at $72.07 a barrel and U.S. crude futures settled down 13 cents at $66.81 a barrel. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled down $1.10 at $1,219.90 per ounce. The dollar rose against most major currencies as investors bet global trade tensions and a robust U.S. economy would continue to support the currency. The dollar index rose 0.56 percent, with the euro down 0.7 percent to $1.1529. The Japanese yen weakened 0.07 percent versus the greenback to 111.07 per dollar.  Benchmark 10-year notes rose 10/32 in price to yield 2.9276 percent.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British billionaire Richard Branson and two dozen Caribbean nations and territories announced in Jamaica on Thursday the creation of a multi-million dollar program to turn the hurricane-prone region into a green tech hub resilient to disasters. The Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator marks the culmination of talks that began with Branson’s push, starting last year, to replace fossil fuel-dependent utilities with low-carbon renewable energy sources in the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean. Hurricanes Maria and Irma left trails of destruction as they crashed through the region last September. Branson has lived in the British Virgin Islands for more than a decade and weathered Hurricane Irma inside a cellar on Necker, his private island. After announcing the initiative at a gathering in Kingston, the business magnate said the more than $4 million initiative serving 26 countries would give start-ups easier access to financing for large projects. “Just the fact that we’ve got ... pretty much every single Caribbean nation signed up and a lot of agencies willing to work with them gives a good chance of speeding the process forward,” Branson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. Partners include the Inter-American Development Bank, private firms and countries from Grenada to Anguilla and Dominica. The effort kicked off by rolling out a handful of projects, including an announcement that Airbnb, the home-sharing website service, was expanding to the Caribbean its “Open Homes” program that matches displaced disaster victims with local hosts with spare rooms free of charge. Organizers also unveiled an award under the patronage of Usain Bolt, the eight-time Olympic gold medalist from Jamaica, that will recognize leading countries, businesses and individuals making the most strides toward a green future. The announcement followed a December gathering in Paris where Caribbean nations banded together to seek the restructuring of some $1 billion in debt to free up cash for coastal defenses and buffer communities against the effects of global warming. Scientists agree that climate change can affect the frequency, intensity and tracks of hurricanes.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices settled slightly lower on Thursday, extending the previous session’s losses as the escalating China-U.S. trade dispute casts doubt over the outlook for oil demand. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 21 cents to settle at $72.07 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 13 cents to $66.81 a barrel.  Both benchmarks tumbled more than 3 percent on Wednesday  after U.S. data showed a smaller-than-expected weekly draw in crude inventories and a surprise build of 2.9 million barrels in gasoline supplies. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 1.7 million-barrel draw in gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI. [EIA/S]  “The ability of gasoline to hang in there despite strong demand weighed on the market,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York. Previously the market had been “racing higher” due to a fear of scarcity, but those concerns have receded, he said. “Supply is seen as sufficient to meet the pretty robust demand picture.”  The market has also been weighed down by concerns that trade disputes will curb demand. As retaliation against Washington, China will impose tariffs of 25 percent on a further $16 billion in U.S. imports ranging from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment. Crude oil will be exempt. The trade war is rattling global markets. Investors fear any slowdown in the world’s two largest economies would slash demand for commodities. [MKTS/GLOB]  Oil traders were also worried about Chinese demand. Crude imports picked up in July after two months of decline, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from smaller independent refineries.  Iraq cut its official selling price for September cargoes of Basra Light crude for its Asian customers on Thursday. (GRAPHIC-Shipped Iran crude oil exports: reut.rs/2vjGcyb) The United States on Tuesday reimposed sanctions on Iran, the third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  The renewed sanctions will not directly target Iranian oil until November, although U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants as many countries as possible to cut their imports of Iranian crude to zero.  “The impact of it is the greatest known unknown of the year. If worst comes to worst and 1.5-2 million bpd (barrels per day) of Iranian disappears from the market ... calculations will go out of the window and oil bears will have to brace themselves for a very rough ride,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said.

2018-08-09,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - At Hungary’s Sziget Festival, the Danube river is providing revelers with some welcome respite from the searing temperatures that have hit much of Europe. Nearly 500,000 people are expected to attend the seven-day music and arts festival, set on an island surrounded by the river in the Hungarian capital and headlined by British acts Artic Monkeys, Liam Gallagher and American singer Lana Del Rey. With 35 Celsius (95F) heat, fire trucks roam the island to spray venues and people, health services are at the ready and there is easy access to drinks. “The best way to stay cool is to stay in the shade and drink beers and stay in the water,” New Zealand festival attendee Nathan Petere said. Organizers of the festival, which runs until Tuesday, have set up billboards warning attendees about the risks the hot weather poses, with a video played on loop on the main stages encouraging people to drink more water. Once the music starts, people leave the beach for the concerts armed with water guns to help stay cool. “A lot of people are using these sprays to keep people cool,” said Dutch attendee Roy Marsman, who was busy spraying people with water from his hammock.     His compatriot Bram van Heesch was already planning on returning to a refreshing spot in the Danube. “When the music starts we will go to check out the different stages but as soon as it gets too hot I might be coming back here,” he told Reuters.

Abu Dhabi slipped 1.1 percent, easing from a near four-year high on Wednesday. Aldar Properties dropped 2.5 percent, as investors were disappointed after the firm this week missed estimates with a 28 percent fall in second-quarter profit, which it blamed on a revaluation of properties related to its retail portfolio. First Abu Dhabi Bank also fell 2.4 percent. FAB shares have gained nearly 37 percent this year, fuelled by strong earnings and a move to expand in the Saudi market. In neighbouring Dubai, the index dropped almost 1 percent on selling in lender Emirates NBD which declined 2.9 percent. Contractor Arabtec also dropped 2.5 percent, after opening higher as it reported a 24 percent jump in quarterly profit. Saudi stocks were down 0.4 percent, as sharp swings in oil prices hit sentiment.

2018-08-09,"SEOUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told North Korea’s foreign minister that the United States cannot be trusted, Tehran’s state media said, as the United States seeks a deal to rein in the North’s nuclear and missile programmes. North Korea for its part denounced the United States for its “outdated acting script” in pressuring the North with continued sanctions, but said it was still prepared to meet its obligations after a historic North Korea-U.S. summit in Singapore in June. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from Washington for talks this week, saying it could not negotiate after the Trump administration reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s own nuclear programme. North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, visited Iran as the United States reintroduced sanctions against the Islamic Republic.  “The U.S. administration performance in these years has led the country to be considered untrustworthy and unreliable around the world which does not meet any of its obligations,” Rouhani was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as telling Ri on Wednesday. “In the current situation, friendly countries should develop their relations and cooperation in (the) international community,” he said, adding Iran and North Korea have “always had close views” on many issues.  Ri travelled to Tehran after attending a security forum in Singapore, where he and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparred over an agreement made at June’s landmark summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The two sides vowed to work towards North Korea’s denuclearisation at the summit, but have since struggled to reach a deal to meet that goal, with the United States insisting sanctions pressure must be maintained. North Korea’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had stopped testing missiles and conducting nuclear tests “followed by dismantling the nuclear test ground”, and yet the United States still had insisted on “denuclearisation first”.   North Korea nevertheless went ahead with the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war, it said. “We hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust existing between the DPRK (North Korea) and the U.S. and to establishing mutual trust,” it said in a statement carried by the North’s KCNA news agency. “However, the U.S. responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure against the DPRK.” The United States was “attempting to invent a pretext for increased sanctions against the DPRK by mobilising all their servile mouthpieces and intelligence institutions to fabricate all kinds of falsehoods...” “As long as the U.S. denies even the basic decorum for its dialogue partner and clings to the outdated acting script which the previous administrations have all tried and failed, one cannot expect any progress in the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement including the denuclearisation... “We remain unchanged in our will to uphold the intentions of the top leaders of the DPRK and the U.S. and to build trust and implement in good faith the DPRK-U.S. joint statement step by step. The U.S. should, even at this belated time, respond to our sincere efforts in a corresponding manner.” Ri told Rouhani that Washington’s pullout from the 2015 pact and restoration of sanctions was an “action against international rules and regulations”, IRNA said.  “North Korea’s strategic policy is to deepen relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and confront unilateralism,” he said.

2018-08-09,"* Yamal’s 2nd LNG train launched ahead of schedule * Novatek aims for greater global LNG role * Yamal’s gas condensate may partially replace Iran’s - sources (Adds details, quotes, background) By Oksana Kobzeva and Natalia Chumakova MOSCOW, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Russia’s Novatek has launched a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) production train at its plant on the Yamal peninsula ahead of schedule, as Moscow tries to become a significant global player on the supercooled-gas market. Novatek, which controls Yamal LNG in which France’s Total along with China’s CNPC and the Silk Road Fund are minority shareholders, said the launch was made six months ahead of its initial schedule. Yamal ships LNG to Asia and Europe. Along with LNG, the Yamal plant is producing gas condensate, a type of light oil, which can replace some Iranian supplies to Middle Eastern companies as the United States reimposes sanctions on Tehran, trading sources said. The second LNG train’s annual capacity is 5.5 million tonnes, which will double Yamal’s output. Novatek is also building a third production train which is expected to be launched next year, raising annual LNG output to 16.5 million tonnes. Novatek’s chairman and co-owner Leonid Mikhelson said on Thursday that the two Yamal LNG trains represent around 3.5 percent of the global LNG market, a growing area for the world’s energy producers. “Our strategic goal is to produce between 55 and 60 million tonnes annually by 2030,” Mikhelson said in a statement. Novatek is also planning to launch its second LNG plant, Arctic LNG-2, after 2020. The launch of the second LNG train comes just days after China proposed tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas, widening the trade war between the two countries. In July, Novatek delivered the first LNG cargo to China via the Northern Sea Route alongside the Arctic coast, which drastically cuts delivery time to Asia. CNPC plans to start lifting at least 3 million tonnes of LNG from Yamal from 2019. At its peak, Yamal will produce over 1 million tonnes of gas condensate a year and Novatek has ordered special vessels for these shipments. In the first six months of the year, Novatek, which is Russia’s largest private gas producer, shipped 234,000 tonnes of Yamal condensate, selling the first cargo to commodities trader Vitol via a tender earlier this year. According to Reuters data and two trading sources, Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) has bought around 37,000 tonnes of condensate via a tender from Yamal - that cargo was loaded on a tanker at Yamal’s Sabetta port at the end of July. Iran has been one of the key gas condensate suppliers to ENOC but further exports could be complicated with sanctions due to be reimposed on Iran’s energy sector on Nov. 4. One of the trading sources said he believed that ENOC was making a test purchase of the Yamal condensate ahead of the sanctions coming into force. Novatek and ENOC did not reply to Reuters requests for comment.

2018-08-09,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Rouble extends drop to 4 percent after new U.S. sanctions * Turkey’s lira hits record low as U.S. tensions mount * Oil steadies after swoon * NZ dollar dives as central bank stays loose * Pound stuck at 1 year low on Brexit concerns By Marc Jones LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Alarm bells were ringing on Thursday as new U.S. sanctions drove down Russia’s rouble and worries that Turkey was sliding towards a full-blown economic crisis battered the lira. A rally in Chinese stocks had helped offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war overnight after Beijing matched the latest U.S. sanctions, but too much was going on nearby for Europe to remain unscathed. London’s FTSE , Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC40 were down 0.7 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively, while German government bonds rose in a broad grab for safety. Wall Street futures pointed to a steady start in New York but that was deceptive. The main fireworks were in the currency markets. The Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin denies. There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that, if passed, would impose even more widespread punishments for meddling in U.S. elections. The rouble slid to its lowest since late 2016, hitting 66.1 roubles to the dollar and leaving it almost 4 percent lighter than it had been 24 hours previously.. “I’m surprised that the market, in retrospect, was quite complacent about this risk,” said North Asset Management portfolio manager Peter Kisler, though he was relieved the new sanctions hadn’t flagged a ban on Russian sovereign debt or banks for the time being. Turkey’s lira, bond and stocks markets were taking even more of a pounding after meetings between officials in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. The lira touched a record low of 5.44 against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday’s close. There was widespread selling in the country’s bond markets and Istanbul stocks dropped 1 percent too. “We think Turkey may need to approach the IMF or seek other external support. Otherwise, capital-control measures seem to be a distinct possibility,” said fund manager Lombard Odier’s chief investment strategist, Salman Ahmed. Asia had been much brighter. Shanghai blue chips closed up 2.5 percent after talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending underpinned industrial resources, including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares reverse early losses to gain 0.5 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, in part because core machinery orders fell. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free-trade agreement at talks in Washington later. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging down 13 cents to $66.80 per barrel and Brent flat at $72.27. Back in the FX markets, it wasn’t only emerging-market currencies that were struggling. The pound wallowed at its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears remained that Britain might leave the European Union without a deal on trade. Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a no-deal Brexit, an event that could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain’s biggest export market. Sterling was last trading at $1.2893, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight. The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a safe haven, with the dollar easing to 111.11 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday. The euro was subdued at $1.1590, while the dollar index was up at 95.282. The New Zealand dollar dropped 1.4 percent to a two-year low at $0.6641 after the country’s central bank pledged to keep rates at record lows well into 2020 . “The risk of rate moves over the next 12 months is weighted more towards cuts than hikes, and financial markets will price the risk accordingly,” said Kiwibank’s chief economist, Jarrod Kerr. “The good news here is interest rates and exchange rates will remain lower for much longer, assisting growth.” Reporting by Marc Jones in London and Wayne Cole in Sydney;

2018-08-09,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union said it was delivering on a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Thursday but called on Washington to do more to make its prices competitive. In talks to urge Trump to drop hefty new tariffs last month, the EU’s chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to work to increase imports of U.S. soybeans and LNG to the bloc. The EU has long worked to diversify away from relying on Russia for almost 40 percent of its gas needs by developing LNG infrastructure to access other suppliers like the United States.  Whether U.S. LNG imports can win market share away from Russia, however, will depend on market forces, EU officials are quick to stress. “The growing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, if priced competitively, could play an increasing and strategic role in EU gas supply,” Juncker said in a statement. “But the U.S. needs to play its role in doing away with red tape restrictions,” he said, referring to U.S. rules that require regulatory approval for LNG exports to Europe.  Since the arrival of the first U.S. LNG supplies in 2016, cumulative imports to the bloc have reached 2.8 billion cubic metres, the EU said on Thursday. In 2017, Europe accounted for more than 10 percent of total U.S. LNG exports, up from 5 percent in 2016, it said. Spain, France and Italy are the largest of nine EU member states purchasing U.S. gas. The EU’s decision to publish historic trade data is unusual - part of the bloc’s drive to sway Trump by showing tariff-free trade flows can benefit the United States. Earlier this month, the European Commission published data showing a surge in U.S. soybean imports so far this year as buyers responded to plunging prices after China largely stopped buying U.S. soybeans in a tit-for-tat trade row. “Both sides have much to gain by working together,” Juncker added. Trump said in a Tweet last month that the EU would “be buying vast amounts of LNG”, while Juncker said the EU would build more terminals to handle American LNG. However, three-quarters of Europe’s existing import facilities lie empty while demand for U.S. LNG on the continent remains limited. The most lucrative markets for U.S. LNG are in South and Central America, India and the Far East, with Europe near the bottom of the pile given its relatively low prices and ample supplies of gas via pipelines from Russia and Norway.

2018-08-09,"(Repeats with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Trends in China's trade, economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 9 (Reuters) - It’s tempting to look at China’s imports of major commodities in July and conclude that the strength is a sign that the escalating trade dispute with the United States isn’t having much of an impact. While the first of the tit-for-tat tariffs came into effect in July, it will likely take several months before any real impact is discernable, and even then, separating out the effect of trade measures from other factors will be tricky. In the meantime, the commodity trade data can still provide insight to China’s economy, and it’s largely painting a picture of resilience. Imports of crude oil rose slightly in July to about 8.48 million barrels per day (bpd), up from June’s 8.36 million, according to customs data released on Wednesday. However, the market chose to focus more on the fact that July was the third-weakest month this year, and that the smaller, independent refiners known as teapots have cut back on their purchases. A combination of higher crude prices and changes in government taxes have been blamed for the weak growth in crude imports, and these factors have certainly tilted the playing field against smaller refiners. It’s also worth noting that China’s exports of refined products slipped in July, to 4.57 million tonnes, which equates to about 1.18 million bpd, using a conversion factor of 8 barrels of product per tonne of crude. This was down from about 1.27 million bpd in June, showing that some of the softness in crude imports can be ascribed to a slowing in the exports of refined fuels. Where there was unambiguous strength in China’s commodity imports was in iron ore and coal. Iron ore imports rebounded to 89.96 million tonnes in July from 83.24 million in June, although they are still down 0.7 percent for the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2017. The robust imports of iron ore can largely be ascribed to near record margins for steel producers and record output as mills try to maximise profits. An ongoing switch to higher grade iron ore by mills seeking to boost output while minimising emissions has also favoured imported iron ore over domestic output, which tends be low quality. Lower prices for iron ore during May and June, when July delivery cargoes would have been arranged, may also have contributed to the surge in imports. Coal imports leapt to the highest in 4-1/2 years, increasing 14 percent from June to 29.01 million tonnes in July. The surge can largely be put down to the heatwave afflicting much of the northern hemisphere, with China boosting power generation from thermal plants to cope with the additional demand for air-conditioning. Curbs on domestic output have also encouraged imports, with the latest available data showing production fell 1.4 percent in June to an eight-month low. The preliminary customs data released on Wednesday also doesn’t break down the types of coal being imported, and official details on this have not been released since March. However, it’s likely that in addition to strong demand for thermal coal for power generation, imports of coking coal for steel-making have been rising as well. This is because domestic coking coal output has been dropping, with a 4.7 percent slide reported in June and production for the first six months slipping 3.2 percent from the same period in 2017. The major industrial commodity most exposed to any pullback from the trade dispute with the administration of President Donald Trump is copper, but so far this hasn’t happened. Imports of unwrought copper rose 2.7 percent in July to 452,000 tonnes, while inbound shipments of copper ores and concentrates were up 5.4 percent to 1.845 million tonnes. Given copper’s importance in manufacturing and construction, any sign of weakness in Chinese demand would raise concerns about the impact of the trade dispute. Overall, China’s commodity imports aren’t raising any red flags, even if the strength in coal and iron ore looks to be partly the result of temporary factors. But it’s early days yet in the trade dispute, and it’s likely that imports in the fourth quarter of this year may be more instructive as to any impact.

A rally in Chinese stocks had helped Asia offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war overnight after Beijing matched the latest U.S. sanctions, but too much was going on nearby for Europe to remain unscathed. London’s FTSE , Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC40 were down 0.7 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively, while German government bonds rose in broad grab for safety. Wall Street futures pointed to a steady start to New York trading but that was deceptive. The main fireworks were in the currency markets. The Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin denies. There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that, if passed, would impose even more widespread punishments for meddling in U.S. elections. The rouble duly slid to its lowest since late 2016, 66.1 roubles to the dollar and left the Russian currency down almost 4 percent lighter than it had been 24 hours previously.. “I’m surprised that the market, in retrospect, was quite complacent about this risk,” said North Asset Management portfolio manager Peter Kisler, though he was relieved the new sanctions hadn’t flagged a ban on Russian sovereign debt or banks for the time being. Turkey’s lira, bond and stocks markets were taking even more of a pounding after meetings between officials in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. The lira touched a record low of 5.44 against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday’s close. There was widespread selling in the country’s bond markets and Istanbul stocks dropped 1 percent too. “We think Turkey may need to approach the IMF or seek other external support. Otherwise, capital-control measures seem to be a distinct possibility,” said fund manager Lombard Odier’s chief investment strategist Salman Ahmed. Asia had been much brighter. Shanghai blue chips closed up 2.5 percent after talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending underpinned industrial resources, including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares reverse early losses to gain 0.5 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, in part because core machinery orders fell. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free-trade agreement at talks in Washington later. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had already announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent.

2018-08-09,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co improperly tested vehicles for fuel economy and emissions, the Japanese government said on Thursday, revealing fresh cases of compliance failures by manufacturers. The results came to light after the government had ordered the automakers to check their operations after revelations of improper testing at Subaru Corp and Nissan Motor Co last year. The conduct of automakers globally has come under intense scrutiny after Germany’s Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide. In the Japanese cases, the carmakers have not broken any laws or prompted massive recalls. But a growing list of improprieties has tarnished the image of the country’s manufacturing industry for high-quality products and efficiency. Suzuki, Mazda and Yamaha cleared vehicles for emissions or fuel efficiency even in cases where they were tested under invalid conditions, the ministry said in a statement. The errors related to slight deviations in the speed of the vehicles during testing that should have invalidated the test results. The automakers examined tests they had conducted over different periods of time and in Suzuki’s case they stretched back to 2012. None of the automakers found significant problems with actual emissions and fuel economy performance of the vehicles, which were destined for sale in Japan, and do not plan any recalls. Suzuki, Japan’s fourth-largest automaker, said that of 12,819 sample vehicles tested for fuel economy and emissions since June 2012, around 50 percent of them had been inspected improperly. “I deeply apologize and will lead efforts to prevent recurrence,” Suzuki Chief Executive Toshihiro Suzuki told a news conference. Mazda said there were irregularities in 4 percent of similar inspections on its cars, or just over 70 vehicles. In Yamaha’s case, irregularities were found in 2 percent of inspections, or just a handful of vehicles. Both Mazda and Yamaha apologized. Suzuki and Yamaha shares fell 6 and 5 percent, respectively, and Mazda shares were down 1 percent, underperforming a steady benchmark Nikkei average. In July this year, Nissan admitted it had improperly measured exhaust emissions and fuel economy for 19 vehicle models sold in Japan. Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Toray Industries - all key suppliers of motor parts to global manufacturers - admitted to product data fabrication last year. Many of the automakers, already hit by lackluster sales, have also been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported vehicles.

2018-08-09,"(Repeats to widen distribution, no change to text) By Sonali Paul MELBOURNE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Australia’s states are set to vote on Friday on a policy to end more than a decade of climate and energy wars and spur investment in new power supply, but the plan may be killed by states that want tougher emissions targets. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pushing the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) in a desperate bid to bring down electricity prices, which have more than doubled over the past decade, and ensure the lights stay on following a string of blackouts in 2016 and 2017. “The National Energy Guarantee is a historic reform. It should be supported in the national interest. It will deliver lower prices, cleaner energy and a much more reliable energy system,” Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said. Under the NEG, power retailers, led by Origin Energy , AGL Energy and Energy Australia, would be required to meet reliability and emissions targets. The aim is to ensure there is enough “dispatchable” energy, power that can back up intermittent wind and solar power, and cut carbon emissions from the sector by 26 percent from 2005 levels, in line with Australia’s Paris Climate Accord target. Modelling showed the National Energy Guarantee would bring down wholesale power prices by more than 20 percent from where they would be without the policy. The framework has won broad support from power producers clamouring for clarity on carbon policy to support new power plant investments, as well as from businesses, farmers and consumer groups battling high and volatile electricity prices. “It’s not perfect. But what it does do is present Australia and investors with certainty...I sincerely hope that reason prevails on Friday and we get an agreement on the NEG,” Nigel Garrard, managing director of packaging manufacturer Orora Ltd , told reporters on Thursday. The framework was designed by independent experts on the Energy Security Board to be technology-neutral and not involve setting any price on carbon emissions, in order to secure support from the Coalition government’s right wing. Negotiated over nearly a year, the plan needs unanimous assent from all six states to go ahead. But the state of Victoria, where the Labor government faces an election in November and stands to lose seats to the Greens, has thrown up last-minute hurdles which will be tough for  the governing coalition to overcome. Victoria wants emissions reduction targets that can only be strengthened over time, with targets to be reviewed every three years and future targets to be set by regulation rather than legislation. Pro-coal former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and rural-party Nationals members in Turnbull’s coalition do not want to give any future Labor government the power to easily raise emissions reduction targets and make coal-fired electricity less competitive. “We can still get this right — but only if Malcolm Turnbull stares down the climate-crazies in his party,” Victoria’s energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio said on Wednesday.

2018-08-09,"ACCRA (Reuters) - Ghana’s President Nana Akufo-Addo replaced his sacked energy minister on Thursday in a reshuffle that still maintained the West African country’s high number of ministers — 110 in total. Akufo-Addo sacked Energy Minister Boakye Agyarko on Monday, and in the reshuffle he replaced him with John Peter Amewu, former minister of lands and natural resources. Press reports said Agyarko was removed because the president was unhappy with his handling of an extension to a five-year deal with United Arab Emirates-based AMERI Energy for a 300MW emergency power plant. Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh, former regional minister for the Brong Ahafo region, was named minister for lands and natural resources, while Kofi Adda, a former minister of sanitation and water resources, was appointed the minister of aviation. Critics and local media say the number of Ghana’s ministers is bloated and is a drain on the public purse, but the government has resisted calls to axe some of them. Ghana, one of the region’s most dynamic economies, became an energy producer in late 2010, and pumps out around 180,000 barrels of oil per day from three main fields. But large amounts of this revenue are spent on government salaries, while Ghana has suffered from falls in commodity prices in the past three years that forced it to go to the IMF for a bailout. It is now in its final year of the $918 million credit deal signed in April 2015 to fix its economy, dogged by high deficits, inflation and public debt.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New U.S. sanctions against Moscow drove down Russia’s ruble, while worries that Turkey was sliding into a full-blown economic crisis battered the lira on Thursday, but global equity markets largely shrugged off the turmoil to edge higher.  The Russian ruble slid 1 percent after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin denies. The ruble slid to its lowest since late 2016, hitting 66.7099 rubles to the dollar, leaving it after a second day of declines more than 4 percent weaker than it had been late on Tuesday. Turkey’s lira touched a record low against the dollar, weakening 4 percent in 24 hours after meetings in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. “Politics continues to wreak short-term havoc in global FX markets,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at Dutch bank ING. “We’re questioning whether any currency is truly safe.”  MSCI’s all-country world stock index fell  0.22 percent after trading flat for most of the session.  European shares earlier in the session were lower but later pared most losses. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.02 percent, as did the blue-chip EURO STOXX 50. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index edged lower but remained about half a percentage point from breaching an all-time high that was set in January, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq was about a quarter of a percent away from a record peak. With the second-quarter U.S. earnings season mostly over, investors have turned their attention from solid economic growth and corporate profits to other risks, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. The latter half of August into September is notoriously volatile and associated with potential market hiccups, he said. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see the market struggle to move much higher from here, even if we do breach the all-time highs, until we get around to the next earnings seasons,” Arone said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 74.52 points, or 0.29 percent, to 25,509.23. The S&P 500 lost 4.12 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,853.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 3.46 points, or 0.04 percent, to 7,891.78. Emerging market securities were mostly weaker as the lira and ruble tumbled, but analysts didn’t see the sell-off in Latin American and other currencies as an asset-class spillover. “I don’t necessarily see this as the start of something broader. But yes, today what seemed to be a few pockets of weakness has spread across the board,” said Ilya Gofshteyn, macro strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in New York. “The reason I don’t expect EM to start rolling over is investor concerns from a few months ago have abated a bit,” he said. Oil prices were down slightly as the escalating China-U.S. trade dispute cast doubt on the outlook for crude demand. Brent crude futures fell 21 cents to settle at $72.07 a barrel and U.S. crude futures settled down 13 cents at $66.81 a barrel. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled down $1.10 at $1,219.90 per ounce. The dollar rose against most major currencies as investors bet global trade tensions and a robust U.S. economy would continue to support the currency. The dollar index rose 0.56 percent, with the euro down 0.7 percent to $1.1529. The Japanese yen weakened 0.07 percent versus the greenback to 111.07 per dollar.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK, Aug 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British billionaire Richard Branson and two dozen Caribbean nations and territories announced in Jamaica on Thursday the creation of a multi-million dollar program to turn the hurricane-prone region into a green tech hub resilient to disasters. The Caribbean Climate-Smart Accelerator marks the culmination of talks that began with Branson’s push, starting last year, to replace fossil fuel-dependent utilities with low-carbon renewable energy sources in the hurricane-ravaged Caribbean. Hurricanes Maria and Irma left trails of destruction as they crashed through the region last September. Branson has lived in the British Virgin Islands for more than a decade and weathered Hurricane Irma inside a cellar on Necker, his private island. After announcing the initiative at a gathering in Kingston, the business magnate said the more than $4 million initiative serving 26 countries would give start-ups easier access to financing for large projects. “Just the fact that we’ve got ... pretty much every single Caribbean nation signed up and a lot of agencies willing to work with them gives a good chance of speeding the process forward,” Branson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by telephone. Partners include the Inter-American Development Bank, private firms and countries from Grenada to Anguilla and Dominica. The effort kicked off by rolling out a handful of projects, including an announcement that Airbnb, the home-sharing website service, was expanding to the Caribbean its “Open Homes” program that matches displaced disaster victims with local hosts with spare rooms free of charge. Organizers also unveiled an award under the patronage of Usain Bolt, the eight-time Olympic gold medalist from Jamaica, that will recognize leading countries, businesses and individuals making the most strides toward a green future. The announcement followed a December gathering in Paris where Caribbean nations banded together to seek the restructuring of some $1 billion in debt to free up cash for coastal defenses and buffer communities against the effects of global warming. Scientists agree that climate change can affect the frequency, intensity and tracks of hurricanes.

2018-08-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Crude prices settled slightly lower on Thursday, extending the previous session’s losses as the escalating China-U.S. trade dispute casts doubt over the outlook for oil demand. Brent crude futures LCOc1 fell 21 cents to settle at $72.07 a barrel. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 13 cents to $66.81 a barrel.  Both benchmarks tumbled more than 3 percent on Wednesday  after U.S. data showed a smaller-than-expected weekly draw in crude inventories and a surprise build of 2.9 million barrels in gasoline supplies.

Previously the market had been “racing higher” due to a fear of scarcity, but those concerns have receded, he said. “Supply is seen as sufficient to meet the pretty robust demand picture.”  The market has also been weighed down by concerns that trade disputes will curb demand. As retaliation against Washington, China will impose tariffs of 25 percent on a further $16 billion in U.S. imports ranging from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment. Crude oil will be exempt. The trade war is rattling global markets. Investors fear any slowdown in the world’s two largest economies would slash demand for commodities. [MKTS/GLOB]  Oil traders were also worried about Chinese demand. Crude imports picked up in July after two months of decline, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from smaller independent refineries.

If worst comes to worst and 1.5-2 million bpd (barrels per day) of Iranian disappears from the market ... calculations will go out of the window and oil bears will have to brace themselves for a very rough ride,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said.

The Russian ruble slid 1 percent after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, which the Kremlin denies. The ruble slid to its lowest since late 2016, hitting 66.7099 rubles to the dollar and leaving it, after a second day of declines, more than 4 percent weaker than it had been late on Tuesday. Turkey’s lira touched a record low against the dollar, weakening 4 percent in 24 hours after meetings in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. “Politics continues to wreak short-term havoc in global FX markets,” said Viraj Patel, a currency strategist at Dutch bank ING. “We’re questioning whether any currency is truly safe.” MSCI’s all-country world stock index, rose 0.02 percent. European shares earlier in the session were lower but later pared most losses. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed up 0.02 percent, as did the blue-chip EURO STOXX 50. On Wall Street, the benchmark S&P 500 index rose modestly and remained less than half a percentage point from breaching an all-time high that was set in January. With the second-quarter U.S. earnings season mostly over, investors are turning their attention from solid economic growth and corporate profits to other risks, said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. The latter half of August into September is notoriously volatile and associated with some potential hiccups in the market, he said. “It wouldn’t surprise me to see the market struggle to move much higher from here, even if we do breach the all-time highs, until we get around to the next earnings seasons,” Arone said.

2018-08-09,"(Adds conference call details, updates shares) Aug 9 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp, the largest oil and gas producer in the Permian basin, on Thursday said it was raising its capital spending sharply but it maintained a tepid production forecast for the year, causing investors to send its shares down as much 6.3 percent. Producers are under pressure from investors to increase production while reining in expenses. In March, investors punished the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, Exxon Mobil, after it outlined plans to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments here Houston-based Occidental, which was the biggest drag Thursday on the S&P Energy Index and earlier the second biggest on the broader S&P 500 index, boosted its spending target to $5 billion from $3.9 billion, a 28 percent increase that surprised some analysts. On an earnings call on Thursday, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said the company’s outlays might go higher next year, to between $5 billion to $5.3 billion if oil prices,  now about $67 a barrel, held above $60. “We were a bit under capital versus our peers,” Hollub said in response to a question about the magnitude of the budget increase. Occidental lowered the top end of its production guidance while boosting the lower end. Occidental now expects annual output of 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 664,000 boe/d, compared with its earlier guidance of 645,000 boe/d to 665,000 boe/d. The company also said on its conference call that it raised annual guidance for production in the Permian by 3 percent, where it plans to spend most of the increased capex. “The disproportionate raise of 2018 capex relative to production guidance are going to be a hurdle for the stock near term,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher said the company expects increased Permian production due to improved well productivity and an increase in well count. The production gains and a sale of pipeline and oil-export assets will add about $5 billion to the company’s 2018 cash flow, he said, helping finance share repurchases and strengthening its balance sheet. Occidental had said in March that it expected its Permian shale division to break even - or generate as much cash as it spends - by the third quarter.. Shares of the company were down about 4 percent at $77.83 in Thursday afternoon.

2018-08-09,"MAIDUGURI, Nigeria (Reuters) - At least 15 soldiers and an official from Nigeria’s disaster agency were killed in an ambush by suspected Boko Haram militants in the northeast of the country, security sources said on Thursday, weeks after 20 troops went missing in an attack. The ambush occurred late on Wednesday in the northern Damasak area of Borno, the state worst hit by the jihadist group which has killed more than 30,000 people since 2009, when it launched an insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate. It highlights the challenge to secure the northeast months ahead of a February election President Muhammadu Buhari plans to contest in which security looks set to be a campaign issue.  In July a fourth commander in 14 months was named to lead the fight against the militants after a number of embarrassing defeats.  Two soldiers and a staff member from the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) said that 15 troops and a NEMA official who was with them were killed in the latest incident.  “We lost 15 troops. Our men were carrying out digging of trenches at Damasak yesterday when the Boko Haram terrorists opened fire on them,” said a soldier who did not want to be named. The NEMA worker, who also did not want to be named, said 18 were killed. NEMA also released a statement in which it confirmed the death of an official in the attack. “The Director General of the National Emergency Management Agency, Engr. Mustapha Maihaja and the management staff have been thrown into mourning following a death of a staff who was killed by Boko Haram yesterday in Damasak, Borno state,” it said. The deaths come after 20 Nigerian soldiers went missing in mid-July following a clash with militants in the Bama area of Borno. Military sources say the troops are feared dead. Boko Haram had held territory around the size of Belgium in northeast Nigeria for several months until being pushed off much of that land in early 2015 by Nigeria’s army and soldiers from neighbouring countries. Nigeria’s government has said since December 2015 that the insurgents have been “technically defeated”. Yet attacks continue in the northeast, while another group, an Islamic State ally that split from Boko Haram in 2016, also holds some territory.

2018-08-09,"RIYADH (Reuters) - A row over human rights in Saudi Arabia will not have any impact on Saudi oil supplies to Canada, its energy minister said on Thursday, reassuring customers after Riyadh froze new trade with Canada and ruled out mediation efforts. Saudi Arabia, angered by Canada’s demand last week that jailed activists in the kingdom be freed immediately, expelled the Canadian ambassador, blocked imports of Canadian grain and ended state-backed educational and medical programs in Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appeared to extend an olive branch on Wednesday, saying he would keep pressing Saudi Arabia on civil liberties but also saying the Gulf Arab state had made some progress on human rights. The Saudi Ambassador to Canada said in an interview with al Arabiya television on Thursday that Trudeau’s comments were positive, but more needed to be done.  “There is no doubt that the Prime Minister’s talk can be described as positive but we are still waiting for more to bridge the gap between the two friendly countries,” Naif bin Bandar al-Sudairi said. The dispute has threatened to undermine Riyadh’s foreign investment drive, a campaign already unsettled by a series of assertive political and diplomatic initiatives by the top oil exporter. Saudi Arabia has a “firm and long-standing policy” that petroleum supplies are not influenced by political considerations, Khalid al-Falih said in a statement. “The current diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada will not, in any way, impact Saudi Aramco’s relations with its customers in Canada.” The Financial Times said on Wednesday the Saudi central bank and state pension funds had told their overseas asset managers to sell their Canadian equities, bonds and cash holdings. A banking source said the Saudi central bank had asked for their bank’s exposure to Canadian assets, but there were no instructions to sell them. Canadian lender CIBC estimates Canadian dollar-denominated FX reserves held by Saudi Arabia at roughly C$10 billion to C$25 billion, or less than a tenth of daily volume in the currency. Riyadh’s Center for International Communication (CIC) posted a tweet late on Wednesday saying “neither the government nor the Central Bank or the state pension fund has issued any instructions regarding the sale of Canadian assets”.  But it promptly deleted the post without providing an explanation. CIC did not respond to a request for comment. “From a mutual funds perspective, I don’t think there’s any significant investment in Canada from Saudi Arabia,” said a banker based in Riyadh. “The footprint is light and very small compared to in the United States.” Eurasia Group said easing the crisis needed time. It added in a note: “The new Saudi leadership is leveraging economic and political tools to send a message to its partners that intervention in its domestic affairs will not be tolerated.” Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir on Wednesday ruled out any mediation efforts and said the kingdom was considering taking more measures against Canada for interfering in Saudi Arabia’s domestic affairs. He did not elaborate. Saudi Arabia has in recent months detained several women’s rights activists, some of whom had campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom’s male guardianship system, the latest to be swept up in a government crackdown on dissent.  Since rising to power in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has courted Western allies to support his reform plans to modernize and open up the kingdom, offering billions of dollars in arms sales and promising to fight radicalism in the kingdom. The 32-year-old de facto ruler has launched a campaign of social and economic change, but has not eased the absolute monarchy’s total ban on political activism. He has taken a more aggressive stance toward arch-rival Iran, begun a three-year-old war in Yemen and led a boycott of fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar. The row with Canada is a sign the prince is willing to risk riling international investors in order to stay in control of the process of change, RBC Capital Markets’ Helima Croft wrote. “Western governments expressing concerns about human rights issues in the kingdom is nothing new and Saudi authorities have long pushed back against what they characterize as inappropriate interference in their internal affairs,” she said in a note. But Prince Mohammed is more willing than predecessors to throw caution to the wind, she added, and may be extra sensitive to outside criticism in light of recent challenges implementing his ambitious economic reform agenda.

2018-08-09,"(Adds background) Aug 9 (Reuters) - Cheniere Energy Inc Chief Executive Jack Fusco said on Thursday he does not expect proposed Chinese tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas to have an economic impact on the LNG’s company’s existing contracts. “We don’t foresee an economic impact to Cheniere as it relates to our existing long-term contracts with PetroChina,” Fusco told analysts in a call following the release of the company’s second-quarter earnings. He was referring to China National Petroleum Corp’s (CNPC) PetroChina subsidiary, which in February agreed to buy about 1.2 million tonnes of LNG per year, or 0.16 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day, from Cheniere through 2043, with a portion of the supply beginning in 2018. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. China, which is embroiled in a trade war with the United States, added U.S. LNG to the list of prospective products it is considering for a 25 percent import tariff. Prior to the recent slowdown in shipments, China was on track to import 141.6 bcf of U.S. LNG in 2018, up from 103.4 bcf in 2017 and 17.2 bcf in 2016. It imported no LNG from the United States in 2015. “We are awaiting details of the proposed tariffs and are hopeful that the U.S. and China can resolve the trade dispute without these tariffs being implemented,” Fusco said, noting that U.S. LNG is an “important variable to help resolve trade issues” with China. “Our business is a very long-term one, and it is well understood that China needs more LNG over the long term,” Fusco said. “We expect to sell meaningful amounts of LNG into China over the long term.” China, which is trying to wean itself off coal to reduce pollution, became the world’s second-biggest LNG importer in 2017. The United States is on track to become the world’s third-biggest LNG exporter by capacity in 2019 as liquefaction trains under construction enter service. Cheniere, the biggest U.S. seller of LNG, operates four liquefaction trains at its Sabine Pass LNG export terminal in Louisiana and has four other trains under construction - one at Sabine and three at its Corpus Christi export terminal in Texas. The deal with PetroChina helped support Cheniere’s decision to move forward with the construction of the third train at Corpus. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-08-09,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Pumping carbon dioxide into the air makes the planet greener; the United Nations puts out fake science about climate change to control the global energy market; and wind and solar energy are simply “dumb”.  These are among the messages that flowed from the America First Energy Conference in New Orleans this week, hosted by some of the country’s most vocal climate change doubters - and attended by a handful of Trump administration officials. The second annual conference, organized by the conservative thinktank the Heartland Institute, pulled together speakers from JunkScience, the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, and the Center For Industrial Progress, along with officials from the U.S. Department of Interior and the White House for  panels that included: “Carbon Taxes, Cap & Trade, and Other Bad Ideas,” “Fiduciary Malpractice: The Sustainable Investment Movement,” and “Why CO2 Emissions Are Not Creating A Climate Crisis.” The day-long conference reflected the political rise of global warming skeptics in Donald Trump’s America that is occurring despite mounting scientific evidence – including from U.S. government agencies - that burning oil, coal, and natural gas is heating the planet and leading to drought, floods, wildfires, and more frequent powerful storms. A similar conference blasting the link between fossil fuels and climate change last year drew then-Environmental Protection Agency chief Scott Pruitt, who was appointed by Trump to reverse Obama-era climate initiatives and roll back regulation hindering drillers and miners but who has since resigned in a flurry of ethical controversies. The U.S. officials who joined included White House Special Assistant Brooke Rollins, Interior Department Assistant Secretary Joe Balash, and Jason Funes, an assistant in the office of external affairs at Interior. They praised the administration’s moves to clear the way for oil industry activity, and steered clear of commenting on climate change. But their presence gave climate change doubters at the conference a boost: “It’s a step in the right direction,” said self-described climate change doubter Roy Spencer, a principal research scientist at the University of Alabama, referring to the U.S. officials in attendance. In an email, Interior Department spokeswoman Heather Swift said department officials “speak at thousands of conferences every year and share ideas with a diverse group of individuals.” A White House spokesperson did not immediately comment. Tim Huelskamp, president and CEO of the Heartland Institute, said the views presented at the conference – once on the fringes of U.S. politics – would be proven right. “The leftist claims about sea level rise are overblown, overstated or frankly just wrong,” he said in an interview. Regarding the United Nations’ findings on climate change, he said it was “fake science” motivated by a desire for “power and control.”   Evidence of sea level rise, however, is strewn across the state that hosted the conference. New Orleans has been ravaged repeatedly by hurricanes that scientists say will become stronger and more frequent due to climate change. And the rest of Louisiana is losing coastline at one of the fastest rates on the planet due to sea level rise and encroaching industry, according to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. “It’s a nice world they live in,” said Steve Cochran, campaign director of Restore the Mississippi River Delta, an environmental consortium involved in coastal restoration programs, referring to the attendees of the America First Energy Conference. “It’s not the world we live in.” The Governor’s Office of Louisiana, a state that has earmarked tens of billions of dollars to fend off coastal erosion and relocate a Native American tribe from a sinking offshore island, did not respond to requests for comment about the conference. In the conference exhibit hall, the words “Coming Soon!” in big orange letters framed a Heartland Institute advertisement for the fifth volume in its “Climate Change Reconsidered” book series. Attendees also passed around a book titled “Dumb Energy: A Rant Against Wind and Solar Energy.” The more than 40 speakers praised Trump for withdrawing from the Paris climate accords, a global agreement to fight climate change mainly by cutting carbon emissions; and for rolling back regulations to allow oil companies to lead the biggest energy surge in the nation’s history.  But they warned that proponents of the U.S. oil and gas boom are still locked in an epic struggle with climate activists in academia and within federal agencies.  “The deep state is real,” said Congressman Clay Higgins, a Louisiana Republican, addressing the conference. “They’re certainly anti-fossil fuel.”  Higgins joked about renewable energy sources, like wind and solar, saying there is probably a conference somewhere in the United States where people are talking about “how the future of the world’s engine will be provided by rainbow dust and unicorn milk.”  David Legates, professor of climatology at the University of Delaware, argued that increased carbon dioxide emissions will not only leave the planet unharmed, but benefit plant life by allowing them to consume water more efficiently.  “So, you would expect, therefore, that this will be a greener planet,” Legates said.  Funes of the Interior Department spoke on a panel called “The Future of Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas,” alongside Joe Leimkuhler, vice president of drilling at LLOG Exploration Co. and Fred Palmer, who joined Heartland in 2016 after retiring from coal company Peabody Energy. “Oil production under President Trump has increased 2 million barrels per day since the beginning of his administration,” Funes said. “The U.S. is exporting four times as much oil as it exported a decade ago.” On the sidelines of the conference, Funes said he only attended the conference to speak about the nation’s surging oil production, and he refused to comment about the views of other speakers. Efforts to reach Balash and Rollins were unsuccessful.  But on the dinner keynote address, Balash embraced the most obvious mutual terrain between the conference organizers and the Trump administration – the U.S. deregulation push. “Last year, this administration rolled back 22 regulations for every one that it proposed,” Balash said. “Unfortunately, I think we need about a decade of that to get back to a reasonable place.” Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Paul Thomasch",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-climatechange/at-america-first-energy-conference-solar-power-is-dumb-climate-change-is-fake-idUKL5N1V05AW,09 Aug 2018,"Pumping carbon dioxide into

2018-08-09,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The Swiss government regrets the “deteriorating” situation regarding sanctions imposed by the United States on Iran, but recommends Swiss firms pursue their business relations with the Islamic Republic on an informed basis, it said on Thursday. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, as new U.S. sanctions targeting dollars, metals trading, coal, industrial software and its auto sector took effect despite pleas from Washington’s allies.  The move follows Washington reneging on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme. European countries, hoping to persuade Tehran to continue to respect the deal, have promised to try to lessen the blow of sanctions and to urge their firms not to pull out. But that has proved difficult: European companies have quit Iran, arguing that they cannot risk their U.S. business. “U.S. decisions on sanctions do not affect the legal situation in Switzerland with regard to Iran,” said Fabian Maienfisch of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Renewed U.S. sanctions may affect Swiss firms that have business relations with Iran, however.  “Switzerland regrets that the sanctions situation in relation to Iran is again deteriorating,” he said.

2018-08-09,"BUDAPEST (Reuters) - At Hungary’s Sziget Festival, the Danube river is providing revelers with some welcome respite from the searing temperatures that have hit much of Europe. Nearly 500,000 people are expected to attend the seven-day music and arts festival, set on an island surrounded by the river in the Hungarian capital and headlined by British acts Artic Monkeys, Liam Gallagher and American singer Lana Del Rey. With 35 Celsius (95F) heat, fire trucks roam the island to spray venues and people, health services are at the ready and there is easy access to drinks. “The best way to stay cool is to stay in the shade and drink beers and stay in the water,” New Zealand festival attendee Nathan Petere said. Organizers of the festival, which runs until Tuesday, have set up billboards warning attendees about the risks the hot weather poses, with a video played on loop on the main stages encouraging people to drink more water. Once the music starts, people leave the beach for the concerts armed with water guns to help stay cool. “A lot of people are using these sprays to keep people cool,” said Dutch attendee Roy Marsman, who was busy spraying people with water from his hammock.     His compatriot Bram van Heesch was already planning on returning to a refreshing spot in the Danube. “When the music starts we will go to check out the different stages but as soon as it gets too hot I might be coming back here,” he told Reuters.

Abu Dhabi slipped 1.1 percent, easing from a near four-year high on Wednesday. Aldar Properties dropped 2.5 percent, as investors were disappointed after the firm this week missed estimates with a 28 percent fall in second-quarter profit, which it blamed on a revaluation of properties related to its retail portfolio. First Abu Dhabi Bank also fell 2.4 percent. FAB shares have gained nearly 37 percent this year, fuelled by strong earnings and a move to expand in the Saudi market. In neighbouring Dubai, the index dropped almost 1 percent on selling in lender Emirates NBD which declined 2.9 percent. Contractor Arabtec also dropped 2.5 percent, after opening higher as it reported a 24 percent jump in quarterly profit. Saudi stocks were down 0.4 percent, as sharp swings in oil prices hit sentiment. Oil prices were higher on Thursday, but fell over 3 percent on concerns about a trade dispute between the United States and China. The ongoing trade war is rattling global markets and investors fear any slowdown in the world’s two largest economies would slash demand for commodities. Refiner Petro Rabigh fell 2.4 percent, partly affected by a 26 percent fall in second-quarter profit. Among other losers, petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries Corp ended 0.5 percent lower. The Qatari index fell almost 0.8 percent, dragged down by Industries Qatar which fell 2.3 percent despite reporting a rise in first half profits.

2018-08-09,"SEOUL/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told North Korea’s foreign minister that the United States cannot be trusted, Tehran’s state media said, as the United States seeks a deal to rein in the North’s nuclear and missile programmes. North Korea for its part denounced the United States for its “outdated acting script” in pressuring the North with continued sanctions, but said it was still prepared to meet its obligations after a historic North Korea-U.S. summit in Singapore in June. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from Washington for talks this week, saying it could not negotiate after the Trump administration reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s own nuclear programme. North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, visited Iran as the United States reintroduced sanctions against the Islamic Republic.  “The U.S. administration performance in these years has led the country to be considered untrustworthy and unreliable around the world which does not meet any of its obligations,” Rouhani was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as telling Ri on Wednesday. “In the current situation, friendly countries should develop their relations and cooperation in (the) international community,” he said, adding Iran and North Korea have “always had close views” on many issues.  Ri travelled to Tehran after attending a security forum in Singapore, where he and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparred over an agreement made at June’s landmark summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.  The two sides vowed to work towards North Korea’s denuclearisation at the summit, but have since struggled to reach a deal to meet that goal, with the United States insisting sanctions pressure must be maintained. North Korea’s foreign ministry said on Thursday it had stopped testing missiles and conducting nuclear tests “followed by dismantling the nuclear test ground”, and yet the United States still had insisted on “denuclearisation first”.   North Korea nevertheless went ahead with the return of the remains of U.S. soldiers killed in the 1950-53 Korean war, it said. “We hoped that these goodwill measures would contribute to breaking down the high barrier of mistrust existing between the DPRK (North Korea) and the U.S. and to establishing mutual trust,” it said in a statement carried by the North’s KCNA news agency. “However, the U.S. responded to our expectation by inciting international sanctions and pressure against the DPRK.” The United States was “attempting to invent a pretext for increased sanctions against the DPRK by mobilising all their servile mouthpieces and intelligence institutions to fabricate all kinds of falsehoods...” “As long as the U.S. denies even the basic decorum for its dialogue partner and clings to the outdated acting script which the previous administrations have all tried and failed, one cannot expect any progress in the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement including the denuclearisation... “We remain unchanged in our will to uphold the intentions of the top leaders of the DPRK and the U.S. and to build trust and implement in good faith the DPRK-U.S. joint statement step by step. The U.S. should, even at this belated time, respond to our sincere efforts in a corresponding manner.” Ri told Rouhani that Washington’s pullout from the 2015 pact and restoration of sanctions was an “action against international rules and regulations”, IRNA said.  “North Korea’s strategic policy is to deepen relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and confront unilateralism,” he said.

2018-08-09,"* Yamal’s 2nd LNG train launched ahead of schedule * Novatek aims for greater global LNG role * Yamal’s gas condensate may partially replace Iran’s - sources (Adds details, quotes, background) By Oksana Kobzeva and Natalia Chumakova MOSCOW, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Russia’s Novatek has launched a second liquefied natural gas (LNG) production train at its plant on the Yamal peninsula ahead of schedule, as Moscow tries to become a significant global player on the supercooled-gas market. Novatek, which controls Yamal LNG in which France’s Total along with China’s CNPC and the Silk Road Fund are minority shareholders, said the launch was made six months ahead of its initial schedule. Yamal ships LNG to Asia and Europe. Along with LNG, the Yamal plant is producing gas condensate, a type of light oil, which can replace some Iranian supplies to Middle Eastern companies as the United States reimposes sanctions on Tehran, trading sources said. The second LNG train’s annual capacity is 5.5 million tonnes, which will double Yamal’s output. Novatek is also building a third production train which is expected to be launched next year, raising annual LNG output to 16.5 million tonnes. Novatek’s chairman and co-owner Leonid Mikhelson said on Thursday that the two Yamal LNG trains represent around 3.5 percent of the global LNG market, a growing area for the world’s energy producers. “Our strategic goal is to produce between 55 and 60 million tonnes annually by 2030,” Mikhelson said in a statement. Novatek is also planning to launch its second LNG plant, Arctic LNG-2, after 2020. The launch of the second LNG train comes just days after China proposed tariffs on U.S. liquefied natural gas, widening the trade war between the two countries. In July, Novatek delivered the first LNG cargo to China via the Northern Sea Route alongside the Arctic coast, which drastically cuts delivery time to Asia. CNPC plans to start lifting at least 3 million tonnes of LNG from Yamal from 2019. At its peak, Yamal will produce over 1 million tonnes of gas condensate a year and Novatek has ordered special vessels for these shipments. In the first six months of the year, Novatek, which is Russia’s largest private gas producer, shipped 234,000 tonnes of Yamal condensate, selling the first cargo to commodities trader Vitol via a tender earlier this year. According to Reuters data and two trading sources, Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) has bought around 37,000 tonnes of condensate via a tender from Yamal - that cargo was loaded on a tanker at Yamal’s Sabetta port at the end of July. Iran has been one of the key gas condensate suppliers to ENOC but further exports could be complicated with sanctions due to be reimposed on Iran’s energy sector on Nov. 4. One of the trading sources said he believed that ENOC was making a test purchase of the Yamal condensate ahead of the sanctions coming into force. Novatek and ENOC did not reply to Reuters requests for comment.

A rally in Chinese stocks had helped offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war overnight after Beijing matched the latest U.S. sanctions, but too much was going on nearby for Europe to remain unscathed. London’s FTSE , Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC40 were down 0.7 percent, 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent respectively, while German government bonds rose in a broad grab for safety. Wall Street futures pointed to a steady start in New York but that was deceptive. The main fireworks were in the currency markets. The Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain, something the Kremlin denies. There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that, if passed, would impose even more widespread punishments for meddling in U.S. elections. The rouble slid to its lowest since late 2016, hitting 66.1 roubles to the dollar and leaving it almost 4 percent lighter than it had been 24 hours previously.. “I’m surprised that the market, in retrospect, was quite complacent about this risk,” said North Asset Management portfolio manager Peter Kisler, though he was relieved the new sanctions hadn’t flagged a ban on Russian sovereign debt or banks for the time being. Turkey’s lira, bond and stocks markets were taking even more of a pounding after meetings between officials in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. The lira touched a record low of 5.44 against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday’s close. There was widespread selling in the country’s bond markets and Istanbul stocks dropped 1 percent too. “We think Turkey may need to approach the IMF or seek other external support. Otherwise, capital-control measures seem to be a distinct possibility,” said fund manager Lombard Odier’s chief investment strategist, Salman Ahmed. Asia had been much brighter. Shanghai blue chips closed up 2.5 percent after talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending underpinned industrial resources, including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares reverse early losses to gain 0.5 percent, though Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, in part because core machinery orders fell. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free-trade agreement at talks in Washington later. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging down 13 cents to $66.80 per barrel and Brent flat at $72.27. Back in the FX markets, it wasn’t only emerging-market currencies that were struggling. The pound wallowed at its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears remained that Britain might leave the European Union without a deal on trade. Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a no-deal Brexit, an event that could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain’s biggest export market. Sterling was last trading at $1.2893, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight. The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a safe haven, with the dollar easing to 111.11 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday. The euro was subdued at $1.1590, while the dollar index was up at 95.282. The New Zealand dollar dropped 1.4 percent to a two-year low at $0.6641 after the country’s central bank pledged to keep rates at record lows well into 2020 . “The risk of rate moves over the next 12 months is weighted more towards cuts than hikes, and financial markets will price the risk accordingly,” said Kiwibank’s chief economist, Jarrod Kerr. “The good news here is interest rates and exchange rates will remain lower for much longer, assisting growth.” Reporting by Marc Jones in London and Wayne Cole in Sydney;

2018-08-09,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union said it was delivering on a deal with U.S. President Donald Trump to buy more U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Thursday but called on Washington to do more to make its prices competitive. In talks to urge Trump to drop hefty new tariffs last month, the EU’s chief executive Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to work to increase imports of U.S. soybeans and LNG to the bloc. The EU has long worked to diversify away from relying on Russia for almost 40 percent of its gas needs by developing LNG infrastructure to access other suppliers like the United States.  Whether U.S. LNG imports can win market share away from Russia, however, will depend on market forces, EU officials are quick to stress. “The growing exports of U.S. liquefied natural gas, if priced competitively, could play an increasing and strategic role in EU gas supply,” Juncker said in a statement. “But the U.S. needs to play its role in doing away with red tape restrictions,” he said, referring to U.S. rules that require regulatory approval for LNG exports to Europe.  Since the arrival of the first U.S. LNG supplies in 2016, cumulative imports to the bloc have reached 2.8 billion cubic metres, the EU said on Thursday. In 2017, Europe accounted for more than 10 percent of total U.S. LNG exports, up from 5 percent in 2016, it said. Spain, France and Italy are the largest of nine EU member states purchasing U.S. gas. The EU’s decision to publish historic trade data is unusual - part of the bloc’s drive to sway Trump by showing tariff-free trade flows can benefit the United States. Earlier this month, the European Commission published data showing a surge in U.S. soybean imports so far this year as buyers responded to plunging prices after China largely stopped buying U.S. soybeans in a tit-for-tat trade row. “Both sides have much to gain by working together,” Juncker added. Trump said in a Tweet last month that the EU would “be buying vast amounts of LNG”, while Juncker said the EU would build more terminals to handle American LNG. However, three-quarters of Europe’s existing import facilities lie empty while demand for U.S. LNG on the continent remains limited. The most lucrative markets for U.S. LNG are in South and Central America, India and the Far East, with Europe near the bottom of the pile given its relatively low prices and ample supplies of gas via pipelines from Russia and Norway.

2018-08-09,"(Repeats with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Trends in China's trade, economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 9 (Reuters) - It’s tempting to look at China’s imports of major commodities in July and conclude that the strength is a sign that the escalating trade dispute with the United States isn’t having much of an impact. While the first of the tit-for-tat tariffs came into effect in July, it will likely take several months before any real impact is discernable, and even then, separating out the effect of trade measures from other factors will be tricky. In the meantime, the commodity trade data can still provide insight to China’s economy, and it’s largely painting a picture of resilience. Imports of crude oil rose slightly in July to about 8.48 million barrels per day (bpd), up from June’s 8.36 million, according to customs data released on Wednesday. However, the market chose to focus more on the fact that July was the third-weakest month this year, and that the smaller, independent refiners known as teapots have cut back on their purchases. A combination of higher crude prices and changes in government taxes have been blamed for the weak growth in crude imports, and these factors have certainly tilted the playing field against smaller refiners. It’s also worth noting that China’s exports of refined products slipped in July, to 4.57 million tonnes, which equates to about 1.18 million bpd, using a conversion factor of 8 barrels of product per tonne of crude. This was down from about 1.27 million bpd in June, showing that some of the softness in crude imports can be ascribed to a slowing in the exports of refined fuels. Where there was unambiguous strength in China’s commodity imports was in iron ore and coal. Iron ore imports rebounded to 89.96 million tonnes in July from 83.24 million in June, although they are still down 0.7 percent for the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2017. The robust imports of iron ore can largely be ascribed to near record margins for steel producers and record output as mills try to maximise profits. An ongoing switch to higher grade iron ore by mills seeking to boost output while minimising emissions has also favoured imported iron ore over domestic output, which tends be low quality. Lower prices for iron ore during May and June, when July delivery cargoes would have been arranged, may also have contributed to the surge in imports. Coal imports leapt to the highest in 4-1/2 years, increasing 14 percent from June to 29.01 million tonnes in July. The surge can largely be put down to the heatwave afflicting much of the northern hemisphere, with China boosting power generation from thermal plants to cope with the additional demand for air-conditioning. Curbs on domestic output have also encouraged imports, with the latest available data showing production fell 1.4 percent in June to an eight-month low. The preliminary customs data released on Wednesday also doesn’t break down the types of coal being imported, and official details on this have not been released since March. However, it’s likely that in addition to strong demand for thermal coal for power generation, imports of coking coal for steel-making have been rising as well. This is because domestic coking coal output has been dropping, with a 4.7 percent slide reported in June and production for the first six months slipping 3.2 percent from the same period in 2017. The major industrial commodity most exposed to any pullback from the trade dispute with the administration of President Donald Trump is copper, but so far this hasn’t happened. Imports of unwrought copper rose 2.7 percent in July to 452,000 tonnes, while inbound shipments of copper ores and concentrates were up 5.4 percent to 1.845 million tonnes. Given copper’s importance in manufacturing and construction, any sign of weakness in Chinese demand would raise concerns about the impact of the trade dispute. Overall, China’s commodity imports aren’t raising any red flags, even if the strength in coal and iron ore looks to be partly the result of temporary factors. But it’s early days yet in the trade dispute, and it’s likely that imports in the fourth quarter of this year may be more instructive as to any impact.

2018-08-09,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co improperly tested vehicles for fuel economy and emissions, the Japanese government said on Thursday, revealing fresh cases of compliance failures by manufacturers. The results came to light after the government had ordered the automakers to check their operations after revelations of improper testing at Subaru Corp and Nissan Motor Co last year. The conduct of automakers globally has come under intense scrutiny after Germany’s Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) admitted in 2015 to installing secret software in hundreds of thousands of U.S. diesel cars to cheat exhaust emissions tests, and that as many as 11 million vehicles could have similar software installed worldwide. In the Japanese cases, the carmakers have not broken any laws or prompted massive recalls. But a growing list of improprieties has tarnished the image of the country’s manufacturing industry for high-quality products and efficiency. Suzuki, Mazda and Yamaha cleared vehicles for emissions or fuel efficiency even in cases where they were tested under invalid conditions, the ministry said in a statement. The errors related to slight deviations in the speed of the vehicles during testing that should have invalidated the test results. The automakers examined tests they had conducted over different periods of time and in Suzuki’s case they stretched back to 2012. None of the automakers found significant problems with actual emissions and fuel economy performance of the vehicles, which were destined for sale in Japan, and do not plan any recalls. Suzuki, Japan’s fourth-largest automaker, said that of 12,819 sample vehicles tested for fuel economy and emissions since June 2012, around 50 percent of them had been inspected improperly. “I deeply apologize and will lead efforts to prevent recurrence,” Suzuki Chief Executive Toshihiro Suzuki told a news conference. Mazda said there were irregularities in 4 percent of similar inspections on its cars, or just over 70 vehicles. In Yamaha’s case, irregularities were found in 2 percent of inspections, or just a handful of vehicles. Both Mazda and Yamaha apologized. Suzuki and Yamaha shares fell 6 and 5 percent, respectively, and Mazda shares were down 1 percent, underperforming a steady benchmark Nikkei average. In July this year, Nissan admitted it had improperly measured exhaust emissions and fuel economy for 19 vehicle models sold in Japan. Kobe Steel, Mitsubishi Materials Corp and Toray Industries - all key suppliers of motor parts to global manufacturers - admitted to product data fabrication last year. Many of the automakers, already hit by lackluster sales, have also been under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported vehicles.

2018-08-09,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co. Ltd (7267.T) will recall 69,090 UR-V sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in China, market regulators said on Thursday, a result of a cold-climate engine problem that has already forced the recall of hundreds of thousands of vehicles. The UR-V is produced and sold in China, the world’s biggest auto market, by Honda’s joint venture with the Dongfeng Motor Group (0489.HK).  As many as 18,907 vehicle recalls are linked to problems caused by an unusual amount of uncombusted petrol collecting in the engine’s lubricant oil pan, the Defective Product Administration Center of State Administration of Market Regulation said on Thursday.   The issue in some cases caused a strong odour of gasoline inside the car and in other cases the car’s check-engine light came on, Honda has said. The Japanese automaker says the problem does not affect the engine’s performance and there have been no reports of accidents because of this particular issue.  Honda recalled 96,900 SUV Avancier vehicles on Monday. The cold-climate engine issue also prompted the Tokyo-headquartered automaker to recall 130,000 of its popular CR-V SUV models and 294,500 Civic cars from China earlier this year. Honda’s China spokesman Zhu Linjie declined to comment on Thursday but he said on Monday the company was now studying to see if the same issue was affecting the Honda Jade car and the UR-V crossover SUV.

2018-08-09,"ROME (Reuters) - Italian police said on Thursday they found 20 tonnes of hash worth as much as 200 million euros (£180 million) in the fuel tanks of a Panama-flagged ship that was stopped in international waters and escorted to Sicily. The entire 11-person crew, all from Montenegro, was arrested for international drugs trafficking, Italy’s finance police said in a statement.  The research and survey vessel Remus left the Canary Islands bound for Egypt and Turkey, but police surveillance showed it had turned off its position transmitter near the coast of North Africa, raising investigators’ suspicions. With the permission of Panamanian authorities, Italian finance police seized the vessel in international waters on July 31 and escorted it to Palermo. There the fuel tanks were drained and the hash was discovered wrapped in sealed brown bags. “The Mediterranean Sea again is confirmed to be one of the world’s largest arteries for illegal trafficking,” the police statement said. “The results of the operation are the fruit of attentive intelligence gathering and analysis of the ship’s routes.”   The North African hashish — compressed cannabis resin — was probably destined for the European market, police said. Morocco is the world’s largest producer of hashish, which is usually smuggled into Europe through Spain, according the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.

2018-08-09,"RAMALLAH/GAZA (Reuters) - From orderly rows of solar panels in a field in the West Bank to the chaotic rooftops of Gaza, Palestinians are hoping that harnessing the energy of the sun can reduce their dependence on Israel for electricity. The West Bank only gets around three-quarters of the power its 3 million people need, imported mostly from Israel and, to a far lesser extent, Jordan.  In the Gaza Strip, power generation is so paltry that, even with imports from Israel and Egypt, it gets just one-third of what it needs - so the 2 million Gazans struggle on with an average of just four hours of electricity a day. Individuals have taken it on themselves to install solar panels, trailing cables down the side of buildings to keep fans whirring or to power televisions and other appliances. The number of panels in the enclave has increased four-fold in four years and they are now dotted on most rooftops and balcony on homes, schools, hospitals, shops, banks and mosques in a place where the sun shines 320 days a year. In Gaza’s Nusseirat refugee camp, Sabreen Abu Shawiesh said installing solar panels on the metal roof of her one-floor house had changed her family’s life: “We almost had no electricity, nowadays fans are working all day.” The sun may be free, but the technology is not, and Palestinians say their ability to import solar panels has been hampered by Israeli border controls. In Gaza, which has endured years of Israeli and Egyptian sanctions aimed at isolating Islamist Hamas which rules the territory, tensions raised by weekly border protest since March 30 have increased the problem. Israel has blocked all imports into the enclave except for humanitarian supplies. Even before then, entrepreneurs in Gaza say they have sometimes been banned from importing various kinds of batteries - including those used for solar power - by Israel, on the grounds that they might be used for military purposes. A spokesman for Israel’s Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories said Israel had not imposed any import restrictions on solar panel technology and did not consider it to be “dual purpose”. In the West Bank, ruled by President Mahmoud Abbas’s Western-backed Palestinian Authority, the public and private sectors have launched projects to diversify power sources to get cheaper electricity and more self-sufficiency. “The government is in dire need of individual initiatives and investments to provide power so that it can become independent of the occupation (Israel), step by step,” Shifa’ Abu Sa’adi, head of natural resources at the Palestinian economy ministry, told Reuters.     The Authority’s Palestinian Investment Fund (PIF) plans to build three solar farms and put solar energy into 500 schools. The three new plants will generate 22 megawatts per day. The West Bank needs 1,400 megawatts but currently only 1,100 megawatts are available. Larger solar projects would require more land but it is scarce because, under the Oslo peace accords of the mid-1990s, Israel retains control of much of the land of the West Bank. “We will be in a good position if we reach 5 or 10 per cent of the required electricity supply for Palestine in general from solar energy,” said Azem Bishara, chief executive officer of Massader, a subsidiary of the PIF. Bishara said Massader intended to invest $200 million in renewable energy over the next six years to generate an additional 200 megawatts. The Gaza Strip only has one power plant, which generated 140 megawatts in 1999 when it was built but now only produces 23 megawatts. The enclave imports 30 megawatts from Egypt and 120 from Israel. This is less than a third of the Strip’s daily needs - estimated at up to 600 megawatts a day. Last week the European Union completed Gaza’s biggest solar farm which will provide 0.5 megawatts per day to fuel the Southern Gaza Desalination Plant, also funded by the EU. U.N. Deputy Special Coordinator for Middle East Peace Process Jamie McGoldrick this week urged Israel to allow U.N.-purchased emergency fuel needed for backup generators at vital health, water and sanitation operations. “The well-being of 2 million people, half of whom are children, is at stake. It is unacceptable that Palestinians in Gaza are repeatedly deprived of the most basic elements of a dignified life,” McGoldrick said. Israel’s Defence Ministry had no immediate comment.

2018-08-09,"NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When two university students knocked on the door of Lillian Kanari’s organic food shop five years ago seeking work, she realised their web design skills could help her business solve one of its most intractable problems: food waste. Until then, most orders were placed over the phone - and that resulted in some customers complaining that what had been delivered to their homes was not what they had ordered. “It cost us a lot in terms of losses and food wastage.” Nowadays, knowing exactly what customers want allows her three small-scale farms to operate more efficiently, and that cuts waste, she said. “Home deliveries have helped us know our customers’ consumption patterns... We have a planting and harvesting calendar right from the farm to enable us to plan what we need for the coming season,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Having a website also means more business, she said: her Kalimoni Greens online shop delivers 200 orders weekly in September-to-March’s high season, up from 20 a week previously. Kanari is one of about 8,000 Kenyan farmers who have gone online in recent years to sell directly to the public - as opposed to selling to intermediaries like market vendors - in a bid to boost sales and reduce food waste, according to the Kenya National Farmers Federation (KENAFF). Doing so could generate significant sums for the farmers, given that agriculture contributes about a quarter of Kenya’s $86 billion GDP, said KENAFF head Mwenda M’Mailutha. “Most of these are smallholder farmers who rely on agriculture for food and income. Technology can help them in marketing, and avoid middlemen who buy their produce at low prices,” he said. Smallscale farmer Sylvia Kuria’s farm in Limuru lies about 30 kilometres (18 miles) northwest of Nairobi, and before she set up her online shop she could sell only to market traders. That meant narrow profit margins and regular haggling for each order. It also meant some vegetables from her farm would spoil - either en route to the market or while at the market. Spoilage is a global problem, the U.N.’s Food & Agriculture Organization says, with about one-third of the world’s food wasted. In Kenya, a lack of proper storage facilities post-harvest and at markets means 40 percent of food is wasted before it can be eaten, said Jerome Ochieng’, principal secretary at the Ministry of Information, Communication and Technology. The government wants farmers to lower that number - and technology can help, he said, with smart government initiatives that take transactions online, for instance, able to cut costs, eliminate corruption, and increase efficiency and effectiveness. He said more farmers should make use of digital solutions. “The agriculture sector in Kenya is expanding at a rate of five percent every year,” Ochieng’ told a digital farmers conference in May. “Farmers need to be part of this digital revolution so that they can play a role in ensuring there is no food waste from the agriculture sector,” he said. To that end, Ochieng’ said, the government last year launched its ‘Big Four Agenda’: a plan to boost economic growth by focusing on food security, as well as on affordable housing, manufacturing and affordable health care. But when it comes to cutting wastage, he said, rural roads remain a challenge: although Kenya’s road network has improved, those in rural areas are not yet well developed, which means produce gets damaged in transit. Kanari said one solution is to open a shop in a central area like Nairobi where farmers can store and distribute their produce. Another, she added, is to partner with established food distributors to help farmers get their produce to such shops. When it comes to home delivery, she said, using motorbikes rather than trucks gives her store an environmental edge. “Motorbikes are faster, efficient and will not get stuck in traffic jams where most emissions occur,” she said. Paul Kukubo, a director at the Communications Authority of Kenya, said online shopping not only cuts food waste attributable to post-harvest losses; it also means fewer miles travelled by producers and consumers to and from markets. “This reduces the amount of carbon emissions that vehicles would have released to the atmosphere for that day,” he said. “This is important especially at this time when Kenya is struggling with increased air pollution in its cities.” Kanari said small retailers like her could do more for the environment by looking at packaging too. In her case, she works with a group of women in central Kenya who supply about 500 woven baskets a month. Once used for deliveries, the baskets are taken back to the shop then swapped with fresh ones. ""Once (the baskets) get old, they can be used at the farms for other tasks like harvesting produce from there. This helps reduce the amount of waste being dumped in the environment.""

2018-08-09,"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish energy group Orsted (ORSTED.CO) has agreed to buy U.S. onshore wind farm developer Lincoln Clean Energy (LCE) in a $580 million deal, aiming to gain a foothold in what it sees as a key growth market.  The acquisition is the latest move for Orsted as it seeks to shed its fossil fuel business and become an entirely green energy company.  Orsted, which has so far mainly developed offshore wind farms in Europe, said the global market for onshore wind power is expected to grow significantly in coming years and that the United States is a key market. “We see this as a very valuable addition to building a long-term platform for growth in the U.S. market, across technologies,” Chief Executive Henrik Poulsen told journalists. The company, previously known as DONG Energy, said in February it was looking at investments in energy storage, solar projects and onshore wind. It was previously involved in onshore wind but sold the business in 2013 due to financial challenges. Orsted shares, which have risen 57 percent since listing in Copenhagen in June 2016, were trading 5.4 percent higher at 405.90 Danish crowns by 0815 GMT. The company is courting investors interested in green assets, which have received a boost from government policies. Last year it sold its oil and gas business to Ineos and has also put its Danish power distribution business up for sale. Orsted has named the United States and Taiwan as its two key growth markets outside its core northern European region. While it has won the right to develop two projects with a combined capacity of 1820 megawatt in Taiwan, it has so far been unsuccessful in winning tenders in the United States. “We see Lincoln adding further to our critical mass and our presence in the United States,” Poulsen said. Focused on wind and solar power, LCE has developed projects in Texas, California and New Jersey. Orsted is buying the business from investment manager I Squared Capital. Orsted also posted second-quarter core profit (EBITDA) of 3.1 billion Danish crowns ($482 million) versus an average 3.13 billion seen in a Reuters poll. It said it expected full-year EBITDA towards the upper end of its previously guided range of between 12.5 billion crowns and 13.5 billion. Orsted also said it was likely to sell 50 percent of its Hornsea 1 project in the British part of the North Sea this year.

2018-08-09,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 9 (Reuters) - South African power utility Eskom and trade unions reached an “in principle” wage deal, the company said late on Wednesday, potentially ending weeks of tense negotiations that have lead to power outages in Africa’s most industrialised economy. Last week Eskom offered the three main unions a salary increase of 7.5 percent this year and 7 percent next year and in 2020, plus an inflation-linked increase in housing allowances and a one-off cash payment of 5,000 rand ($370). The offer was accepted by the Solidarity union last week while the two larger unions, National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) said they would consider it. “Wage talks between Eskom and trade unions, primarily NUM and Numsa, ended without a signed agreement although the unions have in principle accepted Eskom’s offer,” said Eskom spokesperson Khulu Phasiwe. In a statement released late on Wednesday the power firm said the two unions wanted members who participated in an illegal strike to not face disciplinary action, a condition Eskom rejected. Eskom did however agree to a request by the unions for a meeting with minister of state firms Pravin Gordhan and the firm’s board. The cash-strapped power utility, which generates more than 90 percent of the country’s power, is desperate to end the work stoppages and push ahead with a turnaround plan that is centrepiece of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s pledge to reform the economy.

A rally in Chinese stocks had helped offset the latest escalation in the Sino-U.S. trade war in Asia overnight, but too much was going on nearby for Europe to stay upright. London’s FTSE , Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’ CAC40 were down 0.6 percent, 0.1 percent and 0.4 percent respectively, while German government bonds rose in broad grab for safety. But the main fireworks were in the currency markets. The Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain . There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that would impose widespread sanctions on Russia for meddling in U.S. elections. The rouble slid to its lowest since late 2016, 66 roubles to the dollar. The Russian currency dropped 1 percent after falling 3 percent overnight. “I’m surprised that the market, in retrospect, was quite complacent about this risk,” said North Asset Management portfolio manager Peter Kisler, though he was relieved the new sanctions hadn’t flagged a ban on Russian sovereign debt or banks. Turkey’s lira, bond and stocks markets were also taking a pounding after meetings between officials in Washington looked to have made little progress in mending a row over Ankara’s jailing of an American pastor. The lira touched a record low of 5.44 against the dollar, weakening some 2.5 percent from Wednesday’s close. There was widespread selling in the country’s bond markets and Istanbul stocks dropped 1 percent. Asia had been much brighter. Shanghai blue chips closed up 2.5 percent after talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, the latest in a series of growth-boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending underpinned industrial resources, including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reverse early losses to gain 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, in part because core machinery orders fell. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free-trade agreement at talks in Washington later. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had already announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging up 12 cents to $67.08 per barrel. Brent rose by 24 cents to $72.52. Back in the FX markets, it wasn’t only emerging-market currencies that were struggling. The pound skidded to its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears grew Britain might leave the European Union without a deal on trade. Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a no-deal Brexit, an event that could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain’s biggest export market. Sterling was last trading at $1.2881, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight. The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a safe haven, with the dollar easing to 111.07 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday. The euro was relatively subdued at $1.1585, while the dollar index was up at 95.282.

2018-08-09,"BEIJING, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Talks on completing a code of conduct for the disputed South China Sea will be long and complex and it would be unrealistic to set a timetable, state media on Thursday cited a senior Chinese diplomat as saying. Southeast Asia and China agreed last week on a working text to continue long drawn-out negotiations over the code of conduct, with officials lauding it as a “milestone” and “great progress”. Several members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China have overlapping claims to the sea, one of the world’s busiest and most strategic waterways, where China has expanded reefs into manmade islands. For years they have been discussing a pact to prevent an escalation of disputes. In an interview with China Newsweek magazine, Yi Xianliang, Director General of the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, said the talks were continuing. Many of the topics were complex and sensitive and there were many different points of view, he said. “If these issues are to be resolved, and the code finally comes together, all sides need to keep looking for the greatest common denominator,” Yi added. “There are voices from the outside, who are trying to set a timetable for the talks on the code. I think this is unrealistic,” he said. Any multilateral talks take time, especially on such a complex issue as the South China Sea, Yi added. “It is impossible to define a timetable. Instead of setting the timetable unrealistically, and binding one’s hands, it’s better to step forward one foot at a time.” China has repeatedly denounced what it views as interference from “countries outside the region” in the South China Sea, generally a message to the United States and its allies to stay out of the dispute. Signing China up to a legally binding and enforceable code for the waterway has long been a goal for claimant members of ASEAN, some of whom have sparred for years over what they see as China’s disregard for their sovereign rights and its blocking of fishermen and energy exploration efforts. Yi said that matter was “complex”. “Certain countries outside the region have been agitating that the code must be legally binding. This issue is quite complicated, including the domestic legal procedures involved in the countries concerned,” he added, without elaborating.

2018-08-09,"MELBOURNE, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Australia’s states are set to vote on Friday on a policy to end more than a decade of climate and energy wars and spur investment in new power supply, but the plan may be killed by states that want tougher emissions targets. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pushing the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) in a desperate bid to bring down electricity prices, which have more than doubled over the past decade, and ensure the lights stay on following a string of blackouts in 2016 and 2017. “The National Energy Guarantee is a historic reform. It should be supported in the national interest. It will deliver lower prices, cleaner energy and a much more reliable energy system,” Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said. Under the NEG, power retailers, led by Origin Energy , AGL Energy and Energy Australia, would be required to meet reliability and emissions targets. The aim is to ensure there is enough “dispatchable” energy, power that can back up intermittent wind and solar power, and cut carbon emissions from the sector by 26 percent from 2005 levels, in line with Australia’s Paris Climate Accord target. Modelling showed the National Energy Guarantee would bring down wholesale power prices by more than 20 percent from where they would be without the policy. The framework has won broad support from power producers clamouring for clarity on carbon policy to support new power plant investments, as well as from businesses, farmers and consumer groups battling high and volatile electricity prices. “It’s not perfect. But what it does do is present Australia and investors with certainty...I sincerely hope that reason prevails on Friday and we get an agreement on the NEG,” Nigel Garrard, managing director of packaging manufacturer Orora Ltd , told reporters on Thursday. The framework was designed by independent experts on the Energy Security Board to be technology-neutral and not involve setting any price on carbon emissions, in order to secure support from the Coalition government’s right wing. Negotiated over nearly a year, the plan needs unanimous assent from all six states to go ahead. But the state of Victoria, where the Labor government faces an election in November and stands to lose seats to the Greens, has thrown up last-minute hurdles which will be tough for  the governing coalition to overcome. Victoria wants emissions reduction targets that can only be strengthened over time, with targets to be reviewed every three years and future targets to be set by regulation rather than legislation. Pro-coal former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and rural-party Nationals members in Turnbull’s coalition do not want to give any future Labor government the power to easily raise emissions reduction targets and make coal-fired electricity less competitive. “We can still get this right — but only if Malcolm Turnbull stares down the climate-crazies in his party,” Victoria’s energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio said on Wednesday.

2018-08-09,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Fragments from a missile launched into Saudi Arabia from Yemen by Houthi forces killed one civilian and wounded 11, Saudi state media said on Thursday.  The Houthis, an Iran-allied group that controls much of Yemen including the capital Sanaa, said it fired a missile at the Jizan Industrial City in southern Saudi Arabia, according to the Houthi-run al-Masirah TV. The kingdom’s air defence forces intercepted the missile, Saudi state news channel al-Ekhbariya said late on Wednesday. State news agency SPA later said one Yemeni resident in Jizan was killed. “The interception resulted in projection of fragments throughout some residential areas, which caused the martyrdom of a Yemeni resident, and injuries among 11 civilians,” the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis in Yemen’s civil war said in a statement reported by SPA on Thursday. The Houthis have fired dozens of missiles into the kingdom in recent months, part of a three-year-old conflict widely seen as a proxy battle between regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran. Most have been intercepted by the Saudi military. The coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates intervened in Yemen’s war in 2015 to unseat the Houthis and restore the internationally recognised government in exile.

2018-08-09,"SEOUL/BEIRUT, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told North Korea’s foreign minister that the United States cannot be trusted, Tehran’s state media said, as the United States seeks a deal to rein in the North’s nuclear and missile programmes. Iran dismissed a last-minute offer from Washington for talks this week, saying it could not negotiate after the Trump administration reneged on a 2015 deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran’s own nuclear programme. North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, visited Iran as the United States reintroduced sanctions against the Islamic Republic. “The U.S. administration performance in these years has led the country to be considered untrustworthy and unreliable around the world which does not meet any of its obligations,” Rouhani was quoted by the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) as telling Ri on Wednesday. “In the current situation, friendly countries should develop their relations and cooperation in (the) international community,” he said, adding Iran and North Korea have “always had close views” on many issues. Ri travelled to Tehran after attending a security forum in Singapore, where he and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sparred over an agreement made at June’s landmark summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The two sides vowed to work towards North Korea’s denuclearisation at the summit, but have since struggled to reach a deal to meet that goal. North Korea has been pursuing its weapons programmes in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions and sanctions. Ri told Rouhani that Washington’s pullout from the 2015 pact and restoration of sanctions was an “action against international rules and regulations”, IRNA said. “North Korea’s strategic policy is to deepen relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran and confront unilateralism,” he said. Trump decided to restore sanctions against Iran despite pleas from other world powers that had co-sponsored the deal, including Washington’s main European allies, Britain, France and Germany, as well as Russia and China. The sanctions have already led banks and many companies around the world to scale back dealings with Iran. Companies doing business with Iran will be barred from the United States, Trump said on Tuesday. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, said the country had nothing to be concerned about, his official website said on Wednesday. “With regard to our situation do not be worried at all. Nobody can do anything,” Khamenei said, the website reported. “They can be sure. There is no doubt about this.” (Reporting by Hyonhee Shin in SEOUL and Babak Dehghanpisheh in BEIRUT Editing by Nick Macfie)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear-northkorea/u-s-cant-be-trusted-irans-rouhani-tells-north-korea-idUKL4N1V02EP,09 Aug 2018,"Iranian President Hassan

2018-08-09,"(Adds graphic) BEIJING, Aug 9 (Reuters) - At least four cargoes of U.S. coal worth $30 million are headed to China as Beijing prepares to hit imports with hefty 25-percent tariffs, threatening a niche supply of the fuel even as China’s appetite for foreign coal shows no sign of abating. The vessels, carrying a combined 335,000 tonnes of coal, are the only confirmed cargoes in transit from the United States to China, and are scheduled to land in time to avoid the new duties. On Wednesday night, the Ministry of Commerce published its final list of U.S. items worth $16 billion in imports that will incur an additional 25-percent tariff, including coal. The penalties will come into effect on Aug. 23 after Washington plans to start collecting duties on Chinese products of the same value. Coal was also in the draft list issued in June. China’s coal imports have soared as domestic output has flagged, while searing summer temperatures have fuelled demand from utilities. Data on Wednesday showed arrivals hit their highest in more than four years in July. But the new duties are likely to curb exports from the United States, which ramped up shipments in 2017 as its beleaguered coal mining sector has undergone a resurgence under U.S. President Donald Trump. The United States shipped 3.2 million tonnes of coal to China last year, up from less than 700 tonnes in 2016, making it China’s seventh largest supplier, although well behind top supplier Australia with nearly 80 million tonnes. But it takes six weeks for a cargo to travel from the United States - compared with several weeks for Indonesia and Australia - costs more to ship and U.S. coal is of a lower quality than Australian coal. That means replacing U.S. shipments with coal from other places may not be difficult, sources said. “In all aspects, U.S. coal does not have any advantages,” said Zhang Min, coal analyst at China Sublime Information Group. “According to our calculation, after the 25-percent tariff, U.S. coal will cost at least $30 per tonne more, which basically rules it out of the Chinese market.” Reporting by Josephine Mason and Muyu Xu; editing by Richard

Shanghai blue chips climbed 2.7 percent amid talk of possible government support for home-grown technology companies, just the latest in a series of growth boosting measures rolled out by Beijing as the trade dispute worsens. Hopes for more Chinese infrastructure spending also underpinned industrial resources including iron ore and copper. The gains in Chinese stocks helped MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reverse early losses to nudge up 0.5 percent. The relief had yet to spread to Europe with financial spreadbetters tipping London’s FTSE to open 8 points lower, Frankfurt’s DAX 4 points down and Paris’ CAC flat. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 0.2 percent, weighed in part by a shock slump in core machinery orders. Shares in Mazda Motor Corp, Suzuki Motor Corp and Yamaha Motor Co also fell on news they conducted improper fuel economy and emissions tests on their vehicles. Japan will try to avert steep tariffs on its car exports and fend off U.S. demands for a free trade agreement at talks in Washington later in the session. Early on Thursday, China’s state broadcaster said the country must counteract U.S. tariffs and that Beijing had the confidence to protect its own interests as well as the means to do so. China had already announced additional tariffs of 25 percent on $16 billion worth of U.S. imports from fuel to autos. The tariffs will apply to billions of dollars in U.S. gasoline, diesel and other oil products, though not crude. The oil market took the news hard on Wednesday, suffering losses of more than 3 percent. Prices steadied a little on Thursday, with U.S. crude edging up 12 cents to $67.08 per barrel, while Brent bounced 24 cents to $72.52. In currency markets, the Russian rouble sank after Washington said it would impose fresh sanctions because it had determined that Moscow had used a nerve agent against a former Russian agent and his daughter in Britain. There were also reports of a new U.S. Senate bill that would impose widespread sanctions on Russia for election meddling. The rouble duly slid to its lowest since late 2016, with the dollar buying 65.74 roubles having jumped 3.3 percent overnight. The pound skidded to its lowest against the dollar and euro in almost a year as fears grew Britain might leave the EU without a deal on trade with Brussels. Traders reported a significant increase in investors hedging against a ‘no-deal’ Brexit, an event which could send sterling into free fall and hurt the economy by raising trade barriers with Britain’s biggest export market. Sterling was last trading at $1.2881, having dropped 0.4 percent overnight. The Japanese yen seemed to be catching a bid as a traditional safe-haven, with the dollar easing to 110.95 yen after stretching as high as 111.44 on Wednesday. The euro was relatively steady at $1.1610, while the dollar index was a shade firmer at 95.124.

But AGL shares slumped 5 percent on Thursday as it warned it expects almost no profit growth this year, with wholesale prices dropping and a retail war persisting. The record result came a day ahead of a key meeting of state energy ministers to consider a long-awaited policy designed to boost power supply and lower prices while cutting carbon emissions, ending a decade of dispute between green energy proponents and those focused on costs and security of supply. “Policy certainty is key to encouraging further investment in generation supply, which will place downward pressure on electricity prices and ultimately benefit customers,” AGL Chief Executive Andy Vesey told analysts. AGL backs the new policy, dubbed the ‘National Energy Guarantee’. The company reported an underlying profit of A$1.02 billion ($758 million) for the year ended June, above analysts’ forecasts. But its outlook for a profit between A$970 million and A$1.07 billion for fiscal 2019, was weaker than expected, sending its shares lower in a broader market that was trading higher. “It does show there are pressures in the business eating away at it, that’s why guidance was a bit tepid versus expectations. But it’s still a good profit,” said Jason Teh, Chief Investment Officer at Vertium Asset Management, which does not own AGL shares citing the challenges the company faces. AGL said high wholesale power prices over the past year were largely due to the shutdown of two coal-fired power stations over the previous two years, but said prices had peaked. At the same time, it warned that an ongoing war for household and business customers, where its biggest rivals are Origin Energy and Energy Australia, will eat into its profit margin. “We believe the level of competitive intensity we see in the market now will continue,” Vesey said. To offset the margin squeeze, AGL has set out to cut operating costs by 13 percent over the next three years, with A$120 million in cuts targeted for this year. While facing heat to cut household power bills, AGL has also been pressed by the government to keep its ageing Liddell coal-fired power station open beyond 2022 or sell it to ensure there is back-up for intermittent wind and solar power generation. AGL has instead opted to replace Liddell’s capacity with a A$1.36 billion combination of gas-fired plants, an upgrade of another coal-fired plant, renewable power, and possibly some energy storage, including pumped hydro. $1 = 1.3457 Australian dollars

2018-08-09,"TOKYO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded on Thursday after heavy losses in the previous session that came as the China-U.S. trade dispute escalated, with official Chinese data indicating energy demand in the world’s top importer has yet to recover its strength. Brent crude futures were up 24 cents, or a third of a percent, at $72.52 a barrel by 0355 GMT, following a decline of more than 3 percent on Wednesday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures had gained 7 cents to $67.02 a barrel, after dropping 3.22 percent the previous session. China is slapping tariffs of 25 percent on a further $16 billion in imports from the United States, from fuel and steel products to autos and medical equipment. The ongoing trade war is rattling global markets and investors fear any slowdown in the world’s two largest economies would slash demand for commodities. China’s crude imports recovered slightly in July after two months of decline, but were still among the lowest this year due to a drop-off in demand from smaller independent refineries. China, the world’s top importer of crude, took 8.48 million barrels per day (bpd) last month, up from 8.18 million bpd a year earlier and June’s 8.36 million bpd, customs data showed. Prices are drawing some support from U.S. sanctions introduced on Tuesday against Iran, third-biggest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The renewed sanctions won’t directly target oil until November, but U.S. President Donald Trump has said he wants as many countries as possible to cut their imports of Iranian crude to zero. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, meanwhile, reported that crude inventories fell 1.4 million barrels in the latest week, less than half the 3.3 million-barrel draw analysts had expected. Gasoline stocks notched a surprise rise as well of 2.9 million barrels, not the 1.7 million-barrel drop analysts had predicted in a Reuters poll.

2018-08-09,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It’s tempting to look at China’s imports of major commodities in July and conclude that the strength is a sign that the escalating trade dispute with the United States isn’t having much of an impact. While the first of the tit-for-tat tariffs came into effect in July, it will likely take several months before any real impact is discernable, and even then, separating out the effect of trade measures from other factors will be tricky. In the meantime, the commodity trade data can still provide insight to China’s economy, and it’s largely painting a picture of resilience. Imports of crude oil rose slightly in July to about 8.48 million barrels per day (bpd), up from June’s 8.36 million, according to customs data released on Wednesday. (Graphic: Trends in China's trade, economy: tmsnrt.rs/2iO9Q6a) However, the market chose to focus more on the fact that July was the third-weakest month this year, and that the smaller, independent refiners known as teapots have cut back on their purchases. A combination of higher crude prices and changes in government taxes have been blamed for the weak growth in crude imports, and these factors have certainly tilted the playing field against smaller refiners. It’s also worth noting that China’s exports of refined products slipped in July, to 4.57 million tonnes, which equates to about 1.18 million bpd, using a conversion factor of 8 barrels of product per tonne of crude. This was down from about 1.27 million bpd in June, showing that some of the softness in crude imports can be ascribed to a slowing in the exports of refined fuels. Where there was unambiguous strength in China’s commodity imports was in iron ore and coal. Iron ore imports rebounded to 89.96 million tonnes in July from 83.24 million in June, although they are still down 0.7 percent for the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 2017. The robust imports of iron ore can largely be ascribed to near record margins for steel producers and record output as mills try to maximise profits. An ongoing switch to higher grade iron ore by mills seeking to boost output while minimising emissions has also favoured imported iron ore over domestic output, which tends be low quality. Lower prices for iron ore during May and June, when July delivery cargoes would have been arranged, may also have contributed to the surge in imports. Coal imports leapt to the highest in 4-1/2 years, increasing 14 percent from June to 29.01 million tonnes in July. The surge can largely be put down to the heatwave afflicting much of the northern hemisphere, with China boosting power generation from thermal plants to cope with the additional demand for air-conditioning. Curbs on domestic output have also encouraged imports, with the latest available data showing production fell 1.4 percent in June to an eight-month low. The preliminary customs data released on Wednesday also doesn’t break down the types of coal being imported, and official details on this have not been released since March. However, it’s likely that in addition to strong demand for thermal coal for power generation, imports of coking coal for steel-making have been rising as well. This is because domestic coking coal output has been dropping, with a 4.7 percent slide reported in June and production for the first six months slipping 3.2 percent from the same period in 2017. The major industrial commodity most exposed to any pullback from the trade dispute with the administration of President Donald Trump is copper, but so far this hasn’t happened. Imports of unwrought copper rose 2.7 percent in July to 452,000 tonnes, while inbound shipments of copper ores and concentrates were up 5.4 percent to 1.845 million tonnes. Given copper’s importance in manufacturing and construction, any sign of weakness in Chinese demand would raise concerns about the impact of the trade dispute. Overall, China’s commodity imports aren’t raising any red flags, even if the strength in coal and iron ore looks to be partly the result of temporary factors. But it’s early days yet in the trade dispute, and it’s likely that imports in the fourth quarter of this year may be more instructive as to any impact.

2018-08-09,"CAIRO, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s oil supplies to Canada will not be impacted by a dispute between the two countries, the kingdom’s energy minister said on Thursday, reassuring customers after Riyadh froze new trade with Canada and ruled out mediation efforts. The world’s largest oil exporter has a “firm and long-standing policy” that petroleum supplies are not influenced by political considerations, Khalid al-Falih said in a statement. “The current diplomatic crisis between Saudi Arabia and Canada will not, in any way, impact Saudi Aramco’s relations with its customers in Canada.” Saudi Arabia, infuriated by Canada’s demand last week that jailed rights activists in the kingdom be released immediately, expelled the Canadian ambassador on Sunday, blocked imports of Canadian grain and ended state-backed educational and medical programmes in Canada. Bilateral trade between Canada and Saudi Arabia is worth nearly $4 billion a year. Canadian exports to Saudi Arabia were about $1.12 billion in 2017, or 0.2 percent of the total value of Canadian exports. Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir ruled out any mediation efforts and called on Ottawa on Wednesday to “fix its big mistake,” saying the kingdom was considering implementing more measures against Canada for interfering in Saudi Arabia’s domestic affairs. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later appeared to extend an olive branch, saying he would keep pressing Saudi Arabia on civil liberties but also saying the Gulf Arab state had made some progress on human rights. “Diplomatic talks continue ... we don’t want to have poor relations with Saudi Arabia. It is a country that has great significance in the world, that is making progress in the area of human rights,” Trudeau said. Saudi Arabia has in recent months detained several women’s rights activists, some of whom had previously campaigned for the right to drive and an end to the kingdom’s male guardianship system, the latest to be swept up in a government crackdown on activists, clerics and journalists. Since rising to power in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has courted Western allies to support his reform plans to modernize and open up the kingdom, offering billions of dollars of arms sales and promising to fight radicalism in the kingdom. Prince Mohammed has launched a campaign of social and economic change, but has not eased the absolute monarchy’s total ban on political activism. He has taken a more aggressive stance toward arch-rival Iran, began a three-year war in Yemen and led a boycott of fellow Gulf Arab state Qatar. In addition to the trade freeze, Riyadh has stopped sending patients to Canadian hospitals and suspended educational exchanges, moving Saudi scholars to other countries.

2018-08-09,"(Repeats Aug. 8 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Table: tmsnrt.rs/2MdHoNg By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 8 (Reuters) - The shift in oil market power away from OPEC towards a bilateral relationship between Saudi Arabia and Russia is the culmination of structural changes in oil production over the last 20 years. These shifts are deeply structural and have little to do with the personality or negotiating skills of individual oil ministers, which arguably attract far too much attention from commentators and journalists. Most of these changes can be traced back for 20 years or more, though some of them have recently accelerated, such as the recent slump in output from Venezuela and Libya. To the extent that production is an important component of market power, the very different fortunes of OPEC countries have significantly redistributed power within the organisation. The result is that the focus of decision-making has shifted from intra-OPEC negotiations to extra-OPEC negotiations with Russia (“Oil market enters post-OPEC era”, Reuters, Aug. 7). INTRA-OPEC COMPETITION OPEC was founded in 1960 to reduce harmful competition over taxes, royalties and oil ownership between its original members as they tried to attract investment from the international oil companies. “The principal aim of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries shall be the coordination and unification of the petroleum policies of Member Countries”, according to OPEC’s founding statute. The five founding members (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Venezuela) accounted for a significant share of the world’s undeveloped oil reserves and were among the fastest-growing producers. OPEC’s initial focus was on creating a united front in negotiations with the international oil companies to secure a greater share of revenues from the sale of oil. The addition of Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (1967), Algeria (1969) and Nigeria (1971) added other major reserve holders and rapidly growing producers to cement OPEC’s negotiating power. OPEC’s practical focus has shifted over time from taxes and royalty rates (1960s) to equity ownership of reserves (1970s), prices (1970s onwards) and production allocations (1980s onwards). The organisation’s market power arguably peaked in 1973, when members accounted for just over half of all oil production worldwide, before sliding to around a quarter in 1985, and partially recovering in the years since then. In the early years, OPEC was dominated by an internal balance of power between Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela, with other countries playing a more peripheral though occasionally disruptive role. In 1970, these three countries were producing roughly the same amount, about 3.8 million barrels per day each (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). By 1973, Saudi Arabia had already pulled significantly ahead (7.7 million bpd) of both Iran (5.9 million bpd) and Venezuela (3.5 million bpd), a gap that has widened in the subsequent decades. OPEC members can be broadly divided into winners and losers since 1973, based on whether they increased output by 2017 (tmsnrt.rs/2MdHoNg). The biggest winners have been Saudi Arabia (+4.3 million bpd), Iraq (+2.5 million bpd), United Arab Emirates (+2.4 million bpd), Angola (+1.5 million bpd) and Qatar (+1.3 million bpd). The biggest losers have been Libya (-1.3 million bpd), Venezuela (-1.3 million bpd) and Iran (-0.9 million bpd) with other members occupying an intermediate position. The winners have mostly benefited from stable government, significant investment, some of it foreign, and technical expertise. The losers have been hit by conflict, sanctions, unrest, corruption and mismanagement. Some countries have bounced back from earlier setbacks, notably Iraq, which experienced severe production losses during the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s as a result of war and sanctions. Some have suffered more recent problems, such as Libya’s descent into tribal conflict, from which they may recover in time. Others have experienced a patchy production history throughout the last few decades, such as Venezuela and Nigeria - which has recently taken a sharp turn for the worse in the case of Venezuela. As a result, Saudi Arabia and to some extent the United Arab Emirates have become much more powerful while Iran and Venezuela have been relegated to a more peripheral status. Moreover, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the only members with significant production flexibility and contributed most of the voluntary output cuts under the December 2016 production agreement. Other members of the organisation generally produce as much as they are technically able because their immediate revenue needs are enormous. To the extent countries such as Nigeria, Libya and Venezuela have cut production, the loss of output has been forced upon them by unrest and mismanagement. EXTRA-OPEC NEGOTIATIONS Between the 1970s and the 1990s, most intense negotiations occurred within OPEC, as members tried to reach a common position among themselves, and only then negotiate with producers outside the organisation. But the shifting balance of production and power has made intra-OPEC negotiations much less important and put much more emphasis on extra-OPEC negotiations, especially with a resurgent Russia. Sanctions and unrest have sidelined Iran, Libya, Venezuela and to some extent Nigeria, largely relegating them to bystanders within OPEC negotiations. Of the remaining OPEC members, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have coordinated their production policies closely with Saudi Arabia for the last two decades. The changing balance of power has left Saudi Arabia as the undisputed leader of OPEC and free to concentrate on negotiations with outside countries, principally Russia. Instead of negotiating production allocations around a conference table at OPEC headquarters in Vienna, which was the focus for decision-making between the 1980s and 2000s, the most important negotiations are now bilateral between Saudi Arabia and Russia. The shift should not come as a surprise to long-term observers of OPEC. The balance of power and the content of negotiations has changed repeatedly in the last six decades. It may not be the last shift. If Iraq’s production continues to climb it will become harder to ignore and the balance of power will shift again. Output in Iran, Venezuela and Libya could eventually recover, or Nigeria could return to growth, also challenging Saudi Arabia’s control. For the time being, however, Saudi Arabia’s leadership is undisputed and the negotiations that matter are with Russia.
