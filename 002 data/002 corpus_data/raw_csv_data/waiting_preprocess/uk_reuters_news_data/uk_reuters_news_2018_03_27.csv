2018-03-27,"(Reuters) - Britain plans this year to introduce a deposit return scheme for single-use drink containers to increase recycling rates and slash the amount of waste littering the land and sea, the government said. In deposit return schemes - which already operate in Denmark, Sweden and Germany - consumers pay a deposit when they buy a drink which they redeem once the container is returned. British consumers get through about 13 billion plastic drink bottles a year but more than three billion are either incinerated, sent to a landfill or left to pollute streets, the countryside and marine environment, the government said. “We can be in no doubt that plastic is wreaking havoc on our marine environment – killing dolphins, choking turtles and degrading our most precious habitats,” environment minister Michael Gove said in a statement. “It is absolutely vital we act now to tackle this threat and curb the millions of plastic bottles a day that go unrecycled,” he said, adding that implementation of the scheme in England would be subject to consultations later this year. The consultations will focus on the details of how the scheme will work along with other measures to increase recycling rates. A possible alternative to the deposit return scheme is cash rewards for returning drink containers, the government said. This is often executed by a network of ‘reverse vending machines’ through which a plastic or glass bottle can be inserted into one and the machine returns money. Britain has managed to slash the use of plastic bags since 2015 by charging 5 pence for each bag.

2018-03-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices settled slightly lower on Tuesday, only to fall in post-settlement electronic trading as stocks slumped and industry group data showed a surprising increase in crude inventories.  Brent crude futures touched $71 a barrel before retreating, and settled down 1 cent at $70.11 a barrel in what traders characterized as profit-taking following several days of gains. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell 30 cents to settle at $65.25 a barrel. In post-settlement trading, when volumes are thinner, prices for both benchmarks slipped in tandem with equities markets, and then dropped again after industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a larger-than-expected rise in U.S. oil inventories.  At one point, WTI fell more than $1. It traded at $64.69 a barrel, down 86 cents, as of 4:42 p.m. EDT (2042 GMT). Crude inventories rose by 5.3 million barrels in the week ended March 23 to 430.6 million, API said. U.S. inventories were expected to fall by 287,000 barrels; the U.S. Energy Department releases its figures Wednesday morning.     The dollar rebounded from a five-week low hit earlier in the session as trade tensions eased. A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated commodities more expensive for holders of other currencies. [FRX/] “The dollar index is poking up there and that’s probably weighing a little bit on prices,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. Brent has risen by more than 5 percent this month while WTI is up over 4 percent. They are on track for a third consecutive quarterly gain, which last happened in 2010. While both contracts have been gaining, Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Galena, Illinois said Brent has outperformed WTI. The spread between the two May contracts has widened, he noted, which implies OPEC’s success in trimming supplies.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other producer countries agreed more than a year ago to reduce supply. The deal is due to expire at the end of this year, but Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that OPEC and Russia were working on an agreement to cooperate for another 10 to 20 years, though that does not specifically mean cuts will go on for that long. Still, analysts said the market’s current strength may not last. Barclays Research analysts said they expected the supply deficit of the past few months to give way to a surplus on rising U.S. output.

2018-03-27,"BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (Reuters) - The labor union representing employees of Argentina’s soy crushing plants said it will begin an open-ended wage strike on Tuesday night as negotiations over salaries are complicated by fast-rising consumer prices in the grains producing country. Argentina is the top exporter of soymeal livestock feed used from Europe to Asia to fatten cows and pigs. It is also to No. 1 exporter of soyoil, used for cooking and in the manufacture of biodiesel. Both soymeal and soyoil are made in crushing plants. “The strike starts at 10 p.m. (0100 GMT Wednesday),” said Daniel Yofra, general secretary of the Workers’ Federation of the Industrial Oilseed Complex, the labor organization organizing the work stoppage. “We are taking this measure because negotiations with the business chambers are failing.” The strike will affect the southern part of the Rosario port area, but not the key export hub of ​​San Lorenzo further north, where workers are affiliated with another union. With yearly inflation running above 25 percent, strikes are common in Argentina as workers grapple with management over pay packages that increase purchasing power. Twelve-month inflation was 25.4 percent in February versus 25 percent the month before. Reporting by Maximiliano Rizzi, writing by Hugh Bronstein;

2018-03-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sank in late trading on Tuesday, with faltering technology shares reversing a global stock rally that had swept through Asia and Europe. Trading sessions in Asia and Europe had ended on a high note as trade fears ebbed, while U.S. equities sold off sharply in the afternoon just a day after turning in their best performance since August 2015. Tech shares tumbled partly on concerns about regulation of social media. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.55 percent after solid gains for much of the day. “In the absence of earnings data between last quarter and this, the market has allowed its imagination to get the best of it,” said Steve Chiavarone, portfolio manager at Federated Investors Inc. “What we’ve done is we’ve restored the skepticism that has been the keystone of the wall of worry that the market’s been climbing.” The S&P 500 is down 2.3 percent this year, in price terms, with investors burdened by the prospect of trade conflict undermining growth but also by fear that strong economic growth could spark inflation and harsh action by the Federal Reserve. The S&P 500 spent most of the day above Monday’s closing prices, sometimes barely, but then deteriorated sharply in the afternoon. Once high-flying, technology stocks were the worst-performing sector, leaving a market led by defensive utilities shares. Facebook Inc led technology stocks lower, down 4.9 percent as the scandal over the use of data by political consultants widened after a whistleblower said Canadian company AggregateIQ had developed a program to target Republican voters in the 2016 U.S. election.  Other developments weighed on Alphabet Inc, Nvidia Corp, Tesla Inc and Twitter Inc, and the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence data released on Tuesday was also weaker than expected. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 344.89 points, or 1.43 percent, to 23,857.71, the S&P 500 lost 45.93 points, or 1.73 percent, to 2,612.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 211.74 points, or 2.93 percent, to 7,008.81. The day had started on better footing. Reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist shift is more about gaining leverage in trade talks than isolating the world’s biggest economy with tariff barriers that would stifle global growth. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, Reuters reported, citing a person familiar with the discussions. The Asian trading session left Japan’s Nikkei share index with a 2.7 percent gain for its best day in almost three months. A stronger Chinese currency against the U.S. dollar showed signs of optimism on trade. Emerging market stocks rose 0.3 percent, and copper gained 0.8 percent. During European trading, currencies pivoted, with the yuan snapping back lower. Data showed lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust. Those factors helped the euro lower but pushed exporters’ stocks in the region higher. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.2 percent. The dollar index rose 0.4 percent, with the euro moving lower on a relative basis. The yuan fell 0.2 percent against the greenback while the Japanese yen was flat. Even with U.S. government bond investors facing a record $294 billion of new supply this week, strong buying lifted safe-haven Treasuries, with the 10-year yield hitting its lowest levels in over six weeks as stocks turned negative. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes was down to 2.775 percent, from 2.841 percent late on Monday. Spot gold dropped 0.6 percent to $1,344.82 an ounce, while benchmark Brent oil was last at $69.49 per barrel, down 0.9 percent.

2018-03-27,"* Alunorte is world’s largest alumina refinery * Running at half capacity due to Brazil court order * Idling endangers equipment, forcing partial shutdown * Shutdown to take 2 months, full restart 2-3 months (Recasts with details and timeline of planned shutdown) By Joachim Dagenborg and Brad Haynes OSLO/SAO PAULO, March 27 (Reuters) - The Alunorte refinery in northern Brazil, owned by Norway’s Norsk Hydro ASA, will start shutting down half of its alumina capacity in the next two weeks to preserve equipment, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The world’s largest alumina refinery, situated in Brazil’s Amazon region, was forced to halve its output under a judicial order last month after allegations of a toxic leak, pushing up global prices in an already tight market. The process of idling equipment has built up scales and sediment threatening the plant’s long-term capacity. The company will be forced to completely close three of seven alumina lines if the judicial order is not lifted, the sources said on condition of anonymity. The plant could completely shut down the lines within about two months. A cold restart would then take two to three months, the sources said, warning that planning for the unusual procedure involved a high degree of uncertainty. The lost output from Alunorte had already pushed up alumina prices after the company declared force majeure. The plant made 6.4 million tonnes of alumina last year, equivalent to about 10 percent of global production outside of China. Analysts said the possibility of a protracted outage is only now dawning on the tight market for alumina. The mineral reacts with the atmosphere, leading producers to keep minimal stocks. “Alunorte is a big deal,” said Sydney-based UBS analyst Dan Morgan. “I would expect as this outage continues you would see anxiety on the part of consumer. While it’s out, you’ll see alumina above $400 (per tonne).” Alumina prices jumped around 13 percent last week to $438 per tonne, the most expensive since November, according to MB pricing. AL-BRINFIDX-MB Hydro spokesman Halvor Molland said the company was doing everything it could to avoid completely turning off lines at Alunorte, without confirming details of a potential shutdown. “Right now we rotate the production between the seven production lines at the factory to keep them all warm. But this is not a lasting solution. We can’t keep doing it like this much longer,” he said. “It’s complicated and very time consuming to shut these production lines down completely and then restart them again. That is something we are really trying to avoid.” Hydro disputes accusations from Brazilian authorities regarding the contamination of water supplies in the area surrounding the plant following heavy rainfall in February. Hydro has said the integrity at the plant remains intact, with no indications that there were ever any emissions from its bauxite depositories. It has said some unregulated spills, including of untreated rainwater from the roof of a coal storage shed, have occurred, which were “completely unacceptable,” Hydro Chief Executive Svein Richard Brandtzaeg said on March 19. On Monday, Hydro received a counterproposal for a settlement with public prosecutors in Brazil. Still, Hydro said it had to be told what it needed to do to resume full operations. Late on Monday, the company said it would release on April 9 conclusions from its internal review and a review it ordered from environmental consultancy SGW Services.

2018-03-27,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW faces a U.S. lawsuit filed on Tuesday that alleges emissions cheating on diesel vehicles including its X5 and 330d models. “BMW’s representations were misleading for failure to disclose its emissions manipulations,” said the lawsuit, which was filed in U.S. district court in New Jersey.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of BMW drivers by Steve Berman of the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, and James Cecchi of the law firm Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Olstein, Brody & Agnello, the filings show.  BMW’s X5 model, built between 2009 and 2013, and the BMW 330d model, which was sold between 2009-2011, emit levels of nitrogen oxide “many times higher than their gasoline counterparts,” the suit alleges. “The vehicles’ promised power, fuel economy, and efficiency are obtained only by turning off or turning down emission controls when the software in these vehicles senses that they are not in an emissions testing environment,” the lawsuit said. A spokesman for BMW in a statement said the company was thoroughly studying the lawsuit to understand what is being alleged. “As a matter of principle, BMW Group vehicles are not manipulated and comply with all respective legal requirements,” the spokesman said. Software management programs to manage emissions are not illegal unless they are designed specifically to evade pollution tests, or unless a carmaker fails to disclose their existence. Shares in BMW reduced gains sharply earlier on Tuesday with traders pointing to a Bloomberg report saying the German carmaker was being sued for installing “defeat devices” in U.S. diesel cars.

2018-03-27,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and Russia are working on a historic long-term pact that could extend controls over world crude supplies by major exporters for many years. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering a deal to greatly extend a short-term alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after a crash in crude prices.   “We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10 to 20 year agreement,” the crown prince told Reuters in an interview in New York late on Monday.  “We have agreement on the big picture, but not yet on the detail.”  Russia, not a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has worked alongside the 14-member group during previous oil gluts, but a 10 to 20 year deal between the two would be unprecedented.  Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia recruited Russia and other non-OPEC countries to help drain oversupply when oil prices collapsed to below $30 a barrel in 2016 from over $100 in 2014. Crude has since recovered to $70 but fast-rising output from U.S. shale producers has capped prices. “This is all about whether the arrangement is a short-term expedient to deal with this particular crisis in the oil market, or whether it reflects a realignment in world oil,” said oil historian Daniel Yergin, vice chairman at consultancy IHS Markit.  “OPEC countries want to find a way to institutionalize this relationship rather than to have it be a one-shot deal.”  Robert McNally at consultancy Rapidan Energy Group said Riyadh wanted help in breaking the boom-bust cycles that characterize oil markets by capping crude on the upside as well as by helping lift low oil prices. “History shows that without a long-term, powerful, competent coherent, disciplined swing producer in the oil markets ... you get space-mountain oil prices. Wild volatility of the sort we have seen in the past 10 to 15 years and that Saudi Arabia and Russia do not want to see again,” McNally said. He said that would require Russia to join Saudi in building spare production capacity to use when prices rise too much.  A long-term pact between Moscow and Riyadh would effectively co-opt Russia to the Saudi-led OPEC cartel while strengthening Russia’s hand in the Middle East where the United States has long been the dominant super-power.   News of the potential oil alliance came at a time when the two have been working to cement an economic relationship despite being at odds over the conflict in Syria, where they back opposing sides.  Riyadh supports rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s army, while Russian and Iranian forces have backed Assad – meaning that Russia effectively sides with Iran, Riyadh’s regional arch-foe. A meeting between the Saudi crown prince and Russian president Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of a G20 meeting in China in September 2016 was instrumental in bringing Russia on board to support OPEC, non-OPEC oil curbs. Last October, Saudi King Salman became the first Saudi monarch to visit Russia, providing investment and political support for a Russian economy battered by Western sanctions. “It is a very important strategic development,” Helima Croft at RBC Capital Markets said of a potential 10 to 20 year Saudi-Russia oil collaboration. “First, the Crown Prince is making the statement, not the oil minister, one more clear sign that he (like Putin) is the final word on his country’s oil policy.  “Second it is one more sign of the major reversal in Saudi-Russia relations. Saudi was a staunch cold war ally of the U.S. Now this Russia-Saudi alliance appears to be thicker than oil and seems to be driven by the personal affinity between Putin and MBS,” said Croft.   The crown prince predicted that world oil demand would not peak until 2040, despite advances in renewable energy technologies and the electric vehicle. In an attempt to end Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil, he is leading a push to diversify the Saudi economy away from oil and gas by 2030.   Riyadh plans to raise funds through the flotation of a 5 percent stake in state Saudi oil company Aramco. Time is running out for an initial public offering this year but the crown prince said the IPO could still take place at the end of 2018 or in early 2019, depending on financial market conditions. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said last week that documentation was ready but that a venue for the IPO had not yet been decided. The New York stock exchange is still in the running for the IPO, alongside London and Hong Kong, but Falih said there was a risk of a “frivolous” legal action if Aramco were listed in the United States.

2018-03-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - A lawmaker in President Emmanuel Macron’s party is asking for a parliamentary investigation into the legality of French weapons sales to a Saudi-led coalition over concerns the arms are being used to kill civilians in Yemen. Pressure has been mounting on Macron to scale back military support for Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which are  leading the coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group that controls most of northern Yemen and the capital Sanaa. The conflict has killed more than 10,000 people and displaced more than three million. “I am submitting a request for a commission of inquiry knowing that France ratified the 2014 Arms Trade Treaty,” Sebastien Nadot, a lawmaker elected last year as part of hundreds of new parliamentarians that form Macron’s majority, told Reuters on Tuesday. “On the question of French weapons being used against civilian populations in Yemen, I want to know if France is respecting its international commitments.” It remains to be seen whether Nadot will get the necessary backing from other lawmakers to set up the inquiry committee.  The move by Nadot is surprising in that Macron has faced little opposition in parliament since coming to power last year and commands an overwhelming majority, with few of his lawmakers willing to question the executive’s decisions. Unlike many of its allies, French export licensing procedures have no parliamentary checks or balances. They are approved through a committee headed by the prime minister that includes the foreign, defence and economy ministries. Details of licences are not public and, once approved, are rarely reviewed. “Parliament must be able to control whether these weapons are sold in respect of international law,” Nadot said. “If we are just a transmission belt, and not (a) body of control and evaluation, then abstention (in elections) has a bright future ahead of it.” Seventy-five percent of French people want Macron to suspend arms exports to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a YouGov poll showed on Monday. Several rights groups have warned of possible legal action if the government does not halt its sales. France is the world’s third biggest arms exporter and counts the two countries among its biggest purchasers. While some European countries, notably Germany, have curtailed ties with the Saudi-led military coalition, France, Britain and the United States have not followed suit.

2018-03-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Lawyers for more than 50,000 British car owners kicked off a lawsuit against Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in London’s High Court on Tuesday in a battle for compensation over a diesel emissions scandal that has engulfed Europe’s largest carmaker since 2015. The three-day hearing will determine whether the claims can be managed collectively under a Group Litigation Order (GLO) and will set a deadline for claimants to sign up to what lawyers say could become the largest group action in British legal history. Volkswagen has said about 11 million cars worldwide - and 1.2 million in the UK - were fitted with software that cheated diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution. VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. It offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The company has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis of its 78-year history, dubbed “dieselgate”. Law firm Slater and Gordon, which says it represents more than 40,000 claimants in Britain, alleges VW deceived people into buying cars that breached emissions regulations by installing “defeat devices”, engine management software designed to mask pollution levels.  The German company dismissed the allegations and said it intended to defend itself robustly. It said it had broken no English laws, that British drivers had suffered no loss and that the legal proceedings were premature and unfounded. “We ... are confident of a successful outcome,” the firm said in a statement. It said it had not been established that the software was an illegal defeat device and emphasised that the U.S. situation was “materially different”.  “The vehicles are different, the regulatory environment is different and the technical measures are different. The affected vehicles in the UK do not cause more pollution on the road than expected,” it said. Volkswagen has offered European drivers a software update removing a mode that operated when cars were experiencing test conditions.  Slater and Gordon, one of at least three law firms acting for affected VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda drivers in England and Wales, alleged that the software fix had led to mechanical problems. It said it had surveyed more than 11,600 affected car owners who had agreed to the VW fix. Some reported that cars lost power at high speed, had poorer fuel efficiency and engine power and that cars had “juddered”, it said. VW said the survey’s methodology had not been explained and that it was in the financial interest of respondents to allege they had suffered damage. “We have implemented the technical measures in over 840,000 vehicles in the UK and in over 6.4 million vehicles across Europe and the overwhelming majority of customers with these vehicles are satisfied,” it said. Lawyers say that if the case was not settled, it might not come to trial before 2020.

Part of an effort to localize 50 percent of its military industry by 2030, Ahmed Al Khateeb of Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) said Saudi Arabia is talking with major U.S. companies about their presence in the kingdom. “We have been in dialogue with  them to expand their business in Saudi Arabia.

2018-03-27,"(Repeats to add graphic. No changes to text) BRUSSELS, March 27 (Reuters) - EU lawyers gave cautious support this week to a proposal by the bloc’s executive to extend its energy market rules to regulate offshore pipelines including Russia’s planned 9.5-billion euro gas line to Germany. The European Commission was within its rights to draft the amendment, according to the opinion seen by Reuters that contradicts critics who say regulators are overreaching. It adds to a series of conflicting opinions from EU legislators on whether the bloc should have a say over the Nord Stream 2 project to pump Russian gas under the Baltic Sea to Germany, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine. The project is backed by Germany, which approved its construction on Tuesday, and five northern European firms, who seek access to cheap Russian gas to offset declining Dutch production. Eastern European countries fear the pipeline will increase dependence on Moscow and undercut EU support for Kiev by depriving it of transit fees. The document from the legal service of the Council of the European Union, the body where EU ministers meet, follows a separate opinion this month that rejected the Commission’s proposal, saying it may breach U.N. law regulating the seas. The new opinion, dated March 26, said the Commission “has the legal basis to make the proposal” but took issue with some elements of the draft law, now being reviewed by EU member states and the European Parliament. EU lawyers criticised regulators for not carrying out an impact assessment, saying it was up to member states to decide whether it “is appropriate and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives pursued.” Provisions for exemptions from the new rules for existing offshore pipelines from third countries are not justified or limited in time, it said. The Commission last year proposed the changes to its gas directive to make all import pipelines subject to rules it says aim to protect the bloc’s security of supply. The Nord Stream 2 project, fully owned by Russia’s gas export monopoly Gazprom, is far from complying with those rules including that pipelines not be directly owned by gas suppliers and capacity be made available to third parties. Because the pipeline would begin outside of the bloc’s jurisdiction, EU officials say rules may need to be negotiated with Moscow via an intergovernmental agreement (IGAs). The legal opinion also says that if the rule change takes effect, member states would have to ensure all existing IGAs comply and the EU would gain powers to conclude such agreements with third countries.

2018-03-27,"MEXICO CITY, March 27 (Reuters) - Mexico on Tuesday kicked off its final energy auction before the July presidential election, tendering 35 shallow-water oil and gas blocks in a test of foreign producers’ interest in investing  amid uncertainty over energy reforms. The first blocks awarded went to Spain’s Repsol and Britain’s Premier Oil in the Burgos basin in the violent state of Tamaulipas, with few other companies bidding. Blocks in two other basins will be awarded later in the day. Leftist frontrunner Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador says that if he wins the July 1 vote he will review more than 90 contracts signed since Mexico passed legislation in 2013 ending the 75-year monopoly of state energy firm Pemex. Lopez Obrador said this month that he will ask President Enrique Pena Nieto to cancel two auctions planned for the second half of the year, if he wins in July. Mexico is competing for investment with Brazil, which is also holding an auction this week, with another scheduled in June. Brazil holds its own election in October, with the most likely leftist contender in the presidential race, Ciro Ferreira Gomes, warning he would expropriate energy assets bought by investors if he wins. In Thursday’s auction, Mexico offered 35 areas in the Burgos, Tampico-Misantla-Veracruz and Southeast basins. Fourteen companies including BP, Chevron, Eni, India’s ONGC Videsh, Pemex, Petronas, Repsol, Shell and Total qualified to bid as individual bidders, while 22 consortia have also qualified to bid.

2018-03-27,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of ProPetro Holding Corp (PUMP.N) fell by as much as 12.9 percent on Tuesday after the U.S. pressure pumper reported a lower than expected quarterly profit on weather-related delays and a higher mix of lower-margin services.  The Midland, Texas, company posted earnings per share of 12 cents in the fourth quarter, below analysts’ expectations of 35 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter revenue of $313.7 million was roughly in line with expectations of $311.7 million. Pressure pumping has been a bright spot in the oilfield services sector, which was hit hard by a brutal three-year downturn in prices that began in 2014. ProPetro’s operations are focused in the Permian Basin, a shale patch in West Texas and New Mexico where there has been strong demand for completion services amid a surge in drilling activity.  ProPetro’s results were affected by inclement weather, a larger mix of less-lucrative vertical completion jobs than previously anticipated, and more time off during the holidays, the company said.  Harsh winter conditions in the northern United States impacted the company’s supply chain, Chief Executive Dale Redman told analysts on a conference call. He cited rail, which is used to haul in sand from Wisconsin and Minnesota for hydraulic fracturing. He said customers performed more vertical well completions because of lease obligations.  Oilfield services competitor Halliburton Co (HAL.N) last month warned investors that its first-quarter results also would be hurt by rail delays affecting frac sand deliveries. ProPetro plans to add two new fracking fleets in the second and third quarters of 2018, bringing its total to 20. The company also plans to enhance its legacy fleet by an incremental 35,000 hydraulic horsepower this year.  Although demand for fracking and other well-completion services has climbed, more announcements of new builds have sparked concerns among investors and analysts that the market may become oversupplied.  “While the domestic pressure pumping sector remains under supplied (and Permian new builds warranted), we believe this announcement could be viewed negatively by a market still fearful of frac over building in NAM (North America),” James West, senior managing director and partner at investment bank Evercore ISI, wrote in a note following the earnings release, referring to ProPetro’s plans to add two fleets.  ProPetro shares were down 7 percent at $15.78 in late morning, off an earlier low at $14.78.

2018-03-27,"PARIS (Reuters) - French state-owned utility EDF (EDF.PA) plans to invest eight billion euros (7 billion pounds) between 2018 and 2035 to become a European market leader in electricity storage. EDF, which already operates pumped storage hydropower plants and some utility-scale power storage batteries, said on Tuesday it aimed to become a French and European market leader, offering  storage batteries for customers in the retail power sector. “With storage we can smooth out the intermittence of renewable energy and guarantee the balancing of power grids,” EDF chief executive Jean-Bernard Levy told reporters. Power storage usage by European utilities is growing as the intermittent supply from renewable energies like solar and wind forces them to have more power reserves on standby. EDF’s investment in power storage will focus on boosting the resilience of power grids, on individual storage for retail customers with solar panels, and on off-grid solar plus storage systems in Africa, notably in Ghana and Ivory Coast.  The company will finance the plan with a mix of equity and debt but Levy did not give a breakdown.  EDF plans to develop 10 gigawatts of additional storage capacity worldwide by 2035 - in addition to the 5 GW of pumped storage hydropower it already operates.  The company will develop some 6 GW in industrial-scale storage systems, notably in pumped storage and batteries, and 4 GW of individual batteries for retail customers, companies and municipal customers.  Pumped storage stations pump up water while power prices are low and release it when power prices are high, but their profitability is currently low because of the relatively small difference between peak and trough prices.  Levy said that EDF Energy’s 49 megawatt West Burton, Nottinghamshire, battery storage project for Britain’s National Grid (NG.L) - which will be one of Europe’s largest battery storage projects - is set to launch before the summer.  In the next 12 months, EDF plans to launch two more battery projects aimed at stabilising grids. Working with local partners, EDF also aims to develop a portfolio of 1.2 million off-grid customers in Africa by 2035, equipping them with solar panels and individual battery systems. Asked for a detailed breakdown on how and when EDF will spread the planned eight billion euro investment over the next 17 years, Levy said there was not yet a detailed plan. He said EDF would double its research and development into power storage to 70 million euros for the 2018-2020 period.  In the coming two years, EDF’s New Business division also plans to invest some 15 million euros - about a third of its investments - in projects and startups linked to power storage and flexibility.  EDF’s storage plan is the second major investment project in its energy transition towards renewables.  In December, EDF said it would invest about 25 billion euros to build 30 gigawatt (GW) of solar capacity from 2020 to 2035, mainly funded by equity partners, project financing and loans.

2018-03-27,"* European markets climb, S&P positive * Reports China and U.S. quietly working to avoid trade war * Euro reverses gain on lending data, policymaker comment (Updates to U.S. equity market open; changes dateline, previous LONDON) By Trevor Hunnicutt NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - Stock markets mostly gained on Tuesday as reports that the United States and China were negotiating to avert a trade war whetted investors’ appetite for riskier assets. In morning trading, U.S. stock indexes were working to sustain momentum one day after each of the major indexes turned their best day of performance since August 2015. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 73.7 points, or 0.3 percent, to 24,276.3, the S&P 500 gained 1.62 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,660.17 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.79 points, or 0.16 percent, to 7,208.75. Major equity markets outside the United States turned in strong performances, with Japan’s Nikkei share index rising 2.7 percent for its best day in almost three months while Europe’s Stoxx 600 recorded a 1.07 percent gain. Emerging market stocks rose 0.58 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.41 percent. “We expect yesterday’s rally to extend itself as fading fears over a full-blown trade war is begging to restore confidence,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at First Standard Financial in New York. Reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist shift is more about gaining leverage in trade talks than isolating the world’s biggest economy with tariff barriers that would stifle global growth. This helped offset the U.S. Conference Board’s consumer confidence data, which was weaker than expected, and news that the United States and many of its allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. Reflecting the optimistic mood around trade, some industrial metals gained with copper rising 0.50 percent to $6,635.00 a tonne. Risk-taking did little to restrain demand for safe-haven Treasury bonds. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.817 percent compared with 2.841 percent late on Monday. The Treasury market faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. In currency markets the early reaction overnight was to offload both the yen and the dollar, helping the euro to an early gain. But the single European currency later went into reverse after data showed lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, rose 0.47 percent, while the euro was down 0.41 percent to $1.2391. In commodities, benchmark Brent crude oil was last at $69.56, up 0.06 percent on the day. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,342.36 an ounce. Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt

2018-03-27,"FRANKFURT, March 27 (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW faces a class-action lawsuit filed in a New Jersey court on Tuesday for alleged emissions cheating on diesel vehicles including its X5 and 330d models. “BMW’s representations were misleading for failure to disclose its emissions manipulations,” the suit, which was filed in the United States District Court of New Jersey, said. The suit was filed by law firms Steve W Berman from Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP, and James E. Cecchi from Carella, Byrne, Cecchi, Olstein, Brody & Agnello, the filings show. BMW’s X5 model built between 2009 and 2013, and the BMW330d model, which was sold between 2009-2011, emit levels of nitrogen oxide “many times higher than their gasoline counterparts” the suit alleges. “The vehicles’ promised power, fuel economy, and efficiency are obtained only by turning off or turning down emission controls when the software in these vehicles senses that they are not in an emissions testing environment,” the suit said. BMW was not immediately available for comment but has said in the past it did not use illegal defeat devices. Software management programmes to manage emissions are not illegal unless they are designed specifically to evade pollution tests, or unless a carmaker fails to disclose their existence. Shares in BMW reduced gains sharply earlier on Tuesday with traders pointing to a Bloomberg report saying the German carmaker was being sued for installing “defeat devices” in U.S. diesel cars.

2018-03-27,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil traders Vitol and Glencore are in talks to financially back Nigerian firms racing to buy assets owned by Brazil’s Petrobras (PETR4.SA) valued at up to $2 billion (1.4 billion pounds), several sources familiar with the matter said.  Cash is being lined up for purchases of stakes in two major oilfields in the west African country, according to the banking and industry sources.    The potential consortiums including Glencore and Vitol offer the local bidders financial backing that would otherwise be hard to secure directly through international banks.  For the traders, a deal would guarantee access to high-quality crude oil for many years. They would then be able to syndicate out the debt to banks. Signing up to long-term financing deals to increase volumes and gain exclusive access is one of the traders’ strategies to compensate for increasingly thin profit margins. Last November, state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), known as Petrobras, launched the sale of 100 percent of Petrobras Oil & Gas BV, or Petrobras Africa, as part of the heavily-indebted company’s plan to offload $21 billion in assets through 2018 as it also faces a massive corruption scandal. Petrobras holds half the shares in the company while 40 percent are held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and 10 percent by Helios Investment Partners. Scotiabank is running the process with Evercore, according to the sale launch document. The venture has stakes in two offshore blocks that contain two producing fields, the major Agbami field in OML 127, operated by a local Chevron affiliate (CVX.N) and the Akpo field in OML 130 operated by Total SA (TOTF.PA). The assets could fetch as much as $2 billion, according to bankers involved in the process. Trading and mining giant Glencore was looking to back Nigerian producer Seplat in bidding for the assets.  The world’s top oil trader Vitol is examining backing several bidders in the process, according to the sources.  Swiss-based commodities trader Mercuria was involved in the initial bidding round but was unlikely to continue in the process, sources said.  Oil major BP’s (BP.L) trading division had also considered participating in a possible consortium, but dropped out. Glencore, Vitol, Mercuria and BP declined to comment. A spokesman for Seplat did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The result of the auction is expected to be announced in early May but some participants said the assets might not be sold in one package. Industry sources in Nigeria said the winner of the Petrobras blocks would likely be a local company due in part to government pressure.  While the government already has local content laws, a sale so close to the presidential elections in early 2019 has raised pressure to secure high-profile local involvement in the upstream sector. This has made it more difficult, the sources said, for international companies to bid for the assets without a local partner.  The Akpo field produces nearly 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate and Total is also due to start production at the Egina development in OML 130 later this year.   The Agbami oilfield is the main prize, however, producing about 240,000 bpd of light, sweet crude. Petrobras holds a 12.5 percent stake in the field, Statoil has 20.2 percent and Chevron holds a 67.3 percent stake.  The operator is a Chevron affiliate called Star Deep Water Petroleum Ltd. Famfa Oil is one of the concessionaires of Star Deep Water Petroleum and was also looking to increase its stake in the oilfield. Famfa did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Famfa Oil was awarded the rights to the exploration block that holds Agbami in the 1990s. Its owner, Folorunso Alakija, is one of Africa’s richest women.

2018-03-27,"(Reuters) - Pennsylvania environmental regulators on Monday issued another notice of violation to Energy Transfer Partners LP’s Sunoco Mariner East 2 natural gas liquids pipeline for releasing drilling fluids into a wetland. The company told the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) it released less than one gallon (4 liters) of drilling fluids - usually a mix of clay and water - into a wetland in Shirley Township in Huntingdon County located about 80 miles (129 kilometers) west of Harrisburg, the state capital. The spill was associated with a horizontal drill. The DEP said it must approve before ETP can resume drilling at the site.  This is the latest in a long series of spills by the $2.5 billion project that have slowed its construction. Since May 2017, the DEP said the project had 108 inadvertent releases, or spills, prompting the environmental regulator to issue 46 notices of violation. Officials at ETP were not immediately available for comment. It was ETP’s second release into this wetland after spilling between 5,000-10,000 gallons in the area in October. The DEP issued a notice of violation for that earlier spill. The latest release comes after Pennsylvania utility regulators on March 7 suspended operations of ETP’s Sunoco Mariner East 1 liquids pipeline after sinkholes were discovered near the project. The shutdown of Mariner 1 and delays for Mariner 2 have forced shippers, including Range Resources Corp, to find another home for their liquids and is likely causing more ethane to be rejected into the region’s natural gas pipelines, according to analysts. Mariner 1 transports up to 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) of propane and ethane from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in western Pennsylvania to customers in the state and elsewhere, including ETP’s Marcus Hook industrial complex near Philadelphia. The sinkholes were near the area where construction is under way for Mariner 2. The order stopping flows on Mariner 1 did not affect work on Mariner 2. Construction of Mariner 2, which started in early 2017, was originally expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2017 but has been delayed by repeated work stoppages by Pennsylvania regulators, among other things. ETP has said it expects to complete Mariner 2 by the end of the second quarter. Once complete, Mariner 2 will expand the total capacity of the Mariner East project to 345,000 bpd and open the pipe to suppliers in Ohio and West Virginia.

2018-03-27,"(Adds background) By Richard Mably and Yara Bayoumy NEW YORK, March 27 (Reuters) - OPEC and Russia are working on a long-term deal to cooperate on oil supply curbs that could extend controls over world oil supplies by major exporters for many years to come. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told Reuters that Riyadh and Moscow were considering extending an alliance on oil curbs that began in January 2017 after oil prices crashed. “We are working to shift from a year-to-year agreement to a 10-20 year agreement,” the crown prince told Reuters in interview in New York. “We have agreement on the big picture, but not yet on the detail.” Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia recruited Russia and other producers to collaborate with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries when oil prices collapsed from over $100 a barrel in 2014 to below $30 in 2016. Crude has recovered to $70 but fast-rising output from U.S. shale producers has capped prices. Russia, never a member of OPEC, has worked alongside OPEC during previous oil gluts, dating back to 1990, but a 10-20 year deal between the two would be unprecedented. The crown prince said a flotation of 5 percent of state Saudi oil company Aramco could take place at the end of 2018 or early 2019, depending on market conditions.

2018-03-27,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2DYHekG By John Kemp LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Hedge funds had turned more bullish on the outlook for petroleum prices, even before the decision to replace the U.S. president’s national security adviser with an anti-Iran hawk was announced on Thursday. Hedge funds and other money managers increased their net long position in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices by 95 million barrels in the week to March 20. The combined increase was the largest since the end of October and reversed a draw of 73 million barrels over the two previous weeks, according to records published by regulators and exchanges. Fund managers now hold a net long position of 1.311 billion barrels across Brent, NYMEX and ICE WTI, U.S. gasoline, U.S. heating oil and European gasoil (tmsnrt.rs/2DYHekG). The combined net long position is 170 million barrels below the record 1.484 billion barrels set on Jan. 23 but more than four times higher than the recent low of 310 million set at the end of June 2017. Hedge fund positioning remains extremely lopsided, with almost all funds expecting prices to rise further rather than fall. Portfolio managers hold 11.7 long positions for every short one, the second-highest ratio on record after 11.9 on Jan. 30. Almost no one seems willing to bet against the trend. Short positions across the complex have declined to just 122 million barrels, the lowest level since May 2014. In some parts of the complex, positioning has become even more extreme. In U.S. gasoline, for example, long positions (94 million barrels) outnumber short ones (4 million) by a ratio of almost 22:1. The current positioning across the complex is a classic example of a market that has become “locked” with all traders trying to position themselves the same way. Locking often precedes a sharp reduction in liquidity, an increase in volatility and an eventual reversal in the price trend (“Why stock markets crash: critical events in complex financial systems”, Sornette, 2003). Extreme one-way positioning could herald a shift in oil prices into a new, higher trading range, such as happened in the fourth quarter of 2017. But with so few speculative short positions remaining to be covered, there may be few buyers around if and when the holders of long positions decide to realise some of their profits and try to sell them.

SOMO received offers from Exxon Mobil, Total , Japan’s Sumitomo and China’s Unipec, to take part in marketing Iraqi crude, he said. “We are studying building crude storages in South Korea and also Japan and we’re also studying options to have partnership between SOMO and companies which are ready to help with building the storages,” Yasiri said. Iraq plans to stop loading crude from its southern port of Basra for three to four days in early April due to maintenance, he said. During the halt of loading operations at Basra port, Iraq will divert production to storage depots in south. Once the maintenance work is done, it will pump at maximum capacity to make up the shortfall. OPEC’s second-largest producer, after Saudi Arabia, Iraq exports most of its crude from the Basra region, on the Gulf. The Basra port loading capacity is estimated at around 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd). Iraq has 10 million barrels in oil storage capacity in the southern region, Yasiri said. Iraq’s crude output should not exceed 4.360 million barrels per day in compliance with a deal between oil exporting nations to curb supply in order to lift prices, he also said. March oil exports won’t exceed 3.426 million bpd, he said. Oil exports from the northern Kirkuk fields through Turkey, halted since October, could resume “at any moment” as talks with the Kurdistan Regional Government which controls the pipeline are ongoing, he said. The main issue hindering the resumption of exports to Turkey is the Kurdistan region’s demand that the central government in Baghdad pays debt related to the development of the Kurdish oil industry infrastructure, he said. In parallel, the Iraqi government plans to build within six months a pipeline to Turkey that runs in territory under its control, he said, adding that 96 offers to construct the facility had been received. Iraq could start “in one to two weeks” sending crude by truck from Kirkuk to Iran’s Kermanshah refinery, starting at a daily average rate of 30,000 bpd, he said. The swap deal agreed at the end of 2017 between Tehran and Baghdad provides for Iran to export from its Kharg terminal, on the Gulf, on SOMO’s behalf, the same amount of crude it receives from Kirkuk.

2018-03-27,"LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Lawyers for more than 50,000 British car owners kicked off a lawsuit against Volkswagen in London’s High Court on Tuesday in a battle for compensation over a diesel emissions scandal that has engulfed Europe’s largest carmaker since 2015. The three-day hearing will determine whether the claims can be managed collectively under a Group Litigation Order (GLO) and will set a deadline for claimants to sign up to what lawyers say could become the largest group action in British legal history. Volkswagen has said that about 11 million cars worldwide - and 1.2 million in the UK - were fitted with software that cheated diesel emissions tests designed to limit noxious car fumes and carbon dioxide (CO2) pollution. VW agreed to pay up to $25 billion in the United States to settle claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers and offered to buy back 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. But it has not reached a similar deal in Europe, where it faces billions of euros in claims from investors and customers in the worst business crisis of its 78-year history, dubbed “dieselgate”. British law firm Slater and Gordon, which represents more than 40,000 claimants in Britain, alleges that VW deceived people into buying cars that breached emissions regulations by installing “defeat devices”, illegal engine management software designed to mask true pollution levels. “The lawyers will argue that VW profited by lying about the compliance of their cars and betrayed the trust of consumers who thought they were purchasing a car that met emissions standards and which was fit to be sold to UK customers when this was not the case,” the firm said in a statement. The German company has offered to fix UK vehicles, and has said it broke no British laws and that drivers suffered no loss. German and British VW officials were not immediately available for further comment. Slater and Gordon said it had surveyed more than 11,600 affected car owners who had agreed to the VW fix, which amounts to a software update of the engine management system. Over 50 percent of respondents regretted having it carried out, the lawyers said. It said more than one in ten car owners told its survey that vehicles lost power at high speed, exposing them to danger after VW fixed their car. Drivers also reported poorer fuel efficiency and engine power and car juddering, it said. “VW’s only response has been to offer consumers in the UK a fix that our clients are telling us doesn’t work,” said Gareth Pope, a lawyer at Slater and Gordon. Slater and Gordon is one of at least three law firms hoping to be granted the GLO. Lawyers have said that they expect the suit to come to trial next year if it is not settled. If the GLO is granted, all past and present owners of affected VW, Audi, SEAT and Skoda cars can join the claim, regardless of whether they have had their cars fixed by VW.

2018-03-27,"* European markets climb, S&P futures extend gains * Reports China and U.S. quietly working to avoid trade war * Euro reverses gain on lending data, policymaker comment (Adds emerging market milestones, Robeco comments at end) By Tom Pfeiffer LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Stock markets jumped on Tuesday as reports that the United States and China were negotiating to avert a trade war whetted investors’ appetite for riskier assets. Japan’s Nikkei share index rose 2.7 percent for its best day in almost three months while a 1.4 percent gain by Europe’s Stoxx 600 put it on track for its best daily performance in seven weeks. The reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred optimism that U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist shift is more about gaining leverage in trade talks than isolating the world’s biggest economy with tariff barriers that would stifle global growth. This helped offset news that the United States and many of its allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. U.S. stocks are still 7 percent below their January peaks and some investors are not rushing to recalculate risks around Trump’s America First trade agenda. “He can flip-flop quite a lot,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam. “The big problem is, how long will it take before new tweets and headlines that will change the sentiment again?” Daalder said he was underweight emerging market equities and the Nikkei and overweight other developed markets “based on the expectation that there will be more trade uncertainty”. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Monday to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes inched up to 2.848 percent, but remained short of last week’s top at 2.90 percent. In currency markets the early reaction was to offload both the yen and the dollar, helping the euro to an early gain. But the single currency later went into reverse after data showed lending to euro zone companies slowed last month, and European Central Bank Governing Council member Erkki Liikanen said underlying euro zone inflation may remain lower than expected even if growth is robust. The dollar, measured against a basket of currencies, used the euro’s weakness to rally 0.4 percent to 89.424, bouncing off a five-week low hit on Monday. The improved mood on trade earlier pushed China’s yuan to a two-1/2 year high and gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing. In oil markets, Brent crude added 31 cents to $70.43 a barrel. Daalder said there had been no clear flight to quality since February’s burst of equity market volatility, with scarce volatility in currencies and little movement in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. “It seems to be that the U.S. has lost some of its shine as the safe market to which people turn when things get rough,” said Daalder. “It’s partly the uncertainty in the U.S. itself which is playing a role.” Additional reporting by Tommy Wilkes

2018-03-27,"(Repeats with no changes in text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Shanghai crude futures first day's trading: reut.rs/2I32GHF By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 27 (Reuters) - China’s new crude oil futures contract enjoyed a successful first day of trading in Shanghai, most likely exceeding the wildest hopes of its backers, but much of the hard work of building a viable benchmark still has to be done. The new contract, launched on Monday by the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), attracted interest from Western oil traders as well as domestic investors. Some 20 million barrels of oil changed hands on the first day, with the first deal going to global trader Glencore , and other participants included major merchants Trafigura, Freepoint Commodities and Mercuria. At one stage the volume of trades being done on the INE exceeded those in global rivals Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The evident enthusiasm for the new contract would have pleased the INE. It aims to establish a third global benchmark in China, the world’s largest crude buyer with imports averaging just over 9 million barrels per day for the first two months of 2018. On the surface, there is no reason why the INE contract shouldn’t take its place alongside Brent and WTI. It’s a far more useful marker for China - and for the rest of fast-growing Asia as well - given the seven grades of crude accepted for delivery are heavier and more sour than the light grades that make up Brent and WTI. This means the INE contract better reflects the type of crudes that are more typically consumed in China, and in other major regional importers such as India, Japan and South Korea. It’s precisely this advantage that will really need to be honed if the first day’s success is to be carried forward. In effect, the INE contract is a sort of Chinese mirror of the already well-established Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) Oman futures. The DME contract has a similar gravity and sulphur content to the INE equivalent, providing an opportunity to use both as hedges for physical purchases as well as arbitrage plays. This dynamic is likely what will attract and retain international market players to the INE, as it will allow them to profit from any opportunities between the prices for free-on-board cargoes offered by the DME futures, and delivered to China cargoes by the INE. The difficulty for Western investors in the INE is the still-to-be-determined risk of interference by the authorities in Beijing. The latter have a track record of changing rules and regulations for commodity trading if the market isn’t behaving in their desired fashion. Currency risk is also on the agenda, given the INE is settled in yuan and the other major oil contracts are in U.S. dollars. There are other challenges for the INE, with one being that the contract is only traded in Asian hours, closing at 1500 local time, or 0700 GMT. This excludes London and New York traders from getting in on the action in their own time zones, a factor that may hamper liquidity. There is also a risk of different expectations of the various participants, with foreign trading houses, banks and oil companies seeking hedging and arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile the Chinese government and state-owned majors may be seeking market control and the ability to pay for crude in their own currency. Another factor that still has to be worked out will be how much of the volume and open interest is held by professional players, either foreign or Chinese, and how much is down to day traders and other small-scale investors. Several of China’s vibrant commodity contracts are dominated by smaller players, which can exacerbate swings based on sentiment or momentum, without too much based on market fundamentals. But none of these problems are insurmountable, and can be addressed as the contract build ups a history and a reputation. The key will be to keep an eye on volumes and open interest as a measure of the INE’s success.

2018-03-27,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions fell in 2017, largely thanks to the closure of coal-fired power plants, but car-makers and factories still need to do more to cut pollution, government officials said on Tuesday. Overall emissions in Europe’s biggest economy fell 0.5 percent through the year, according to preliminary data released by a federal environment agency. “While energy-related emissions fell significantly, those in transport and the manufacturing industry went up,” the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) said in a statement.  “Therefore, additional measures are necessary to set Germany on a course toward its targets again.” The energy industry, which is undergoing a staged transition to renewable technologies, saw its emissions fall by 4.1 percent, or 13.7 million tonnes, in 2017, UBA said. But transport sector emissions rose by 2.3 percent to 170.6 million tonnes, as car ownership expanded and the booming economy meant more heavy vehicles were on the road.  The buoyant economy also drove up emissions from refineries, steelmaking and chemicals. Germany has already had to abandon a self-imposed target of cutting emissions by 40 percent by the year 2020 from 1990 levels. The current reduction is 27.7 percent with just two years to go. Instead, government is now aiming for a 55 percent cut by 2030 and has promised to bring in a climate law in 2019 that will demand more from lagging sectors. The car industry is also facing the prospect of restrictions on diesel vehicles in cities as it tries to move on from a 2015 scandal in which Volkswagen admitted to cheating U.S. emissions tests. Climate-harming emissions from Europe’s biggest economy totalled 904.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent, compared with 909.4 million a year earlier, said the state body, which reports to the Economy Ministry. The bulk of German emissions in 2017 consisted of CO2, which accounted for 797.3 million tonnes, accounting for a 0.6 percent decline from 801.8 million a year earlier.  Some 107.4 million tonnes of emissions, down from 108 million in 2016, were made up of other noxious gases monitored by the UBA. The German data on Tuesday were estimates only, based on usage and macroeconomic data, and may well change, UBA stressed, adding it will publish more details in May.

2018-03-27,"(Corrects paragraph 7 to clarify May is U.S. deadline, not when Iran deal expires) * Concern that U.S. may bring back sanctions against Iran * Surging U.S. output looms over otherwise bullish market * Shanghai crude continues high launch-day trading volumes By Amanda Cooper LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Oil rose on Tuesday, holding above $70 a barrel for a third day, supported by concerns that tensions in the Middle East could lead to supply disruptions, although with global output rising fast, investors remained cautious. Brent crude futures were up 28 cents on the day at$70.40 a barrel by 0848 GMT, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 19 cents at $65.74 a barrel. The oil price has risen by more than 7 percent so far this month and by     5.3 percent in the first three months of the year, putting it on track for a third consecutive quarterly gain, something the market has not witnessed since late 2010. Geopolitics and expectations of the world’s largest exporters controlling supply have helped push Brent above $70 this year for the second time since late 2014, but analysts said this strength may not persist for long. “The recent rally in oil prices might have taken some by surprise as the underlying fundamental picture does not justify Brent being close to $70/bbl. This view is based on the simple fact that non-OPEC oil supply growth will trump the increase in global oil demand this year,” PVM Oil Associates analyst Tamas Varga said. “The price strength of the last couple of weeks is down to two factors. The first one is a stable OPEC output level which leads to impressive compliance (with an oil supply-cutting deal). The second one is supply-side geopolitical developments in Venezuela, Libya and Iran, the most acute of which is Iran.” The United States has threatened to withdraw from a nuclear deal that Iran signed with six nations in 2015 by a deadline it has set in May, raising the chance that it may impose sanctions on Tehran and hinder oil exports. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, has curtailed production since January 2017 to prop up prices. The deal is scheduled to last through 2018, and there has been recent support by OPEC’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to extend the cuts into 2019. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said there was “considerable resistance” to extending the deal as current, or higher, prices could entice even more U.S. shale producers to come back online. U.S. crude production - thanks largely to shale oil drilling - has already grown by nearly 25 percent in under two years to above 10 million barrels per day C-OUT-T-EIA. In Asia, Shanghai crude futures fell over 2 percent in their second day of trading to 424 yuan ($67.85) per barrel from a last settlement of 433.8 yuan ($69.41).

The news of the maintenance activity, which Vedanta said was earlier scheduled for April, comes amid local media reports that thousands had taken to the streets and shut shops in Thootukudi to protest against the expansion of the smelter. The refining and copper rod manufacturing operations would continue as usual at the smelter, Vedanta said in a statement. The company did not return calls from Reuters seeking further comment. The copper smelter, run by Vedanta’s Sterlite Copper unit, is one of the India’s biggest and has been a target of protesters, who call it a major source of pollution and a risk to fisheries. The plant was shut for more than two months in 2013 after residents complained about emissions. An environmental court later ruled the smelter could operate, but should take extra steps to prevent pollution.

2018-03-27,"* European markets open higher, S&P futures extend gains * Reports China and U.S. quietly working to avoid trade war * Currency investors dump dollar and yen, snap up euros (Adds European markets) By Tom Pfeiffer LONDON, March 27 (Reuters) - Stock markets jumped and the dollar fell on Tuesday as reports that the United States and China were negotiating to avert a trade war whetted investors’ appetite for riskier assets. The euro rose to a five week high against the U.S. currency and Japan’s Nikkei share index enjoyed its best day in almost three months, jumping 2.3 percent. The reports of behind-the-scenes talks between Washington and Beijing spurred optimism that President Donald Trump’s protectionist shift is more about gaining leverage in trade talks than isolating the world’s biggest economy with tariff barriers that would stifle global growth. This helped offset news that the United States and many of its allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. An equity rally that began late on Wall Street, where shares had their best day in 2-1/2 years, spilled over to Asia and then Europe, where the Stoxx 600 index was on track for its best day in seven weeks. But some investors were not rushing to recalculate risks around Trump’s America First trade agenda. “He can flip flop quite a lot,” said Lukas Daalder, chief investment officer at Robeco in Rotterdam. “The big problem is, how long will it take before new tweets and headlines that will change the sentiment again?” He said he was underweight emerging market equities and the Nikkei and overweight other developed markets “based on the expectation that there will be more trade uncertainty”. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang pledged on Monday to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes inched up to 2.848 percent, but remained short of last week’s top at 2.90 percent. In currency markets the reaction was to offload both the yen and the dollar. After a big gain on Monday, the euro added another 0.3 percent to hit $1.2473, leaving it less than one cent off a three-year high hit in mid-February. Valentin Marinov, head of G10 FX strategy at Credit Agricole, said that the easing of trade fears had allowed investors to re-focus on whether the European Central Bank would tighten monetary policy faster than expected, and for large institutional investors to resume allocating more money to the euro zone after years of being underweight. The improved mood on trade gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing. In oil markets, Brent crude added 23 cents to $70.33 a barrel.

2018-03-27,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China met its 2020 carbon intensity target three years ahead of schedule last year, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Tuesday, citing the country’s top climate official Xie Zhenhua. China, the world’s biggest energy consumer, cut its 2005 carbon intensity level, or the amount of climate-warming carbon dioxide it produces per unit of economic growth, by 46 percent in 2017, Xie told a forum in Shanghai on Tuesday.  Carbon intensity fell 5.1 percent in 2017 compared to the previous year, Xinhua said, suggesting that China’s war on pollution also helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions.   China originally promised to cut its 2005 carbon intensity by 40 percent to 45 percent. The pledge, first made in 2009, was included in the country’s commitments to the international community ahead of negotiations for a new global climate pact in Paris in 2015.  However, China struggled to honor another promise to establish a nationwide emissions cap and trade system by 2017, with the scheme delayed by technical problems, including the reliability of emissions data. The country eventually settled for a scaled-back scheme involving only the power sector, which was launched in December last year.    In his speech, Xie said the national market, though only at an embryonic stage, already covers about 1,700 power firms with total carbon dioxide emissions in excess of 3 billion tonnes, making it the world’s biggest. He said China would continue to work to expand coverage to other industries.     But the issue has been complicated by the decision, made at this year’s full session of parliament, to transfer responsibility for climate change and carbon emissions to an expanded Ministry of Ecology and Environment. It was previously under the remit of the state planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). Xie was formerly vice-chairman of the NDRC and is now a special envoy with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  “It is a daunting task to launch China’s national carbon trading market,” said Peter Corne, managing partner at the legal firm Dorsey & Whitney in Shanghai, who follows China’s environmental policies.  “It is questionable whether in the short term (the new ministry) can be elevated in status and power to the extent that it will be able quickly to assume the influential role that the NDRC occupied in the area of climate change,” he added.

Germany accounted for nearly 30 percent of Nordex’s sales in 2017, which came in at 3.1 billion euros ($3.86 billion), but a shift towards a more competitive auction-based system for wind projects has led to a steep drop in new orders. Having scaled up after the takeover of Acciona’s wind business in 2015, Nordex was able to counter-balance its heavy exposure to Germany with Acciona’s broad footprint in Latin America. That is a key advantage at a time when competition in the industry is tightening as governments reduce subsidies for wind power. Nordex said that while sales in Germany were expected to slump by nearly two thirds this year, volumes would recover from 2020, with traders citing this positive mid-term outlook as the driver behind a 6.6 percent gain in the group’s shares. “We have a great turnaround plan in place and are optimistic that with our new products we will be again in a top market position,” Nordex Chief Executive Jose Luis Blanco told reporters on Tuesday. Like most of its peers, including market leaders Vestas and Siemens Gamesa, Nordex faces heavy margin pressure as tender-based systems reward project developers able to make the lowest bid. Nordex, the world’s sixth-largest maker of wind turbines, said it expects sales to fall to between 2.4 billion and 2.6 billion euros in 2018, down from 3.1 billion last year. Analysts, on average, expect 2.6 billion euros. The company expects its margin on earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to drop to 4 to 5 percent this year from 6.5 percent in 2017. This is also below the 5.5 percent average analyst poll. Asked about the relationship with major shareholder Acciona, which holds a stake of just below 30 percent in Nordex, Blanco said that the Spanish group was a very important customer and a constructive partner. Sources have told Reuters previously that Acciona could at some point choose to buy the remaining stake in Nordex, which is currently worth 536 million euros, once a three-year lock-up period expires later this year. Blanco said that the group would study opportunities that could add value, including mergers and takeovers, but added he did not see any at the moment.

2018-03-27,"(Adds graphic) TOKYO, March 27 (Reuters) - Japan’s Shikoku Electric Power Co Inc said on Tuesday it will decommission an ageing reactor at its Ikata nuclear plant as the country’s power industry struggles to meet new nuclear safety standards set after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The announcement brings to 15 the number of reactors being scrapped since the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi plant more than seven years ago. The move comes as Japan’s return to nuclear power is slowly gathering pace, although the industry still faces public opposition, court challenges and unfavourable economics. Shikoku Electric will scrap the No. 2 reactor at the Ikata plant, about 720 km (450 miles) west of Tokyo. The reactor began operations in 1982 with a capacity of 566 megawatts but has been shut since 2012. The decision took into account factors including the cost of reinforcing work to meet new safety standards and the need to extend the reactor’s operations after a standard operating life of 40 years, the company said in a statement. Shikoku Electric earlier decided to scrap the No.1 reactor at Ikata, while a Japanese court in December ordered the utility not to restart the No.3 reactor, overturning a lower court decision. The No.3 reactor has been idled for maintenance since October 2017 after resuming operations in 2016. Just five reactors are currently operating out of 40 commercially viable units. All reactors in Japan had to be relicensed following the 2011 Fukushima disaster which highlighted shortcomings in regulation.

2018-03-27,"* Consumption seen rising up to 8 pct in 2018 vs 2017 * Demand to be spurred by infrastructure spend, monsoon * Jan-Feb diesel use up 10 pct on year -govt data By Koustav Samanta SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - Demand for diesel in India is set to hit a record in 2018 as the government targets massive infrastructure spending in the fiscal year that starts April 1, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking a second term in elections in 2019. Diesel consumption growth in calendar 2018 may be more than double last year, analysts and traders told Reuters, aided by an expected regular monsoon this year that should boost demand in the world’s third-largest oil consumer for diesel used in harvesting and other farming, leading to higher rural spending. “Barring extreme events and expecting a continuation in good GDP (gross domestic product) growth accompanied by an average monsoon, India’s diesel consumption should be up to about 7.7 million tonnes towards the end of the year,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of consultancy Trifecta Energy. Strong growth would end two choppy years which saw consumption dented by a surprise demonetization programme launched by India’s government that crimped public spending after the most commonly used bank notes were removed from circulation at virtually no notice. India’s average monthly diesel consumption was about 6.6 million tonnes, or about 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd), in 2017. That was up about 3.1 percent from 2016, when average monthly consumption was 6.4 million tonnes. Demand for the industrial fuel in Asia’s third-biggest economy is expected to grow between 5 and 8 percent this year, market participants said. Eying the 2019 elections, Modi is budgeting 14.34 trillion rupees ($221 billion) on rural infrastructure in the 2018/19 business year. Indians will also go to the polls in five states by January next year. “Bullish factors to look forward to in regards to Indian gasoil (include) solid economic growth with special emphasis towards rural development, improving industrial/freight activities, an uptick in the construction sector and not the least, the upcoming elections,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of East of Suez oil at consultancy FGE. Meanwhile, an expected plentiful monsoon would boost agricultural expansion as seasonal rainfall is likely to be unaffected by an El Nino weather pattern forecast to set in after the four-month rainy season ends in September. “In the absence of rain, diesel will be used for power generation. However, a good rainfall will mean that diesel will be used a lot more in harvesting,” Vijayakar said. India guzzled 13.2 million tonnes of diesel in January and February, up 10 percent from a year earlier, recent government data showed. Meanwhile India’s diesel exports in February were up 32 percent to 2.31 million tonnes year-on-year. Election spending and “the tendency of state-run refiners to refrain from increasing diesel prices during this period, will particularly support the fuel’s demand,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy’s Global Gas Analytics in London.

2018-03-27,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A mix of concern and disappointment met Uber Technologies Inc’s deal to sell its Southeast Asian business to bigger regional rival Grab, as drivers and users of the ride-hailing firms took in the prospect of sharply reduced competition.     The services throughout Asia have long relied on discounts and promotions for consumers and incentives for drivers, which made for tough competition, pushing down profit margins.      Grab said the Uber acquisition accelerated its path to profitability in its core transport business, as it would become the most cost-efficient Southeast Asian platform.         While drivers were split on which of the two services offered better compensation, they generally expected fares to go up with the reduced competition.     Rennu Mahajan, who has driven a combined three-and-a-half years for both companies in Singapore, said some of her driver friends were concerned because now they would not be able to switch to the other app.     “But I am personally not worried. I am quite confident that the fares will go up. If incentives don’t go up, fares will increase and we will still get a little bit more,” said Mahajan, 57.          On its Singapore website, Grab said passengers could expect better service with more drivers and transport options available on one app and that fares would not change. For drivers, it said the benefits and incentives structure remained the same. However, following a similar merger between Grab investor Didi Chuxing and China’s Uber business in 2016, driver numbers dropped dramatically as subsidies lapsed and new regulations raised residence requirements for drivers.  In the year following Didi Chuxing’s acquisition, driver response rates fell between 15 and 40 percent in major Chinese cities, according to Didi Chuxing’s data.  According to mobile data analytics firm App Annie, Grab was ranked fifth among top apps based on monthly active users in Singapore in 2017 versus Uber at No. 7. In Indonesia, Go-Jek was at No. 9 just ahead of Grab.         Whether the merger would eliminate competition in Singapore will be the focus of government review, a spokeswoman for the Land Transport Authority said.     “We will ensure that no one single market player dominates the sector to the detriment of commuters and drivers,” she said.     Malaysia’s Land Transport Authority issued a similar statement, saying it “will work closely with relevant consumer and various regulatory agencies such as the Malaysia Competition Commission to safeguard passengers from unfair terms”.     For both Ricky Tan, who has driven for Uber in Singapore for over a year, and Andre Pereira who uses both services, Grab’s ability to exert greater control on prices was cause for concern as it may drive away customers to public transport.     “As the only app left, Grab can easily increase prices,” Pereira, 24, said.     While there are smaller ride-hailing apps in each market, Grab and Uber have a presence across the region, while Indonesia’s popular Go-Jek only operates within its home country.     Drivers in Cambodia, one of the last frontiers in the battle of apps, say competition is fierce and the market will not be easy for Grab.     “A lot of people are used to using Uber, Grab isn’t strong yet, Uber is stronger...Grab just arrived,” said Krem Sokhom.          The apps have also grown in popularity in countries with fewer public transportation options, such as Vietnam.     Le Minh Quan, 30, who drives with both Grab and Uber in Vietnam, said: “Without competition they could enforce higher commission or reduce their support, and that’s worrying. Before we had a choice, but now we don’t.”     Banker Le Hoang Ngan also uses both.     “Whoever gives me discount codes I’ll go with it, if not, I’ll skip. So one down will just give me less option,” he said.        In Thailand, ride-hailing services by privately owned vehicles are illegal but many drivers work with both Uber and Grab. There was no shortage of drivers and riders who liked the service that Grab had to offer.      “Grab provides enough promotions for my liking, and even if sometimes they don’t, I don’t mind paying the full price,” said Choltanutkun Tun-atiruj, a magazine writer, who said she preferred Grab’s services and relied on it in her everyday life.      “I prefer convenience and what’s the quickest, easiest.”      Created by Bill Tarrant",https://uk.reuters.com/article/uber-grab-reaction/refile-update-1-as-uber-bows-out-to-grab-drivers-and-riders-bemoan-loss-of-choice-idUKL3N1R92HC,27 Mar 2018,"A mix of concern and

2018-03-27,"* Asia shares track Wall St rebound, Nikkei up over 2 pct * European markets seen opening higher, S&P futures extend gains * Reports China and U.S. quietly working to avoid trade war * Currency investors dump dollar and yen, snap up euros By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 27 (Reuters) - Asian share markets sprang higher on Tuesday as reports of behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China rekindled hopes that a damaging trade war could be averted, in turn sapping life from the dollar and yen. Taking a cue from Wall Street, Japan’s Nikkei enjoyed its best day in almost three months, jumping 2.3 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose almost 1 percent, while China blue chips added 0.9 percent. Futures for the FTSE rose 1.2 percent and spread betters pointed to steep gains for other European bourses, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 firmed 0.3 percent. The abrupt mood swing came amid reports Chinese and U.S. officials were busy negotiating to avert an all-out trade war. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday pledged to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. “The recent escalation may have simply been a negotiating tactic that will end in a compromise,” wrote analysts at JPMorgan. “This would be consistent with the pattern around the steel/aluminium tariffs and is the interpretation that many market commentators are favouring.” Yet they warned it was too early to say for sure, given President Donald Trump has had deeply held views on fair trade for decades. Even a whiff of a deal was enough to propel Wall Street to its best day in 2-1/2 years and deliver the Dow its third-biggest point gain ever. The Dow jumped 2.84 percent, while the S&P 500 climbed 2.72 percent and the Nasdaq 3.26 percent. The sudden bout of optimism helped offset news that the United States and many of its Allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes inched up to 2.856 percent, but remained short of last week’s top at 2.90 percent. In currency markets the reaction was to offload both the yen and the U.S. dollar as appetite for riskier assets revived. “The yen is being quietly sold as risk hedges are unwound and looks particularly vulnerable on the crosses,” Citi analysts said in a note. Short-covering against the euro was especially sharp as the common currency jumped 1.4 percent overnight to stand at 131.51 yen. That allowed the U.S. dollar to bounce to 105.61 yen, having been at its lowest since late 2016 at one point. Yet the U.S. currency ran into selling against almost everything else, with notable breaks by the euro and sterling. The euro was up at $1.2450, after cracking the March top at $1.2446, and bulls were eyeing the peak for the year so far at $1.2556. The broad-based softness kept the dollar retrained against a basket of currencies at 89.063, after touching a five-week trough of 88.979. The improved mood on trade gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing, while spot gold inched up to $1,353.61 an ounce. In oil markets, U.S. crude futures put on 29 cents to $65.84 a barrel, while Brent crude added 18 cents to $70.30 a barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-03-27,"(Adds Qatari denial) DUBAI, March 26 (Reuters) - Two Qatari fighter jets flew dangerously close to two civilian aircraft from the United Arab Emirates while they were in Bahraini airspace on Monday, UAE state news agency WAM quoted its civil aviation authority as saying. WAM said the General Civil Aviation Authority had condemned the “provocative action”, which it said followed two similar incidents that had been reported by the UAE to the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations’ aviation agency. Qatar denied the claim in a statement by its civil aviation authority saying that the UAE was trying to cover up for its own violations of Qatari airspace.

2018-03-27,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: Shanghai crude futures first day's trading: reut.rs/2I32GHF By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, March 27 (Reuters) - China’s new crude oil futures contract enjoyed a successful first day of trading in Shanghai, most likely exceeding the wildest hopes of its backers, but much of the hard work of building a viable benchmark still has to be done. The new contract, launched on Monday by the Shanghai International Energy Exchange (INE), attracted interest from Western oil traders as well as domestic investors. Some 20 million barrels of oil changed hands on the first day, with the first deal going to global trader Glencore , and other participants included major merchants Trafigura, Freepoint Commodities and Mercuria. At one stage the volume of trades being done on the INE exceeded those in global rivals Brent and West Texas Intermediate (WTI). The evident enthusiasm for the new contract would have pleased the INE. It aims to establish a third global benchmark in China, the world’s largest crude buyer with imports averaging just over 9 million barrels per day for the first two months of 2018. On the surface, there is no reason why the INE contract shouldn’t take its place alongside Brent and WTI. It’s a far more useful marker for China - and for the rest of fast-growing Asia as well - given the seven grades of crude accepted for delivery are heavier and more sour than the light grades that make up Brent and WTI. This means the INE contract better reflects the type of crudes that are more typically consumed in China, and in other major regional importers such as India, Japan and South Korea. It’s precisely this advantage that will really need to be honed if the first day’s success is to be carried forward. In effect, the INE contract is a sort of Chinese mirror of the already well-established Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME) Oman futures. The DME contract has a similar gravity and sulphur content to the INE equivalent, providing an opportunity to use both as hedges for physical purchases as well as arbitrage plays. This dynamic is likely what will attract and retain international market players to the INE, as it will allow them to profit from any opportunities between the prices for free-on-board cargoes offered by the DME futures, and delivered to China cargoes by the INE. The difficulty for Western investors in the INE is the still-to-be-determined risk of interference by the authorities in Beijing. The latter have a track record of changing rules and regulations for commodity trading if the market isn’t behaving in their desired fashion. Currency risk is also on the agenda, given the INE is settled in yuan and the other major oil contracts are in U.S. dollars. There are other challenges for the INE, with one being that the contract is only traded in Asian hours, closing at 1500 local time, or 0700 GMT. This excludes London and New York traders from getting in on the action in their own time zones, a factor that may hamper liquidity. There is also a risk of different expectations of the various participants, with foreign trading houses, banks and oil companies seeking hedging and arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile the Chinese government and state-owned majors may be seeking market control and the ability to pay for crude in their own currency. Another factor that still has to be worked out will be how much of the volume and open interest is held by professional players, either foreign or Chinese, and how much is down to day traders and other small-scale investors. Several of China’s vibrant commodity contracts are dominated by smaller players, which can exacerbate swings based on sentiment or momentum, without too much based on market fundamentals. But none of these problems are insurmountable, and can be addressed as the contract build ups a history and a reputation. The key will be to keep an eye on volumes and open interest as a measure of the INE’s success.

2018-03-27,"NAMIE, Japan (Reuters) - At a small plant intended to help revitalize a town ravaged by the 2011 earthquake, Nissan Motor Co is giving its costly electric vehicle (EV) batteries new life after they pass their peak performance. Global automakers are looking for ways to make cheaper EVs and prolong the life of their batteries, which can account for up to one-fifth of each vehicle’s cost and are made from increasingly costly materials, including cobalt and nickel. Starting in May, 4R Energy Corporation, a joint venture between the Nissan and Sumitomo Corp will begin selling rebuilt replacement lithium-ion batteries for the first-generation Leaf. The batteries will be produced at the new factory in Namie by reassembling high-performing modules removed from batteries whose overall energy capacity has fallen below 80 percent. They will be sold in Japan for 300,000 yen ($2,855.51), roughly half the price of brand-new replacement batteries for the world’s first and best selling mass-marketed all-battery EV. “By reusing spent EV batteries, we wanted to raise the (residual) value of EVs and make them more accessible,” said Eiji Makino, CEO of 4R, which on Monday opened the plant in Namie, Fukushima Prefecture, around 5 kilometers north of the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the world’s worst since Chernobyl in 1986.  The flat, rectangular battery packs that line the bottom of each Leaf chassis are trucked into the plant, where each module is assessed.   Sumitomo has come up with a way to analyze all 48 modules contained in each battery pack in four hours, a huge time savings from the 16 days Nissan engineers previously used for similar measurements. Modules with capacities above 80 percent are assigned for use in replacement Leaf batteries; lesser modules are reassembled and sold as batteries for fork lifts, golf carts, and lower-energy applications such as streetlamps. The plant can process 2,250 battery packs a year, and initially plans to refabricate “a few hundred” units annually, Makino said, adding that 4R would see whether the process could also be used for batteries from the latest Leaf model, which uses a different battery chemistry. Bracing for a sharp increase in the price of key EV battery materials, including cobalt, nickel, and lithium, more automakers are focusing on reuse and recycling, with Toyota Motor Corporation announcing in January it would partner with a Japanese electric power company to explore such options. Makino said it would be difficult for 4R to completely break down and recycle EV batteries on its own but may consider partnering with another company to retrieve reusable materials, a process industry experts say is key to sustainable EV battery production.    “Second use is potentially a really great option, but at the end of it all, batteries still need to be recycled,” said Jeff Spangenberger, energy systems researcher at the U.S. Argonne National Laboratory, adding that the profitability of battery recycling operations would depend on the highly volatile price of component materials.   ($1 = 105.0600 yen) Reporting by Naomi Tajitsu; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/nissan-battery/nissan-spins-up-new-plant-to-give-second-life-to-ev-batteries-idUKL8N1R81MN,27 Mar 2018,"At a small plant intended

2018-03-27,"* Asia shares track Wall St rebound, Nikkei up over 1.5 pct * Reports China and U.S. quietly working to avoid trade war * Currency investors dump dollar and yen, snap up euros By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, March 27 (Reuters) - Asian share markets rose sharply on Tuesday as reports of behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China rekindled hopes a damaging trade war could be averted, in turn sapping the strength of the dollar and yen. Taking their cue from a surge on Wall Street, Japan’s Nikkei climbed 1.7 percent and China blue chips added 1.2 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose almost 1 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.7 percent, adding to gains made after the U.S. exempted the country’s steel from import tariffs. The abrupt mood swing came amid reports Chinese and U.S. officials were busy negotiating to avert an all-out trade war. White House officials are asking China to cut tariffs on imported cars, allow foreign majority ownership of financial services firms and buy more U.S.-made semiconductors, said a person familiar with the discussions. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday pledged to maintain trade negotiations and ease access to American businesses. Even a whiff of a compromise was enough to propel Wall Street to its best day in 2-1/2 years and deliver the Dow its third-biggest point gain ever. The Dow jumped 2.84 percent, while the S&P 500 climbed 2.72 percent and the Nasdaq 3.26 percent. All 11 major sectors of the S&P 500 gained, with technology up 4.0 percent and finance 3.2 percent. The sudden bout of optimism on trade helped offset news the United States and many of its Allies were expelling more than 100 Russian diplomats in retaliation for a nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy in Britain. The surge in stocks dragged on the Treasury market, which faces a record $294 billion of new supply this week. Yields on 10-year Treasury notes inched up to 2.856 percent, but remained short of last week’s top above 2.90 percent. In currency markets the reaction was to offload both the yen and the U.S. dollar. “The yen is being quietly sold as risk hedges are unwound and looks particularly vulnerable on the crosses,” Citi analysts said in a note. Short-covering against the euro was especially sharp as the common currency jumped 1.4 percent overnight to stand at 131.32 yen. That allowed the U.S. dollar to bounce to 105.69 yen, having been at its lowest since late 2016 at one point. Yet the U.S. currency ran into selling against almost everything else, with notable breaks by the euro and sterling. The euro was up at $1.2450, after cracking the March top at $1.2446, and bulls were eyeing the peak for the year so far at $1.2556. The broad-based softness kept the dollar retrained against a basket of currencies at 89.121, after touching a five-week trough of 88.979. The improved mood on trade gave a fillip to industrial commodities, with copper and iron ore bouncing, while spot gold was steady around $1,352.00 an ounce. In oil markets, U.S. crude futures put on 19 cents to $65.74 a barrel, while Brent crude added 14 cents to $70.26 a barrel.

2018-03-27,"* Concern that U.S. may bring back sanctions against Iran * Shanghai crude repeats high launch-day trading volumes By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, March 27 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday, pushed up by concerns that tensions in the Middle East could lead to supply disruptions. Hopes that behind-the-scenes talks between the United States and China will prevent a looming trade war between the world’s two biggest economies also supported global markets, including crude oil futures. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $65.71 a barrel at 0142 GMT, up 16 cents, or 0.2 percent, from their previous close. Brent crude futures were at $70.25 per barrel, up 13 cents, or 0.2 percent. James Mick, Managing Director and Energy Portfolio Manager with asset management firm Tortoise, said “rising geopolitical tensions” were driving up oil prices. The biggest risk was that the United States could re-introduce sanctions on Iran. “Crude also received support from OPEC members as Saudi Arabia and Russia both reiterated goals to extend the production cut agreement,” Mick said. Iraq, the second biggest producer within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said on Monday that it also supports the producer cartel’s agreement to cut oil output. OPEC, together with a group of non-OPEC producers led by Russia, started withholding production in 2017 in order to prop up prices. The deal to cut is scheduled to last through 2018, and there has been recent support by OPEC’s de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to extend the cuts into 2019. However, some traders cautioned that such a moved faced opposition. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage OANDA in Singapore said there was “considerable resistance” as current or higher prices opened the possibility that even more U.S. shale producers could come back online. U.S. oil production has already jumped by almost a quarter since mid-2016, to 10.4 million barrels per day (bpd) C-OUT-T-EIA, taking it past top exporter Saudi Arabia and within reach of top producer Russia, which pumps around 11 million bpd. In Asia, Shanghai crude oil futures saw their second day of trading, repeating Monday’s high volumes. Over the first 24 hours of its trading, Shanghai’s spot crude volumes made up 5 percent of the global market, versus 23 percent for Brent and 72 percent for WTI. Brent volumes are currently low as much of Europe is already on holidays for Easter. Shanghai crude dropped from a Monday close of 429.9 yuan ($68.62) per barrel to 426.2 yuan ($68.03) at 0143 GMT on Tuesday. In dollar-terms, Chinese crude prices are trading between Brent and WTI.

2018-03-27,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s environment ministry has urged 28 northern cities to shut factories to tackle a bout of heavy smog in the region, the Shanghai Securities News reported on Tuesday, a sign that tough winter curbs could be extended for the rest of the year. The Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said on Sunday that it had told cities to take emergency action to tackle this week’s smog and to strengthen supervision. The Shanghai Securities News said the notice also included measures to shut or reduce output at a selected number of plants in the region. As many as 34 northern Chinese cities have issued smog alerts this week amid concerns that industrial activity was starting to ramp up again following six months of tough output curbs. The MEE said on Sunday that the heavy smog, expected to last until Wednesday, was caused by warm and humid air as well as the resumption of large swathes of industrial production in the region.   China’s winter campaign to force 28 northern cities to shut plants and restrict traffic came to an end earlier this month, but the major steel-producing city of Tangshan has already announced plans to extend the curbs until November. A manager at a steel mill in Tangshan said they had received a notice to shut down production for the whole of this week. A separate industry official said output restrictions were currently in effect throughout the city. He did not elaborate.  However, the head of one ceramics firm at Zibo in the province of Shandong, which was forced to suspend operations at the end of last year, said his company had not received any closure orders since January. China is currently drawing up a new three-year action plan to curb smog in major industrial regions and has promised tougher targets and smarter enforcement methods.
