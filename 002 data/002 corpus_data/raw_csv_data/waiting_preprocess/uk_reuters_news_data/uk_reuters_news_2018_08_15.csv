2018-08-15,"Aug 15 (Reuters) - A unit of Citgo Petroleum in September plans to resume long-delayed work to refurbish an idled, 235,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) oil refinery on Aruba, the Caribbean island’s government said on Wednesday. Due to a lack of credit, Citgo Aruba Refining in February had slowed efforts at the plant amid U.S. financial sanctions imposed since 2017 on its parent company, Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA). Under a $685-million project that was approved in 2016 by Aruba’s government in a 25-year lease contract, Citgo aims to revamp and restart a facility that has been idled since 2012 when the previous operator, U.S.-based Valero Energy, halted crude processing due to low profits. Citgo declined to comment. PDVSA and its subsidiaries are increasingly under pressure to gain access to a Caribbean terminal or a refinery since U.S. producer ConocoPhillips in May began seizing the company’s overseas assets to satisfy a $2 billion arbitration award. The project’s latest phase will require about $35 million in investment and will take eight to 10 months to be completed, Aruba’s Labor Ministry said in a statement. Some 150 additional workers will be hired for the task. “The total number of workers, mostly local, is now reaching 500 people ... Financing for this stage is already available,” Aruba’s Labor Minister Glenbert Croes said. The plan was submitted by Citgo to the government of Aruba earlier this week, according to three sources with knowledge of the talks. Citgo appointed new executives for its Aruba unit in June in preparation for the new stage of the refurbish plan.

2018-08-15,"JOHANNESBURG, Aug 15 (Reuters) - South African power firm Eskom on Wednesday sought arbitration in a dispute with unions over whether some staff who went on strike illegally should be disciplined, threatening to delay implementation of a wage deal to end the crippling stoppage. The state-owned utility and its three main unions reached the outline deal on Thursday, agreeing on salary increases of 7.5 percent this year and 7 percent next year and in 2020, plus other benefits. Workers at Eskom, which generates more than 90 percent of the country’s power, went on strike in June. The same month, South Africa’s Labour Court declared that action “unprotected and unlawful.” In defiance of that order and an attempt at arbitration by Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan, some Eskom workers downed tools again in July and August. The National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) and the National Union of Metal Workers of South Africa (NUMSA) sought dispensation from disciplinary action for those workers, a condition Eskom said it could not agree to. The company said it was referring the dispute to the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration. The cash-strapped utility is desperate to push ahead with a turnaround plan that is a centrepiece of President Cyril Ramaphosa’s efforts to reform the economy. $1 = 14.5481 rand

2018-08-15,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil futures fell more than $2 a barrel on Wednesday after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles jumped last week, compounding worries about a weaker global economic growth outlook. Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down $1.96 a barrel at $70.50 a barrel by 11:07 a.m. EDT [1507 GMT]. The contract earlier touched $70.40 a barrel. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell $2.22 to $64.82 a barrel.  U.S. crude inventories rose unexpectedly last week USOILC=ECI, climbing 6.8 million barrels in spite of refinery crude runs hitting a record high, the Energy Information Administration’s data showed. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma USOICC=ECI, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures rose 1.6 million barrels. [EIA/S] Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a weekly decline in U.S. crude stocks. “Crude oil processing increased sharply and reached a record level of almost 18 million barrels per day last week,” said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank. “But this was not enough to prevent the inventory build. Or take it this way; it prevented an even larger build.” “Adding to the weakening price backdrop are signs that a deepening trade spat between the United States and China is undermining oil demand.” Investors are concerned about the world economy as trade disputes between escalate between the United States and its major trading partners. The OECD’s composite leading indicator, which covers the western advanced economies plus China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, slipped below trend in May and June. World trade volume growth peaked in January, and since then has nearly halved to less than 3 percent by May, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. The United States and China have been locked in a trade battle for months, a dispute that threatens to curb economic activity in both countries. Chinese oil importers now appear to be shying away from buying U.S. crude oil as they fear Beijing may decide to add the commodity to its tariff list. Not a single tanker has loaded crude oil from the United States bound for China since the start of August, Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data showed, compared with about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June and July. Meanwhile, investors were watching the impact of U.S. sanctions on Tehran, which analysts say could remove as much as 1 million bpd of Iranian crude from the market by next year. BMI Research said oil markets would “struggle for direction, as uncertainty around both the impact on supply from the Iranian sanctions and escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China persists”.

2018-08-15,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - QHG Oil Ventures, a joint venture between Qatar Investment Authority and Glencore, has valued a 14.2 percent stake in Rosneft, which it is selling, at 7.4 billion euros ($8.4 billion), a QHG financial statement showed on Wednesday. Under a deal sealed in May, Qatar Investment Authority (QIA)will buy the 14.16 percent stake in the Russian energy giant from the Singapore-based joint venture. The stake is now worth 4.94 euro per share, according to QHG’s statement, the first time it has filed a financial report. However, as QIA already indirectly owns part of the stake through the joint venture it is unclear how much it will pay for the stake. Reuters was first to report details of the financial statement, which was published on the website of the Singapore Account and Corporate Regulatory Authority. QHG was set up by QIA and Glencore in 2016 to invest in Rosneft and it bought a 19.5 percent stake in the Russian company for 10.2 billion euros. In its statement on Wednesday, QHG said that stake was now valued at 10.4 billion euros, meaning it has changed little in value in two years. QHG also said in the financial statement, which covered the period between Dec. 8 2016 and May 31 2018, that it made a profit of more than 672 million euros during that period, mostly from Rosneft dividends. The 2016 sale of the stake in Rosneft was trumpeted by the Kremlin at the time as a landmark deal and vote of confidence in the Russian economy, despite Western sanctions. But the deal, from the outset, was mired in unanswered questions about how it was structured. After the transaction was announced in 2016, it transpired that it was only an interim deal, and that a long-term buyer for the stake had yet to be found. Rosneft came close to concluding a deal with China’s CEFC last year, but that deal ran into trouble after CEFC founder and chairman Ye Jianming was put under investigation by Chinese authorities over suspected economic crimes, Reuters reported in March. Eventually Qatar’s investment fund agreed to become the permanent owner, resulting in the sale agreement in May. In its financial results, QHG said it expected that deal to complete by the end of this year.  QIA would eventually control an equity stake of 18.93 percent in Rosneft and Glencore would hold 0.57 percent.      On Dec. 7 2016, when the deal to sell 19.5 percent in Rosneft to Glencore and QIA was announced, Rosneft’s shares were trading at around 356.3 roubles (4.7 euros) per share compared to 427.1 roubles on Wednesday.

2018-08-15,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Exxon Mobil Corp’s motion to dismiss a securities suit alleging the company and top executives misled investors about the impact of climate change on its business.    U.S. District Court Judge Ed Kinkeade in Dallas ruled on Tuesday the plaintiffs could go ahead with their suit against Exxon, former Chief Executive Rex Tillerson and several financial executives. The civil suit alleges Exxon and the executives failed to properly account for climate impact to its business and made public statements and financial disclosures that caused its share price to fall.  The decision to proceed “is an important first step in holding one of the world’s most powerful corporations accountable,” said Darren Robbins, an attorney for the plaintiffs, which include the Greater Pennsylvania Carpenters Pension Fund.  Exxon had sought to dismiss the suit, arguing plaintiffs failed to state a claim for the civil action.   “We continue to believe the complaint is meritless and will vigorously defend ourselves from these baseless claims,” said Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri.      The case is one of several, including shareholder and employee lawsuits, centered on whether Exxon has for decades lied about climate change, including its impact on energy prices and the environment and its ability to develop reserves, and taken public positions inconsistent with what it knew. New York and Massachusetts attorneys general are investigating whether the company misled the public and investors on its statements on climate change, releasing documents showing that Tillerson while at the company had used an email account under a different name to discuss climate-related issues. Exxon has called those investigations politically motivated.  The case is Pedro Ramirez Jr v. Exxon Mobil et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas, No. 16-03111.

2018-08-15,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The northern Chinese province of Hebei will cut smog by a further 15 percent by 2020 and aims to make almost half its groundwater supplies safe for human use by the end of the decade, according to a policy document released late on Tuesday. The smog-prone province, which surrounds the capital Beijing, has been on the frontline of China’s efforts to reverse the consequences of more than three decades of untrammelled economic growth.  The country’s biggest steel producing region has been taking action to raise emission standards, eliminate outdated production capacity and switch to cleaner forms of energy, as well as curb industrial output during pollution build-ups. According to guidelines issued by the provincial environmental protection agency, Hebei will aim to bring average concentrations of hazardous floating particles known as PM2.5 to 55 micrograms per cubic meter by 2020, down from 65 micrograms last year. China’s official urban air quality standard is 35 micrograms, but the World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms. Hebei province said it would also cut the proportion of “below grade V” groundwater - water so polluted that it has lost all functionality - to less than 25.7 percent by 2020. The figure stood at 36.5 percent in 2016.  China grades its water into six bands using Roman numerals, with “grade I” the cleanest, and “below grade V” unusable even for irrigation and industry. Hebei said it would ensure that 48.7 percent is classified in grade I-III, meaning that it is fit for human consumption, up from around 46 percent in 2017. It also promised to make around 91 percent of its contaminated farmland safe for planting by the end of the decade, and make 20.7 percent of total land off-limits to development through a new “ecological red line” scheme. Six of China’s most polluted cities were in Hebei last year, and the province has been trying to develop new mechanisms to encourage them to clean up. In a separate notice on Tuesday, Hebei said the city of Hengshui was awarded 1 million yuan ($145,000) for improvements made in June, while Tangshan - China’s biggest steelmaking city - was fined the same amount after its air quality ranking fell during the month.     The money was distributed as part of a new ‘punishment and reward’ scheme that gives cash prizes to those cities at the top of the province’s monthly air quality rankings, while fining those at the bottom.

2018-08-15,"SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese oil importers are shying away from buying U.S. crude as they fear Beijing’s decision to exclude the commodity from its tariff list in a trade dispute between the world’s biggest economies may only be temporary. Not a single tanker has loaded crude oil from the United States bound for China since the start of August, Thomson Reuters Eikon ship tracking data showed, compared with about 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in June and July.  The United States and China have been locked in a tit-for-tat trade spat over the last few months, but crude was dropped from China’s final list of tariffs on $16 billion in U.S. goods announced last week. The move underscored the growing importance of the United States as a key global oil producer and critical alternative supply source for top importer China.  However, would-be buyers in China fret the commodity could be used as a bargaining chip in future negotiations with Washington, potentially getting added to tariff lists if the trade conflict takes a turn for the worse. “Since it takes months to get U.S. crude (to China) ... this (not buying U.S. shipments) is a precautionary measure to avoid any distressed selling in case the government puts tariffs on U.S. crude oil,” said Sushant Gupta, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. A source with a Chinese refiner said the company was “watching and seeing” how the situation develops before placing new orders for U.S. oil. He declined to be identified as he was not authorized to speak with media.  That comes after the country’s main oil importer, Unipec, earlier this month suspended shipments from the United States. Another petroleum source familiar with the Chinese market said U.S. crude may have been left off the tariff list to “facilitate clearing shipments” that have already been committed to.      “(The government) probably wants to impose (tariffs) when there is no more U.S. crude on the water, so I won’t take it as a reversal of the political stance on U.S. crude,” said the source. For a graphic on oil heading to China, click tmsnrt.rs/2vL6kCp To replace U.S. oil, China has been turning to the Middle East, West Africa and Latin America, according to shipping data and traders. That has been helped as a narrow price-spread between Brent and Dubai crude allows Atlantic basin oil to be profitably shipped to Asia. The spread on Wednesday had nearly halved from a month ago to $1.63 per barrel DUB-EFS-1M. Although China’s biggest oil suppliers are the Middle East, Russia and West Africa, the United States has become an important global supplier since it opened up its market for exports in 2016. Beyond the short-term complications of finding replacements for American oil, the Sino-U.S. trade dispute also poses risks to economic growth. “Any further escalation in the trade conflict between them is clearly an important downside risk and could lead to a further slowdown in oil demand growth for 2019, leading to downward pressure on oil prices,” said Gupta at Wood Mackenzie.

2018-08-15,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s second-largest steelmaking province, Jiangsu, will require steel mills to move to two new areas on the coast in the next few years, according to a provincial government document, to reduce air pollution and to make the industry more efficient. After years of getting rid of outdated excess capacity, the latest measures are the next front in the government’s long-term effort to upgrade and streamline its smokestack industries. Jiangsu province, which accounted for 12.5 percent of China’s total crude steel output last year, plans to create two steelmaking hubs, focussing on high-quality steel production, and relocate steel mills through merger and capacity trading, the document said. The plan was distributed on Tuesday by the Jiangsu government and reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday. The provincial government declined to comment. “(Jiangsu) will guide and encourage steel companies to adopt electric-arc furnaces (EAFs) and to produce high-end steel products used in military defence, rail, nuclear, aerospace and new energy vehicles industries,” the document said. Electric-arc furnaces, or mini-mills, emit far less harmful air than traditional blast furnaces which use coking coal as fuel. The move is similar to one outlined by Hebei, the country’s top steel producing province, earlier this year. Last month, Zenith Steel Group based in the city of Changzhou in Jiangsu, with annual capacity of 11.8 million tonnes, said it will move some production to a new steel factory in Nantong on the coast of the province.  In the document, Jiangsu explicitly ordered the city of Xuzhou to cut number of steel mills in the city to under 10 by the end of 2018 from 18 currently and consolidate the remaining into one to two companies by 2020. In April, at least three steel mills were ordered closed in Xuzhou.  Small steel mills and coke plants near the Yangtze river and Tai Lake region will be eliminated by 2020.  The province also plans to keep its coal-fired power capacity below 80 gigawatts by 2020 and lower the portion of its power produced from coal to 58.5 percent of total capacity from 67.6 percent currently. It plans to build more solar and wind power generation on the coast to meet the targets.

2018-08-15,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Mekong River Commission welcomed on Wednesday a decision by the Laos government to suspend approval of new dams while reviewing all dams currently under construction following the collapse of part of a hydropower project last month. An auxiliary dam, part of the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy power project in the southern province of Attapeu, collapsed on July 23, killing at least 39 people. More than 90 are still missing. The collapse put Laos’ hydropower ambitions in the spotlight and underscored concerns raised by environmental groups. “The Mekong River Commission (MRC) has welcomed the highly applauded and progressive decision ... that the country will review all existing and under-construction dams and suspend the consideration of all new hydropower investments considering the Xepian Xenamnoy dam break,” the MRC said on Wednesday. Laos, one of Asia’s poorest countries, hopes to become the “Battery of Southeast Asia” by selling power to neighbours through a series of hydropower dams. The landlocked country sells much of this electricity abroad, which makes up about 30 percent of its exports. Laos had 46 operating hydroelectric power plants in 2017, with 54 more planned or under construction. However, conservation groups warn of the project’s impact on the environment and rural communities that depend on the Mekong.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to open slightly higher, with Britain’s FTSE seen rising 0.2 percent, Germany’s DAX adding 0.1 percent and France’s CAC gaining 0.15 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid more than 1 percent to its lowest since August 2017, after bouncing 0.4 percent the previous day when the Turkish lira showed signs of stabilising. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 1.5 percent, reaching a near one-year low, and the Shanghai Composite Index fell 1.3 percent. Signs of the world’s second-largest economy losing momentum and the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade conflict have weighed on Chinese equities. “Investors tend to focus on negative aspects of listed companies’ first-half reports, as there is much pessimism and caution in a falling market,” said Linus Yip, a Hong Kong-based analyst at First Shanghai Securities. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1 percent after rallying more than 2 percent on Tuesday. South Korean markets were closed for a public holiday. The lira - which plummeted to a record low of 7.24 to the dollar at the week’s start, rattling global markets - was about 2 percent weaker at 6.47 after rebounding more than 8 percent overnight. While the lira clung above record lows, tensions between Washington and Ankara remained on the boil, keeping the currency on a shaky footing. Turkey has raised tariffs on some U.S. products under the principle of reciprocity “in response to the U.S. administration’s deliberate attacks on our economy”, Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had said on Tuesday that Ankara would boycott electronic products from the United States, retaliating in a row with Washington that has helped drive the lira to record lows. Underscoring lingering concerns over the crisis in Turkey, the dollar hit a 13-month peak against a basket of currencies, supported by its safe-haven status. The dollar index, which measures the greenback’s strength against a group of six major currencies stretched overnight gains and reached 96.862,, its highest since late June 2017. The strength of the U.S. currency was compounded by the euro’s fall, which has been dogged by potential risks to European banks from Turkey’s financial turmoil. “The lira rallied yesterday, but there is not remedial plan for Turkey’s internal and external imbalances. Europe’s banks will have to reserve more against these potential losses, and already low capital adequacy ratios will be tested,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. The euro dipped to $1.1319, its weakest since July 2017. The euro also struggled near a 13-month low versus the Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven currency. Adding to overnight gains, the dollar last traded up 0.1 percent at 111.25 yen. China’s onshore yuan weakened to a 15-month low above 6.9 per dollar after the country’s central bank set the lowest mid-point since May 2017 following the dollar’s broad surge. Government bond yields edged lower as risk appetite dampened across the region. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield declined 1 basis point to 2.882 percent after poking above 2.900 percent on Tuesday. Crude oil prices felt pressure from a stronger dollar, which increases the cost burden on non-U.S. buyers of commodities. Brent crude futures dipped 0.2 percent to $72.31 a barrel and U.S. crude shed 0.45 percent to $66.73 a barrel. Spot gold fell to an 18-month low of $1,186.70 an ounce, having declined 1.9 percent this week. Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange fell about 1.5 percent to a one-year low of $5,950 per tonne. Easing fears over a possible strike at a mine in Chile accelerated the metal’s fall.

2018-08-15,"BEIJING, Aug 15 (Reuters) - China’s Zhenhua Oil Corp, a subsidiary of Chinese defence conglomerate Norinco, has set up a new business unit to invest in liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals and trade the fuel to help feed the country’s thirst for the cleaner-burning fuel. A LNG team of five employees was set up in June at the company’s Beijing headquarters, led by Yu Fengwei, previously the company’s head of crude oil trading, according to multiple industry sources with knowledge of the matter. The team has set its sights on breaking into spot LNG trade and will explore deals with its global oil partners to secure gas supplies, said one of the sources, with direct knowledge of the company’s plan. “As Zhenhua does not have any LNG offtake deals to begin with, one of the ideas is to swap the company’s oil assets outside China with partners’ gas supplies,” said the source, without giving further details. In the domestic market, the company is looking to invest in LNG receiving facilities by teaming up with local government-backed piped gas distributors. All these proposals are at very early stage and will take time to materialize, said the sources, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak to press. A Zhenhua spokesman declined comment. Zhenhua, a unit of defence conglomerate China North Industries Group Corp (NORINCO), operates about a dozen oil and gas exploration and production projects globally, according to its website. Its main operations are in Iraq, including a stake in the Ahdab oilfield. In May, the firm entered a new production contract to develop the East Baghdad oilfield. Zhenhua, the smallest Chinese state-run oil and gas company, has sought to expand and upgrade its business. It has gained a foothold in China’s independent oil refining market by supplying some 6.5 million tonnes of crude in 2017. China’s natural gas demand has soared following a government-mandated switch from coal to the cleaner-burning fuel to reduce the country’s air pollution. The increased consumption in homes and by industry pushed the country to overtake South Korea as the world’s second-biggest LNG importer.

Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $72.14 per barrel at 0021 GMT, down by 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 34 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $66.70 per barrel. U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.7 million barrels in the week to Aug. 10, to 410.8 million barrels, private industry group the American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 1.6 million barrels, the API said. “Oil prices ... fell after the API inventory data showed an unexpected crude build last week,” said William O’Loughlin, investment analyst at Australia’s Rivkin Securities. Official U.S. fuel inventory data is due to be published later on Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration. Sentiment was also clouded by a darkening economic outlook which could start impacting oil demand, traders said. The OECD’s composite leading indicator, which covers the western advanced economies plus China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, peaked in January but has since fallen and slipped below trend in May and June. World trade volume growth also peaked in January at almost 5.7 percent year-on-year, but nearly halved to less than 3 percent by May, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis.

Algeria has been trying to attract more investment to its vital oil and gas sector, with Ould Kaddour pursuing a multi-pronged strategy since he took over as CEO in March 2017. “Our aim is definitely to rise our reserves by a presence overseas,” said the senior official, who asked not to be named.

Station 186 was restarted on Sunday amid tightened security, and was producing about 50,000 bpd, around half its normal capacity, the engineer said. The abduction last month of two workers, one Libyan and one Romanian, led to production at Sharara being limited to about 125,000 bpd, enough for refining at Libya’s Zawiya refinery but leaving no oil for export. The kidnapping of the workers remains unresolved. Before the incident, Sharara had been producing around 300,000 bpd, though the field has been vulnerable to frequent disruptions. Sharara, Libya’s largest field, is operated by Libya’s National Oil Corporation (NOC) in partnership with Repsol , Total, OMV and Equinor, formerly known as Statoil.

2018-08-15,"HOIMA, Uganda, Aug 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ugandan farmer James Mubona, 73, looked pensive as he sat in a blue plastic chair under a mango tree next to three of his four wives, one breastfeeding a five-month-old baby, contemplating the imminent loss of his 22-acre farm to an oil pipeline. The government is set to take about half of the land, which feeds Mubona’s 20 children and numerous grandchildren, to build the world’s longest electrically heated oil pipeline from northwest Uganda to Tanzania’s Tanga port on the Indian Ocean. “I am worried because I don’t know where to go when this land is taken,” Mubona told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Kyakatemba village in Hoima District, a poor region along Uganda’s western border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. “When the pipeline takes a bigger portion of your land and you remain with a small portion, what do you do with that small portion?” Uganda discovered crude reserves estimated by government geologists at 6.5 billion barrels in the Albertine rift basin more than 10 years ago. The east African country aims to refine crude oil domestically and export some via a 1,445-km (900-mile) pipeline through neighbouring Tanzania by 2020. An energy ministry official told Mubona that a chunk of his land will be used to run a 30-metre wide pipeline, road and power line from the refinery to the sea. Uganda signed an agreement in April with a consortium, including a subsidiary of General Electric, to build and operate a 60,000-barrel-a-day refinery that will cost up to $4 billion, the president’s office said. Yusuf Masaba, a spokesman for Uganda’s energy ministry, said the entire pipeline route had been mapped out and plans to compensate and resettle people were at an advanced stage. “Once the government valuer is done with valuation, then compensation will be done. I cannot say when they will be compensated,” Masaba told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We are not going to break people’s homes to pass the line. There are no settlements in the areas that the pipeline is going to pass,” he said, emphasising that the government is only going to acquire farmland, not houses. Mubona will not be the first Ugandan to lose land to the oil project, which the government hopes will spur economic growth, pay down the national debt and reduce poverty. More than 7,000 people were evicted from 13 neighbouring villages in Hoima District in 2012 for the refinery and a new international airport, which will fly in oil equipment, according to the energy ministry. In Kyakaboga resettlement village, some 50 km west of Mubona’s family, about 50 concrete, three-bedroom houses with red iron roofs stood in neat lines. More than a dozen lay empty. The urban-style houses were built for families that lost their land and homes to the refinery and opted to be compensated with an equivalent amount of land, rather than cash. “I can’t live here,” said Christop Opio, one of the small minority who chose resettlement over money when the government acquired his land in Kabaale for the airport. “It looks like a camp and there is no privacy. All houses are so close together,” he said, gesturing at the two rows of houses, as construction workers in orange and red reflector jackets laid stones to build a police station in the midday sun. Many families who have been resettled on the 530-acre plot complained that they could not keep livestock at the tightly-packed modern houses, unlike at their old rural homes, and that their new farmland was too far away, he said. The families who chose cash compensation have not fared much better, activists said. Innocent Tumwebaze, chairman of the Oil Refinery Residents Association, which represents evictees, said the 4.5 million shillings ($1,230) per acre compensation was too little to buy land in the same area. “We were compensated using outdated rates,” he said, standing outside his house in Kyakaboga resettlement village. Masaba said land is valued according to the market price in the area and that people who choose to receive cash compensation agree to the rate before accepting the money. “There is no one who is forced to take compensation they don’t agree to. We have a grievance mechanism and they can also go to court,” he said by phone. Some men who received the cash, as the customary landowners, deserted their families and disappeared to towns, abandoning their wives and children, who are staying with relatives. “Issues of compensation have broken up many families,” Tumwebaze said. Back in Mubona’s village, red crosses, painted by government officials in April, mark the doors of five mud-walled houses. “I was told that an oil pipeline is going to pass through here,” said Jacinta Kyomukama, 48, whose house is marked, adding that she is unsure whether to plant for the next season in case she is moved. Masaba said the marks did not mean those houses would be demolished, as the pipeline’s final route has not been decided. ""I expect to be compensated and then go and buy land elsewhere,"" said the mother of seven, as her grandchildren milled around her. ""I don't intend to go very far from here.""

Wall Street futures pointed to a sharply lower opening. The lira, a big focus for markets in recent days, bounced as much as 8 percent as authorities tightened the screws on foreign investors aiming to short the currency. But having firmed beyond 6 per dollar, most of its early gains fizzled out. The rebound follows a 36-percent drop over the past month and fears remain that Turkey is headed for full-blown crisis and debt defaults. Failure to tackle galloping inflation and Ankara’s diplomatic tiff with Washington, is also keeping investors wary. Attention has turned once again to the dollar, which opened Wednesday flat but then strengthened 0.16 percent against a basket of currencies. It is now up more than 5 percent this year. “The dominant theme in financial markets at the moment is the strength of the dollar,” Aviva Investors head of multi-asset funds Sunil Krishnan said. “We see scope for that move to continue.” “One of the big challenges to risk appetite in markets is if the dollar moves continue and put pressure on riskier assets such as emerging market bonds and so on,” he said. Krishnan saw the lira bounce as fragile, noting Turkey needed “concrete policy action to improve fundamentals and also some improvement in relations with the United States.” As the dollar rise hit commodities, European stocks fell half a percent. Copper prices hit one-year lows, gold slipped to 18-month lows and Brent crude fell almost $1 per barrel . The latest copper slide, with three-month futures down 2.5 percent, came after a Chilean mineworkers’ strike was averted. MSCI’s all-country equity benchmark fell half a percent , though it stayed off one-month lows reached on Monday. The lira collapse and dollar strength are driving a capital exodus from across emerging markets, sending currencies such as the Argentine peso and Indian rupee to record lows. Emerging equities fell 2 percent, and are down almost 20 percent from January highs. There are concerns also about China’s slowing economy - reinforced by this week’s data on investment and industrial output - and the yuan’s weakening to 15-month lows against the dollar. That is also pressuring other Asian markets. Indonesia, acting after the rupiah fell to three-year lows, raised interest rates for the fourth time since May. The backdrop to all this is the escalation in global trade tensions, with Beijing now lodging a complaint to the World Trade Organisation to determine the legality of U.S. tariff and subsidy policies. Turkey has also raised tariffs on some U.S. products “in response to the U.S. administration’s deliberate attacks on our economy”, Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter. Brokerage FXTM’s global head of currency strategy, Jameel Ahmad, said the U.S.-Turkey tensions reminded investors that “it is not just the United States and China that stand at the heart of the global trade war concerns”. There are signs the negative newsflow is starting to affect Wall Street which has so far drawn support from robust company earnings. The fears are reflected in the SKEW index - a gauge of the cost of put options on the S&P500 index relative to calls. A put option confers the right to sell an asset at pre-agreed price, while a call offers right to buy. The SKEW has risen this week to the highest since March. A rise in SKEW indicates higher demand for protection against market falls. S&P500 futures slipped 0.6 percent while futures on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index fell 0.8 percent. Trade and tighter central bank policy were stock market headwinds, according to Aviva’s Krishnan, who reckons the issues need to be “better discounted in terms of market pricing. It’s something investors need to come to terms with in coming months.” All those concerns have driven investors to embrace more stable assets. Aside from the dollar, that includes German and U.S. government bonds, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc. German and U.S. 10-year yields are down more 10 basis points this month. The strong dollar’s biggest victims are emerging currencies but its rise is also pummelling the euro and sterling. The single currency slipped a further 0.2 percent to a new 13-month low versus the dollar and also extended losses against the Swiss franc. Sterling tumbled to below $1.27 for the first time since June 2017, having lost ground for 11 days in a row, the longest losing streak since 2008.

2018-08-15,"* European carbon price graphic tmsnrt.rs/2PbgSCB By Susanna Twidale LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - The Benchmark European carbon price hit a 10-year high on Wednesday, marking a near 130 percent rise this year, with prices set to continue climbing over the next few years. The European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS) charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide (CO2) they emit. The cap-and-trade scheme is the EU’s key tool to meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030 compared with 1990 levels. Each member state has a set number of permits it can auction each year which are then purchased by companies to cover their emissions. The ETS suffered from excess supply following the financial crisis, which kept prices low and rendered the scheme ineffective, but in an effort to revive the scheme, the EU agreed on reforms in 2017 to curb oversupply. The first of these reforms, a Market Stability Reserve (MSR), comes into effect in 2019, which will take excess permits from the market. “This year is all about buying in anticipation of the start of the MSR,” Energy Aspects analyst Trevor Sikorski said. Carbon analysts at Thomson Reuters forecast the MSR will remove 390 million tonnes of permits in 2019, cutting the supply available from government auctions by 40 percent. Over the years 2019-2023, the analysts forecast a total of almost 1.5 billion permits will be withdrawn. In addition, Germany, Europe’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, said this week its near weekly auctions of permits would be paused from Nov. 9, meaning around 22 million fewer than expected permits will be auctioned this year. In a recent Reuters survey of eight analysts, the analysts on average expect prices to hit 20.76 euros a tonne by 2020 with the most bullish forecast at 30 euros/tonne. In addition to the MSR, the total quantity of carbon permits - known as the Linear Reduction Factor - will be reduced by 2.2 percent each year from 2021 to 2030, up from 1.74 percent a year now. This means there will be fewer permits available to buy, driving up the cost. High carbon costs make fossil fuel power generation more expensive which mean they also affect wholesale electricity prices. For a predominantly low-carbon nuclear power generator, such as France’s EDF, strong carbon prices are bullish as the company can benefit from higher electricity prices. On the flip side, companies with a large portion of fossil fuel power generation could be adversely hit by higher carbon prices if they are not well hedged and need to pay more to cover their emissions. Most large utilities however, will be protected as they hedge many years in advance. Germany’s RWE is the biggest company emitter of carbon dioxide in Europe as most of its electricity is produced from fossil fuels. Earlier this week the company’s half-year results revealed it has financially hedged its carbon needs until the end of 2022, limiting the impact of soaring prices. Under the ETS, some industries are eligible for free permits if they are deemed to be vulnerable to competition from countries with looser environmental regulations, known as “carbon leakage”. The number of sectors and companies eligible for this support will be reduced in the fourth trading phase of the scheme which runs from 2021-2030, meaning more firms will need to buy carbon allowances, another long-term bullish factor.

2018-08-15,"KOCHI, India (Reuters) - The death toll from the worst floods in nearly a century in the Indian tourist state of Kerala rose to 43 on Wednesday as rising water stranded tens of thousands of people and forced the closure of one of its main airports. The five latest fatalities from the rain that began a week ago came when authorities in the southern state were forced to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river. “Presently, 35 reservoirs in the state are releasing water. Many districts in the state are facing floods,” the state’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said on Twitter. The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rain in the state until Saturday, and it has issued a “red alert” for 12 out of its 14 districts.  The airport in the port city of Kochi will stay shut until Saturday afternoon. The rain and floods have destroyed and damaged hundreds of houses in the past week and caused significant losses to crops in the state known for its spices and coffee. A senior official with the Kerala State Disaster Management Authority, Sekhar Lukose Kuriakose, said the seasonal rains have killed more than 200 people in the state since May and displaced many. The state last saw such devastating flooding in 1924. Famous for its coastline and picturesque backwaters, Kerala has become a major destination for domestic and international tourists.

2018-08-15,"LEH, India, August 15 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tsering Chondol, 60, remembers a time when the water that flowed through the town of Leh, high in the Himalayas in India’s far north, was pristine. “We used to drink directly from the streams - until our land became a tourist hub,” said Chondol, wearing a traditional black gown and a red scarf. Leh is the largest town in the remote region of Ladakh, where locals have long wrested a living from herding goats and tending barley and wheat fields, ringed by 6,000-metre (19,685-foot) snow-capped peaks. Buddhist monasteries that dot the landscape are a reminder of ties to its eastern neighbour, Tibet. But as members of India’s burgeoning middle-class have ventured in increasing numbers to holiday in Ladakh’s tranquil, lunar-like terrain, its resources have been put under strain, threatening its fragile ecosystem. More than 277,000 tourists visited Leh last year alone, the local tourism body said - twice the number of residents in the region. The result: vehicles clogging narrow roads, and much more pollution, particularly sewage and plastic bags. “With the arrival of lots of tourists, people gradually forgot about the traditional ways of keeping the surroundings clean,” Chondol said, adding that the convenience and popularity of plastic bags had made matters worse. Rigzin Spalgon, who heads Leh’s municipal committee, said that a decade ago the city produced almost no waste. “All of a sudden we started generating more than 20 tonnes of waste and a lot of sewage per day,” Spalgon said. The steady environmental deterioration over the years spurred more than 4,000 volunteers in the Women’s Alliance of Ladakh, which Chondol heads, to take measures to tackle plastic waste. “This made us to think that we have to do something about it,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The world uses up to 5 trillion plastic bags annually, the U.N. Environment Programme says, with some 15 million tons of plastics ending up in the oceans each year. India generates 15,000 tonnes of plastic waste daily. Nearly half ends up in landfills, on the streets, and in drains and sewage systems, according to India’s Central Pollution Control Board. The issue of plastic pollution has caught the attention of India’s government, which in June pledged to eliminate all single-use plastics in the country by 2022. The Jammu and Kashmir region, where Ladakh is located, has moved faster: in January this year it banned plastic bags outright. Using a plastic bag carries a fine of 5,000 rupees ($73) or up to one month in jail, or both. “We were able to make Ladakh free of plastic carry-bags all because of the efforts of Women’s Alliance of Ladakh. They initiated the whole process and later ensured that the ban on plastic bags works,” said Spalgon. Half of India’s states and union territories have introduced a ban on plastic bags, yet many shoppers remain wedded to them. Plastic waste litters the streets of the South Asian nation. “Historically, we have had a very poor record of plastic ban implementation, with most governments only providing lip service,” said Pratibha Sharma from the campaign group Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. Megha Shenoy, a researcher at the India-based Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment, said broader action was needed. “Governments need to work with citizens to collect fines, and companies need to be held accountable in terms of their environmental and social responsibilities,” Shenoy said. Enforcing plastic bans also depends on people power, said Shakil Romshoo, head of the earth sciences department at Kashmir University. “The reason why these bans don’t make an impact in India is very simple: people are yet to get involved directly or indirectly in making these bans a success,” said Romshoo. “The ban on plastic carry-bags in Ladakh was successful because groups like Women’s Alliance ensured people’s participation in implementing the bans,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In Ladakh, alliance volunteers - backed by the local council and the police - inspect shops and markets up to three times a year. They also come armed with a solution: not only do they warn locals about the damage plastic bags do in the environment, but they sell handmade cloth bags as an alternative. The income generated from making and selling cloth bags, as well as traditional dresses, helps the volunteers continue their conservation efforts while providing them with an extra source of cash in a region where most women are farmers and housewives. “I want to be the part of the Ladakhi women’s movement as it is helping Ladakh’s environment and agriculture, which is at risk because of the huge influx of tourists and chemical fertilisers,” said volunteer Sonam Dolma. Chondol said the women’s group is also now campaigning to end the use of chemical fertilisers. Its actions have had other consequences too, she said. “Before, no one would think of allowing women to go out of the houses by themselves. Forget about allowing them taking a lead role in bringing change in the society,” she said. “Thanks to the success of Women’s Alliance, today women in Ladakh are a force to be reckoned with,” Chondol said.

2018-08-15,"(Fixes typo in par 2) * Turkish lira extends bounce but dollar stays firm at 13-mth high * Stronger dollar pressures commodities, gold at 18-mth low * Indonesia raises rates for fourth time since May * World stocks down quarter percent, European stocks flat By Sujata Rao LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Action from Turkey’s central bank pushed the lira higher for a second day on Wednesday, helping European stocks and emerging currencies consolidate recent losses though the dollar stuck at 13-month highs kept up the pressure on world markets. The lira bounced another 5 percent, sharply extending Tuesday’s gains as authorities further tightened the screws on foreigners aiming to short the currency. The lira is now around 6 per dollar, off record lows beyond 7.24 . However, it started 2018 at 3.75 and the rebound follows a 36 percent drop over the past month. Fear of full-blown crisis and debt defaults in the country of 80 million people is far from over as the central bank’s failure to tackle galloping inflation and Ankara’s diplomatic tiff with Washington keep investors wary. “It has calmed down a bit, the reason is that the Turkish lira is appreciating and that is causing people to re-focus on country-specific fundamentals so the contagion effect naturally is less,” said Koon Chow a strategist at fund manager UBP. He said however there had been little fundamental change to celebrate and added: “It’s only a temporary thing for Turkish markets, I’m not sure (volatility) is over.” The Turkish worries have in recent days driven a capital exodus from across emerging markets, sending currencies from the Argentine peso to the Indian rupee to record lows, while emerging equities have tumbled almost 20 percent from January highs. There are also concerns about China’s slowing economy — reinforced by this week’s data on investment and industrial output — and the yuan’s weakening to 15-month lows against the dollar is also pressuring other Asian markets. Indonesia, acting after the rupiah fell to three-year lows, raised interest rates for the fourth time since May European shares opened flat, though liquidity was severely thinned by a holiday in many countries. Earlier, Asian shares excluding Japan slid more than 1 percent to one-year lows while MSCI’s all-country equity benchmark was a quarter percent lower. But it stayed off one-month lows reached on Monday. Chinese shares  lost more than 1 percent, pressured by signs the world’s second-largest economy is losing momentum amid a trade conflict with Washington. Japanese shares too dropped one percent. U.S. President Donald Trump has slapped hefty tariffs on a swathe of Chinese goods, prompting retaliation from Beijing. Global trade tensions show little sign of easing, with Beijing now lodging a complaint to the World Trade Organisation to help determine the legality of U.S. tariff and subsidy policies. Turkey too has raised tariffs on some U.S. products “in response to the U.S. administration’s deliberate attacks on our economy”, Vice President Fuat Oktay wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. President Tayyip Erdogan has called a boycott on U.S. electronic goods. Jameel Ahmad, global head of currency strategy at FXTM brokerage said the escalation of tensions between the United States and Turkey reminded investors “it is not just the United States and China that stand at the heart of the global trade war concerns.” Wall Street closed higher on Tuesday, continuing to draw support from forecast-beating company earnings but New York stocks appear set for a weaker opening, futures show. The concerns have driven investors to embrace assets such as German and U.S. government bonds, the Japanese yen and Swiss franc, which are considered safer. German and U.S. 10-year yields are down more 10 bps this month . The other beneficiary has been the dollar. Already resurgent thanks to the high yield it offers, it has surged to 13-month peaks against a basket of currencies. “In light of all the turmoil we’ve seen out of Turkey and the subsequent contagion into other emerging markets, the dollar is pretty much establishing itself as the safe-haven currency,” said Bart Wakabayashi, Tokyo branch manager at State Street Bank. “If you are going to park your money somewhere to stay away from the turmoil, the dollar is going to be the currency of choice.” The strong dollar’s victims are of course emerging currencies — many of them remain under pressure despite the lira’s recent bounce. But the greenback’s rise has also pummelled euro and sterling. The former has been hit also by jitters around euro zone banks’ exposure to Turkey. The single currency slipped another 0.2 percent to a new 13-month low versus the dollar and it also extended losses against the Swiss franc Sterling meanwhile tumbled under $1.27 for the first time since June 2017, having lost ground for 11 days in a row, its longest losing streak since 2008. The currency is being undermined by confusion around what trade deal it (the British government) will negotiate with the European Union ahead of Britain’s planned exit next year from the bloc. However, gold, the other traditional safe haven, sank to 18-month lows, also hurt by dollar strength. “The dollar will continue to be the safe-haven asset of preference. As a consequence, gold prices are really going to struggle,” said Daniel Hynes, an analyst at ANZ Bank. Additional reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro in Tokyo and Marc

2018-08-15,"* EU carbon price rises to highest level since Nov. 2008 * Higher carbon prices mean more expensive to burn fossil fuels * EU market reform, reduced auction volumes drive rally (Updates prices, adds more detail) By Nina Chestney LONDON, Aug 15 (Reuters) - European Union carbon permit prices have risen to their highest in 10 years as reduced supply has prompted a flurry of buying. The permits, called EU Allowances, are traded under the European Union’s Emissions Trading System (ETS), which charges power plants and factories for every tonne of carbon dioxide they emit. Higher carbon prices make it more expensive for European utilities to burn fossil fuels and encourage a shift to cleaner sources of energy. The ETS, the EU’s flagship tool for reducing emissions, has suffered from excess supply since the financial crisis, which dragged prices down to lows of 2-3 euros a tonne. EU Allowances for delivery in December 2018 hit an intra-day high of 18.28 euros a tonne in early trade on Wednesday, their highest level since November 2008. The rise had a knock-on effect on German year-ahead baseload power prices which reached a record high. When wholesale energy prices rise on the back of higher carbon, utilities in some European countries pass on some of the cost to consumers through higher retail energy prices. Carbon prices are still under a record high of more than 30 euros in 2006, not long after the ETS started. By 0834 GMT, the EU Allowance price had retreated to 18.15 euros a tonne. The ETS was long viewed as inefficient because it suffered from too many permits. Long-awaited reforms were hammered out last November after more than two years of debate in Brussels. The reforms struck a delicate balance between being ambitious on climate change and protecting energy-intensive industries at risk of relocating abroad to avoid climate legislation. In measures to address the oversupply, the European Commission will withold a certain number of permits from market auctions from next year in a mechanism called the Market Stability Reserve (MSR). Traders said buying has increased in recent weeks as market participants stock up to build long positions due to reduced supply from auctions and amid higher energy prices. The number of permits released to the market by auctions has been reduced this month due to public holidays in several European countries. Added to that, weekly German auctions will stop after Nov. 9 until the first quarter of next year as Germany’s current contract with the European Energy Exchange (EEX) expires. Nearly 22 million permits from those auctions will have to be sold when auctions resume next year. “But 2019 is already in serious deficit due to the MSR reserve kicking in, so 22 million tonnes of additional supply in that year will make no difference to the deficit,” said analysts at investment bank Berenberg. The bank said average prices could rise to 25 euros a tonne in 2019 and 30 euros in 2020. In a Reuters survey last month, analysts raised their forecasts for carbon prices to 2020 after a bullish start to the year and on expectations that plans to reform the market will significantly curb oversupply.

2018-08-15,"* Vestas Q2 profit, order intake beat forecasts * Launches 200 mln euro share buyback * Says turbine prices have stabilised * Shares rise 7 pct (Adds CEO, updates share price) By Stine Jacobsen COPENHAGEN, Aug 15 (Reuters) - Shares in wind turbine maker Vestas jumped 7 percent on Wednesday after it reported forecast-beating orders and profit and said a steep decline in prices had stabilised. The wind power industry is entering a new phase with slower growth and higher pressure on prices as subsidies taper off and governments opt for more competitive contract tenders. Vestas said prices per megawatt had stabilised in the second quarter, albeit at a much lower level than last year, echoing recent statements from rivals such as Siemens Gamesa and General Electric. “Vestas’ shares have suffered from concerns over what could happen on pricing... If prices have now stabilised, then Vestas’ shares have taken more than enough beatings,” said Sydbank analyst Jacob Pedersen. Vestas’ order intake in the second quarter came with an average selling price of 0.71 million euros per megawatt, compared with the 0.73 million achieved in the first quarter. “It’s hard to predict what our competitors will do, but we take this a good trend going forward,” said Chief Executive Anders Runevad, adding that it was the third consecutive quarter with fairly stable prices. Vestas also launched a 200 million euro ($227 million) share buy-back scheme to run over the next four months. Its shares traded up 5 percent at 0840 GMT as the positive comments overshadowed Vestas’ warning that tariffs stemming from U.S-China trade tensions would drive up prices of U.S. steel and imported components. Runevad said, based on current estimates, group production costs could increase by up to 1.5 percent in 2019 due to trade tariffs. However, he underlined it was still hard to predict the exact impact. Vestas now expects revenue of 10-10.5 billion euros this year from a previous forecast of 10-11 billion and an EBIT margin before special items of 9.5-10.5 percent versus 9-11 percent previously. Siemens Gamesa said last month that trade tensions would drive up costs while it kept its target for an EBIT margin of 7-8 percent this year. Vestas’ new turbine orders rose 43 percent to 3,807 megawatt (MW) between April and June, compared to the 3,165 MW expected by analysts in a Reuters poll, sending its order backlog to an all-time high. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 259 million euros came in above the 204 million expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. Reporting by Stine Jacobsen, additional reporting by Jacob

2018-08-15,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A glacial lake in China’s far western region of Xinjiang has burst though there were no casualties, state media said, while the environment group Greenpeace warned on Wednesday that such events have increased because of rising temperatures. The glacial lake burst last Friday releasing floodwater into the remote Yarkant River Basin, state media reported. “As temperatures climb, glacial outbursts, flooding, and seasonal water shortages will only become more severe,” Greenpeace East Asia climate and energy campaigner Liu Junyan said in a statement. The group cited research from the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources at the Chinese Academy of Science as saying the frequency of glacial outbursts in the Yarkant River Basin has gone up since the 1980s because of a rise in average annual temperatures and precipitation. “Climate change has caused the acceleration of glacier mass loss and an increase in glacial runoff in arid regions of northwest China and has led to more frequent glacial floods and debris flows,” Greenpeace quoted Shen Yongping, a research fellow at the institute, as saying.

Russia has suspended gas purchases from Turkmenistan for many years while Ashgabat supplied China with its fuel. Iran and four ex-Soviet nations, including Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, agreed in principle on Sunday how to divide up the potentially huge oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea, paving the way for more energy exploration and pipeline projects. One of those is a pipeline across the Caspian which could ship natural gas from Turkmenistan to Azerbaijan and then further to Europe, allowing it to compete with Russia in the Western markets.

2018-08-15,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh will attend a meeting of an OPEC/non-OPEC committee that monitors output compliance, known as the JMMC, in Algeria in September, the Iranian Students’ News Agency (ISNA) reported on Wednesday. Zanganeh’s goal in attending the meeting is to maintain Iran’s oil market share, ISNA reported. The meeting is scheduled to take place six weeks before U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil industry are due to take effect. After months of underproduction, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed with Russia and other oil-producing allies to raise output from July by returning to 100 percent compliance with previously decided cuts. That would mean an output increase of roughly 1 million barrels per day. Last week, Zanganeh sent a “letter of complaint” to his United Arab Emirates counterpart after noticing that some OPEC members were trying to adjust output, according to SHANA, the news site of the Iranian oil ministry. Zanganeh told UAE Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei, who holds the OPEC presidency in 2018, that the JMMC should not distribute output increases among other producers. Zanganeh’s comments underline the still-simmering tensions after OPEC’s June meeting. Saudi Arabia said the deal allowed countries able to produce more to meet the group’s overall conformity level, meaning some members, such as itself, could make up for shortfalls elsewhere. Iran, which faces U.S. sanctions, disagreed and criticized Saudi plans to boost output above targeted levels. The JMMC is chaired by Saudi Arabia and is due to meet next on Sept. 23 in Algeria. Iran is not on the committee, which also includes Russia, the UAE, Oman, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela.

2018-08-15,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The northern Chinese province of Hebei will cut smog by a further 15 percent by 2020 and aims to make almost half its groundwater supplies safe for human use by the end of the decade, according to a policy document released late on Tuesday. The smog-prone province, which surrounds the capital Beijing, has been on the frontline of China’s efforts to reverse the consequences of more than three decades of untrammelled economic growth.  The country’s biggest steel producing region has been taking action to raise emission standards, eliminate outdated production capacity and switch to cleaner forms of energy, as well as curb industrial output during pollution build-ups. According to guidelines issued by the provincial environmental protection agency, Hebei will aim to bring average concentrations of hazardous floating particles known as PM2.5 to 55 micrograms per cubic meter by 2020, down from 65 micrograms last year. China’s official urban air quality standard is 35 micrograms, but the World Health Organization recommends levels of no more than 10 micrograms. Hebei province said it would also cut the proportion of “below grade V” groundwater - water so polluted that it has lost all functionality - to less than 25.7 percent by 2020. The figure stood at 36.5 percent in 2016.  China grades its water into six bands using Roman numerals, with “grade I” the cleanest, and “below grade V” unusable even for irrigation and industry. Hebei said it would ensure that 48.7 percent is classified in grade I-III, meaning that it is fit for human consumption, up from around 46 percent in 2017. It also promised to make around 91 percent of its contaminated farmland safe for planting by the end of the decade, and make 20.7 percent of total land off-limits to development through a new “ecological red line” scheme. Six of China’s most polluted cities were in Hebei last year, and the province has been trying to develop new mechanisms to encourage them to clean up. In a separate notice on Tuesday, Hebei said the city of Hengshui was awarded 1 million yuan ($145,000) for improvements made in June, while Tangshan - China’s biggest steelmaking city - was fined the same amount after its air quality ranking fell during the month.     The money was distributed as part of a new ‘punishment and reward’ scheme that gives cash prizes to those cities at the top of the province’s monthly air quality rankings, while fining those at the bottom.

2018-08-15,"(Adds earnings details) SAO PAULO, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled power utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA on Tuesday said its second-quarter net profit soared when compared with the same period a year earlier, helped by increases in power prices. Eletrobras, as the company is known, reported in a securities filing net income of 2.832 billion reais ($732.50 million), up sharply from 344 million reais in the second quarter of 2017. The company said increases in the prices of power in several Brazilian states where it operates with power distribution subsidiaries boosted its quarterly earnings considerably. The increases have been authorized by the federal government, which is trying to improve the finances of many distribution companies that Eletrobras plans to sell to private investors in the coming months. Eletrobras said the tariff increase’s positive impact totaled 3.84 billion reais. The company also said that its results benefited from scrapping a provision worth 1.33 billion reais related to a possible cost with a duty the government of Pará state was willing to charge it. Eletrobras no longer believes it will have to pay that duty. The Brazilian government has the intention to sell a controlling stake in Eletrobras. The privatization process, however, has hardly advanced among criticism from politicians and unions who defend state control.

2018-08-15,"(Repeats column that ran on Tuesday, with no changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2P8CShp By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 14 (Reuters) - Cyclical indicators point to slower and more uneven growth in the global economy for the rest of this year and into 2019, which means the rise in oil consumption is likely to moderate, especially for distillates like diesel. Economic growth remains strong in the United States, but in much of the rest of the world clear signs of slackening momentum have emerged since the start of the year. (tmsnrt.rs/2P8CShp) Strong and synchronised global growth in 2017 has given way to a weaker and more varied picture in 2018 and 2019, which is likely to be less supportive for oil consumption and prices: * The OECD’s composite leading indicator, which covers the advanced economies plus China, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia and South Africa, peaked in January but has since fallen and slipped below trend in May and June. * World trade volume growth also peaked in January at almost 5.7 percent year-on-year but had nearly halved to less than 3 percent by May, according to the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis. * The new export orders component of JPMorgan’s global purchasing managers’ index peaked in January, showing the fastest increase for seven years, but has since fallen every month and showed only marginal growth in July. * South Korea’s KOSPI-100 share index, a useful proxy for global trade growth given the country’s heavy export orientation, peaked in January but has since fallen and hit a 15-month low this week. * Air freight volumes are still growing but more slowly than in 2017, reflecting the completion of the restocking cycle and a slowdown in manufacturing orders, according to the International Air Transport Association. These trade-oriented indicators are all correlated closely with one another and with the rate of expansion in the world economy - and they all tell a consistent story of slowing momentum outside the United States. The softening outlook for world trade has filtered through to the oil market, with Brent calendar spreads and spot prices peaking in April and May respectively. Medium-density refined fuels, including road diesel, marine gasoil and jet kerosene, are the most heavily geared to the growth of freight given their dominance in the road, rail, shipping and air cargo sectors. If global trade growth slows, consumption of mid-distillates will also decelerate — though the outlook for these fuels is complicated by the introduction of new marine fuel regulations at the start of 2020. So far, the main cyclical indicators point to a slackening of growth momentum rather than a more pronounced slowdown in the world economy. None of the major economic forecasters is predicting a recession later in 2018 or 2019. However, the number of risk factors in the global economy is multiplying, and includes: * Rising U.S. interest rates * Rising value of the U.S. dollar * Rising emerging market debt * Rising corporate leverage * Deteriorating credit quality * High oil prices (especially in non-dollar economies) * Rising tariffs and trade disputes * Increasing diplomatic uncertainty Cocktails of some or all of these risk factors have preceded most recent international economic crises in the last four decades, including the Latin American debt default (1982), Mexico’s debt default and the tequila crisis (1994), Thailand’s devaluation and the Southeast Asian financial crisis (1997) and Russia’s financial crisis (1998). Compounding the uncertainty, the outlook for fiscal, monetary and trade policies has become confused, with the world’s largest economies all trying to pursue inconsistent policies on tariffs and currency valuations. The United States is pursuing an expansionary fiscal policy combined with a restrictive monetary policy, causing the real exchange rate to appreciate, while simultaneously trying to reduce the external trade deficit with tariffs. Fiscal policy has turned strongly pro-cyclical even though the expansion is over nine years old, unemployment is at multi-decade lows, and inflation has accelerated to the fastest rate for more than six years. China has eased monetary policy and allowed its currency to depreciate since the start of the year to offset the impact of higher U.S. tariffs and counter a slowdown in its domestic economy. The currencies of the euro zone and the United Kingdom have also weakened, supporting flagging domestic growth but now creating problems with rising imported inflation. There is a significant possibility that global growth will experience either a mild or a deeper slowdown over the next 12-18 months. It is, of course, possible the current loss of momentum will turn out to be no more than a temporary soft patch, with growth accelerating again. On balance, however, the main leading indicators suggest the pace of economic expansion - and the outlook for growth in oil consumption - will continue slowing for at least the next six months.
