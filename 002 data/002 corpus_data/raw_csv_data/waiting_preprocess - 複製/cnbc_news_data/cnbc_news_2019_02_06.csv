2019-02-06,"SINGAPORE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday after U.S. crude inventories rose and as production levels in the country held at record levels, but OPEC-led supply cuts and Washington's sanctions against Venezuela supported markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.84 per barrel at 0247 GMT, down 17 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down by 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $62.43 per barrel. U.S. crude oil inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> climbed by 1.3 million barrels in the week that ended Feb. 1 to 447.21 million barrels, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Wednesday. Meanwhile, average weekly U.S. crude oil production remained at the record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) <C-OUT-T-EIA> it reached in late 2018. The United States is currently the world's largest oil producer, ahead of traditional top suppliers Russia and Saudi Arabia. Countering the rising U.S. crude output and inventories are voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's oil industry are expected to freeze the sales proceeds of 500,000 bpd of crude exports. ""The cumulative effect of OPEC-led output cuts along with additional U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's state oil company ... bolstered market sentiment,"" said Benjamin Lu of Singapore-based brokerage Phillip Futures in a note on Thursday. French Bank BNP Paribas cut its estimated average of 2019 prices for Brent to $68 per barrel and for WTI to $61 per barrel, both down by $8 from its previous outlook. ""We expect the oil price to rise in the first-half of 2019 on tightening supply conditions and decline in the second-half on weakening economic activity and an increase in U.S. crude exports to international markets,"" said French bank BNP Paribas.

2019-02-06,"The first U.S. oil shipments to China in months will reach their destinations just days from now, punctuating a pledge by President Donald Trump in December that China would begin buying more American products despite an ongoing trade battle. The shipments, which left ports in Texas in late December, are not a clear sign of U.S. victory, however. They are among a handful bound for China or points near it currently as a March negotiating deadline on a new trade deal draws near. And the amount of U.S. oil being shipped to China is well below what it was a year ago, when the trade war erupted.

2019-02-06,"Oil prices rose on Wednesday, boosted by signs of strong U.S. demand for distillate products and tightening global crude supply. But gains were capped by a rising U.S. dollar and ongoing concerns about a global economic slowdown. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled 35 cents higher at $54.01 a barrel on Wednesday, after posting a session low of $52.86. Benchmark Brent crude futures rose 64 cents, or 1 percent, to $62.62 a barrel around 2:25 p.m. EST. The benchmark earlier fell to a session low of $61.05 a barrel.  U.S. government data on Wednesday showed that domestic crude inventories rose by less than expected last week even as refineries hiked output. Stocks gained by 1.3 million barrels in the week ended Feb. 1, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 2.2 million barrels. Gasoline stocks increased by 513,000 barrels, less than anticipated, while distillate stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected drop by 2.3 million barrels. ""Basically it's a pretty supportive report,"" said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""That drop in distillates is probably enough to give the entire report a more bullish tilt. Market participants have already been focused on signs of tightening global crude supply after OPEC and allies began an agreement in January to cut output. The producers known as OPEC+ started cutting production by 1.2 million barrels per day from last month to avert a new supply glut, and OPEC has delivered almost three quarters of its pledged cuts already, a Reuters survey showed last week.
