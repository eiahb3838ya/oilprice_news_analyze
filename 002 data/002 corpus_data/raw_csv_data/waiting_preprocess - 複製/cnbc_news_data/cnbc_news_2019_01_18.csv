2019-01-18,"Six weeks after agreeing to slash production, major oil producers are finally giving investors some clarity on exactly how much crude they'll take off the market. OPEC on Friday released a table laying out production quotas for each of its 14 members and the 10 allied countries participating in the deal. The two dozen nations agreed last month to slash a combined 1.2 million barrels per day in order to prevent a repeat of the oil glut that caused crude prices to tank from 2014 to 2016. However, over the following weeks, international benchmark Brent crude prices fell another 18 percent. The continued slide reportedly prompted OPEC to urge oil producers to publicly release their production quotas to boost the market's confidence in the cuts. While oil prices have risen for the last three weeks, OPEC has nevertheless decided to publish the output levels under the deal, which runs through the first six months of 2019. The so-called OPEC+ alliance meets April 17-18 to assess the impact of the cuts. Here's how much each of the countries in the deal will endeavor to keep off the market: ",https://www.cnbc.com//2019/01/18/how-much-oil-each-opec-member-and-allied-nations-intend-to-cut-in-2019.html,,Here's exactly how much oil OPEC members and allied nations intend to cut in 2019
2019-01-18,"UBS is upgrading Chevron to buy, saying the oil and gas giant is positioned to weather a sudden drop in crude prices. The investment bank thinks shares of Chevron could rise as much as 21 percent based on its 12-month price target of $135. The stock popped $1.65, or 1.5 percent, to $113.61 on Friday. Oil prices plunged more than 40 percent from peak to trough in the final quarter of 2018. UBS says the volatility shows the value of a ""conservative"" and ""sustaining business and financial model"" embodied by Chevron. Despite a 12 percent drop in Chevron's stock price during the oil price pullback, ""we believe that that the intrinsic value of the shares is materially unaffected; that the financial and operating model of Chevron is explicitly constructed to cope with this type of volatility; and that absent a material and structural change in the oil market (which we don't believe is the case) the share price weakness offers an interesting entry point,"" UBS analyst Jon Rigby wrote in a research note on Friday. UBS highlights Chevron's ability to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments with Brent crude futures at $50 a barrel — about $12 below the current price. The bank says capital expenditures remain ""generous"" and Chevron's debt relative to equity is low compared to peers, giving the company the ability to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Chevron's asset portfolio is also ""enviable,"" in the bank's view. The start-up of liquefied natural gas projects will help the company generate cash, while it's ""industry-leading"" position in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale oil field, reduces risks. That gives Chevron time to consider investments in capital-intensive fuel refining facilities and offshore oil and gas projects.

2019-01-18,"Jan 18 (Reuters) - Canada's main stock index rose on Friday, set for its fourth straight weekly gain, as an increase in oil prices lifted shares of energy companies.

2019-01-18,"The level of crude output from the U.S. will once again be a major factor this year, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said its closely-watched report on Friday, with the energy giant on track to reaffirm its position as the world's leading crude producer. The IEA report comes shortly after OPEC and non-OPEC producers officially implemented a fresh round of supply cuts. Alongside Russia and nine other nations, top oil exporter Saudi Arabia struck a deal with the rest of OPEC in December to keep 1.2 million barrels per day (b/d) off the market from the start of January. ""While the other two giants voluntarily cut output, the U.S., already the biggest liquids supplier, will reinforce its leadership as the world's number one crude producer,"" the Paris-based IEA said Friday. ""By the middle of the year, U.S. crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either Saudi Arabia or Russia."" International benchmark Brent crude traded at around $61.69 Friday morning, up 0.8 percent, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) stood at $52.56, almost 1 percent higher. Brent crude has fallen almost 30 percent since climbing to a peak of $86.29 in early October last year, while WTI is down more than 31 percent over the same period. The collapse in oil prices was exacerbated by concerns about oversupply, as well as a stock market slump amid worries over rising U.S. interest rates. That prompted OPEC and non-OPEC producers to throttle back output at the start of 2019, in an effort to try to put a floor under falling oil prices.

2019-01-18,"Oil prices hit a roughly two-month high on Friday, rising with the stock market, on news that China has put forward a plan to eliminate its trade surplus with the United States. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Friday's session up $1.73, or 3.3 percent, at $53.80 per barrel, the best closing price since Nov 21. International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.50, or 2.5 percent, at $62.68 per barrel around 2:30 p.m. ET. Brent earlier rose as high as $63, its best intraday price since Dec. 7.  Both benchmarks are up about 4 percent this week, posting a third consecutive week of gains following a three-month collapse in oil prices. A plan floated by Beijing would see China ramp up purchases of U.S. goods over the next six years with the goal of reducing its trade surplus to zero by 2024. President Donald Trump has highlighted the U.S. trade deficit with foreign countries, and the offer could appeal to the protectionist commander-in-chief. However, U.S. trade negotiators — who aim to address issues like barriers to accessing the Chinese market and China's alleged theft of intellectual property — are skeptical of Beijing's offer, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the news. Earlier on Monday, markets got a boost from a Wall Street Journal report that Washington is considering removing tariffs on Chinese goods to calm investors and advance trade talks. Markets gave backs gains after the U.S. Treasury Department and United States Trade Representative denied that either agency has recommended the tactic. The ongoing trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies has raised concerns about slower global growth and weaker demand for fuel.
