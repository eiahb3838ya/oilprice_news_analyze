2019-01-25,"Jan 25 (Reuters) - Venezuela's oil exports to the United States remain the primary cash resource for its state-owned oil company, and efforts by the United States to cut off that revenue would likely force it to send crude to China, India or other Asian countries. U.S. refineries that depend on Venezuela's heavy crude would have even more trouble securing supplies as Canadian and Mexican crude are often not as discounted and are limited in availability. The United States has considered moves to cripple Venezuela's oil shipments, which account for nearly all of the country's exports, in response to the reelection of socialist President Nicolas Maduro, a vote that was widely viewed as a sham. However, it has not yet taken that step, nor has it elected to cut off supply of U.S. oil that goes to Mexico. Washington has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's head of state. Guaido is considering naming a board to state-run PDVSA's U.S. subsidiary, Citgo Petroleum, in a gambit to generate revenue for the opposition. Venezuela, on average, exported about 500,000 barrels of crude a day to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. Energy Department data. The U.S. share of its exports has declined in recent years, with more shipments going to Russia and China. 1/8GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to the United States: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S4YIXB 3/8 Those deliveries are being made largely through oil-for-debt repayment structures as output from Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., known as PDVSA, has slumped to near 70-year lows during a nationwide economic crisis. Venezuela's output has been cut in half since 2016 to less than 1.2 million bpd, according to figures from OPEC secondary sources. Shipments to the United States account for about 75 percent of the cash Venezuela gets for crude shipments, according to a Barclays research note published last week. The primary importers of Venezuelan crude are Citgo, Valero Energy, and Chevron. The country could seek additional deals with Turkey, India or other Asian nations. Gas Energy, a Caracas-based consultancy, said in a report that India was the second-largest importer of Venezuelan crude in November. ""While Venezuela will be hard hit the first month, they will find some market for their crude,"" said Diego Moya Ocampos, principal Americas analyst in country risk at IHS Markit. 1/8GRAPHIC: Top U.S. importers of Venezuelan crude: https://tmsnrt.rs/2RYGk2E 3/8 Though the United States produces nearly 12 million barrels of oil a day, complex Gulf Coast refineries need heavier crude grades to produce diesel and other high-margin products, and cannot simply sub in light crude. Prices of heavier U.S. grades like Mars Sour <WTC-MRS>, an offshore medium U.S. crude, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude <WTC-HLS> have risen as buyers scramble for supply. Mars traded at a $7.10 premium to U.S. crude on Thursday, a five-year high, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, as bidders came into the market to secure supplies through the second quarter, traders said. ""It would make a tight market even tighter. If it happens, it would be an unambiguous headwind for refiners already struggling to find supplies,"" said Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, an energy consultancy in Bethesda, Maryland. 1/8GRAPHIC: Venezuelan crude exports to U.S. refiners: https://tmsnrt.rs/2S42EI5. 3/8 Traders said the United States may need to sell oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve to cover supply shortfalls as additional shipments are secured via Canada or Mexico. Sanctions could also include U.S. exports of petroleum products to Venezuela that are used for blending with Venezuelan heavy crude.

2019-01-25,"Russia came in as China's largest crude oil supplier in December, cementing the top spot for all of 2018 for a third year in a row ahead of rival Saudi Arabia, customs data showed on Friday. Imports from Russia reached 7.04 million tonnes, or 1.658 million barrels per day, in December, up 40 percent from 5.03 million tonnes a year earlier, according to the data from the General Administration of Customs. For the full year, Russian imports rose to 71.49 million tonnes, or 1.43 million bpd, up 19.7 percent from 59.7 million tonnes in 2017. Demand for Russian crude was supported by a rise in throughput by China's private refiners, who favour Russian grades such as ESPO, while geopolitical uncertainties also forced China to import less from countries such as Iran and Venezuela. Russian oil giant Rosneft has also marketed its ESPO grade more aggressively, signing new long term supply deals with state oil companies such as ChemChina and PetroChina. Saudi Arabia supplied China with 6.97 million tonnes in December, or 1.64 million bpd, up 48 percent from 4.71 million tonnes a year earlier. For 2018, OPEC's top supplier boosted shipments to China by 8.7 percent to 56.73 million tonnes, or 1.135 million bpd. That means Russia's lead over Saudi Arabia in supplying China almost doubled to 295,000 bpd in 2018 from 150,000 bpd a year earlier. U.S. shipments to China — which have been hit by a trade war between the two countries — came in at zero in December. Imports for 2018 were up 24.8 percent from 2017 at 245,616 bpd. Chinese oil trader Unipec plans to resume U.S. crude shipments to China by March, Reuters reported in December.

2019-01-25,"Oil prices rose on Friday as political turmoil in Venezuela threatened to tighten crude supply, but concerns over surging U.S. fuel stocks and global economic woes weighed on sentiment. The United States signaled on Thursday it may impose sanctions on Venezuelan exports after recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president this week, prompting President Nicholas Maduro to cut ties with Washington. But the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and broader gloom over world economic growth put a check on prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Friday's session 56 cents, or 1.1 percent, higher at $53.69 per barrel. WTI fell about 0.2 percent for the week, the first weekly decline in four weeks.  Brent crude oil futures were up 61 cents, or 1 percent, at $61.70 a barrel around 2:20 p.m. ET. Brent has shed about 1.6 percent since Monday and was also on track for its first week of losses in four weeks. RBC Capital Markets predicted that U.S. sanctions could nearly double projected output shortfalls from Venezuela. ""Venezuelan production will decline by an additional 300,000-500,000 barrels per day this year, but such punitive measures could expand that outage by several hundred thousand barrels,"" it said. Still, some analysts said the possibility of immediate sanctions were unlikely. ""We view a blockade on Venezuelan imports as low probability and a last resort measure that is likely weeks if not months away should it materialize,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. ""The evolving situation in Venezuela appears capable of delaying our expected test of $50 support."" Global oil markets are still well supplied, however, thanks in part to a spike in U.S. output.
