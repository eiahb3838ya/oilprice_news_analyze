2019-01-11,"Stocks are taking a cue from volatile oil prices, where traders are looking for signs of a recession and other problems in the market, according to analysts. Crude futures and stocks have been trading in tandem throughout much of the last few months in part because both markets are concerned about the same macro factors: rising U.S. interest rates, the ongoing U.S.-China trade dispute and signs of slowing global economic growth. U.S. crude futures: 3-month performance  However, some strategists believe equities are actually following oil prices, which serve as a sort of recession barometer, since economic growth is closely tied to fuel demand. At the end of last year, the collapse in crude futures essentially amplified fears of Federal Reserve rate hikes, trade tensions and the pace of economic growth. ""Stocks were far less of a lead indicator and more of a concurrent indicator than they usually are,"" said Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG. ""Oil really got caught in the same geopolitical uncertainty downdraft."" Emanuel notes that stocks bottomed on Dec. 26 after U.S. crude hit a trough on Dec. 24. Since their intraday lows, benchmark oil prices are up about 22 percent, while the S&P 500 has bounced back about 10 percent. ""The price of oil is telling you there isn't going to be a recession. It's firming up. To me that's the feed through loop into equities,"" Emanuel said. S&P 500: 3-month performance  Oil prices are likely to head higher in 2019, in part because Saudi Arabia has backstopped the market on the supply side with significant output cuts, said Francisco Blanch, head of global commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But there is also now support on the demand side following commentary from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the central bank will be patient with future interest rate increases. ""With a shift in Fed policy direction approaching, we see an oil 'demand put' being triggered within the forecasting horizon,"" Blanch said in a research note Friday. ""In other words, we think that the global recession fears priced into oil markets during the Christmas period were overblown and see the Fed acting preemptively to deter a major global economic deceleration.""

2019-01-11,"In a part of the world better known for towering skyscrapers and oil than for its startup scene, Gulf Arab entrepreneurs might be seeing bright times ahead. That's according to Fadi Ghandour, executive chairman of Wamda Group, whose venture capital fund invests in tech companies all over the Middle East and North Africa. ""For years we've said there is an inverse relationship between how change happens on the regulatory environment and the price of oil -- the lower the price of oil, the faster the change process happens,"" Ghandour told CNBC's Hadley Gamble on Thursday, pointing to Arab Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates whose economies have historically been dependent on hydrocarbon revenues. Now that oil prices are dramatically down from their October highs, the veteran Middle East investor says the market moves ""will definitely be a blessing in disguise"" and in that it will force the development of sustainable, knowledge-based economies and jobs. He believes that startups founded five or more years ago are now reaching their maturity stage, meaning there will be more businesses scaling up in the next several years â€” if they can get the necessary support. ""These companies born somewhere around 2011, 2012, have raised much more money, they are growing much faster, the region is adopting mobile smartphone technology much faster, they are interacting much faster and at a much larger scale, specifically in Saudi Arabia,"" Ghandour said. ""This is the time when there is size, there is scale, and the big funds globally who don't want to take the risk early on, are going to be looking for entry into a market that they don't have much presence in."" He pointed to New York-based global equity firm General Atlantic's investment of $120 million in Dubai-based website Property Finder last November. The Middle East real estate platform was founded in 2007 and has been profitable since 2013. Investments in Middle East and North Africa (MENA)-based startups went up by 31 percent between 2017 and 2018 to $893 million, with 366 deals made, according to Magnitt, a regional data platform for investors. The database also found that more than 155 institutions invested in MENA startups in 2018, 30 percent of which were from outside the region and 47 percent of which had not previously invested in the region.

2019-01-11,"Oil prices fell about 2 percent on Friday amid worries about a global economic slowdown, but futures ended the week higher, keeping some gains from a week-long rally spurred by U.S.-China trade hopes. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Friday's session down $1, or 1.9 percent, at $51.59 a barrel. Brent crude futures fell $1.15, or 1.9 percent, to $60.53 a barrel, around 2:30 p.m. ET. Friday's pullback marked the end of a nine-day winning streak for crude futures, the best string of gains since January 2010 for WTI and April 2007 for Brent.   Still, both benchmarks posted their second week of gains, with WTI rising about 7.5 percent and Brent up 6 percent. Markets were supported earlier this week by hopes that an all-out trade war between Washington and Beijing might be averted. Three days of talks concluded on Wednesday with no concrete announcements, but higher-level discussions may convene later this month.
