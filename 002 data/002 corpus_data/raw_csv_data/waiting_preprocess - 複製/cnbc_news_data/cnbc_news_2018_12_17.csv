2018-12-17,"SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped over 1 percent on Tuesday, falling for a third straight session, as reports of inventory builds and forecasts of record shale output in the United States, currently the world's biggest producer, stoked worries about oversupply. Concerns around future oil demand amid weakening global economic growth and doubts over the impact of planned production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) were also pressuring prices, traders said. International benchmark Brent crude oil futures were at $58.90 per barrel at 0340 GMT, down 71 cents, or 1.2 percent, from their last close. Brent has fallen more than 4 percent in the past three sessions so far. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 60 cents, or 1.2 percent, at $49.27 per barrel. Both U.S. crude and Brent have shed more than 30 percent from early October amid swelling global inventories, with WTI currently trading at levels not seen since October 2017. ""OPEC is reducing production to attempt to rebalance. However, data from Cushing still shows an oversupply,"" said Hue Frame, portfolio manager at Frame Funds. ""This isn't being viewed favorably by the market, especially in combination with slow global growth."" Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, which is the delivery point for the WTI futures contract, rose by more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape on Monday. Meanwhile, oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to climb to 8.03 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Monday. ""Rising U.S. shale production levels along with a deceleration in global economic growth has threatened to offset OPEC+ efforts as markets weigh the potential of looser fundamentals,"" said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, an analyst at Singapore-based brokerage firm Phillip Futures. With oil prices now falling, unprofitable shale producers will eventually stop operating and cut supply, but that will take some time, analysts said. Supply curbs agreed by OPEC and its Russia-led allies might not bring about the desired results as U.S. output goes on increasing and as Iran keeps pumping out more oil, analysts said. The cuts are also coming from currently high production. Oil output from Russia has been at a record-high of 11.42 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in December. ""The strength of OPEC+ cuts will be weighed against Iranian production levels in lieu of U.S. waivers till Q2 2019,"" analyst Lu Jiaxuan said. ""Market confidence remains extremely delicate amidst looming economic uncertainties as investors contemplate on weaker fuel demand beyond 2018."" China's industrial output in November rose the least in nearly three years as the world's second-largest economy lost further momentum.

2018-12-17,"SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell 1 percent on Tuesday after slipping below $50 a barrel in the previous session, with reports of a big climb in U.S. inventories and forecasts of record shale output stoking worries about oversupply. Concerns around future oil demand amid weakening global economic growth and doubts on the impact of planned OPEC-led production cuts were also hurting prices, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $49.35 per barrel at 0035 GMT, down 1.06 percent, or 53 cents, from their last settlement. U.S. crude prices have tumbled more than 35 percent since early October and are currently at levels not seen since October 2017. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. ""Crude oil prices were lower amid fears of weaker demand pushing inventories higher in the United States,"" ANZ Bank said on Tuesday. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to surpass 8 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose by more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape on Monday. ""Investors also remained concerned that OPEC will struggle to keep to its agreement to reduce output. This is likely to see prices remain under pressure until there is evidence that output is being cut,"" ANZ Bank said in a note. Supply curbs agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies might not bring about the desired results as U.S. output goes on increasing and as Iran keeps pumping out more oil, analysts said. Fueling those doubts, Russian oil output has been at a record-high of 11.42 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in December. ""There remains high suspicion as to what extent Russia will fill their commitment,"" said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. ""But enveloping supply concerns is the increasing likelihood of a protracted economic downturn in China that continues to stoke fears of demand slowdown,"" Innes added. China's November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy lost further momentum. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates again at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, impacting the dollar, which in turn may usher a major move in oil prices, analysts said.

2018-12-17,"NEW YORK, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2 percent on Monday, with U.S. crude tumbling below $50 a barrel, on signs of oversupply in the United States and as investor concern over global economic growth and fuel demand grows. Brent crude oil fell 67 cents, or 1.11 percent, to settle at $59.61 a barrel after dropping to a session low of $58.83 a barrel. U.S. crude dropped $1.32, or 2.58 percent, to end the session at $49.88 a barrel and tumbled to a low of $49.09 a barrel. Benchmark U.S. crude futures settled below $50 for the first time since October 2017. U.S. crude futures fell after inventories at the storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose by more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Traders and market participants closely watch supplies at the hub because it is the delivery point for the futures contract and underpins nearly all other regional crude grades. ""The Cushing number came in higher than anticipated. ... It's definitely pointing to the concern that there's more supply and demand is weakening,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""A lot of the shale producers can't make money where prices are right now, let alone below $50, so we're going to see a cutback in some of the production estimates, but it takes time for that to happen .... right now we're definitely following the continued weakness in momentum."" Increasing concerns about weakening growth in major markets such as China and Europe have also dampened the mood in oil and other asset classes. Broad stock market declines in Europe and the United States on Monday dragged equity markets lower around the world, adding to a sell-off that has sent global shares near 17-month lows. Both U.S. crude and Brent crude benchmarks fell more than 30 percent from early October through the end of November as the supply glut inflated global inventories. But they have stabilised over the last three weeks, trading within fairly narrow ranges as oil producers promised to cut production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies have agreed to reduce output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from January, in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. United Arab Emirates energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei told reporters in Dubai on Monday that the oil market was correcting and he expected everyone to stick to the plan. Some investors doubt the planned cuts would be enough to rebalance markets, however. U.S. shale output is growing steadily, taking market share from the big Middle East oil producers in OPEC and making it harder for them to balance their budgets. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to surpass 8 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. As inventories at Cushing rise, front-month U.S. crude futures traded as much as 33 cents below the second month <CLc1-CLc2>, the widest level since October 2017. Russian oil output has been at a record high of 11.42 million barrels per day (bpd) in December so far, an industry source familiar with the data told Reuters. Chinese oil refinery throughput in November fell from October, suggesting an easing in oil demand, while the country's industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy continued to lose momentum.
