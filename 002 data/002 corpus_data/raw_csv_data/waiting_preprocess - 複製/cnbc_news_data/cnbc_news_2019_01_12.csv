2019-01-12,"While North American shale may be competition for OPEC members, some crude-exporting countries in the Arabian Gulf are simultaneously taking advantage of the commodity's ability to fuel lucrative investments beyond oil. For the United Arab Emirates' Musabbeh al-Kaabi, chief executive of Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Petroleum and Petrochemicals, the shale revolution has the made North American gas and petrochemicals industry very attractive, bringing competitively-priced gas feedstock to the market. The petrochemicals firm is a major component of Mubadala Investment Company, Abu Dhabi's state-owned holding company. It operates as a sovereign wealth fund with assets of more than $226 billion, and is aimed at diversifying the emirate's economy. ""We as an investor made big investments in the last 18 months, north of $12 billion dollars, and some of these big investments are happening in North America,"" al-Kaabi told CNBC's Hadley Gamble during the Atlantic Council Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi. This was for two simple reasons, the CEO said. ""It is a big market and it is enjoying a highly competitive feedstock. So we like the business in that part of the world because of these two reasons."" Feedstock refers to raw material, such as natural gas, used in petrochemical production. Gas dominate's the company's business, and al-Kaabi has previously highlighted North America as the focus of a strategic shift when it comes to petrochemicals thanks to the shale revolution.  ""Other parts of global energy I would say, the energy industry, the price would be set by the high cost producers going forward,"" al-Kaabi added. ""And who are the high cost producers nowadays? The shale producers. And we will keep monitoring what is happening in that part of the world.""

2019-01-12,"Oman's oil minister thinks President Donald Trump has given OPEC some undue flak. But echoing other Gulf ministers, Mohammed bin Hamad al-Rumhi stressed his desire to steer clear of political animosity with the American leader, appearing keen to give him the benefit of the doubt. ""Sometimes he hasn't been fair,"" al-Rumhi told CNBC's Hadley Gamble while at the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi. ""I'm sure he has good intention too, he thinks he is representing the people of the U.S. and he thinks this is the way to do it."" ""Nobody wants volatility, I am sure Trump doesn't want volatility, because volatility is difficult to manage,"" he said. Trump has spent months vocally criticizing the 14-member cartel for its management of oil output, urging the group to keep the taps open and oil prices low. ""OPEC is ripping us off,"" Trump said in a tweet last October. In December, OPEC members along with Russia reached an agreement to cut their crude production by 1.2 million barrels of oil per day from the market in order to stem the fall in prices, something that further drew Trump's ire. ""Unfortunately there are politics, but sometimes the politics forces people to go to the social media or to CNBC to present their case. And that is the reality of today,"" the minister said.
