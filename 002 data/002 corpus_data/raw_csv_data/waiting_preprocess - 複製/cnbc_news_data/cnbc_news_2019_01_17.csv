2019-01-17,"NEW YORK, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday, boosted by a rebound in U.S. equities, after earlier losses on fears about surging U.S. crude production and a weakening global economy. Brent crude oil futures were down 14 cents to 61.19 a barrel by 2:04 p.m. EST (1904 GMT). U.S. crude futures fell 32 cents to $52 a barrel. Earlier in the session, both benchmarks dropped about 2 percent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in its monthly market report cut its forecast for the average demand for its crude in 2019 to 30.83 million barrels per day, down 910,000 bpd from the 2018 average. OPEC, however, said it cut oil output sharply in December before a new accord to limit supply took effect, suggesting that producers have made a strong start to averting a glut in 2019 as a slowing economy curbs demand Saudi Arabia led the cuts of 751,000 bpd in December, the biggest month-on-month drop in almost two years. The group and its allies plan to meet on April 17-18 in Vienna to review the supply reduction deal that began in January. Even as the OPEC-led cuts reduce supplies, U.S. output surged close to 12 million bpd last week, and some traders and investors are concerned that growth in global supply this year will outpace demand. ""That's going to weigh on the market at least until we get some new information,"" including from OPEC, said Thomas Saal, senior vice president of INTL Hencorp Futures in Miami. Still, Saal said, investors had already expected increasing U.S. production and priced it into the market, which supported prices on Thursday. U.S. crude output has climbed by 2.4 million bpd since January 2018 and stockpiles of crude and refined products have risen sharply, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed. Wall Street's main indexes were slightly higher, helping to steady oil futures, which sometimes track equities. ""Today and tomorrow we're probably going to move in concert with equities,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Jim Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. ""Going forward, we should start getting a little better indication of Saudi production trends. I think that's going to be supportive to the market,"" Ritterbusch said. In response to the drop in price in the second half of last year, OPEC and non-members plan to cut production by a joint 1.2 million bpd this year. Oil is still about 20 percent above the lows reached in late December, but analysts said Brent has been trading in the low $60s and U.S. crude in the low $50s due to ongoing nervousness about relations between Washington and Beijing and China's economic outlook. ""Brent needs to move past $62 before we can talk about $65,"" BNP Paribas head of commodities Harry Tchilingurian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""From there, the door will be open to target $70, (if) we do not have negative news emerging around U.S.-China trade talks that caused high levels of angst and de-risking last December.""

2019-01-17,"OPEC slashed production in December, delivering a bullish signal to the market one month before the producer group officially began a fresh round of output cuts. Last month, OPEC struck a deal with Russia and nine other nations to keep 1.2 million barrels per day off the market starting in January. The so-called OPEC+ alliance is trying to prevent another price-crushing oil glut. The cost of crude collapsed in the final quarter of 2018, stirring memories of the punishing 2014-2016 downturn. The 14-nation OPEC got a jump on the agreement in December. Oil supplies from OPEC nations plunged by 751,000 barrels per day to nearly 31.6 million bpd, according to independent figures cited by OPEC in its monthly report. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia was the driving force behind the headline decline. The kingdom's output plunged by 468,000 bpd to just over 10.5 million bpd last month, independent figures show. Data supplied directly by Riyadh show a 450,000 bpd drop to slightly more than 10.6 million bpd.

2019-01-17,"LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. crude production neared an unprecedented 12 million barrels per day (bpd) amid worries about weakening demand, particularly in light of the trade dispute between the United States and China. Brent crude oil futures were down 44 cents at $60.88 a barrel by 1035 GMT, while U.S. crude futures fell by 53 cents to $51.78 a barrel. The price of oil has recovered by some 22 percent since hitting an 18-month low in late December, but investors appear loath to push crude much higher without evidence that relations between Washington and Beijing are improving, analysts said. ""Brent needs to move past $62 before we can talk about $65,"" BNP Paribas head of commodities Harry Tchilingurian told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""From there, the door will be open to target $70, (if) we do not have negative news emerging around U.S.-China trade talks that caused high levels of angst and de-risking last December."" Skyrocketing U.S. crude output, which neared a record 12 million bpd in early January, is fueling some of the concern among traders and investors that growth in global supply this year will outpace demand. In response to the drop in price in the second half of last year, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-members such as Russia and Oman will cut production by a joint 1.2 million bpd this year. U.S. output has soared by 2.4 million bpd since January 2018 and stockpiles of crude and refined products have risen sharply, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

2019-01-17,"SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday as U.S. crude production neared an unprecedented 12 million barrels per day (bpd) just as worries about weakening demand emerge. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.92 per barrel at 0752 GMT, down 39 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down 37 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $60.95 per barrel. American crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> reached a record 11.9 million bpd in the week ending Jan. 11, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, up from 11.7 million bpd last week, which was already the highest national output in the world. U.S. output has soared by 2.4 million bpd since January 2018, stoking fears of a supply glut. The EIA also said gasoline stockpiles climbed 7.5 million barrels last week, far exceeding analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.8 million-barrel gain. At 255.6 million barrels, gasoline stocks were at their highest weekly level since February, 2017. ""While (U.S. crude) inventories fell slightly more than expected, there was a large build in gasoline inventories. This stoked fears of weak demand in the U.S.,"" ANZ Bank said in a note. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 3.0 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.6 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. U.S. EXPORTS SURGE, OPEC CUTS Along with the surge in U.S. crude output, exports from the United States are also rising, hitting a record 3.2 million bpd by the end of last year. ""Crude oil exports from the U.S. have strongly increased during the last few years and the trend is expected to remain positive,"" shipping brokerage Banchero Costa said in a note. Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss Julius Baer, said ""the United States is moving forward towards energy independence and is set to become a petroleum net exporter next year thanks to rising shale output."" Soaring U.S. supply comes amid concerns over stuttering demand-growth due to a global economic slowdown, which some analysts believe will turn into a recession. To stem a lurking petroleum glut, the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producer Russia are leading efforts to cut supply. This has prevented crude prices from falling much lower despite softening demand and the surge in U.S. output.
