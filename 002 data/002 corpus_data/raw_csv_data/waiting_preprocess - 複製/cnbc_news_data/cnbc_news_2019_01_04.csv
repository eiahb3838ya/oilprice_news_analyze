2019-01-04,"NEW YORK, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Oil rose 2 percent on Friday after proposed trade talks between the United States and China eased some fears about a global economic slowdown, but gains were capped after the United States reported a sharp build in refined product inventories. Brent crude futures gained $1.10, or 2 percent, to $57.05 a barrel, by 11:33 a.m. EST (1633 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 94 cents to $48.03 a barrel, a 2 percent gain. After both benchmarks fell sharply last year, prices were on track for solid gains in the first week of 2019, despite recent data that added to concerns about a slowing global economy. Brent was set to increase 9.2 percent for the week, while WTI was on track to rise by nearly 6 percent. Prices pared gains on Friday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a sharp increase in product inventories as refiners ramped up utilization rates to 97.2 percent of capacity, the highest rate on record for this time of year. Gasoline stocks rose 6.9 million barrels last week, while distillate stockpiles grew 9.5 million barrels, the EIA said, compared with forecasts for builds under 2 million barrels. U.S. crude stockpiles were little changed. ""The big build in products has really caught everyone by surprise again,"" said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. ""The gasoline number was a little bit disappointing because demand was soft and we saw a big build in supply."" Oil drew support from comments by China's commerce ministry, which said Beijing would hold vice-ministerial trade talks with U.S. counterparts on Jan. 7-8. The news helped boost sentiment across riskier assets including the U.S. equity and oil markets. Washington and Beijing have been locked in a trade war for much of the past year, disrupting the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and hampering growth. China's services sector extended its expansion in December, a private survey showed on Friday, bucking a trend of downbeat economic data. ""Recent Chinese data is not confirming the doom-and-gloom trend,"" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. ""And you've got OPEC cutting."" A robust U.S. jobs report also added to broader market optimism. Despite some demand-side worries, oil has received support as supply cuts announced by the global coalition of producers known as OPEC+ kick in. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-members agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. OPEC's share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. A Reuters survey on Thursday found OPEC supply fell by 460,000 bpd in December. The focus now will be on whether producers deliver further curbs in January to implement the deal fully. Iraq said on Friday it was committed to the deal and would keep its oil production at 4.513 million bpd for the first half of 2019.

2019-01-04,"LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Oil rose to around $57 a barrel on Friday after China said it would hold trade talks with the United States and a survey showed China's services sector expanded in December, while signs of lower crude supply also lent support. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries cut crude output in December, a Reuters survey showed, and the American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a 4.5 million-barrel drop in crude inventories.

2019-01-04,"LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Oil rose towards $57 a barrel on Friday after China said it would hold talks with the United States to look for solutions to a trade dispute, while signs of lower crude supply also supported prices.

""Jitters over the health of the global economy look set to endure but are being lost on the oil market, at least for the time being,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM. ""That said, whether this bout of price strength can be sustained is far from certain."" Oil gained further support from the latest supply report from the API industry group, which said on Thursday that U.S. crude stocks fell by 4.5 million barrels last week. Both benchmarks are on track for solid gains in the first week of 2019 trading despite rising concerns that the China-U.S. trade war will lead to a global economic slowdown.

2019-01-04,"cuts@ SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose by more than 1 percent on Friday, shaking off earlier losses, after China said it would hold talks with the U.S. government on Jan. 7-8 to look for solutions to a trade dispute between the world's two biggest economies. Brent crude futures were at $56.60 per barrel at 0741 GMT, up 65 cents, or 1.2 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $47.61 per barrel, up 52 cents, or 1.1 percent. Both benchmarks are on track for solid gains in the first week of 2019 trading despite rising concerns that the Sino-American trade war will lead to a global economic slowdown. The firmer prices came after China's commerce ministry said it would hold vice-ministerial level trade talks with U.S. counterparts in Beijing on Jan. 7-8. The two nations have been locked in a trade war for much of the past year, disrupting the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and stoking fears of a global economic slowdown. Data for December from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday showed the broadest U.S. slowdown in growth in a decade. Leading economies in Asia and Europe have already reported a fall in manufacturing activity. U.S. bank Morgan Stanley said in a note following the release of the data that the weak data ""increased the downside risks to an already moderating global growth outlook."" Japan's MUFG bank said in its 2019 oil market outlook that ""on the demand side, oil has not been immune from the broad cross-asset sell-off as global growth concerns...mount downside pressure on oil demand"". OPEC CUTS Despite the turmoil, oil prices have received some support as supply cuts announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) kick in. OPEC-supply fell by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) between November and December, to 32.68 million bpd, a Reuters survey found on Thursday, although some of the fall were involuntary disruptions in Iran and Libya, which are exempt from cuts. ""Isolating the participating countries indicates their output would need to fall a further 940,000 bpd to be in adherence with their targets,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said. OPEC and non-members led by Russia - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed last December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 versus October 2018 levels to rein in an emerging fuel glut. The fuel surplus was in part depicted by light distillate fuel stocks at Singapore's refining hub climbing to a record 16.1 million barrels in by January. Considering the planned cuts versus ongoing increases in U.S. crude production, which hit a record 11.7 million bpd by late 2018, FGE said it expected Brent prices to range between $55-$60 per barrel in the first months of 2019. Some analysts doubt the OPEC+ group is able to support prices in the longer term, however. ""OPEC+ strategy for supporting prices over market share is not working, said MUFG bank. ""Not only are oil prices down nearly 40 percent since October (2018), they are in fact now below where they were when the group began their first iteration of output cuts back in January 2017,"" the Japanese bank said. MUFG said this was ""a clear indication"" that OPEC+'s interventionist strategy to support oil prices was not working.
