2019-02-07,"(Adds fourth-quarter details) Feb 7 (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp posted a 56 percent jump in the number of barrels of crude oil it processed per day during the fourth quarter and the U.S. refiner's margins got a boost from cheap Canadian oil. Marathon has been processing large amounts of Canadian crude at its refineries in the U.S. Midwest as transport bottlenecks have driven Canadian crude prices lower. Refiners like Marathon process crude into diesel, gasoline and other products. The company said refining and marketing margin per barrel of oil rose about 15 percent to $15.07 from a year earlier. Marathon's crude oil throughput came in at about 3 million barrels per day, up from 1.84 million bpd. Net income attributable to Marathon fell to $951 million, or $1.38 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $2.02 billion, or $4.13 per share, a year earlier. Last year, the company recorded a $1.5 billion gain related to the U.S. tax overhaul. Total revenue rose to $32.54 billion from $21.24 billion.

2019-02-07,"sanctions support@ SINGAPORE, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Thursday after U.S. crude inventories rose and the country's production held at record levels, but OPEC-led supply cuts and Washington's sanctions against Venezuela supported markets. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.82 per barrel at 0607 GMT, down 19 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures fell 25 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $62.44 per barrel. U.S. crude oil inventories <C-STK-T-EIA> climbed by 1.3 million barrels in the week that ended Feb. 1 to 447.21 million barrels, data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed on Wednesday. Meanwhile, average weekly U.S. crude oil production remained at the record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) <C-OUT-T-EIA> it reached in late 2018. The United States is currently the world's largest oil producer, ahead of traditional top suppliers Russia and Saudi Arabia. Countering the rising U.S. crude output and inventories are voluntary supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. ""The key supply story remains the ongoing OPEC production cuts,"" U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's oil industry are expected to freeze sales proceeds of Venezuelan crude exports to the United States. ""Around a third of Venezuela's exports head to the U.S. As such, we expect Venezuelan exports to quickly fall by 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to around 700,000 bpd,"" ANZ bank said on Thursday. ""The risks are rising that this political standoff will deepen the fall in output as funds dry up and mass defection of workers accelerates,"" it added. Washington said last week that after April 28 foreign companies will not be able to conduct business with PDVSA using the U.S. financial system, effectively banning them from paying in U.S. dollars. ""The ban ... dramatically ramps up the sanctions to a global level and could potentially result in a loss of most Venezuelan output,"" French bank Societe Generale said in a note published on Wednesday.

2019-02-07,"Venezuela is in the middle of a power struggle at the highest level, and that could mean trouble for its two biggest foreign allies: China and Russia. The socialist petrostate is home to the largest oil reserves on the planet, but endemic corruption has devastated its economy. Beijing and Moscow have helped the country stave off collapse by repeatedly extending financial lifelines — to the tune of tens of billions of dollars over the last decade.  For the most part, those oil-for-debt swaps were good for all parties involved. But that may be changing.

2019-02-07,"Oil prices tumbled on Thursday as the market confronted concerns that global demand growth would lag in the coming year. A rebound from late December lows seemed to stall amid worries that a trade war between the U.S. and China would continue, weighing on demand. The market also contended with the possibility that oil producers would not adhere strictly to cuts agreed to last year. Crude futures fell with the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average droppedmore than 250 points after a senor administration official told CNBC a meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping is highly unlikely to take place before a critical March deadline to avoid higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled $1.37 lower at $52.64 a barrel for a or 2.5 percent loss. International Brent crude oil futures fell $1.05 a barrel, or 1.7 percent, to $61.64 around 2:30 p.m. ET. ""The correction is stalled, mainly on concerns about demand growth,"" said Gene McGillian, director of Market Research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. ""There seems to be uncertainty about what is going to happen with the trade talks, with global economic growth and demand in the coming year,"" he said.  In particular, he said, the market is worried about whether demand is sufficient to absorb growing crude production from the U.S. ""Supply fundamentals have increasingly been turning supportive in recent weeks, but against this the market still worries about the yet-to-be-realized if at all impact on demand from weaker macroeconomic fundamentals,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Though the United States published robust jobs data last week, global markets remain nervous after China reported the lowest annual economic growth in nearly 30 years in January. That focuses yet more attention on the outcome of U.S.-China talks to end the trade war between the world's top two economies. The oil price also came under pressure as weekly data published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday showed an unwelcome increase in stocks of crude oil. A decline in OPEC production and a squeeze on supply from Iran and Venezuela because of U.S. sanctions have led many analysts to forecast that the market will be balanced in 2019. The oil price is showing a 20 percent gain so far this year. Price support is provided by supply cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to tighten the market.

2019-02-07,"In a bid to block Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from the country's lucrative oil business, opposition leader Juan Guaido will name a new governance board for the country's Citgo Petroleum, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. This comes after Guaido, supported by the U.S. President Donald Trump and several European nations, declared himself to be the country's interim president in January. The U.S. has since placed sanctions on Venezuelan oil to weaken Maduro's government and wrestle assets over to the opposition. In an interview with the Journal, Rubio said the new board — which he said will be named ""as early as today or tomorrow"" — will be backed by the U.S. as Citgo's controlling legal entity. ""We are aware that there may be new members elected to the Citgo Petroleum Corp. board of directors. In corporate governance, as with all matters, we will follow the laws of the United States,"" a company spokesman told the Journal in a statement. The Journal said it had yet to receive comment from Guaido's officials, the U.S. Treasury and the White House. The Commerce Department has declined to comment.
