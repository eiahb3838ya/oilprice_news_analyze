2019-01-07,"SINGAPORE, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday on hopes that U.S.-Chinese talks in Beijing would bring a halt to trade disputes between the world's biggest economies, while OPEC-led supply cuts tightened markets. International Brent crude futures were at $57.77 per barrel at 0113 GMT, up 44 cents, or 0.8 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $48.85 per barrel, up 33 cents, or 0.7 percent. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said late on Monday that Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"" as dozens of officials from the world's two largest economies held talks in a bid to end their trade dispute that has roiled global markets since last year. Asian stock markets rose as investors hope Washington and Beijing will reach some sort of agreement. Despite optimism around the talks in Beijing, some analysts warned that the relationship between Washington and Beijing remained on shaky grounds, and that tensions could flare up again soon. ""We remain concerned about the world's most important bilateral relationship,"" political risk consultancy Eurasia Group said in its 2019 outlook. ""The U.S. political establishment believes engagement with Beijing is no longer working, and it's embracing an openly confrontational approach ... (and) rising nationalist sentiment makes it unlikely that Beijing will ignore U.S. provocations,"" Eurasia Group said. Beyond politics, oil markets are being supported by supply cuts started late last year by a group of producers around the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as well as non-OPEC member Russia. ""Crude oil prices have benefited from OPEC production cuts and steadying equities markets,"" said Mithun Fernando, investment analyst at Australia's Rivkin Securities. Looming over the OPEC-led cuts, however, is a surge in U.S. oil supply, driven by a steep rise in onshore shale oil drilling and production. As a result, U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> rose by a whopping 2 million barrels per day (bpd) last year to a world record 11.7 million bpd. With drilling activity still high, most analysts expect U.S. oil production to rise further this year. Consultancy JBC Energy said it was likely that U.S. crude oil production was already ""significantly above 12 million bpd"" by early January.

2019-01-07,"Kemp@ (Repeats from JAN 7, no changes to text) LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are cautious on the outlook for oil prices, despite a slump at the end of last year, as fears about the global economy outweigh output cuts by OPEC and its allies. Fund managers cut bullish positions in Brent crude futures and options by 10 million barrels in the week to Dec. 31, exchange data published on Friday showed. Funds have cut their net long position in Brent to just 152 million barrels, down from almost 500 million at the end of September, and close to the lowest level since 2015. Portfolio managers' bullish long positions outnumbered bearish short ones by a margin of just 2.5 to 1, down from a ratio of more than 19 to 1 at the end of September (https://tmsnrt.rs/2SFtSlv). There are some signs the heavy liquidation of bullish positions between the start of October and early December has run its course, with Brent prices seeming to find a floor above $50 per barrel. But most fund managers have preferred to wait before taking new long positions until the outlook for the global economy and equity prices becomes clearer. DIESEL GLOOM Portfolio managers were even more bearish towards middle distillates such as diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, cutting their net long position in European gasoil by 9 million barrels. Net length in ICE gasoil was cut to just 2 million barrels, down from a recent high of 112 million barrels in early October. The ratio of long to short positions was cut to just 1:1, down from a peak of more than 30:1 less than three months ago, and the lowest for more than two years. Middle distillate consumption is heavily geared to freight transportation by ship, road, rail and aircraft, as well as manufacturing, mining and the farm sector. Distillates tend to be in short supply towards the end of the economic and oil price cycles as industrial activity heads towards a peak, helping put upward pressure on crude prices. Until recently, fears of cyclical shortages were exacerbated by the scheduled introduction of new regulations on shipping fuels, which are likely to boost distillate consumption from the start of 2020. But the loss of momentum in global trade growth since the middle of 2018, coupled with fears about a further slowdown or even recession in 2019, has transformed investor sentiment. Fears about a future shortage have been replaced by concern about a potential slowdown in consumption, compounding the downward pressure on petroleum prices.

2019-01-07,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday said oil prices did not and will not influence the Trump administration's response to the killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi. Pompeo's remarks, made in an interview with CNBC's Wilfred Frost, come three months after Saudi agents killed the Washington Post columnist in the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. In November, President Donald Trump declared the United States stands with Saudi Arabia, even though the CIA has reportedly concluded that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman played a role in the slaying. At the time, Trump linked his stance to Saudi Arabia's help taming oil prices, as well as its role countering Iran in the Middle East and its pledge to buy more American-made weapons. ""Saudi Arabia, if we broke with them, I think your oil prices would go through the roof. I've kept them down. They've helped me keep them down,"" Trump told reporters after issuing a statement spelling out his support for the Saudi government. One day later, Trump thanked Saudi Arabia for taking steps to lower oil prices and implored the kingdom to push them even lower. 
@realDonaldTrump: Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower!
 Asked whether low oil prices influenced the administration's response, and whether Trump might take a tougher stance if the Saudis let oil prices rise, Pompeo said, ""They're disconnected."" ""We've taken a very clear message to the world with respect to the murder of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Pompeo told CNBC. ""This was a heinous act. It's unacceptable. It's inconsistent with the way nations ought to behave around the world."" Concerned about rising gasoline costs, Trump called on Saudi Arabia and OPEC to pump more oil throughout 2018. Between June and November, Saudi Arabia sharply hiked oil production, helping to knock the cost of crude from a four-year high. In October, oil prices plunged, with U.S. crude falling from nearly $77 to about $54 a barrel when Trump issued the statement.  Two weeks after Trump issued the statement, the Saudis reached a deal to launch price-boosting production cuts with fellow OPEC members and allied oil producers, including Russia. The administration's response to Khashoggi's killing has drawn fire from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Last month, the Senate voted to halt U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia for the war in Yemen. Senators also voted unanimously to hold Crown Prince Mohammed responsible for Khashoggi's death. Pompeo on Monday defended the administration's stance, referring to its move to sanction 17 people linked to Khashoggi's death. ""We've told the Saudis that we've held Saudi citizens accountable for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi. We will continue to do so as new facts arise,"" Pompeo said. ""At the same time, we're going to continue to do the things that protect the American people, and that includes a deep and lasting relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.""

2019-01-07,"The outcome of trade talks between the United States and China this week will play a major role in determining whether oil prices can continue to rally, analysts tell CNBC. Oil prices have risen for six straight sessions, clawing back gains after falling to 1½-year lows last month. The cost of crude collapsed more than 40 percent between early October and late December on concerns about slowing economic growth and oversupply in the oil market.  Amrita Sen, chief oil analyst at research firm Energy Aspects, thinks crude futures have more room to run, but says the recovery is on shaky ground. ""I think as long as the global economy isn't collapsing, we should be able to climb a little bit higher, but it is going to be very fragile because the biggest, biggest uncertainty right now is the trade war going on between the U.S. and China,"" she told CNBC Europe's ""Squawk Box"" on Monday. U.S. and Chinese trade representatives are meeting Monday and Tuesday to negotiate a path forward in the nations' ongoing trade dispute. The two countries have slapped tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Additional tariffs threaten to weigh on global economic growth, and consequently, demand for oil and fuel. This comes at a time when forecasters have already warned that oil demand will grow more slowly than previously anticipated in 2019.

2019-01-07,"LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed for a fifth session in a row on Monday, rallying from December's 18-month low thanks to OPEC production cuts and more stable equity markets. Oil has gained nearly 12 percent since last Monday, its biggest week-on-week rally since early December 2016. Brent crude oil was up $1 at $58.06 a barrel by 1500 GMT, having touched a session high of $58.90. U.S. crude was up 88 cents at $48.84 a barrel. ""Momentum is coming back into the market from very depressed price levels,"" Petromatrix strategist Olivier Jakob said. ""We've had five consecutive days of price gains already, so what you have today is a continuation of that."" The oil prices are drawing support from an agreed supply cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, as well as some non-member countries such as Russia and Oman. OPEC oil supply fell in December by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 32.68 million bpd, a Reuters survey found last week, led by cuts from top exporter Saudi Arabia. The aim of the cuts is to rein in a surge in global supply, driven mostly by the United States, where production grew by nearly a fifth to over 11 million bpd in 2018. ""If compliance by OPEC and the allied non-OPEC countries is similarly high as in the agreement two years ago, the oil market is likely to be rebalanced during the first half year,"" Commerzbank said in a note. Record high crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> has also pushed up U.S. inventories, which rose by nearly 17 percent in 2018 to their highest in well over a year, according to weekly data by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Friday. More upbeat equity markets also offered support. ""When stock markets are strong oil usually follows suit,"" PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga said. Shares have risen on expectations that trade talks this week between the United States and China will ease a trade dispute. Disruptions to trade undermine prospects for economic growth and oil demand. Goldman Sachs said in a note it had downgraded its average Brent crude oil forecast for 2019 to $62.50 a barrel from $70 due to ""the strongest macro headwinds since 2015."" Societe Generale cut its 2019 oil price forecast for Brent by $9 to $64 a barrel and reduced its forecast for U.S. light crude by $9 to $57 a barrel.

2019-01-07,"Goldman Sachs downgraded its oil price forecasts for 2019, citing a surge in global production and surprisingly resilient U.S. shale growth. The investment bank now expects international benchmark Brent crude to average $62.50 a barrel this year, down from a previous forecast of $70. Meanwhile, U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is expected to average $55.50 in 2019, down from a prior estimate of $64.50, the investment bank said in a research note published Sunday. ""We expect that the oil market will balance at a lower marginal cost in 2019 given: higher inventory levels to start the year, the persistent beat in 2018 shale production growth amidst little observed cost inﬂation, weaker than previously expected demand growth expectations (even at our above consensus forecasts) and increased low-cost production capacity,"" analysts including Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie said.
