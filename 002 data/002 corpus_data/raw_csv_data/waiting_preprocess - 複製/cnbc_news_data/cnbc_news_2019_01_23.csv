2019-01-23,"A sudden escalation in long-burning tensions between the United States and Venezuela could have far-reaching ramifications in the oil market, where the Bolivarian Republic remains a significant player despite its plunging output. On Wednesday, the Trump administration announced it would back Venezuelan National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself the country's interim president earlier in the day. Shortly after President Donald Trump recognized Guaido, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro severed relations with the United States and gave U.S. diplomatic personnel 72 hours to leave the country. The latest development raises the prospect that the United States will expand sanctions to U.S.-Venezuelan energy trade, a move that would be potentially devastating to Venezuela. The nation has seen its oil production crater in recent years, depriving the socialist republic of its lifeblood energy revenue and exacerbating a devastating economic crisis. But the consequences could also ripple throughout the broader oil market and complicate OPEC's relationship with the United States. RBC Capital Markets is already forecasting an additional drop of 300,000 to 500,00 barrels a day from Venezuela in 2019. If the Trump administration pulls the trigger on energy sanctions, those declines could balloon to several hundred thousand more barrels, says Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC.

2019-01-23,"It ""infuriates"" CNBC's Jim Cramer to watch hedge funds take control of the stock market by making decisions based on a single variable: the price of oil. Oil prices, which are ""almost entirely hostage to the trade talks with China,"" declined on Wednesday, reflecting the notion that ""no news is bad news,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money."" But after the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged in the first hour of trading on some strong earnings reports, the fact that oil's morning reversal was able to drag the Dow and the S&P 500 lower rattled the longtime stock-picker. ""This is a rough environment for individual investors who prefer to own stocks, not rent them, because the hedge funds are in control,"" Cramer explained, adding that the morning's ""breathtaking"" decline was linked solely to the price of crude. ""This kind of action infuriates [me],"" he said. ""First off, 90 percent of the companies in the S&P 500 actually benefit from lower oil — their stocks should be going up, not down, when the price of crude drops. [...] It makes a mockery of everything investing is supposed to be about."" This obsession with oil prices can cause such dramatic market swings that it discourages regular, individual investors from buying stocks, the ""Mad Money"" host warned. ""But don't despair. Longer term, these day-to-day gyrations don't matter. Longer term, stocks behave a lot more rationally,"" he said. ""Cheaper oil helps everything from freight costs to plastic discretionary consumption. Most companies are going to be winners from lower oil prices, and their stocks will be winners, too."" Shorter term, though, no single investor can muster the buying power to beat the hedge funds, Cramer said. Instead, he suggested battling them ""over the long haul,"" where these near-term investment firms are ""at their weakest."" ""You can afford to take your time and pick at the stocks of high-quality companies that deliver amazing results,"" like the four ""standout"" earnings reports Wednesday morning from IBM, Procter & Gamble, United Technologies and Comcast, he said. Shares of all four companies have ""more room to run"" based on their quarterly results, which indicated strategic focus, organic growth, and encouraging prospects for innovation, he added. ""Bottom line? On a moment-to-moment basis, this market may be controlled by traders who only seem to care about the price of oil — it's why we sold off this morning [and] it's why we bounced later in the day,"" Cramer concluded. ""But, over the long haul, the earnings of individual companies do actually matter, which is why what we heard from IBM, from Procter & Gamble, United Technologies and Comcast was so encouraging for the future of these great American companies.""

2019-01-23,"President Donald Trump has blasted OPEC several times over the past year, but Hess CEO John Hess says the 14-nation producer group plays an important role in the oil market and deserves praise for stabilizing prices in recent years. OPEC forged an alliance with Russia and other oil producers in 2016 to end a punishing oil price downturn that bankrupted more than 100 U.S. drillers. The alliance, often called OPEC+, has capped production for much of the last two years in order to shrink a global crude glut and put a floor under oil prices. ""The secretary general of OPEC as well as OPEC members play a very important role in stabilizing markets for oil, so those efforts are to be recognized,"" Hess said during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on Wednesday. OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo, speaking at the same panel, said what OPEC+ has done is ""commendable"" and helped save U.S. producers. ""We have to continue to collaborate. It's one industry. It's a global industry, and I think our colleagues in the U.S. are on the same page with us and we will work together to exchange views,"" he said.

2019-01-23,"NEW YORK, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday, following most U.S. stock markets lower, on concerns about global economic weakness, forecasts for record U.S. shale production and declining U.S. gasoline prices. Brent futures were down 70 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $60.80 a barrel by 1:28 p.m. EST (1828 GMT), while the most active U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude contract for March was down 67 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $52.34. The S&P 500 Index turned negative on concerns about global economic weakness after rising about 0.7 percent earlier in the day. In addition to the stock market woes, analysts said falling U.S. gasoline prices and rising crude output in the United States was also pressuring the crude market. ""We are paying particular attention to weakening NYMEX crack spreads where an increasingly heavy gasoline market is providing a limiter on near term WTI gains,"" Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates in Chicago, said in a report. The crack spread between U.S. gasoline futures and WTI crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) <RBc1-CLc1> fell to $6.11 a barrel, its lowest since 2013. Market participants said they are looking ahead to the U.S. weekly petroleum inventories report, which is expected to show a third weekly drawdown in crude stocks, but gasoline inventories were forecast to build for the eighth straight week. The weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, is expected after the market settles on Wednesday, a day later than usual due to the U.S. Martin Luther King Jr holiday on Monday. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will be released on Thursday. The EIA said on Tuesday it expected shale output to rise to a record high in February. ""Rising oil output from the United States, together with the effects of the U.S.-China trade war and growing prospects of the United States hitting its debt ceiling"" were weighing on crude prices, said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Those bearish market factors offset several bullish influences from around the world, including production cuts led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and declining output from Iran and Venezuela. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself interim president on Wednesday, while hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans poured onto the streets to demand an end to the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro. The Trump administration said the United States could impose new sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector as soon as this week if the political situation there deteriorates further.
