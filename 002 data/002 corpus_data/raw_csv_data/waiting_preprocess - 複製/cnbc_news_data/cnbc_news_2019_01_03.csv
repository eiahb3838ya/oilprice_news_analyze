2019-01-03,"While gas prices have been falling, the cost of monthly car payments keeps climbing. During the third quarter of 2018, the average new car monthly payment accelerated to $530, with the average used car loan payment at $381. According to Experian Automotive data, both figures are at record highs. The average car loan is now just under $31,000. However, Experian says 20 percent of borrowers are taking out loans of $50,000 or more. ""If you`ve been out of the market for five or six years, then these numbers can be surprising,"" Melinda Zabritski, Experian's Director of Automotive Credit told CNBC's ""On the Money"" in a recent interview. ""And they`re certainly not going to go down."" The richer price tags haven't yet dissuaded consumers. Despite higher payments, larger vehicles including pickup trucks, SUVs and crossovers remain in high demand. Meanwhile, U.S. auto sales are on track to exceed 17 million vehicles for the fourth consecutive year.

2019-01-03,"Oil and gas business activity in Texas and neighboring states plunged in the fourth quarter, according to the Dallas Federal Reserve. The survey from the Fed's 11th District also showed company sentiment turned negative for the first time in nearly two years and executives don't expect much of an oil price recovery in 2019. The insight is from the Dallas Fed's latest quarterly Energy Survey, which comes on the heels of a nearly 40 percent plunge in U.S. crude oil prices to about $45 a barrel in the final quarter of 2018. The oil market has been hammered by fears of growing oversupply and slowing economic growth that could weigh on fuel demand. One of the key findings in the survey shows that oil executives think U.S. crude prices will end 2019 at $59.97 on average. That would mark a fairly moderate recovery -- U.S. trade in crude ended Thursday at $47.09.   The Fed's 11th District includes Texas, northern Louisiana and southern New Mexico and is home to the nation's top shale oil region, the Permian Basin. Rising output from the Permian has helped push U.S. production to all-time highs above 11.5 million barrels a day, making the United States the world's biggest producer. The Dallas Fed survey's business activity index, a broad measure of conditions impacting the region's energy firms, plummeted from 43.3 points in the third quarter to 2.3 points in the fourth quarter. That means activity was largely unchanged following 10 straight quarters of increased activity. The biggest driver of declining activity came from oilfield services firms, the companies that provide equipment and technical expertise to oil producers. An index that measures utilization of equipment by oilfield services fell from 43 points to just 1.6 points in the fourth quarter. A reading below zero means activity in the sector is shrinking. Oil and gas production fared better, but the survey still shows weaker growth in those sectors. The oil production index dropped by 5.7 points, while the natural gas production index moved 10.7 points lower. Sentiment also plunged into negative territory for the first time since the first quarter of 2016, when oil prices hit 12Â½-year lows. The broad company outlook index dropped by 57 points to stand at -10.2. The plunge was worse among oilfield services firms, with company outlook down 64 points to -17.2. The survey also shows companies are feeling less certain about the future. An index of uncertainty jumped 34 points to 42.

2019-01-03,"The oil market should prepare for a bullish surprise from OPEC in January, according to a former Saudi Aramco executive The 14-member oil producer group will likely deliver a deeper output cut in January than it promised last month, said Sadad al-Husseini, founder of Husseini Energy. Market analysts could see OPEC production fall by about 1 million barrels per day from October levels this month, Husseini said. Last month, OPEC agreed to take 800,000 bpd off the market. Pledges from 10 other producers aligned with OPEC, including Russia, brought total output cuts to 1.2 million bpd. ""It's working very well,"" Husseini told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Thursday. ""There's already been a significant drop in OPEC production and it's continuing on target to come down to about 32 [million] and 100,000 barrels in January."" OPEC pumped just under 33 million bpd in October, the month that serves as the benchmark for production cuts. If Husseini's forecast is correct and OPEC pumps roughly 32.1 million bpd in January, it would equal a reduction of 876,000 bpd. But Husseini said it's possible that OPEC cuts more than 1 million bpd by the end of January, and the group could potentially throttle back output by nearly 1.2 million bpd, essentially doing the work of its allies for them. Husseini is former executive vice president of exploration and production operations at Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company Aramco. Saudi Arabia is OPEC's top oil producer and the world's biggest crude exporter. There are already signs that OPEC will over deliver in January, the month its production deal begins. Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih said last month that Saudi Arabia will pump about 10.2 million bpd in January, down from nearly 11.1 million bpd in November, according to the kingdom's figures.
