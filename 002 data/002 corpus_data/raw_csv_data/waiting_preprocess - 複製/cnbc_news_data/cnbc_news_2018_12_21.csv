2018-12-21,"The oil market will be a tale of two halves in 2019, according to Wall Street forecasters. Oil analysts see prices recovering in the first six months of 2019, following a sell-off that has slashed the cost of crude by about 40 percent since October. But in the back half of the year, commodity watchers anticipate new headwinds for the oil market. The upshot is Wall Street expects a moderate recovery for oil in 2019. Investment banks see Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, averaging about $68-$73 a barrel next year. Forecasts for U.S. crude mostly fall in a range between $59-$66 a barrel.

2018-12-21,"(Adds Permian rig count and analysts estimates) Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms added oil rigs for the first time in the past three weeks despite sharp declines in crude futures prices to their lowest since the summer of 2017. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Dec. 21, bringing the total count to 883, General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>. This was the biggest weekly gain in rig numbers since early November. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country's biggest shale oil formation. Active units there held steady this week at 486, the lowest since early October. Drillers added 2 rigs in the Niobrara shale in Colorado and Wyoming, bringing the total there up to 30, the most since Sept. 2017, and three rigs in Williston in North Dakota and Montana, bringing the total up to 56. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 747 rigs were active as energy companies have spent more to capture higher prices. U.S. crude futures were trading around $46 a barrel on Friday, down about 10 percent for the week, as global oversupply kept buyers away from the market ahead of the end of year holidays. Earlier Friday, the contract fell to its lowest since July 2017. Crude futures were trading around $49 a barrel for calendar 2019 and $50 for calendar 2020. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 23 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $88.9 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,031. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track for the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas.

2018-12-21,"NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017 on Friday, heading for losses of nearly 11 percent in a week, as global oversupply kept buyers away from the market ahead of holidays over the next two weeks. Crude has lost ground along with major equity markets as investors fret about the strength of the global economy heading into next year. The prospect of a possible government shutdown in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, added to investors' worries. Oil markets have pulled back amid concerns about oversupply, despite planned production cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. ""OPEC folks are not doing a good job of convincing the international oil community that they are going to be a strong advocate of their supply cut program,"" said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. Falls were exaggerated by thin trade and risk aversion ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, traders said. Brent crude fell 35 cents a barrel to $54.00 by 11:56 EDT (1656 GMT) after earlier touching $52.79 a barrel, its weakest since September 2017. U.S. light crude oil was flat at $45.88 a barrel, after earlier touching a session low of $45.13 a barrel. Both contracts are on track to fall 10.4 percent in the week. Since reaching multi-year highs at the beginning of October, both crude oil benchmarks have lost more than a third of their value in their steepest collapse for three years. The big oil producers in OPEC, dominated by Middle East Gulf states which mostly rely on energy exports, have agreed to reduce production to try to push up prices. But those output cuts - a reduction with Russia and other non-OPEC producers of 1.2 million bpd - do not kick in until next month, and meanwhile global inventories are filling up fast. ""The bear fest continues,"" said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. ""According to OPEC's own forecasts, global oil stocks will build by 500,000 bpd in the first half of 2019. This will compound a glut in OECD commercial oil stocks."" In an effort to show its commitment to reducing supply, OPEC will release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said in a letter reviewed by Reuters. To reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million bpd, the effective reduction for member countries was 3.02 percent, Barkindo said. That is higher than the initially discussed cuts of 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. Driving the sell-off has been sustained oversupply as the United States has emerged as the world's biggest crude producer thanks to the success of its shale industry. The United States now pumps 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, putting it ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia.

2018-12-21,"TORONTO, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar weakened to a 19-month low against its U.S. counterpart on Friday as stocks and the price of oil fell, offsetting data showing stronger than expected growth in the domestic economy. The Canadian economy expanded by 0.3 percent in October from September, pushed higher by strength in manufacturing, finance and insurance, Statistics Canada data indicated. Analysts had predicted an increase of 0.2 percent. Separate data from Statistics Canada showed that the value of Canadian retail trade rose by 0.3 percent in October from September, thanks largely to higher sales at motor vehicle dealers and gasoline stations. Stocks were pressured by increasing worries of slowing global growth and the threat of a U.S. government shutdown. The price of oil, one of Canada's major exports, extended its recent decline as global oversupply kept buyers away from the market ahead of the long holiday break. The price of U.S. crude was down 1.1 percent at $45.36 a barrel. At 8:58 a.m. (1358 GMT), the Canadian dollar was  trading 0.2 percent lower at 1.3539 to the greenback, or 73.86 U.S. cents. The currency touched its weakest level since May 2017 at 1.3564.

On Thursday, the 10-year yield hit its lowest intraday in one year at 1.944 percent.
