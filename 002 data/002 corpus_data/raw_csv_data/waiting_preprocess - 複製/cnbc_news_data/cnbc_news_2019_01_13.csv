2019-01-13,"SINGAPORE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil prices fell below $60 per barrel on Monday after Chinese data showed weakening imports and exports in the world's biggest trading nation. International Brent crude oil futures were at $59.78 per barrel at 0312 GMT, down 70 cents, or 1.2 percent from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 63 cents, or 1.2 percent, $50.96 a barrel. China's December exports fell by 4.4 percent from a year earlier, the biggest monthly drop in two years, official data showed on Monday, pointing to further weakening in the world's second-largest economy. Imports also contracted, falling 7.6 percent, the biggest decline since July 2016. Traders said the data pulled down crude oil futures and Asian stock amrkets alike, which had both posted modest gains earlier on Monday. Economic research firm TS Lombard said oil prices were capped as ""the world economy is now slowing ... limiting the scope for positive surprises in oil demand and hampering inventory reduction."" Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank, said ""the deterioration seen recently in forward-looking economic data from the U.S. to Europe and China"" meant that the upside for crude oil futures was likely limited to $64 per barrel for Brent and for $55 for WTI. The weak Chinese data countered general support that oil markets have been receiving since the start of the year from supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia. In the United States, drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Jan. 11, bringing the total count down to 873 <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a weekly report on Friday.

2019-01-13,"SINGAPORE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Monday, supported by ongoing supply cuts from producer club OPEC and Russia and by a drop in U.S. drilling activity. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.75 per barrel at 0040 GMT, up 27 cents, or 0.5 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $51.81 a barrel. Economic research firm TS Lombard said oil ""prices are likely to stabilize around current levels and quite possibly drift upwards,"" pointing to supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC allies, including Russia, as a fundamental driver. Drillers cut four oil rigs in the week to Jan. 11, bringing the total count down to 873 <RIG-OL-USA-BHI>, energy services firm Baker Hughes said in a weekly report on Friday. However, TS Lombard said oil prices may not rise much higher as ""the world economy is now slowing... limiting the scope for positive surprises in oil demand and hampering inventory reduction.""

2019-01-13,"OPEC Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo is largely optimistic over prospects of achieving a balanced oil market in 2019. But if one thing keeps him awake at night, it's the U.S.-China trade war's potential to disrupt growth in major Asian markets that import the highest proportion of the world's crude. ""We are concerned with the lingering trade disputes,"" Barkindo told CNBC's Hadley Gamble while at the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi Sunday. ""The synchronized growth that we have witnessed since the last global financial crisis that has taken this long was also due largely to the growth in international trade."" ""Any measures that may impact or constrain trade may likely impact on growth and by extension on demand for energy. At the moment, outside the U.S., China and India remain the brightest spots in terms of demand for energy. So you can imagine our concern of the lingering negotiations.""

2019-01-13,"Saudi Arabia plans to set up a $10 billion oil refinery in Pakistan's deepwater port of Gwadar, the Saudi energy minister said on Saturday, speaking at the Indian Ocean port that is being developed with the help of China.    Pakistan wants to attract investment and other financial support to tackle a soaring current account deficit caused partly by rising oil prices. Last year, Saudi Arabia offered Pakistan a $6 billion package that included help to finance crude imports.   ""Saudi Arabia wants to make Pakistan's economic development stable throughestablishing an oil refinery and partnership with Pakistan in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor,"" Saudi Energy Khalid al-Falih told reporters in Gwadar.   He said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman would visit Pakistan in February to sign the agreement. The minister added that Saudi Arabia would also invest in other sectors.    Beijing has pledged $60 billion as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) that involves building power stations, major highways, new and upgraded railways and higher capacity ports, to help turn Pakistan into a major overland route linking western China to the world.

2019-01-13,"Saudi Arabia's energy minister said Sunday he's positive OPEC and partnered nations will meet their production cut commitments to balance oil markets in 2019, despite what he described as a slower than anticipated pace by some. ""We've already done it, we've done enough,"" Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told CNBC on Sunday in Abu Dhabi, when asked what OPEC's largest producer would do to balance markets this year. ""Not only the kingdom but other countries, we've heard from the Emirates, I've talked repeatedly to my colleagues in Iraq, they've already taken action,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble. He then mentioned the performance of the largest non-OPEC producer that's partnered with the cartel on cuts: ""Russia has started, slower than I'd like, but they've started, and I am sure as they did as in 2017 they'll catch up and be a positive contributor to re-balancing the market."" OPEC members, along with several other countries, in December agreed on output cuts totaling 1.2 million barrels per day in order to stem a sinking market and support their own export-dependent economies. ""OPEC plus"" refers to the group's cooperation with the non-OPEC producers like Russia and other former Soviet states, as well as Mexico. Russia was more reluctant to cut its output, as its growth is heavily dependent on robust crude exports. Russia has initially let the Saudis shoulder the bulk of output cuts. The top OPEC ally, which in late 2016 began a cooperation agreement with Riyadh to stabilize oil prices, has often said that $60 per barrel is enough to meet its economic needs. Moscow in December said it would cut production by 50,000 to 60,000 barrels a day in January, while Saudi pledged a cut of 900,000 barrels.
