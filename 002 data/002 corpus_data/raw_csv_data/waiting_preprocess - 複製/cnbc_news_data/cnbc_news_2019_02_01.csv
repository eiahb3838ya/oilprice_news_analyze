Brent crude oil futures rose $1.91 a barrel, or 3.14 percent, to settle at $62.75 a barrel. The international benchmark notched a weekly gain of about 1.9 percent. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures ended the session at $55.26, up $1.47 a barrel or 2.73 percent and gained about 3 percent on the week. Prices climbed to session highs after General Electric Co's Baker Hughes energy services firm reported that U.S. energy firms cut the number of operating oil rigs for a fourth week in the past five, bringing the count to the lowest in eight months. Last week's data showed the rig count in January fell the most in a month since April 2016. Oil prices got a boost from Wall Street after surprisingly strong U.S. job growth data fed demand for equities. Washington imposed sanctions on Venezuela's Petróleos de Venezuela SA this week, keeping tankers stuck at ports. On Friday, the U.S. Treasury Department provided details. ""We are beginning to see the impact to crude supplies from the sanctions on Venezuela.

Results for the San Ramon, California, company reflected a 12.5-percent increase in oil and gas production as net output rose to 3.08 million bpd. Prices paid for its crude were $59 a barrel in the quarter, up from $57 a year earlier, the company said. It was ""a good beat overall,"" said Muhammed Ghulam, an analyst at Raymond James. ""Permian production growth remained strong, up 12 percent compared to the prior quarter and 84 percent year over year,"" he said. The Trump administration last month added new sanctions against imports from Venezuela, where Chevron is the last major U.S. oil company with production operations. Chevron continues to operate in Venezuela and believes it can maintain a ""good, stable operation"" there, Chief Executive Michael Wirth said Friday on a call with analysts. It has been able to replace Venezuelan crude usually processed at its Pascagoula, Mississippi refinery, he said. Chevron's fourth-quarter cash flow from operations rose to $9.2 billion from $8 billion a year earlier, reflecting the higher output and expense reduction. Investors have been pushing oil companies to restrain spending and increase returns to shareholders. Wirth forecast oil-equivalent production this year to grow between 4 percent and 7 percent, excluding asset sales. Chevron reported a profit of $3.7 billion, or $1.95 per share, compared with $3.11 billion, or $1.64 a share a year earlier. Analysts' mean forecast was $1.87 a share, according to Refinitiv. Its operating results compared to the year-ago period were lower because of the impact of U.S. tax reform a year ago. Profit from oil and gas exploration was $3.29 billion compared with $5.29 billion a year earlier; refining profit fell to $256 million compared with $1.2 billion a year ago. The company this week agreed to pay $350 million to buy a refinery in Pasadena, Texas, from Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, confirming a Reuters report from Monday . The acquisition is intended to process oil flowing from its West Texas shale fields. Shares were up 4 percent at $118.79 in midday trading, helping lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

2019-02-01,"Chevron reported quarterly profits that topped Wall Street's expectations, as the company's fossil fuel production hit an all-time high and executives forecast solid output gains for 2019. Shares of the company were up about 3 percent at roughly $118 a share on Friday. Chevron's production of oil and natural gas increased 12 percent to 3.1 million barrels per day of oil equivalent in the quarter, bolstered by new liquefied natural gas output from its Wheatstone project in Australia and surging supplies from its wells in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. For the full year, Chevron reported record production at 2.93 million barrels per day of oil equivalent. The company expects production to rise by another 4-7 percent this year, based on its forecast for $60 Brent crude oil prices. ""We expect positive production trends to continue in the fist quarter and throughout 2019,"" Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said during a conference call on Friday.  Last month, the company announced plans to spend $20 billion on development and exploration for 2019. The budget is focused on short-cycle projects, most of which are projected to generate cash within two years. Chevron's profit for the final quarter of 2018 jumped nearly 20 percent, to $3.73 billion, or $1.95 per share. Analysts had been expecting earnings of $1.87 per share, according to Refinitiv. The earnings beat was largely attributable to lower charges in the quarter due to tax impacts. Chevron faced just $419 million in charges last quarter, compared with $3.46 billion a year ago. The San Ramon, California-based oil major generated $42.35 billion in revenue, compared with the $46.13 billion forecast by Wall Street. Chevron's lower expenses offset a drop in earnings in its main business lines from a year ago. Profits in Chevron's upstream business producing oil and natural gas fell nearly 38 percent from the year ago period to $3.29 billion, also due to U.S. tax impacts. Earnings fell by a third to $859 million in Chevron's downstream unit, which focuses on refining and selling fuels like gasoline. Profits from international refining operations rose seven-fold to $603 million due to better margins and currency factors. That offset tax impacts that dragged on U.S. downstream earnings.

2019-02-01,"data@ SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices were steady on Friday, torn between hopes the United States and China could soon settle their trade disputes and new data raising fresh concerns over China's economic slowdown. International Brent crude oil futures were at $60.93 per barrel at 0712, 9 cents above their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $53.80 per barrel, virtually unchanged from their last settlement. Oil prices were supported as U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal. But crude markets were weighed down by a survey on Friday that showed China's factory activity shrank by the most in almost three years in January amid slumping orders, reinforcing fears a slowdown in the world's second-largest economy is deepening. Despite these concerns, traders said oil markets overall are being supported by supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which according to a Reuters poll pumped 30.98 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, down 890,000 bpd from December. In Venezuela, meanwhile, U.S. sanctions imposed on state oil firm PDVSA this week are keeping tankers stuck at ports and are expected to accelerate the supply drop in February. ""The latest U.S. sanctions could directly halt around 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Venezuelan exports to the U.S.,"" Citi bank said. Much Venezuelan crude oil is rated as heavy and requires the light petroleum naphtha, much of it supplied from the United States, for dilution before export to refineries. ""An additional 350,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil output is at risk due to the lack of U.S. dilutents, a result of the U.S. product exports ban with immediate effect,"" Citi said. Some relief especially to U.S. refiners may come in the form of Canadian heavy crude, despite infrastructure constraints between the two countries. ""The Alberta government announced it was increasing the oil production curtailment limit for February and March to 3.63 million bpd, which translates in restoring 75,000 bpd of the 325,000 bpd cut announced in December,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday.

2019-02-01,"Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Friday, after upbeat U.S. jobs data strengthened expectations for higher fuel demand and on signs that U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply. Futures extended gains after data showed U.S. energy firms this week cut the number of operating oil rigs for a fourth time in the past five weeks, as some drillers follow through on plans to spend less on new wells this year. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures ended Friday's session up $1.47, or 2.7 percent, at $55.26 a barrel. WTI posted a weekly gain of nearly 3 percent. Brent crude oil futures rose $1.91 a barrel, or 3.1 percent, to $62.75 a barrel around 2:30 p.m. EST. The international benchmark was on track for a weekly gain of about 2 percent.
