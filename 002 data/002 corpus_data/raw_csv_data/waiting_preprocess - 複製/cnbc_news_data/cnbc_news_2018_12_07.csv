2018-12-07,"NEW YORK, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices ended more than 2 percent higher on Friday after OPEC members and allies like Russia agreed to reduce output to drain global fuel inventories and support the market, but the gains were capped by concerns that the cuts would not offset growing production. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies, referred to as ""OPEC+,"" agreed to slash production by a combined 1.2 million barrels per day next year in a move to be reviewed at a meeting in April. This was larger than the minimum 1 million bpd that the market had expected, despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. OPEC will curb output by 800,000 bpd from January while non-OPEC allies contribute an additional 400,000 bpd of cuts, Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said after the organization concluded two days of talks in Vienna. The deal had hung in the balance for two days - first on fears that Russia would cut too little, and later on concerns that Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions, would receive no exemption and block the agreement. But after hours of talks, Iran gave OPEC the green light and Russia said it was ready to cut more. Russia gave a commitment to reduce output by 228,000 bpd from October levels of 11.4 million bpd, though it said the cuts would be gradual and take place over several months. Without cuts there would have been extreme downward pressure on the market, said John Paisie, executive vice president at Stratas Advisors, a consultancy. I think the Saudis tried to walk a tightrope: they want to make sure they maintain their relationship with the U.S., but they also need to make some cuts because they need a higher oil price to balance their budget."" Brent crude rose $1.61, or 2.7 percent, to settle at $61.67 a barrel. In early trading, the global benchmark had dropped below $60 when it looked as if the oil exporters might leave output targets unchanged. It then rallied to a session high of $63.73 on news of the agreement, before pulling back late in the session. U.S. crude rose $1.12, or 2.2 percent, to $52.61 a barrel, after earlier reaching a session high of $54.22. U.S. crude was up 3 percent on the week and Brent was 4.8 percent higher. Oil prices have plunged 30 percent since October as supply has surged and global demand growth has weakened. While the announcement of the cuts initially sent prices higher, some of the enthusiasm cooled, on fears that the cut would not absorb new output coming online in the United States that has made it the word's top producer. A 1.2 million-bpd cut, if implemented fully, ""should be enough to largely attenuate, but not eliminate, expected implied global inventory builds in the first half of next year, Harry Tchilinguirian, global oil strategist at BNP Paribas in London told the Reuters Global Oil Forum. Given supply due to come online, some analysts and market participants said the cut may not be sufficient to end oil's rout. Relative to how big this looming supply tsunami is, it is not nearly enough to prevent big inventory builds next year, said Robert McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group in Washington. President Trump and President Putin prevented OPEC+ from cutting by more, which was certainly needed to put a sturdy floor under prices. They are putting a fuzzy floor under prices. Trump has asked OPEC to keep prices low, pleading with the Saudis in twitter messages. Russia had initially balked at cutting production alongside OPEC.

2018-12-07,"LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) slumped this week to a six-month low, bucking the usual winter trend, as low demand persisted and supplies were boosted by deliveries from tankers that had been floating in north Asian waters for weeks. Spot prices for January delivery dropped a dollar to $8.80 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since May and below the levels of a year ago, for the first time in 2018. Prices for February delivery, although also weaker, dropped less and returned to contango with the January. Prices were estimated at around $9.00 to $9.30 per mmBtu for February. Low demand during the northern hemisphere winter and falling prices follow frantic buying by Asian utilities in September and October, filling up storage for the coming months. Nevertheless, some traders bet on continued high demand and began using laden LNG carriers as storage in waters off Singapore, Malaysia and South China, while others had cargoes waiting there for delivery slots to become free. When the market turned to backwardation last week, some of these traders sold the cargoes if only to gain from sky-high shipping rates by subleasing the newly freed-up tankers. Despite the low demand, several cargoes were sold in both Pacific and Atlantic basins, according to trade sources. U.S. producer ExxonMobil has sold a late December cargo from Australia's Gorgon plant on a delivered ex-ship (DES) basis, a trader said. Australia Pacific LNG (APLNG) sold a DES cargo for January below $9 per mmBtu, a shipping source said. Commodity trader Trafigura was marketing an early January cargo from Singapore this week, with one trader saying on Thursday the cargo was gone. Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company (Kufpec) is closing on Friday a tender for a free on board (FOB) cargo loading on Jan. 18-23 from Australia's Wheatstone plant. Japan's utility Kansai Electric was one of the few buyers this week, securing a late January cargo, a trader said. YAMAL SELLS TO EUROPE Russia's Novatek will sell the rest of its winter cargoes to Europe, having covered three positions in Asia -- a way of cutting down on shipping costs from Europe to Asia, a source with knowledge of the matter said. Novatek bought cargoes for December at a $1.60 premium to the Dutch gas hub benchmark price, a January cargo at a slight discount to the spot Asian LNG price and February cargo linked to Brent crude, the source said. Novatek is trying to sell two summer cargoes to Asia, with prices expected to be linked to oil, according to the source. In the Atlantic, Nigeria LNG sold an FOB cargo for December loading from its Bonny plant, after offering at least two at the end of November, several sources said. In the Middle East, Gunvor won an FOB tender from Abu Dhabi's state-owned ADNOC for loading between Dec. 26 and 28.

2018-12-07,"LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped more than 2 percent on Friday as Russia and the major Middle East producers in OPEC edged closer to an agreement to reduce output to try to drain inventories and support the market. Benchmark Brent crude oil rose $1.80 a barrel to a high of $61.86 before easing back to trade around $61.50 by 1335 GMT. In early trade, Brent had fallen below $60 when it looked as if oil exporters might be unable to agree a deal. U.S. light crude rose $1.19 to a high of $52.68 a barrel. Crude prices fell almost 3 percent on Thursday after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a meeting in Vienna with only a tentative deal to tackle weak oil prices. Talks with other producers were being held on Friday. Oil prices have plunged 30 percent since October as supply has surged and global demand growth has weakened. Iran appeared on Friday to be the main obstacle to an OPEC deal to cut output. OPEC sources said the group's de facto leader Saudi Arabia was opposed to exemptions in the deal demanded by Iran, which is under U.S. sanctions. But an OPEC source said that Iran had given a green light for OPEC to reduce its overall production by around 0.8 million barrels per day (bpd) from 2019. OPEC wants non-OPEC producers to contribute an additional 0.4 million bpd of cuts, the source said. OPEC is seeking support from non-OPEC Russia for supply cuts. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak returned to Vienna on Friday after discussing the issue with President Vladimir Putin. A Russian Energy Ministry source said Moscow was ready to contribute a cut of around 200,000 bpd. Analysts said a big cut would be needed to reverse recent price falls and Russia's contribution would be vital. ""Reversing the overwhelmingly bearish price sentiment will likely require a credible and cohesive message from the OPEC meeting,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said, adding that 1 million bpd would not be enough.

2018-12-07,"Stock markets have been gripped with fear this week over a deteriorating economic growth outlook and questions regarding the U.S.-China trade truce. While investors have typically pointed to the yields on different U.S. government bonds for warning signs on growth, the secondary market of corporate debt may also be a key to market directionality from here. During the first bout of stock market volatility in February, so-called investment grade and high-yield (or junk) bonds remained relatively resilient. However, in October and after the S&P 500 plunged 7 percent having its worst month since November 2008, credit markets also started exhibiting some signs of distress, underperforming equities.

2018-12-07,"Oil prices surged higher on Friday after OPEC, Russia and several other producers reached an agreement to cut output next year in order to boost the market. The new agreement comes at a time when the oil market is near the bottom of its worst price plunge since the 2008 financial crisis. Oil prices have dropped more than 30 percent from their highs in early October, hammered by concerns about oversupply, weakness in global markets and technical trading that exacerbated the slide. OPEC and its allies agreed to throttle back output by 1.2 million bpd during the first six months of 2019. The production cut is roughly in line with expectations heading into the meeting. Commodity watchers were expected the alliance to remove 1 million to 1.4 million bpd from the market. Brent crude, the international benchmark for oil prices, rose $1.61, or 2.7 percent, to $61.67 a barrel. Brent earlier rose more than 5 percent to $63.73.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures ended Friday's session up $1.12, or 2.2 percent, at $52.61 per barrel, off a session high of $54.22. Energy research firm Wood Mackenzie forecasts the production cut will tighten markets by the third quarter of 2019 and cause Brent to rise back above $70 a barrel. ""It would help producers contend with the strength of US supply growth in 2019 when we expect a year-on-year increase of 2.4 million b/d in non-OPEC production as US supply continues to gain sharply,"" said Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president of macro oils at Wood Mackenzie. The United States is pumping at all time highs near 11.7 million bpd, according to preliminary government figures. Last week, the country exported more oil and refined fuels than it imported for the first time in decades. Meanwhile, Russian production hit a post-Soviet era high at 11.4 million bpd this fall, and Saudi oil production rose to a record 11.1 million bpd in November. The supply surge from the world's top three oil producers is as forecasters warn oil demand growth will be softer than anticipated next year. OPEC members agreed on Friday to cut production by 800,000 bpd, while non-OPEC producers aim to shave 400,000 bpd off the market.

2018-12-07,"LONDON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Brent oil futures edged higher on Friday after Russia seemed likely to contribute a bigger output cut to an OPEC and non-OPEC deal, but Saudi Arabia voiced pessimism on whether an agreement could be reached as Iran insisted on an exemption. International Brent crude oil futures fell below $60 per barrel in early trade, but firmed to $60.17 a barrel by 1041 GMT, up 11 cents from the close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 18 cents at $51.3 per barrel. The slight recovery came after crude slumped by almost 3 percent the previous day, with the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ending a meeting at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria, on Thursday without announcing a decision to cut crude supply. Iran appeared on Friday to be the main obstacle for an OPEC deal to cut oil production, as the group's leader Saudi Arabia had yet to agree exemptions for sanctions-hit Tehran, two OPEC sources said. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said he was not confident a deal could be reached. OPEC also wants to get Russia on board with cuts. Russian energy minister Alexander Novak returned to Vienna on Friday after discussing OPEC with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow. Novak said on Friday Russia would seek an agreement with OPEC and non-OPEC producers and a Russian Energy Ministry source said Moscow was ready to contribute a cut of around 200,000 bpd, up from the initial 150,000 bpd previously floated. OPEC delegates have been pushing for Moscow to cut around 250,000 bpd. Analysts noted a big cut would be needed to reverse recent price falls and Russia's volume was key to this. ""Reversing the overwhelmingly bearish price sentiment will likely require a credible and cohesive message from the OPEC meeting,"" U.S. investment bank Jefferies said on Friday. ""Even a 1 million bpd cut could lead to a 'sell the news' reaction in the short term,"" Jefferies added. ""If no agreement is reached, oil prices have significant downside."" SUPPLY SURGE, PRICE PLUNGE Oil producers have been hit by a 30 percent plunge in crude prices since October, as supply surges just as the demand outlook weakens amid a global economic slowdown.

2018-12-07,"(Adds context, govt forecast as background) ALMATY, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Kazakhstan's central bank has trimmed its forecast for the country's oil output in 2019 and said it expects Brent crude oil to average $60 a barrel next year. The bank said in a statement on Friday that it expects the country to produce 91 million tonnes of oil next year, down from its previous estimate of 93 million tonnes, and taking into account scheduled maintenance work at oilfields. It also reduced its forecast for oil production this year to 90 million tonnes from 91 million tonnes. The new forecasts would still be above forecasts in the government's budget for oil production of 87 million tonnes this year and 88 million tonnes in 2019. Oil is the Central Asian nation's chief export and the bank said it expects the price of Brent crude oil to average $71.80 a barrel this year and $60 next year. Brent was trading at $60 a barrel on Friday. The central bank also cut its forecast for Kazakhstan's 2018 current account deficit to 1.2 percent of gross domestic product, from 2.3 percent in its previous outlook. However, it said it now expected the current account deficit to widen to 3.9 percent of GDP next year, from 3.8 percent in its previous forecast, due to lower oil prices and slower growth in oil production than it previously forecast.

2018-12-07,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 7 (Reuters) - China's Iranian oil imports are set to rebound in December after two state-owned refiners in the world's largest oil importer began using the nation's waiver from U.S. sanctions on Iran, according to industry sources and data on Refinitiv Eikon. Sinopec resumed Iran oil imports shortly after Tehran's biggest crude buyer received its waiver in November, while China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) will  restart lifting from its own Iranian production in December, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Reuters reported in November that China's waiver on U.S. sanctions allows it to buy 360,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil for 180 days. Top Chinese energy group CNPC, which has invested billions of dollars in Iranian oilfields, is ready to load its full share of production from December, said an oil executive with direct knowledge of CNPC's Iran activities. The executive, who asked not to be named, estimated CNPC will load at least two million barrels a month from December, doubling previous levels to help compensate for cuts made before sanctions on Iran's oil exports went into effect on Nov 5. Before the waivers had been announced, Sinopec, Asia's largest oil refiner, had planned to stop loading Iran oil in November, but resumed imports within days of getting the exemption, a second source said, also asking to remain unnamed. ""We continued lifting Iranian oil in November because we received the waiver,"" the second source said. Sinopec and CNPC will likely use up the 360,000 bpd of Iranian oil imports allowed to China under the waiver. Another source said Iranian oil is ""attractively priced"" versus rival supplies from the Middle East. For November and December, Iranian Heavy crude sold to Asia has been priced at $1.25 a barrel below Saudi's Arab Medium, a discount not seen since 2004. The source also said many Chinese refiners were geared towards processing Iranian crude grades. At 360,000 bpd, China's purchases would still be 45 percent less than the average 655,000 bpd imported during the January-September period. The rise in Iranian oil supply and surging production from the United States, Russia and OPEC countries has pulled down crude oil prices by almost a third since October. Ahead of the sanctions being implemented in early November, China's crude oil imports from Iran fell to 1.05 million tonnes (247,260 bpd) in October, the lowest since May 2010, Chinese customs data shows. Data from Refinitiv Eikon, however, shows that 2.77 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Chinese ports in October, including into bonded storage tanks in Dalian. million tonnes, the Eikon data showed. A total 2.51 million tonnes of Iranian crude were discharged into Dalian in October and November, according to the data. Other major Iranian oil buyers, including India, South Korea and Japan, are also increasing or resuming orders. It is still not clear whether Iran will be able to export much oil after the U.S. sanctions waivers expire around the start of May.

2018-12-07,"Major oil producers have reached a deal to cut oil production and boost the market, following two days of grueling negotiations and despite opposition from U.S. President Donald Trump. OPEC clinched the deal with allied oil-producing nations including Russia at its headquarters in Vienna, Austria on Friday.

The alliance will take 1.2 million barrels per day off the market for the first six months of 2019. The 15-member OPEC cartel has agreed to reduce its output by 800,000 bpd, while Russia and the allied producers will contribute a 400,000 bpd reduction.
