2019-01-30,"SINGAPORE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose for a third day on Thursday, pushed up by signs of lower imports into the United States as part of efforts by OPEC to tighten the market. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.58 per barrel at 0249 GMT, up 35 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last settlement. WTI closed up 1.7 percent on Wednesday, when prices touched their highest since Nov. 21 at $54.93 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures were up 52 cents, or 0.8 percent, at $62.17 per barrel. The price rise came after a report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) on Wednesday showed a drop in Saudi crude supply to the United States. ""Crude oil prices were stronger after signs emerged that OPEC cuts are impacting trade. EIA's weekly report showed that U.S. imports from Saudi Arabia fell by more than half from the previous week to 442,000 barrels per day (bpd). This is the second lowest level in weekly data going back to 2010,"" ANZ bank said. Saudi Arabia is the de-facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which together with some non-OPEC producers, including Russia, announced supply cuts late last year aimed at tightening the market and propping up prices. Despite these efforts, oil remains in ample supply, not least because of soaring U.S. crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA>, which jumped by more than 2 million bpd last year to a record 11.9 million bpd. This shows in high U.S. commercial crude oil stockpiles <C-STK-T-EIA>, which rose by 919,000 barrels in the week to Jan. 25, to 445.94 million barrels, EIA data showed. Stockpiles are 6.6 percent higher than a year ago.

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, as U.S. government data that showed signs of tightening supply and investors remained concerned about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry.

""While the slight increase may not appear monumental, we will reiterate that the build compared with 5-year average increases of about 7.5 million barrels.""

The sanctions aim to freeze sale proceeds from PDVSA's exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day of crude to the United States, the OPEC member's largest crude importer. Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions, while U.S. companies that buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work-arounds, seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third-party intermediaries, such as commodity merchants, can continue.

Crude inventories rose 919,000 barrels in the week to Jan. 25, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures fell by 145,000 barrels, EIA said. ""The report was supportive due to the much smaller-than-expected decline in crude oil inventories,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management. Crude oil futures extended gains after the data was released, with U.S. crude up 95 cents a barrel at $54.26 by 10:51 a.m. EST (1551 GMT). Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 1 million barrels per day. ""A precipitous drop in imports has helped stave off another big build to crude stocks,"" said Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. The decline in imports helped offset the impact of a substantial drop in refining activity, he said. Refinery crude runs fell by 586,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates fell by 2.8 percentage points to 90.1 percent of total capacity, the slowest rate of production since early November. After eight straight weeks of builds, gasoline stocks fell 2.2 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9 million-barrel gain.

2019-01-30,"Baghdad signed into law one of its largest-ever spending packages last week after months of gridlock. At $111.8 billion, the 2019 budget is a nearly 45 percent increase on the previous year's, featuring the highest deficit and second-highest spending volume in Iraq's history since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003. But despite desperate need for reconstruction funding after its devastating three-year war with the Islamic State, and with a crippled business sector beset by government corruption, Iraqi experts say the spending plan still fails to address the country's most urgent problems. ""The amount of waste and wrongly allocated money is outrageous,"" Abbas Kadhim, director of the Atlantic Council's Iraq Initiative, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""Despite being a very large spending plan, Iraq's new budget still suffers from the same problems. Too much of the budget goes to salaries… In the meantime, necessary spending on new infrastructure and reconstruction is not adequate."" Nearly half of the budget — $52 billion — will go to public sector salaries, pensions, and social security for government employees, a 15 percent spike from 2018. $27.8 billion will go to investments, with the deficit set to more than double to $23.1 billion, as reported by AFP.  Parliament members from the predominantly Sunni areas devastated by the anti-Islamic State (IS) campaign accuse the Shia-dominated government of not allocating sufficient funds to their areas' reconstruction.

2019-01-30,"economic outlook@ SINGAPORE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices held steady on Wednesday, supported by concerns about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry but pegged back by a darkening outlook for the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.30 per barrel at 0748 GMT, virtually unchanged from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were also flat, at $61.32 per barrel. Washington on Monday announced export sanctions against state-owned oil firm Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), limiting transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA. ""The sanctions so far have been mostly disruptive for refiners on the U.S. Gulf Coast, who are being forced to seek alternative heavy crude supplies, and have stepped up purchases from Canada,"" said Vandana Hari of Vanda Insights, an energy consultancy. The sanctions aim to freeze sale proceeds from PDVSA's exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to the United States. Although the move pushed up oil prices, markets appeared relatively relaxed as the sanctions only affect Venezuelan supply to the United States. ""The (Venezuelan) export volumes will not be eliminated from the market, but rather rerouted to other countries,"" said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, an analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy. With the United States dropping out as a customer for Venezuelan oil, she added that ""China and India ... will be able to pick up these oil volumes at great discounts."" Despite this, some analysts said non-U.S. oil trading firms with operations in the United States may still avoid dealing with Venezuelan oil. The Schork Report, a daily oil trading publication, said on Wednesday that many ""international oil traders ... have significant trading operations in the U.S. ... At least in the short-term, these traders will undoubtedly quit buying from Venezuela until such a time that they are assured that they are not running afoul of U.S. sanctions."" Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro told Russian state news agency RIA on Wednesday he is ready for talks with the opposition, with the participation of international mediators, although he ruled out snap elections the opposition is demanding. Globally, traders said the U.S. sanctions against Venezuela will have a limited impact, as markets remain well supplied. Even before the latest sanctions, Venezuela's economic turmoil had pulled down its crude oil production from a peak of around 2.5 million bpd before 2016 to little more than 1 million bpd now. U.S. crude oil output, by contrast, jumped by more than 2 million bpd in 2018 alone, to a record 11.9 million bpd. Beyond Venezuela, analysts pointed to economic weakness as countering supply-side troubles. ""Pulling (oil prices) in the opposite direction are heightened concerns about global growth, particularly that of China,"" said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark's Saxo Bank. Global economic growth is slowing amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, the world's two biggest economies.

RIA released his comments as the struggle for control of Venezuela intensified with the government preparing an investigation that could lead to the arrest of opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, who has called for new street protests.   Venezuela was plunged into political turmoil last week after the United States recognised Guaido, 35, as acting president, while Russia has continued to back Maduro.     ""I am ready to sit at the negotiation table with the opposition for us to talk for the benefit of Venezuela, for the sake of peace and its future,"" RIA quoted Maduro as saying.    Maduro made the comments in an interview to Russia's RIA news agency in Caracas released on Wednesday.     Asked about the possibility of third countries mediating in the standoff, Maduro was quoted as saying: ""There are several governments, organizations globally, which are demonstrating their sincere concern about what is happening in Venezuela, they have called for a dialogue.""

2019-01-30,"U.S. crude oil surged this month to post its best January performance on record, breaking a three-month losing streak that saw futures lose nearly half of their value. Crude futures have powered through a steady flow of weak economic data from China, the world's second biggest oil consumer, amid an ongoing trade dispute with Washington. The energy complex has been boosted by OPEC-led production cuts aimed at draining oversupply and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela, which threaten to disrupt global trade flows and bolster prices. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude prices ended Thursday's session down 44 cents at $53.79 a barrel, after hitting a two-month high at $55.37. WTI posted an 18.5 percent monthly gain, its biggest jump since April 2016 and its best January since the futures began trading in 1983. International benchmark Brent crude for March delivery rose 24 cents at $61.89 a barrel, finishing January up 15 percent, also the best monthly gain since April 2016. Brent's more heavily traded April contract was down 1 percent at $60.89 around 2:30 p.m. ET. Prices tumbled after U.S. Energy Information Administration reported U.S. oil production rose to an all-time high 11.9 million barrels per day in November, up from 11.5 million bpd in October. Preliminary weekly figures have long telegraphed the jump, confirmed by EIA's first monthly reading on Thursday.  The drop also came after President Donald Trump said he wants a big trade deal with China, but may not reach an agreement by March 1, the deadline to prevent a rise in tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars in goods. An increase in trade barriers threatens to exacerbate a slowdown in Chinese growth that could dent fuel demand. Negotiators from the two countries are meeting in Washington this week. ""I'm not sure President Trump's comments about the China situation were helpful to the bull case,"" said John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital. Kilduff said some traders may be taking profits after WTI jumped above $55 a barrel on Thursday for the first time in over two months. Despite the strong monthly performance, both benchmarks remain in bear market territory, with WTI down about 30 percent from its 52-week high in October. The crude price collapsed to roughly 18-month lows in the final quarter of 2018 on growing oversupply, weak demand signals and technical trading. At the end of the January rally, the oil market is on the cusp of another leg higher, according to Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA. ""A break through $55 in WTI and $65 in Brent would be a very bullish signal for these and could be the catalyst for more significant upside, with oil having stabilised over the last few weeks following the post-Christmas bounce,"" Erlam wrote in a briefing.
