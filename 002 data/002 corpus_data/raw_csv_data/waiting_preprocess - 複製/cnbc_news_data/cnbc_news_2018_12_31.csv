2018-12-31,"In a year when Wall Street predicted oil would surpass $100 for the first time in four years, the oil market instead experienced its worst annual loss since 2015. The oil market's sudden about-face in the fourth quarter has ended a 2½-year recovery for oil prices following the 2014-2016 downturn. Analysts expect oil prices to rebound next year, but the geopolitical risks that have weighed on the market throughout 2018 will remain a big variable in the new year. U.S. crude settled on Monday at $45.41 a barrel, ending the year down nearly 25 percent. At around $54 a barrel, international benchmark Brent crude is down 19.5 percent in 2018. The declines mark the first annual loss and the biggest yearly drop since 2015, when both contracts fell more than 30 percent.  Just three months ago, oil was trading at nearly four-year highs. While many analysts said the rally was unwarranted and warned a pullback was in the cards, few predicted the market would sell off so sharply. From peak to trough, U.S. crude has shed nearly half its value. With the benefit of hindsight, it's fairly easy to explain oil's plunge into a bear market. In May, the Trump administration restored sanctions on Iran, OPEC's third-biggest producer, raising concerns about a supply squeeze in the oil market. The following month, OPEC and a group of producers led by Russia abandoned their 2016 agreement to restrict supply. At the urging of Trump and oil customers, Saudi Arabia in particular turned on the taps, adding about 1 million barrels per day to the market between June and November.

2018-12-31,"(Updates prices) LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 2 percent on the final day of the year, mirroring gains in stock markets, but were on track for their first annual decline in three years as concerns of a persistent supply glut lingered. Hints of progress on a possible U.S.-China trade deal, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying he had a ""very good call"" with Chinese President Xi Jinping, helped bolster sentiment for oil. Brent crude futures were up 75 cents at $53.96 a barrel by 1357 GMT but rose over $1 to a high of $54.82 in earlier trade. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $45.90 a barrel, up 57 cents. In earlier trade, WTI was up over $1 at $46.53 a barrel. Both contracts are down more than a third this quarter, the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2014. For most of 2018, oil prices were on the rise, driven up by healthy demand and supply concerns, especially around the impact of renewed U.S. sanctions against major producer Iran, which were introduced in early November. Brent crude, seen as a global benchmark for oil prices, rose by almost a third between January and October, to a high of $86.74 per barrel. That was the highest level since late 2014, the start of a deep market slump amid bulging global oversupply, and many leading analysts and traders at the time said they expected crude to hit $100 per barrel again by the end of 2018. Instead, Brent prices have wiped out all of 2018's gains, plunging by almost 40 percent from the year's high, in what has been one of the steepest oil market sell-offs of the past decades. The slump came after Washington gave unexpectedly generous sanction waivers to Iran's biggest oil buyers and as concerns over a global economic slowdown amid the Sino-American trade dispute dented the outlook for oil demand. ""It was the bailout of Iran that really pricked the bubble that was the crude oil market,"" said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of energy consultancy Trifecta. ""For the immediate future, in the absence of anything new, the first pressure point for oil markets would come around May 2019 or a month or so earlier when the 'extensions of (Iran)waivers' would be discussed."" A Reuters poll showed a bearish 2019 outlook on Monday. A survey of 32 economists and analysts forecast an average Brent price of $69.13 a barrel next year, compared with $71.76 in 2018. The current downward pressure on oil prices should likely taper off from January, analysts said, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia start curbing production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). The market, however, might still remain under some pressure from swelling production in the United States, which has emerged as the world's biggest crude producer this year, pumping 11.6 million bpd. ""The key swing producers within OPEC+ do have meaningful spare capacity and are able to use it if they deem it necessary. That said, it is nonetheless a difficult tool to use correctly in a world where forecasters tend to routinely underestimate U.S. production by several hundred thousand barrels per day,"" JBC Energy consultancy said in a daily note.

The current downward pressure on oil prices should likely taper off from January, when OPEC-led supply cuts commence, analysts said.  Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, agreed to curb output by 1.2 million barrels per day starting in January to clear a supply overhang and prop up prices.  The group of producers ""may hold out on supplies longer than reasonable in order to see if they can effect a rally similar to September-October this year,"" Vijayakar said.  Brent hit a four-year high of $86.29 a barrel on Oct. 3 and has fallen about 38 percent since then.  While a gentle recovery is expected for prices in the first quarter 2019, the market might still remain under pressure from swelling production in the United States, which has emerged as the world's biggest crude producer this year.  U.S. shale production levels would be one of the primary drivers of crude markets going forward, said Benjamin Lu Jiaxuan, commodities analyst at Singapore-based brokerage firm Phillip Futures.  The market direction might get dictated if U.S. shale producers disregard bearish signals in oil prices and push for higher output next year, Jiaxuan said.  Energy companies in the United States added two oil drilling rigs in the week to Dec. 28, bringing the total count to 885. That was up from 747 a year ago.
