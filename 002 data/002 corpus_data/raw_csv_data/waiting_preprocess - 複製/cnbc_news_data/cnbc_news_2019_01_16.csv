2019-01-16,"SYDNEY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Thursday as U.S. crude production quickly approached an unprecedented 12 million barrels per day (bpd) just as worries about weakening demand emerge. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52 per barrel at 0140 GMT, down 31 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were down 34 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $60.98 per barrel. American crude oil production <C-OUT-T-EIA> reached a record 11.9 million bpd in the week ending Jan. 11, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday, up from 11.7 million bpd last week, which was already the highest national output in the world. U.S. output has soared by 2.4 million bpd since January 2018, stoking fears of a supply glut. The EIA also said gasoline stockpiles climbed 7.5 million barrels last week, far exceeding analyst expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.8 million-barrel gain. At 255.6 million barrels, gasoline stocks were at their highest weekly level since February, 2017. ""While (U.S. crude) inventories fell slightly more than expected, there was a large build in gasoline inventories. This stoked fears of weak demand in the U.S.,"" ANZ Bank said in a note. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 3.0 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.6 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. U.S. EXPORTS SURGE, OPEC CUTS Along with the surge in U.S. crude output, exports from the United States are also rising, hitting a record 3.2 million bpd by the end of last year. ""Crude oil exports from the U.S. have strongly increased during the last few years and the trend is expected to remain positive,"" shipping brokerage Banchero Costa said in a note. Norbert Ruecker, head of commodity research at Swiss Julius Baer, said ""the United States is moving forward towards energy independence and is set to become a petroleum net exporter next year thanks to rising shale output."" Soaring U.S. supply comes amid concerns over stuttering demand-growth due to a global economic slowdown, which some analysts believe will turn into a recession. To stem a lurking petroleum glut, the Middle East-dominated Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC producer Russia are leading efforts to cut supply. This has prevented crude prices from falling much lower despite softening demand and the surge in U.S. output.

2019-01-16,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Alberta's OPEC-style decision to force production cuts is benefiting oil companies with higher prices, but it is also pushing capital elsewhere and threatens to undermine booming crude-by-rail shipments. After Alberta cut 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) starting this month, the discount on Canadian heavy oil compared to benchmark U.S. crude oil shrank to less than $7 per barrel from more than $40 in October, providing relief for producers. But drilling activity has dropped sharply in the last year, hurting service providers, and the shrinking discount reduces incentive for shippers to move crude by rail, which is costlier than pipelines. Some producers have already decided to spend more in other provinces. ""As soon as we heard this curtailment was taking place, we shifted our capital to Saskatchewan from Alberta,"" said Grant Fagerheim, chief executive of light-oil producer Whitecap Resources Inc. Whitecap intends to spend about 80 percent of its C$450 million ($340 million) capex in Saskatchewan, up from its usual spending there of around 60 percent, Fagerheim said. Canada is the world's fourth-largest crude producer, but larger producers like the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia do not face Canada's obstacles in getting oil to market. Full pipelines and aggressive opposition to expanding the industry meant that even as Canada's production hit record levels last year, benefits of that boom were elusive. Alberta, which produces most of Canada's oil, last month ordered curtailments to drain bloated storage tanks and boost prices. Government intervention has provided a lifeline to producers that were selling barrels at a loss late last year and avoided an economic catastrophe for Canada. Bonterra Energy Corp produces less than 9,000 bpd, making it exempt from requirements to curb output, but it still benefits from higher prices, Chief Executive George Fink said. DRILLERS HIT Cenovus Energy Inc, which announced plans last year to increase shipments by rail, is seeing a ""very positive impact"" on cash flow due to small price discounts, senior vice president of downstream Keith Chiasson told Reuters. But with growth capital leaving Alberta and transportation problems unresolved, producers are feeling their way along in the early days of reckoning with almost unprecedented challenges. Across Canada, 184 rigs were working as of Jan. 11, down 92 rigs from a year earlier, according to Baker Hughes data. Companies that provide contract services for producers, such as drilling, are looking to the United States and Mexico, said Gary Mar, chief executive of the Petroleum Services Association of Canada. Government-ordered production cuts worsened an already grim situation for service companies, Mar said. Asked about the curtailment program's unintended consequences, an Alberta government spokesman noted that its strategy was focused on getting top dollar for its oil. ""There's too much at stake and we shouldn't be selling our products on the cheap,"" said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for Alberta's energy minister. But prices have improved so dramatically that shipping by rail - the backup plan for moving crude until new pipelines are built - makes less economic sense. The cost of shipping crude by rail to U.S. buyers is estimated around $15 to $20 per barrel, well above the current differential. Cenovus would not comment on whether the company is losing money on near-term rail shipments, but said they are scheduled to ramp up in the second quarter once new cars arrive. Devon Energy Corp was planning to move 20 percent of its Canadian heavy oil this year by rail, but the narrow differentials now make that an unlikely target, said Rob Dutton, Devon's senior vice president of Canadian operations. Devon currently moves less than 10 percent by train. ""It's more difficult now"" to reach that level, Dutton said in an interview. ""Forty-five days ago, I would have said, 'absolutely, for sure.""'

2019-01-16,"NEW YORK, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday after data showed growing U.S. refined product inventories and record crude production, which could undermine global efforts to support prices. Brent crude futures fell 44 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $60.20 a barrel by 11:03 a.m. EST (1603 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was 69 cents, or 1.3 percent, lower at $51.42 a barrel. U.S. fuel stockpiles last week rose more than forecast and for the fourth straight week, the Energy Information Administration said, outweighing a bigger-than-expected crude drawdown. Gasoline stockpiles rose 7.5 million barrels, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.8 million-barrel gain. At 255.6 million barrels, gasoline stocks at the highest weekly level since February of 2017. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, increased 3 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.6 million-barrel rise, the data showed. Crude inventories fell 2.7 million barrels, more than double forecasts. ""The continued strong rise in oil product stocks is bearish and overshadows the draw in crude oil stocks,"" said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank. The EIA also said U.S. crude production rose to a record high of 11.9 million barrels per day last week, as crude exports jumped close to record highs near 3 million bpd. Growing U.S production and exports have weighed on oil prices. Output is expected to grow to a new record of more than 12 million bpd this year, with U.S. turning into a net crude exporter in late 2020, the EIA said on Tuesday. The rising output could undermine oil markets which have been receiving support from supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including top exporter Saudi Arabia, and major non-OPEC producer Russia. Mounting signs of an economic slowdown across the world may also keep oil prices in check. White House estimates showed on Tuesday that the U.S. economy is taking a larger-than-expected hit from a partial government shutdown. The outlook for the global economy darkened further after Britain's parliament on Tuesday shot down Prime Minister Theresa May's deal to leave the European Union. Earlier this week, China reported poor December trade data, with exports and imports contracting from a year earlier. China's central bank on Wednesday made its biggest daily net cash injection via reverse repo operations on record, in efforts oil markets will watch closely. ""(China's) rapidly expanding economy and ... thirst for oil has in recent years provided a major pillar of price support,"" Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil, said.

2019-01-16,"Expectations for a decreased oil supply, potential Chinese stimulus and political uncertainty are buoying hopes for gains in the commodities sector, according to Goldman Sachs. Jeff Curries, global head of Commodities Research at Goldman Sachs, told CNBC on Wednesday that the bank is bullish on commodities oil and gold for several reasons, ranging from the Federal Reserve signalling it will hike rates less aggressively than expected and a weakening dollar. ""We're bullish on commodities,"" Goldman's Currie told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. ""One, because you don't have the rising (interest) rates anymore and in fact, they've come off and they're on pause. Two, the dollar's really strong and likely to weaken from here as opposed to strengthen like it did last year."" A weaker dollar makes oil more attractive as oil is denominated in dollars. Oil markets got a welcome boost when OPEC and its friends decided to cut supply again in December, another push is coming from news of Chinese economic stimulus that could propel demand. Oil prices rose 3 percent overnight on expectations that production cuts will tighten supply. On Wednesday midday, Brent futures stood at $60.37 per barrel and WTI at $51.70. Currie added that a predicted rise in Chinese demand and falling global oil supply also added to the bullish outlook for oil. ""China has given notice that it's stimulating (its economy) and then you have OPEC ready to cut production,"" he said, speaking to CNBC at Goldman's global strategy conference in London. China's central bank injected a net 560 billion yuan ($83 billion) into the banking system on Wednesday, the highest ever recorded for a single day, in a sign that it's willing to inject liquidity into a slowing economy. Chinese economic growth is driving higher oil demand.

2019-01-16,"LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged down on Wednesday having climbed about 3 percent in the previous session, with worries about the global economy and forecasts of swelling U.S. production hurting sentiment. Brent crude oil futures were at $60.37 per barrel at 1215 GMT, down 27 cents or 0.45 percent. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 43 cents, or 0.83 percent, at $51.68 a barrel. U.S. crude output is expected to rise to a new record of more than 12 million barrels per day this year, the Energy Information Administration said on Tuesday, adding that the U.S. will become a net crude exporter in late 2020. The forecast could undermine oil markets which have been receiving support from supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including top exporter Saudi Arabia, and major non-OPEC producer Russia. ""U.S. oil production will continue to grow strongly this year and next year,"" Carsten Fritsch, senior commodities analyst at Commerzbank, told Reuters Global Oil Forum. ""That means OPEC won't have any other choice than extending the production cuts beyond mid-year. Even deeper cuts could be necessary"", Fritsch added.

The benchmark palm oil contract for April delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange was down 0.4 percent at 2,175 ringgit ($529.45) a tonne at the close of trade.

The Chicago March soybean oil contract was last up 0.3 percent. Palm oil prices are impacted by price movements of soyoil, as they compete for a share in the global vegetable oil market. The edible oil is also affected by crude oil prices, as it is used as feedstock to make biodiesel. U.S. oil prices inched lower on Wednesday after gains of more 3 percent in the previous session, pressured by concerns over the outlook for the global economy.
