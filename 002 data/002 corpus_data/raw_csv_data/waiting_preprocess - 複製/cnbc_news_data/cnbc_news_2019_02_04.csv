2019-02-04,"(Updates prices, adds analyst quote) SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched up on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply due to U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.77 per barrel at 0223 GMT, up 21 cents or 0.4 percent. They closed down 1.3 percent on Monday, after earlier touching their highest since Nov. 21 at $55.75 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.72 a barrel, also up 21 cents or 0.4 percent, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. Analysts said that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela had focused market attention on tighter global supplies. ""Fresh U.S. sanctions on the country could see 0.5-1 percent of global supply curtailed,"" said Vivek Dhar, mining and energy analyst, Commonwealth Bank of Australia. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to but slightly less extensive than those imposed on Iran last year, experts said on Friday after looking at details posted by the Treasury Department. With fresh sanctions potentially looming, a flotilla loaded with about 7 million barrels of Venezuelan oil has formed in the Gulf of Mexico, some holding cargoes bought ahead of the latest U.S. sanctions and others whose buyers are weighing who to pay, according to traders, shippers and Refinitiv Eikon data. Meanwhile, oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group's supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production fell by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October.

2019-02-04,"The volatility that rocked oil prices last quarter may have moderated, but Citi's global head of commodities research says the market's ""nightmare"" is not over yet. The bank expects oil supply to tighten in the first quarter as top exporter Saudi Arabia cuts production, but Citi's Ed Morse also forecasts a soft spot for demand in the opening months of 2019. Further complicating matters are a series of geopolitical and market dramas that will play out through the beginning of May. This follows a three-month period that saw oil prices spike to nearly four-year highs as the market braced for U.S. sanctions on Iran. Prices then tumbled more then 40 percent to 18-month lows, blowing up long-held trading strategies and forcing drillers to rethink their 2019 budgets. ""The volatility every year is a good $20 to $25 a barrel between low and high,"" Morse said. ""December was kind of the nightmare for the world where the swings were $50 at a low, $86 at a high and $68 for the average of Brent."" ""We're not out of this. There's no real range that we think is going to hold for any length of time,"" he told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" on Monday. Brent crude: 6-month performance  Oil prices hit fresh two-month highs on Monday before tumbling as much as 3.6 percent. Morse chalked up the daily move to currency impacts and expectations that closely watched U.S. crude stockpiles rose last week. In the coming weeks and months, the oil market will have to deal with a lot of moving parts, Morse says. At present, new U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have displaced half a million barrels per day of heavy crude supplies. Meanwhile, the U.S. and China are holding talks to settle a trade dispute that could dent global growth and shrink fuel demand if left unresolved. Major oil producers led by OPEC will meet in March and April to review their deal to curb output and drain oversupply. Then in May, President Donald Trump must decide whether to renew six-month waivers that allow several nations to continue buying Iranian crude. ""We have plenty of potentially bullish moves in the market"" following a soft patch for demand before the seasonal uptick in fuel consumption begins around May, says Morse. Citi expects Brent crude to continue rising into the mid-$60 range and hit $70 before year end. That will be enough to keep in play another wild card: surging U.S. oil production. While some American drillers are pulling back spending after the price collapse, $65-$70 Brent will encourage U.S. producers to allocate more money to drilling, says Morse. Citi sees U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude's discount to Brent narrowing, preventing benchmark WTI from falling below the $50-$55 range. ""We think that's enough to keep U.S. production growth at a good million barrels a day, no matter what OPEC does on price level,"" said Morse.

2019-02-04,"Feb 4 (Reuters) - London's blue-chip stocks climbed to their highest in more than two months on Monday as gains in oil shares and consumer staples offset deep losses in miners, while airline Ryanair slumped after a disappointing quarterly report. The FTSE 100 index edged 0.2 percent higher to its highest since Dec. 4, extending a five-day winning streak, after the U.S. Fed's cautious stance last week and consensus-busting U.S. jobs data boosted confidence. But some gains in the exporter-heavy index evaporated as the pound handed back initial losses, while the more domestically focussed mid-cap index ended with a 0.2 percent gain. Sterling gained after a newspaper reported that goods shipped to Britain from the European Union could be waved through without checks in the event of a ""no-deal"" Brexit. On Wall Street, stocks edged higher thanks to a boost from technology shares ahead of Alphabet's results, while declines in healthcare and energy stocks weighed. In contrast, British oil majors Shell and BP held on to gains and provided the most support for the main bourse as crude prices earlier hit their highest so far this year on OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's petroleum industry. Cyclicals, such as miners, and dollar earners led the falls while consumer staples such as Unilever, Diageo - which are considered safe havens in times of economic and geopolitical stress - were in favour. Miners broke a seven-day winning streak and suffered their worst one-day fall in more than 10 days as copper prices fell on concerns about slowing factory activity in China, which is the world's biggest industrial metals consumer. London-listed shares in Ryanair shaved some of the day's losses to end down 2.3 percent after Europe's biggest budget airline blamed falling fares for its quarterly loss and warned that overcapacity was likely to continue to pressure prices. On the midcaps, iron ore pellet producer Ferrexpo slumped 8 percent after it said its auditors received bank statements from a charity, which was set up mainly to coordinate its corporate social responsibility programme, that contained ""as yet unexplained discrepancies"". Ferrexpo was the worst mid-cap faller, ending the day with steepest one-day decline in six months. In single stock moves, supermarket chain Morrisons advanced nearly 2 percent to be among best FTSE 100 performers after Citigroup raised the rating to ""neutral"". Meanwhile, the broader picture remained bleak with multiple downbeat data from the world's fifth-largest economy. A survey by accountants Deloitte found that major British businesses' appetite to take on financial risk has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade due to fears of ""the hardest of Brexits"" and rising U.S. protectionism. Growth in Britain's construction industry also dipped in January to its weakest in 10 months as Brexit uncertainty dragged on commercial building work, another survey showed. Worries about Brexit were exacerbated by Nissan's announcement over the weekend that it had scrapped plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain, and its warning that uncertainty over Britain's departure was making it harder to plan for the future. ""The Nissan cancellation was a blow and reflects the underlying reality that Brexit uncertainty inexorably impacts medium/longer-term business confidence and hence related investments,"" said Raymond James analyst Chris Bailey.

2019-02-04,"Venezuela: Kemp@ (John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming steadily less bearish towards oil as OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela remove large volumes of crude from the market amid increasing confidence a global recession can be averted. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of another 30 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to position data from ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers have been net buyers in seven of the last eight weeks and have increased their position by 96 million barrels since Dec. 4 (https://tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4). In common with previous weeks, fund managers mostly closed out old bearish short positions (-18 million barrels) rather than opening new bullish long ones (+12 million). Bearish short positions have fallen by more than 60 percent from a peak of 122 million barrels on Dec. 11 to 48 million as fund managers have become convinced that the fourth-quarter sell-off is over. In contrast, bullish long positions have risen by just 27 million barrels over the same period, as portfolio managers remain cautious. However, weekly increases have started to accelerate, in a sign of growing confidence. Funds now hold almost 6 bullish long positions for every bearish short one, up from a ratio of 2:1 in mid-December, and the most bullish overall position since mid-October. OPECs early and aggressive output reductions have removed some of the downside supply risk to oil prices even as traders remain uncertain about the risk of recession and the potential hit to consumption growth in 2019. U.S. sanctions on Venezuelas national oil company PDVSA, since broadened to include third-country purchasers of Venezuelas heavy crude, are also likely to reduce global oil supplies. Besides crude, fund managers were buyers of 7 million barrels of European gasoil futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to exchange data. Net long positions in gasoil have risen in each of the last four weeks and now stand at 22 million barrels, up from just 2 million barrels at the end of 2018. Gasoil is the part of the barrel most closely geared to the business cycle, so cautious buying suggests fund managers see a reduced probability of recession this year.

2019-02-04,"(For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) Feb 4 (Reuters) - London's blue-chip stocks on Monday rose to their highest in more than two months as gains in oil stocks and consumer staples offset deep losses in miners, while airline Ryanair slumped after a disappointing quarterly report. The FTSE 100 index was up 0.3 percent at its highest since Dec. 4 at 0910 GMT, extending a five-day winning streak after U.S. Fed's cautious stance last week and consensus-busting U.S. jobs data boosted confidence, and the mid-caps were up 0.3 percent. Elsewhere, Asian shares hovered near four-month highs after a mixed performance on Wall Street at the close of last week and the dollar firmed against the yen following upbeat U.S. employment and manufacturing data. But trading was muted with Chinese markets closed for the Lunar New Year. Oil majors BP and Shell were the top support to the main index with crude prices hitting their highest so far this year on OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's petroleum industry. Cyclicals, such as miners and banks, led the falls while consumer staples and healthcare stocks such as Unilever and GlaxoSmithKline, considered safe havens in times of economic and geopolitical stress, were in favor. Those companies, which make their income abroad, were also aided by the weaker sterling. Miners dipped 1 percent and were on course for their worst one-day fall in ten days as copper prices were marred by concerns over slowing factory activity in the world's biggest industrial metals consumer China. London-listed shares in Ryanair slumped 4 percent after Europe's biggest budget airline blamed falling fares for its quarterly loss and warned that overcapacity was likely to continue to pressure prices. The report dragged rival easyJet down 2.9 percent to the bottom of the FTSE 100. On the midcaps, iron ore pellet producer Ferrexpo slid 7 percent after it said its auditors received bank statements from a charity, which was set up mainly to coordinate its corporate social responsibility program, that contained ""as yet unexplained discrepancies."" Ferrexpo was the worst mid-cap faller in early deals and the losses placed it on track for steepest one-day declines since last July. The Brexit process has slipped into limbo while investors await to see the outcome of British Prime Minister Theresa Mays meetings with European Union counterparts this week. Highlighting worries about the country's exit from the bloc, carmaker Nissan canceled plans to build its new X-Trail SUV in Britain and said it would produce it solely in Japan, warning that the uncertainty over Britain's departure was making it harder to plan for the future. A survey by accountants Deloitte found that major British businesses' appetite to take on financial risk has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a decade due to fears of ""the hardest of Brexits"" and rising U.S. protectionism.

2019-02-04,"bite@ SINGAPORE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose to their highest so far this year on Monday as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela's petroleum industry tightened markets. International Brent crude oil futures climbed to a 2019 high of $63.37 per barrel around 0800 GMT after already rising by 3 percent the previous session. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures hit a 2019 high of $55.68 per barrel around the same after already gaining 2.73 percent in the last session. Higher crude oil prices helped drag Asian refinery margins to their lowest levels since 2010 on Monday, Refinitiv data showed. Output declines from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as they make good on their pact to curb a supply overhang were compounded by falling U.S. oil rig counts and sanctions on Venezuelan oil sales. ""While Venezuela's output reportedly rose last month, fresh U.S. sanctions on the country could see 0.5 to 1 percent of global supply curtailed,"" Vivek Dhar, commodities analyst for Commonwealth Bank of Australia, said in a note on Monday. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to those imposed on Iran last year, experts said after examining details posted by the Treasury Department. OPEC oil supply fell in January by the largest amount in two years despite sluggish production declines from Russia, according to a Reuters survey. Russian oil output in January missed the target for the output cuts, Energy Ministry data showed on Saturday. Production last month declined to 11.38 million barrels per day (bpd), but that was only down by 35,000 bpd from its October 2018 level that is the baseline for the pact. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said the country's overall cuts from the October baseline would total 50,000 bpd in January. Russia has pledged to reduce oil output by 230,000 bpd from October. U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil rigs operating to their lowest in eight months, to 847, as some drillers followed through on plans to spend less on new wells this year. ""The collapse in oil prices late last year has resulted in more cautious spending by U.S. oil explorers,"" said Dhar. U.S. President Donald Trump last week said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the coming weeks to try settle the disputes, and there are hopes that the two sides will come to an agreement.

2019-02-04,"SINGAPORE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Oil prices prices were stable on Monday, largely maintaining gains from the previous session as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela provided the market with support. International Brent crude oil futures were at $62.76 per barrel at 0507 GMT on Monday, 1 cent above their last close. Brent rose by more than 3 percent in the previous session to their highest close since Nov. 21. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $55.20 per barrel, down 6 cents from their last settlement. WTI settled 2.73 percent higher in the last session at its highest close since Nov. 19.

2019-02-04,"Oil prices fell on Monday after U.S. data sparked fresh concerns about a slowdown in the global economy and rising crude supplies in the United States. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude hit a 2019 high of $55.75, its best intraday price since Nov. 21. WTI ended Monday's session 70 cents lower at $54.56 for a 1.3 percent loss. Brent crude oil, the global benchmark, hit $63.63 a barrel, the highest since Dec. 7, before turning negative. Brent recouped most of its losses to trade 24 cents lower at $62.51 around 2:30 p.m. ET. Weighing on oil markets, U.S. government data showed new orders for U.S.-made goods unexpectedly fell in November, with sharp declines in demand for machinery and electrical equipment. ""In a market that's looking for direction, there's concern that any slowdown in the manufacturing sector would slow down demand. Because the number was a little disappointing, it played into the slowing demand scenario,"" said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Prices also dipped after data showed U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, rose by more than 943,000 barrels in the week to Feb. 1, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. ""I think that's why we've seen most of the WTI sell-off, and the sell-off in WTI has dragged down Brent, not quite as much as WTI,"" Edward Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street."" The U.S. dollar also strengthened, making oil more expensive to holders of other currencies. Prices have been buoyed by a new round of supply cuts from OPEC and its allies that began in January. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October. The impact of OPEC+'s supply curbs has been boosted by U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The sanctions will limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to those imposed on Iran last year, some analysts said after examining details announced by the U.S. government. ""There's no sign of overhang in the crude oil markets,"" said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix.
