2018-10-09,"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - European Union nations, voicing concern over a U.N. report on global warming, agreed on Tuesday to seek a 35 percent cut in car emissions by 2030, as Germany warned that overly challenging targets risked harming industry and jobs. Torn between reducing pollution and preserving industry competitiveness, EU environment ministers meeting in Luxembourg talked for more than 13 hours until nearly midnight to reach a compromise over what 2030 carbon dioxide limits to impose on Europe’s powerful carmakers. “We saw a really complicated discussion,” Europe’s Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said of the compromise that gained the support of 20 nations, with 4 voting against and 4 abstaining. “I never believed in the beginning that such a strong support would be obtained.” The final rules will now be hashed out in talks beginning on Wednesday with the EU’s two other lawmaking bodies: the European Parliament, which is seeking a more ambitious climate target, and the European Commission, which proposed a lower one. In a joint statement earlier, the EU ministers expressed deep concern over a U.N. report calling for rapid and unprecedented action to contain global warming and renewed commitment to the 2015 Paris climate accord. Several countries had sought a higher, 40 percent reduction in car emissions, in line with targets backed by EU lawmakers last week, but softened their position in talks. However, Ireland and the Netherlands were among those who voiced disappointment with the compromise deal, which also set a 30 percent target for cutting emissions from vans by 2030. Germany, with its big auto sector, had backed an EU executive proposal for a 30 percent cut for fleets of new cars and vans by 2030, compared with 2021 levels. Climate campaigners say Germany has still not learned to be tougher on the auto industry, despite the scandal that engulfed Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 when it admitted to using illegal software to mask emissions on up to 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide. Germany had the backing of several eastern European nations early in the talks against more ambitious targets, EU sources said. But a last-minute amendment helped ease concerns over the new rules, which also create a crediting system encouraging carmakers to raise sales of electric cars. It would allow for a different accounting in countries where the current market penetration of zero- and low-emissions vehicles is less than 60 percent below the average in the bloc. Curbs on the transport sector, the only industry in which emissions are still rising, aim to help the bloc meet its goal of reducing greenhouse gases by at least 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have fuelled concerns climate change is gathering pace, leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. But a call by the EU’s climate commissioner and 15 EU nations for the bloc to increase its pledge to cut emissions by 45 percent under the Paris accord has met with resistance. Ahead of U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, the bloc’s 28 environment ministers reiterated their commitment to leading the fight to limit global warming. They said the EU was ready to “communicate or update” its Nationally Determined Contribution, the efforts by each country to reduce emissions, by 2020. Raising it would require the approval of all 28 nations.

2018-10-09,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks on major world markets edged lower on Tuesday, with a decline in the materials sector offsetting rising energy shares, while long-dated U.S. Treasury yields pulled back from multi-year highs and helped weaken the U.S. dollar. The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note, a global benchmark, rose to a seven-year high at 3.261 percent before paring gains to trade at 3.2044 percent on worries about global growth. The International Monetary Fund cut global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019, as well as its U.S. and China estimates for next year, saying the two countries would feel the brunt of the impact of their trade war next year. European shares closed higher in a choppy session, rising above six-month lows, as worries about a likely clash in Europe over Italy’s budget plans eased and energy heavyweights such as Eni SpA and Total lifted benchmarks.    The oil and gas index was the biggest sectoral gainer in Europe, up 1.5 percent after crude prices rose as more evidence emerged that Iran’s crude exports were falling. [O/R] Wall Street’s materials index fell 3.4 percent, with PPG Industries leading the decline after the chemicals company warned late on Monday that its earnings would be hit by higher raw material costs and softer demand in China. PPG fell 10.1 percent and the industrials sector, the second-biggest drag on the S&P 500, slid 1.5 percent. S&P 500 companies are vulnerable to global growth since  about half their business comes from overseas, noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “If industrials and materials are weighed on because of concerns about global activity, it’s going to cast a pall over the market at large,” Luschini said. Tech stocks edged off two-month lows in a sign the recent sell-off has dissipated as the speed of rapidly rising bond yields drove investor reactions. The strength of the U.S. economy has generated a rotation from the higher valuation areas of the market to more reasonably valued areas, said Andrew Acheson, director of U.S. growth equities at Amundi Pioneer in Boston. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 56.21 points, or 0.21 percent, to 26,430.57 and the S&P 500 shed 4.09 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,880.34. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.07 points, or 0.03 percent, to 7,738.02. MSCI’s index of stock performance in 47 countries fell 0.13 percent, while the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares rose 0.31 percent. The dollar dipped due to a fall in U.S. bond yields after touching a seven-week peak against a basket of currencies. Sterling rose after a report that rekindled hopes that Britain and the European Union are on the brink of a Brexit deal. Ongoing worries about a stand-off between the European Union and Italy over the country’s budget had pushed Italian borrowing costs to their highest since 2014 and had weighed on the euro. Investors dumped U.S. bonds last week on fears that domesticinflation might accelerate and prompt the Federal Reserve tohasten the pace of interest rate hikes. The dollar index fell 0.08 percent, with the euro up 0.03 percent to $1.1494. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.24 percent versus the greenback at 112.97.

U.S. crude rose 67 cents to $74.96 per barrel and Brent settled up $1.09 at $85.00.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts first sentence with potential impact on Mexican oil production, adds comments by energy minister, Pemex CEO, other details) By Ana Isabel Martinez and Marianna Parraga MEXICO CITY, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-run Pemex said on Tuesday it has discovered up to 180 million barrels of crude oil in the Gulf of Mexico’s shallow waters, a find that is expected to help boost the country’s dwindling oil production. Pemex, whose oil and gas output has been declining since 2004, said light and heavy crudes were found in seven reservoirs along the Mulach and Manik fields in the southern Gulf of Mexico, close to existing infrastructure for production and transportation. “These are the reservoirs that will feed the country’s reserves,” said Mexican Energy Minister Pedro Joaquin Coldwell at a news conference with Pemex executives. The discovery of proven, possible and probable reserves (3P) in Mulach and Manik follows discoveries announced by Pemex in recent years in four nearby fields. Together they will require $7 billion to $10 billion in investment, including drilling rigs, pipelines and at least one production platform. Even amid budgetary constraints, Pemex in recent years has increased exploration efforts, with a 25 percent success rate in confirming reserves, below rates registered in previous decades, according to the firm’s exploration chief Jose Antonio Escalera. Rising crude prices and an expanding budget now allow the company to do more to reverse the country’s falling proven reserves, which last year declined 7 percent to 8.48 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Pemex expects new production from the Xikin, Esah, Kinbe, Koban, Mulach and Manik offshore fields to add up to 210,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and 350 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of natural gas by the second half of 2020. The first field to add barrels would be Xikin, discovered three years ago, where early production is expected in 2019. The Esah field would follow in the first quarter of 2020. Mexico expects the downward trend in its oil reserves to turn positive in two years, following a constitutional energy overhaul enacted in 2013, said Joaquin Coldwell. The new fields will also contribute relatively quickly to Pemex output in shallow waters, where the vast majority of its production originates. Pemex has recently been facing production problems at one of its main shallow-water areas, the Xanab light crude field. “We still don’t have a specific production goal for this year. There’s an emergency plan to ease Xanab’s (output) declination,” Pemex’s CEO, Carlos Trevino Medina, said at the news conference.

2018-10-09,"(Recasts, adds minister comments, background) MILAN, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that will transport Russian gas to Germany will be completed on time even if new sanctions are imposed on Moscow, Russia’s energy minister said on Tuesday. “We hope there will be no additional sanctions but if there are the project will be completed anyway,” Alexander Novak said on the sidelines of an energy conference in Milan. Nord Stream 2 AG, which will double the existing Nord Stream 1 capacity, is led by Russian gas giant Gazprom and financed by five Western companies. The United States opposes the project and President Donald Trump has accused Germany of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance, saying it was wrong to support the Baltic gas pipeline. Divisions exist among EU member states over whether to do more business with Moscow despite its military incursions in Ukraine and Syria. “Everything is on time and as of today the first commercial gas will be ready by the end of 2019,” Novak said. Russia is keen to press ahead with Nord Stream 2 which will bypass traditional routes through Ukraine. Asked about the Gazprom-led Turkish Stream project to pipe Russian gas via the Black Sea to southern and southeast Europe, Novak said that was also on track for first commercial gas by end-2019. “The second marine-based part of the project is 85 percent complete,” he said. At the conference on Tuesday, Novak had a bilateral meeting with EDF’s Italian energy unit Edison. Last year, Gazprom signed an agreement with Edison and Greece’s state-controlled gas company DEPA to work on building a southern route for Russian gas supplies from Russia to Europe, across Turkey and Greece to Italy. “We agreed to continue this,” Novak said. Later on Tuesday an Edison spokeswoman confirmed the meeting. “It was a positive and warm meeting that we thank the minister for, ahead of the planned visit by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte to Moscow later this month,” she said.
