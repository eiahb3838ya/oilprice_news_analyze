2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The United States may soon get funding for a new heavy icebreaker ship, the head of the U.S. Coast Guard said on Thursday, as global warming spurs the race to stake out the Arctic, which is rich in oil, gas, and minerals. The United States has two operational icebreakers - a heavy one, the Polar Star, which is more than 42 years old and has outlived its life expectancy by a dozen years, and a medium one, the Healy cutter. By comparison, Russia has about 40 to 50 icebreakers, purpose-built vessels that can rescue other ships, supply bases, and reach oil spills in harsh polar conditions. “I’m guardedly optimistic funding for that first polar security cutter is going to be there,” Commandant Karl Schultz said at a National Press Club event. Icebreakers support scientific missions and operate in the Arctic and Antarctic, which hold vast natural gas, oil, mineral, fish, and fresh water resources, Schultz said. While Washington participates in several forums on Arctic security and cooperation, such as the Arctic Council, it also needs to ensure it has the necessary equipment, he said. China early this year declared itself a “Near Arctic State,” outlined how it believed the region should be developed, and is expanding its icebreaker fleet. “Diplomacy and cooperation are really hollow or shallow without presence,” Schultz said, adding that the country needs a minimum of six icebreakers, which can cost about $1 billion each and take up to 10 years to build. “If we’re not present, if we don’t own the environment today, guess who owns it tomorrow - our competitors.” While President Donald Trump’s administration has budgeted $750 million for an icebreaker, it is not certain whether the funding will survive in Congress, which is also looking for ways to fund the border wall with Mexico, among other items. The Coast Guard is part of Homeland Security, one of several departments that have not been funded for the 2019 budget. Congress is expected to consider a $450 billion bill, before stopgap funding expires on Dec. 21, to fund the agencies through the fiscal year that ends next Sept. 30.

2018-12-06,"(Reuters) - The chief executive of Tennessee Valley Authority said on Thursday the U.S.-owned power generator will keep cutting carbon emissions in future years after replacing much of its coal-fired fleet with plants run on natural gas, nuclear and renewables. Since Bill Johnson took the reigns as CEO in 2013, TVA has spent $15 billion to modernize its generating fleet, reduced carbon emissions by retiring coal units, and cut debt by $3.5 billion, all while keeping consumer electric prices basically flat for six years. “Carbon emissions are now down to 50 percent below 2005 levels. I predict CO2 will fall to 60 percent below 2005 levels by 2020/2021 and 70 percent by the end of the next decade,” Johnson told Reuters in an interview. Johnson, who announced his retirement in November, said he will continue as CEO until the board finds a replacement. The company continued to shut coal-fired units over the past two years despite efforts by U.S. President Donald Trump to prop up the coal industry by sweeping away former President Barack Obama’s climate change regulations, like the Clean Power Plan. Johnson said TVA shut old coal plants for economic reasons. “We have reduced carbon emissions simply by doing what is the most efficient and effective way to serve our customers,” Johnson said, noting the low cost of gas in recent years has made it more economic for TVA to build a new gas-fired power plant than refurbish a 60-year old coal unit. Over Johnson’s tenure, TVA’s generating mix transitioned from 41 percent coal and 12 percent gas in 2012, the year before he became CEO, to 19 percent coal and 20 percent gas in 2018, according to TVA’s federal filings. And TVA may not be done retiring coal plants. In November, the company said it is seeking public comment on potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts of closing the 870-megawatt (MW) Bull Run coal plant in Tennessee and the last 971-MW coal unit at the Paradise plant in Kentucky. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes. “We’re trying to figure out what is the lowest feasible cost to provide energy to people in the region,” Johnson said. Separately, TVA Chief Financial Officer John Thomas told Reuters the company reduced debt by $3.5 billion over the past six years to $24.2 billion, its lowest in 25 years, and was on track to cut total debt to below $20 billion by 2023.

2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration took aim at two Obama-era environmental policies on Thursday to boost the oil and coal industries, proposing to open up a bird’s wildlife habitat to drilling and mining and remove hurdles to new coal-fired power plant construction. The moves, part of a broader agenda by U.S. President Donald Trump to revive the ailing coal industry and ramp up domestic energy production, come amid increasingly urgent warnings from within his own government about climate change, and as world leaders gather at a United Nations conference to combat planetary warming. Announced separately by Trump appointees who were both former energy lobbyists, the proposals cheered the coal and oil industries but triggered an uproar from environmental groups who raised the prospect of legal challenges. “Trump and his deputies are delivering on the wish list of the coal and oil industries, but they are up against the public and market demand for clean energy,” said Mary Anne Hitt, senior director of Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign. The U.S. Interior Department proposed easing Obama-era protections for a bird, the greater sage-grouse, to boost oil drilling and mining across Western states, potentially opening up hundreds of thousands of acres of grouse habitat in states like Colorado and Utah to oil and gas leasing. Announced by Interior Department Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt, a Colorado native and a former energy lobbyist, the proposal would allow for changes to habitat boundary maps of the chicken-sized prairie fowl - considered by conservationists to be a key indicator species for America’s dwindling sagebrush ecosystem. The Obama administration had launched the plan to protect the sage-grouse in September 2015 as an alternative to listing the ground-dwelling bird under the Endangered Species Act, a move that would potentially have entailed even tougher habitat protections. The oil and mining industries, however, have said the limits to development are overreaching.  Also on Thursday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency proposed rolling back an Obama-era rule requiring new U.S. coal plants to slash carbon emissions, a move that could crack open the door in coming years for new plants fired by the fossil fuel. Rejecting criticism that the move would potentially increase carbon emissions, acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, argued that the move would encourage cleaner coal investments in the United States, which would then be exported worldwide and help reduce global emissions. It is unclear if the move will spur any new construction of coal plants in the United States, however, as many utilities turn to cheaper natural gas and renewables like solar and wind energy. The U.S. government lists only two major coal-fired power plants scheduled to come online over the next five years, with more than 70 scheduled to retire over the same period.  Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has made a habit of rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, including crude oil. U.S. oil production is already the highest in the world, above Saudi Arabia and Russia, after a boom that was triggered more than a decade ago by improved drilling technology. Trump’s agenda to encourage more fossil fuels use clashes with a congressionally mandated government report that came out last month saying climate change is driven mainly by human activity and will cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. The White House has discounted the report, saying it fails to account for potential advances in technology that could make burning fossil fuels cleaner in the future.

2018-12-06,"(David A. Andelman, a former foreign correspondent for the New York Times and CBS News, is author of “A Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today.” The opinions expressed here are his own.) By David A. Andelman Dec 6 (Reuters) - Nicole Barthelemy, the quiet, gracious owner of one of Paris’s premier cheese shops on the Rue de Grenelle, told me this week, with real panic in her eyes, “I have never in 47 years been so afraid as I am today.” And with good reason. Only a few blocks away, on the Rue de Solferino, around the corner from the Musée d’Orsay, in the building where I’ve lived off and on since 1981, two barricades were built on this quiet residential street. One was set ablaze last Saturday and burned for hours. But while Madame Barthelemy and I may need to dodge scattered clouds of tear gas launched by France’s redoubtable gendarmerie, President Emmanuel Macron is fighting for his political life. At least for the moment, his vision for his country and for Europe seems increasingly disconnected from the people who elected him. Tens of thousands have taken the streets to demonstrate their displeasure. And that’s what is stoking fear among Barthelemy and millions more. It’s not hard to find reasons for this sudden unraveling of the grand ambitions of the youngest French leader since Napoleon. Macron’s visions for this future appear increasingly disconnected from anything France, even Europe, has known or at least for the moment even wants. “We must do away with this little political world which functions only for itself,” Laurent Tinois told the French daily Le Monde. A public works department laborer in northern France, he is a local leader of the movement known as the “gilets-jaunes” for their yellow vests, which all French motorists must keep in their cars for emergencies. The gilets-jaunes, and the hooligans or “casseurs” (breakers) who have ridden along like pilot fish, have been at the center of weeks of unrest. Tinois’s views echo those of hundreds of thousands who have demonstrated and rioted across the nation. The revolution of the yellow vests has become more of a political movement for utter social change than an economic issue of taxation, which was the spark that set off this firestorm of protest. So, on Tuesday, when Prime Minister Édouard Philippe went on national television to announce a six-month suspension of a gas tax increase, the outrage over the sop of halfway measures was palpable. Tinois voted in the last election for Macron’s left-wing opponent Jean-Luc Mélenchon. Other protesters admitted to voting for a range of Macron opponents, from Mélenchon on the left to far-right leader Marine Le Pen. All have taken advantage of this movement to press their disparate desires – new parliamentary elections, even Macron’s resignation. Much of this political action seems designed to re-run last year’s vote that swept Macron and his new political party into office with a landslide and what appeared to be an unchallengeable mandate. Though, as is now becoming apparent, this was hardly so clearly-cut. Thousands stayed away from the polls because they saw little they really liked and now they seem to be venting their anger in the streets. As someone who has observed how French presidents back to Charles de Gaulle dealt with the protests that erupted from even the narrowest change in direction, I feel Macron had little real understanding of the nation he was seeking to transform. France is effectively a giant ocean liner, lumbering straight ahead. But Macron arrived in the pilot house and immediately tried to make a sudden turn in direction. The move to the barricades to protest taxes and inequalities should have been entirely predictable to anyone familiar with the nation’s history. While barricades date to the 16th century in France, the French Revolution in 1789 was the first time such a show of resistance led to the beheading of a French king, Louis XVI, and his wife, Marie Antoinette. The barricades went up again in times of turmoil like the 1848 revolution, and in 1968 they began in the Latin Quarter with a student rebellion that spread quickly to workers and farmers alike before De Gaulle restored order by threatening to resign. Back then, not an insignificant threat. This time, the revolution threatens to spread again. In the wake of vast rioting and pillaging along the Champs-Elysées, thousands of high-school students have gone out on strike across the country, at times battling police as they protest the curriculum changes that are part of Macron’s education reforms. In front of the National Assembly in Paris, just minutes from my apartment, scores of ambulances have blocked traffic for hours, sirens blaring, hundreds of drivers protesting rules that discriminate against small individual ambulance companies in favor of a few behemoths. Faced with an inchoate and leaderless, though powerful, movement, and having moved too quickly with his reforms, Macron’s easy fix of suspending the gas tax increase first for six months, then for all of 2019 may be insufficient. He’s also dug in his heels on upholding his repeal of the surtax on the wealthy that Socialist President Francois Mitterrand initiated three decades ago. “We will never unravel anything we’ve done over the past 18 months,” Macron declared to a session of his cabinet Wednesday evening. Macron’s reversal of this tax led many to brand him “president of the rich.” Of course, Macron has had reasons – intellectually quite brilliant – for each of his fiscal moves. The gas tax was designed to pay for a post-carbon France. Ending the wealth tax was designed to lure British bankers driven from London by Brexit. But none of this is immediately apparent to French provincial workers, many of whom squeak by on the minimum wage of around 1,500 euro ($1,700) a month to feed their families and buy gas to get to work in a countryside with little public transport. There really are two Frances – rich and poor, but especially urban and rural. Now both seem to be united in their revolt – and fear for their future. With no one organized to negotiate on the other side, the government has found no solution – beyond putting more military force on the streets – for what promises to be another Saturday of chaos and violence. But France’s president faces a crisis different from any other Western leader. Macron’s is a vast peasant uprising that requires a whole new set of nuanced political tools if he is to neutralize this unrest before it lurches utterly out of control. (Reporting by David A.

France will close the Eiffel Tower and other tourism landmarks in Paris and draft in thousands more security forces on Saturday to stave off another wave of violent protests in the country over living costs. Authorities have postponed Sunday’s Ligue 1 match between St Etienne and Olympique de Marseille - two of France’s biggest teams - and Friday’s AS Monaco-Nice south-coast derby.  Toulouse against Olympique Lyonnais has also been called off, the league said, along with Angers v Girondins de Bordeaux. The top-of-the-table clash between leaders Paris St-Germain and Montpellier was postponed on Tuesday. L’Equipe also reported that the Nimes against Nantes game was a sixth casualty leaving only two fixtures on Saturday, while two games are still on the programme for Sunday. There was no immediate response from the French Football Federation on whether the entire weekend programme, with 10 matches originally scheduled, would be called off. Last weekend, thousands of people rioted against French President Emmanuel Macron and his squeeze on household spending brought about by tax increases on diesel. Riot police were overrun as protesters wrought havoc in Paris’s fanciest neighbourhoods, torching dozens of cars, looting boutiques and smashing up luxury private homes and cafes in the worst disturbances the capital has seen since 1968.

2018-12-06,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - The largest oil field in the United States holds as much as 49 years worth of oil at current production rates, according to data from a report released on Thursday by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). In its first assessment of the Delaware portion of the Permian shale field that spans west Texas and New Mexico, the USGS, which is part of the U.S. Department of the Interior, said it contains about 46.3 billion barrels of oil and 281 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.  The government estimates include all underground shale oil and gas that is technically recoverable but may not be economic to extract at current prices. The estimate is twice the size of the country’s next largest shale reserve - the Midland Basin - another portion of the Permian. In 2016, that was found by the USGS to have about 20 billion barrels of oil and 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.   Survey results “demonstrate the impact that improved technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and directional drilling have had on increasing the estimates,” said Walter Guidroz, an official in the USGS Energy Resources Program. Hydraulic fracturing forces water and sand underground at high pressure to free oil and gas trapped in shale rock.  The Permian Basin, which includes both shale regions, is expected to pump 3.7 million barrels of crude oil per day this month, up 30 percent from a year ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  The Delaware and Midland basins combined would take 49 years to produce if all the oil was profitable to recovery, according to the EIA figures.

2018-12-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world sank on Thursday as the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive threatened to strain an already brittle U.S.-China trade relationship, while oil prices fell after OPEC delayed an output decision.   The arrest of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada for extradition to the United States came as Washington and Beijing prepared for talks aimed at resolving a bitter trade spat.  Sources familiar with the probe told Reuters Meng was arrested as part of a U.S. investigation of an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.    Wall Street tumbled in early trade before paring some losses by the close.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 79.4 points, or 0.32 percent, to 24,947.67, the S&P 500 lost 4.11 points, or 0.15 percent, to 2,695.95 and the Nasdaq Composite added 29.83 points, or 0.42 percent, to 7,188.26. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 3.09 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.05 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.04 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.91 percent. “Clearly, the Huawei CFO arrest was the individual catalyst that caused today’s moves lower,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide.     Canadian authorities late on Wednesday said they had arrested Meng, also the daughter of Huawei’s founder, on Dec. 1, the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina.  The world’s two economic superpowers had agreed on a 90-day trade truce period to hammer out a more permanent agreement, which sent global stock markets soaring on Monday. Equities reversed course the next day as uncertainty grew that the world’s two largest economies could, in fact, find common ground.  “The potential slowdown in global growth is also something the markets are pricing in,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. Earlier this week, shorter-dated yields rose above medium-dated yields for the first time since early 2008, which fanned fears about a U.S. recession in the coming months and also sent Wall Street shares sliding.  U.S. Treasury yields fell, with 10-year yields hitting three-month lows, as worries about U.S.-China trade and Brexit spurred safe-haven bids. A U.S. derivatives regulator warned on Thursday that uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union is having a “substantial” impact on some U.S. entities and markets.  Additionally, traders scaled back expectations on the number of rate hikes the Federal Reserve would implement amid weakening economic data and market volatility. U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any serious weakness, markets are likely to react, said Shuji Shirota, HSBC’s head of macro economic strategy. The U.S. dollar fell against major peers on lower Treasury yields and as traders scaled back rate hike expectations. “The problem for the dollar is really a decline in U.S. yields and fading Fed expectations,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto. The euro was 0.26 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1373. Gold prices, which move inversely with the dollar, held near a five-month peak as the greenback and equities slipped. Oil prices fell nearly 3 percent in choppy trading after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a meeting without making a decision on crude output.

2018-12-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell nearly 3 percent in choppy trading on Thursday after OPEC and its allies ended a meeting without announcing a decision to cut crude output, and prepared to debate the matter the next day. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries met in Vienna to decide production policy in coordination with other countries including Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan. OPEC tentatively agreed to cut oil output but was waiting for a commitment from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding volumes.  Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak flew home from Vienna earlier for talks with President Vladimir Putin in Saint Petersburg. Novak returns to Austria’s capital on Friday for discussions among Saudi-led OPEC and its allies. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC needed Russia to cooperate, and said a decision was likely by Friday evening. “If everybody is not willing to join and contribute equally, we will wait until they are,” al-Falih said.  Market watchers had expected a joint cut of 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd). The OPEC, non-OPEC meeting is set to start on Friday at 1100 GMT.  “All eyes are now fixated on tomorrow’s OPEC+ joint declaration, and a combined output cut of at least 1 million barrels per day will be required to see a meaningful recovery in oil prices,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London.       Brent crude futures fell $1.50, or 2.4 percent, to $60.06 a barrel, after dropping to a session low of $58.36. U.S. crude futures fell $1.40, or 2.7 percent, to $51.49, bouncing off a low of $50.08.  The benchmarks have slumped more than 25 percent so far this quarter.  Prices found some support after data showed U.S. crude stockpiles declined last week, the first drawdown since September. Inventories had climbed for 10 straight weeks as domestic production grew to a weekly record at 11.7 million bpd, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) showed.  The United States, however, last week became a net exporter of crude and refined products for the first time since at least 1973, exporting a net 211,000 bpd, on the back of a jump in crude exports to a record of 3.2 million bpd, the data showed. Crude prices have sagged almost a third since October, in part due to concerns about oversupply coming to the fore again as U.S. production rose in tandem with increased output from Saudi Arabia and Russia. The three countries are the world’s largest producers of oil.     OPEC’s crude oil production has risen by 4.1 percent since mid-2018, to 33.31 million bpd. European equities hit their lowest in two years. Commodity-sensitive currencies such as the Russian rouble tumbled on sliding oil prices and the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei in Canada for extradition to the United States, just ahead of crucial trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing. Barclays said in its Global Outlook that “investors need to lower their expectations” and “2019 should be a period of lower returns and higher volatility.” It forecast that the global economy would “slow over the next several quarters” although it added that “not one major economy is near recession.” Ann-Louise Hittle, vice president, macro oils at Wood Mackenzie, said world oil demand growth is expected to average close to 1.1 million bpd in 2018 and 2019.  “This sits against a backdrop of rapid non-OPEC production growth ... the strength in non-OPEC production creates pressure on OPEC to curtail its output for 2019 from recent levels, if oil prices are to remain stable,” Hittle said.

2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday proposed rolling back an Obama-era rule requiring new U.S. coal plants to slash carbon emissions, a move that could crack open the door in coming years for new plants fired by the fossil fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s acting administrator, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, announced the proposal. It would allow new coal plants to emit up to 1,900 pounds (862 kg) of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity, up from 1,400 pounds now. The move to revive the ailing coal industry, whose share in the U.S. energy mix has been in decline, caused an uproar among environmental groups, who said it ignored dire warnings from the world’s scientists about climate change. “We are rescinding unfair burdens on American energy providers and leveling the playing field so that new energy technologies can be part of America’s future,” Wheeler said at a press conference. He spoke alongside Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, a long-time opponent of former President Barack Obama’s limits on carbon emissions. The EPA hopes to finalize the rule after a public comment period. “This proposal is another illegal attempt by the Trump administration to prop up an industry already buckling under the powerful force of the free market,” said U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat on the Senate Environment Committee. Under the existing Obama-era rule, new coal plants would have to burn some natural gas, which emits less carbon, or install carbon capture equipment or highly efficient technology that is not yet commercially available. Wheeler argued the proposal would not boost U.S. greenhouse emissions but would actually help drive them down by encouraging U.S. investment in new energy technologies, which could then be exported. “I’d love to see coal plants being built in China and India meet our standards,” he said. The announcement came ahead of annual U.N. climate talks in Poland next week, where White House officials plan a panel on coal technology. A U.S. Government report last month found climate change will cost the national economy hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century. That bleak picture clashes with the Trump administration’s pro-fossil-fuels agenda. “We are not ignoring the government report,” Wheeler said. But he added “a lot of the media’s focused on is the worst-case scenario.” The U.S. Energy Information Administration has projected that coal demand will fall this year to the lowest in 39 years, as the power industry moves further toward natural gas and renewables like solar and wind. The government lists plans for two new major coal fired power plants over the next five years, which could benefit from the EPA’s rollback. Still, it also lists plans for 77 retirements.  Asked if the EPA had an estimate on whether the new proposal would result in many new coal plants being built, Wheeler said that was not up to the agency.  “We are not picking winners and losers here,” he said. Jay Duffy, a legal associate at Clean Air Task Force, said lifting the carbon emissions limit failed to satisfy clean air law requirements for the best available emissions technology. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, applauded the EPA’s proposal, saying it would help families working in the coal industry in his state of Kentucky.  “Coal deserves a level playing field, and that’s what this White House is trying to accomplish,” McConnell said.

2018-12-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will close the Eiffel Tower and other tourism landmarks in Paris and draft in thousands more security forces on Saturday to stave off another wave of violent protests in the country over living costs.  With protesters from the “yellow vest” movement calling on social media for “Act IV” - a fourth weekend of protest - Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said 89,000 police nationwide would be deployed to stop a repeat of last Saturday’s mayhem across France. About 8,000 of these would be deployed in Paris where rioters torched cars and looted shops off the famed Champs Elysees boulevard, and defaced the Arc de Triomphe with graffiti directed at President Emmanuel Macron. Seeking to regain the initiative after weeks of civil unrest, the government appeared ready to offer concessions. Philippe told the Senate he was open to new measures to help the lowest-paid workers while Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was prepared to accelerate tax cuts for households and that he wanted workers’ bonuses to be tax-free. “I am ready to look at all measures that will help raise the pay of those on the minimum wage without doing excessive damage to our competitiveness and businesses,” Philippe told the parliament’s upper house. The rush of sweeteners to soothe public anger began with Philippe’s climb-down on fuel tax hikes, the first major U-turn of Macron’s presidency.  Yet, five days after the worst rioting central Paris has seen since 1968, all signs are that the government has failed to quell the revolt. A repeat of last Saturday’s violence in Paris’s city centre would deal a blow to the economy and raise doubts over the government’s survival. Philippe said the state would do all it could to maintain order. Six first division football matches have been cancelled. Authorities in Paris ordered dozens of museums, tourism sites, shops and restaurants to close on Saturday, including the Eiffel Tower and Louvre. Local officials in 15 areas around the capital were also asked to remove anything in the streets that could be used as projectiles. “We are facing people who are not here to protest, but to smash and we want to have the means to not give them a free rein,” Philippe told TF1 television’s evening news programme. As well as increased police numbers, twelve armoured vehicles belonging to the gendarmerie would be used, the first time in a French city since 2005 when riots broke out in the capital’s suburbs. There is concern about far-right, anarchist and anti-capitalist groups like the Black Bloc, which have piggybacked off the ‘yellow vest’ movement. The government is also considering using troops currently deployed on anti-terrorism patrols to protect public buildings.  Other towns across the country, including Bordeaux, ordered pre-emptive measures over concerns that protesters may opt to rally regionally rather than face tightened security in Paris. On Facebook and across social media, protesters called for “Act IV”. “France is fed up!! We will be there in bigger numbers, stronger, standing up for French people. Meet in Paris on Dec. 8,” read one group’s banner. The protests, named after the fluorescent safety jackets French motorists have to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes. Demonstrations swiftly grew into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron, with no formal leader. Their demands are diverse and include lower taxes, higher salaries, cheaper energy costs, better retirement provisions and even Macron’s resignation. Reversing course on next year’s fuel-tax hikes have left a gaping 4 billion euro hole in the government’s 2019 budget which it is now searching for ways to plug.  Citing unnamed sources, Les Echos business daily said the government was considering delaying corporate tax easing planned next year or putting off an increase in the minimum wage. The unrest has exposed the deep-seated resentment among non-city dwellers that Macron, whose popularity is now at about 20 percent, is out-of-touch with the hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar workers. They see the 40-year-old former investment banker as closer to big business. Trouble is also brewing elsewhere for Macron. Teenage students on Thursday blocked access to more than 200 high schools across the country and clashed with security forces. About 700 students were arrested, French media reported.  Farmers and truckers are also threatening blockages and strikes from Sunday.

2018-12-06,"* Wall Street swamped by fresh U.S.-China trade worries * Arrest of Huawei CFO seen heightening U.S-China tension * Adds to investor worries over trade outlook, global growth * Oil sinks after OPEC delays output decision * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout with afternoon trading, oil report) By Laila Kearney NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Stock markets around world slid on Thursday as the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive cast further shadows on U.S.-China trade relations, while oil prices sank after OPEC delayed an output decision. The arrest of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co. Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada for extradition to the United States came as Washington and Beijing prepared for talks aimed at resolving a bitter trade spat. Sources familiar with the probe told Reuters Meng was arrested as part of a U.S. investigation of an alleged scheme to use the global banking system to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran. Wall Street tumbled in early trade before paring some losses by the afternoon. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 351.2 points, or 1.4 percent, to 24,675.87, the S&P 500 lost 34.86 points, or 1.29 percent, to 2,665.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 44.40 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,114.03. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 3.09 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.68 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.08 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.91 percent. “Clearly, the Huawei CFO arrest was the individual catalyst that caused today’s moves lower,” said Mark Hackett, chief of investment research at Nationwide. Canadian authorities late on Wednesday said they had arrested Meng, also the daughter of Huawei’s founder, on Dec. 1, the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina. The world’s two economic superpowers had agreed on a 90-day trade truce period to hammer out a more permanent agreement, which sent global stock markets soaring on Monday. Equities reversed course the next day as uncertainty grew that the world’s two largest economies could, in fact, find common ground. “The potential slowdown in global growth is also something the markets are pricing in,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. Earlier this week, shorter-dated yields rose above medium-dated yields for the first time since early 2008, which fanned fears about a U.S. recession in the coming months and also sent Wall Street shares sliding. U.S. Treasury yields pared some of the decline as Wall Street trimmed losses after flailing early in the day, with 10-year yields hitting three-month lows as worries about U.S.-China trade and Brexit spurred safe-haven bids. Additionally, traders scaled back expectations on the number of rate hikes the Federal Reserve would implement amid weakening economic data and market volatility. U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any serious weakness, markets are likely to react, said Shuji Shirota, HSBC’s head of macro economic strategy. The U.S. dollar fell against major peers on lower Treasury yields and as traders scaled back rate hike expectations. The euro was 0.32 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1380. Gold prices, which move inversely with the dollar, held near a five-month peak as the greenback and equities slipped. Oil prices fell about 3 percent in choppy trading after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended a meeting without making a decision on crude output. OPEC met in Vienna to decide on production policy in coordination with other countries, including Russia, Oman and Kazakhstan. The organization said it had agreed on a tentative deal to cut oil output but had not yet come up with a final figure. U.S. crude settled down 2.65 percent at $51.49 per barrel and Brent was last at $60.06, down 2.44 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Marc Jones, Lewis Krauskopf, Shreyashi

2018-12-06,"(Reuters) - The United States last week exported more crude oil and fuel than it imported for the first time on record, according to data released on Thursday, the same day OPEC ended a meeting without a decision to curb global output to balance out the historic surge in U.S. supply. When adding in all imports and exports of crude and refined products, the U.S. exported a net 211,000 barrels per day for the week through Nov. 30 – the first time that has happened, according to U.S. Energy Department figures dating to 1973. That was on the back of a jump in crude exports to a weekly record of more than 3.2 million bpd.  “So when does the U.S. send a delegate to OPEC meetings?” said Kyle Cooper, consultant at ION Energy in Houston. “It’s really quite amazing. I do think that will occur more and more often in coming years.”              The United States historically has been a heavy importer of crude oil in part due to a four-decade ban on crude exports that was lifted in late 2015 by then-President Barack Obama.  Petroleum exports until recently were dominated by products like gasoline and diesel, but that has changed since the U.S. shale revolution that has sped up drilling and extraction of oil, helping boost overall U.S. production to a record 11.7 million bpd.     The data comes on the same day that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries adjourned a meeting without announcing a supply-cut agreement as it grapples with sinking prices due in part to the surge in U.S. output that has upended the global supply equation. Crude inventories fell 7.3 million barrels last week, the first drawdown since September, as net crude imports hit a record low of 4 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Thursday. (Graphic: U.S. turns into net exporter of oil - tmsnrt.rs/2Rz57Xn) U.S. crude prices have sagged almost a third since hitting a four-year high near $76 a barrel in October. That was in part due to concerns about oversupply coming to the fore again as U.S. production rose in tandem with increased output from Saudi Arabia and Russia. The three countries are the world’s largest producers of oil. That has created a dilemma for Saudi-led OPEC, which wants to maintain higher prices but avoid ceding more market share to shale producers. On Thursday, OPEC adjourned its meeting in Vienna, aiming to reach an agreement with Russia on Friday. “It seems EIA has a habit of sending bad news to OPEC during its Vienna meetings. In the past, it has been surging U.S. production numbers. But this time was truly remarkable and historic showing data for net crude imports as -211,000 bpd,” said Joe McMonigle, analyst at Hedgeye in Washington.  U.S. crude production is expected to average more than 12 million bpd in 2019, according to the EIA, an increase of more than 3 million bpd in 2016. Shale production surged in the early part of the decade as companies started to use hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to extract oil in basins in Texas, North Dakota and other states.  U.S. output rose to 9.7 million bpd in mid-2015, just shy of the nation’s all-time high set in 1970, but fell off when OPEC flooded the world markets with supply to try to hinder the shale industry. But OPEC was forced to curb output in 2016 as oil-producing nations faced budget shortfalls, and as prices recovered, shale’s output accelerated. “Every single month, every single year, we’re going to become more of a global pie and that’s a part of the pie you can’t control - it’s completely different than the OPEC piece,” said Bernadette Johnson, vice president in market intelligence at Drillinginfo in Denver.  For the week, the United States also posted net exports of 4.2 million bpd of products like gasoline and diesel.  The weekly figures are subject to wide fluctuations, however, so the sudden shift may be a temporary occurrence. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston, said he was not surprised this happened in the winter, a seasonally slow period for domestic gasoline demand. U.S. oil prices ended Thursday lower, due to concern that planned OPEC production cuts will be smaller than originally anticipated. U.S. crude futures lost 2.7 percent on the day, while Brent crude dropped by 2.4 percent.

2018-12-06,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors are wary that a 30 percent slump in oil prices will pressure corporate profits while also presenting a sign of weakness in global growth at a time they are already weighing when the long economic expansion will end. Oil prices fell further on Thursday as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries met in Vienna. OPEC and allied exporting countries ended the meeting without announcing a decision to cut crude output, and prepared to debate the matter the next day. [nL8N1YB1II] Oil's drop holds economic benefits, including lower costs for some companies and cheaper fuel prices for consumers. But investors were already bracing for a significant drop in U.S. profit growth next year, and the oil price slump is poised to bite into profits for energy producers and related companies that are part of Wall Street's benchmark S&P 500 stock index .SPX. OPEC and allied producers used output cuts to curb an oil glut that sent prices from late 2014 into a prolonged slump, bringing prices to below $30 a barrel at the start of 2016. But supplies are growing again, and the U.S.-China trade war and other factors have investors worried that slowing economic growth could erase demand and send prices still lower. “What started the sell-off on oil was a supply issue,” said Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “In the last couple of weeks, what we are getting is fears of slowing demand. And fears of slowing demand are directly related to fears of global growth slowdown.” Crude oil prices have fallen 30 percent or more 13 times since 1982, according to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Of the prior 12 occurrences, the oil drop overlapped eight times with what Ned Davis Research defines as a cyclical bear market - a 30 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI after 50 calendar days or a 13 percent decline after 145 calendar days. However, finds Clissold, in only three of those cases did the oil decline overlap with a U.S. economic recession. Futures contracts for U.S. crude CLc1, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), topped $75 a barrel in early October. The commodity slid to as low as $49.41 last week, and was trading just above $50 on Thursday. Brent LCOc1, the global crude benchmark, has notched a similar percentage drop. “Somewhere in the $50-60 level, it’s probably a good level for the market, because producers are making enough money and it’s also helping the consumer,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “But if you see an abrupt move down, the bigger concern is what is that signalling about the global economy.” Oil's decline has coincided with increased turbulence in the stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX late last month confirmed a correction, a decline of more than 10 percent from its all-time high. Still, investor optimism about a less aggressive path of U.S. interest-rate hikes prompted a modest market rebound.  Both oil and equities markets have been focused on international trade, China’s economic health and the global economy, said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. “For the near term, the two are very closely correlated,” Katz said.       Since oil’s October peak, the S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY has dropped about 19 percent, twice the drop for the overall S&P 500. Analysts have been lowering earnings estimates for the sector, with S&P 500 energy companies now expected to increase earnings by 21.1 percent in 2019, down from an expectation of 26.2 percent on Oct 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Many investors see positives in the oil drop, including a potential stimulus for consumer spending through lower gasoline prices. Lower fuel prices could help check inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to slow its program of U.S. interest rate hikes. But David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS, estimates that every $5 per barrel decline in oil prices shaves $1 to $1.50 per share from S&P 500 earnings. The S&P 500 is expected to earn $162.83 per share this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.     That earnings impact includes not just energy companies, but also industrial manufacturers that service the energy sector. It also accounts for any earnings boost for companies like airlines and consumer companies that benefit from lower fuel prices. “The S&P is much more of a commodity producer than a commodity user,” Bianco said. “Higher commodity prices bring higher profits and lower commodity prices bring lower profits...This is one of the most reliable relationships when it comes to corporate profitability of them all.” Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-oil/analysis-oils-sharp-price-drop-fuels-questions-for-stock-market-idUKL1N1YB0TD,06 Dec 2018,"U.S. stock investors are wary

2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators, bent on punishing Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, said on Thursday they want to vote next week to penalize Riyadh, but struggled to agree on how best to do so. Despite President Donald Trump’s desire to maintain close ties to Saudi Arabia, several of his fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in blaming the crown prince for Khashoggi’s death and backing legislation to respond by ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led war effort in Yemen, imposing new sanctions and stopping weapons sales. But others strongly oppose linking the Yemen conflict with the killing of the journalist. “It would be a mistake to fracture that relationship with the Saudis. It’s not based on friendship as much as it’s based on common interests, combating extremism in the Middle East and countering the Iranian threat,” said Senator John Cornyn, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican. Five Republican and Democratic senators met behind closed doors on Thursday morning to discuss how to move ahead, saying afterward they had not yet come up with a compromise that could win enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate. The lack of agreement contrasted with some senators’ harsh words on Tuesday against the crown prince, the de facto ruler of the kingdom who has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi on Oct. 2 in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.  A briefing by Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel for senators on Tuesday hardened their resolve to act against the prince known as MbS, who has the support of Trump. There are three different measures making their way through the Senate: a war powers resolution ending any U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict, legislation imposing a broad clampdown on Saudi Arabia, including ending arms sales and levying new sanctions; and a nonbinding resolution targeting the crown prince.  The Senate is expected to vote on the war powers resolution next week, but lawmakers have not yet agreed on how, or whether, it should be amended. Some have questioned whether the resolution is even legal, and others said they want a response to Khashoggi’s death but agree with the Trump administration that Washington should continue to back the Saudis as an essential counterweight to Iran. Saudi Arabia is leading a campaign in Yemen against the Houthis, Shi’ite Muslim fighters that Yemen’s neighbours view as agents of Iran. The war has killed more than 10,000 people and created the world’s most urgent humanitarian crisis. Fourteen Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate and rarely break from the president, have already defied Trump and voted with Democrats in favour of moving ahead with the war powers resolution. But to become law, the resolution would not just have to pass the Senate this month, but also must pass the House of Representatives and be signed by Trump, neither of which is expected this year. However, backers said Senate passage alone would still be an important step. “A vote on the resolution is a very tough message to Saudi Arabia that the relationship is changing. And you can interpret that as a message on the Yemen war, but you can also interpret that as a message on Khashoggi,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, a co-sponsor, told reporters. It was not immediately clear whether the broader legislation would come up for a Senate vote before lawmakers go home for the year and a new Congress is seated in January, or whether some provisions might be added to the war powers measure. Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who is retiring this month, said he hoped to hold a hearing early next week on the broader legislation. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the most vocal critics of Saudi Arabia who is close to Trump, introduced the Senate resolution with two other Republicans and three Democrats. That measure is intended to hold the Saudi crown prince “accountable” for contributing to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, a blockade of Qatar, the jailing of dissidents and Khashoggi’s death but it imposes no penalties on Riyadh. Graham said he supported the idea of stopping U.S. aid for the war in Yemen, but thought the war powers resolution was not constitutional. Many lawmakers have been calling for months for an end to U.S. refueling of Saudi jets that bomb Yemen, often killing civilians. But the murder of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist, added to frustration with the kingdom and prompted even stronger demands for a shift in relations.

2018-12-06,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 6 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - D eveloping countries with fewer resources to cut carbon emissions and adapt to climate change cannot step up their efforts to combat global warming unless they get more support in the form of funding and technology, they said on Thursday. India will deliver on what it has promised to do under the 2015 Paris Agreement by boosting renewable energy production, expanding forests, and generating fewer emissions in relation to its gross domestic product, its chief negotiator AK Mehta said. “We are very certain that we will not renege on our commitment - we will do what is required,” he told journalists on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland. The U.S.-based Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said this month that India is on track to achieve two of its three targets well ahead of a 2030 deadline. But it faces challenges in doing so, Mehta emphasised. If the South Asian nation wanted to step up its efforts on solar power in a big way, for example, it would need assistance with energy storage technology, he noted. India met a 2020 goal of installing 20 gigawatts of solar power four years early, and is now aiming for 100 gigawatts by 2022, making it one of the world’s most ambitious adopters. But as nations around the world try to move toward a common goal of reducing emissions, “everybody is not similarly placed” in their ability to make those cuts, Mehta said. More than 190 countries are meeting in the coal-mining town of Katowice through Dec. 14 to hammer out rules that will enable the Paris accord to be put into practice from 2020, and spur countries to strengthen their current climate action plans. Current pledges to cut emissions would lead to global warming of about 3 degrees Celsius this century, scientists say. Under the Paris deal, governments have pledged to hold temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees C above pre-industrial times, and ideally to 1.5 degrees C. The world has already warmed about 1 degree C, scientists say. On Wednesday, a scientific report said global carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise nearly 3 percent this year due to continued fossil fuel use, dashing hopes an increase in 2017 was temporary after two years of slowdown. That, and other recent U.N. reports, have underlined the urgency of ramping up efforts to reduce emissions - and, under the Paris Agreement, countries are expected to increase the ambition of their emissions-cutting plans by 2020. At stake in Katowice is how they do that. The guidelines decided at the talks will be crucial to sharing the burden of the work, with poorer countries saying they need more financial help to do their part. For the least developed nations, funding is a key piece in the puzzle that will enable them to deliver on their pledges, said Gebru Jember Endalew, who chairs the group of 47 states. “Increasing your ambition on your (climate action) plan alone will not be the right answer. There needs to be ambition in terms of increasing financial support,” the Ethiopian said. The U.N. climate talks have long tangled over how rich countries will meet a promise to raise $100 billion a year from 2020 to help developing countries go green and cope with wild weather. The latest figures show climate finance is rising but there is no agreement on what should be counted towards that goal. A report issued by UN Environment on Thursday said there is a considerable gap between countries’ current preparedness for climate change and the actual measures needed to get communities ready for a future of increasing climate risks. While low- and middle-income countries have shown steady progress, catching up with wealthier nations in their ability to adapt “will take many decades” unless help increases, it said. Funding flows for adaptation are “significantly lower” than the needs outlined in national action plans, it noted. In Katowice, some rich countries are resisting pressure to project how much they will contribute in the future, saying they cannot forecast that far ahead due to short budget cycles. But Endalew said projected amounts would only be indicative and should not cause political problems back in capitals. Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF’s global climate lead, said meeting the $100 billion annual goal from 2020-2025 was an important political signal. But genuinely reworking energy systems and making the world safer would take much more money, he suggested. “After 2025, we should be finding ways to shift the trillions (of dollars)” that are “the only way to really address climate change”, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Pulgar-Vidal, who as a former Peruvian environment minister presided over the Lima talks in 2014, said the only way to ensure national climate action plans are boosted enough to meet the Paris goals was to agree a “strong rulebook” in Katowice. “If we fail on that, we can’t keep the 1.5C promise, and we are going to postpone solutions,” he warned. Both Mehta and Endalew said they were optimistic the talks could achieve a satisfactory rulebook, even if some finer details remained to be settled later. Mehta said India’s existing climate plan was already “very ambitious”, and it was too early to say whether it could be improved on by 2020. But “we will be willing to engage if the rules of the game are clear, and if it is an inclusive process”, he said. Achim Steiner, head of the United Nations Development Programme, said India and China should do more because renewables and energy efficiency offer significant economic opportunities. But there was little point in governments lecturing one another on levels of ambition, he noted. ""Let's invest in strengthening the public policy that allows a country to begin to accelerate efforts,"" he said in a phone interview from New York.

2018-12-06,"VIENNA (Reuters) - OPEC tentatively agreed to an oil output cut on Thursday but was waiting for a commitment from non-OPEC heavyweight Russia before deciding the exact volumes for a production reduction aimed at propping up crude prices, two sources from the group said. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak flew home from Vienna earlier for talks with President Vladimir Putin in St Petersburg. Novak returns to Austria’s capital for discussions among Saudi-led OPEC and the group’s allies on Friday. The price of crude has fallen almost a third since October but U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries make oil even cheaper by refraining from output cuts. “We still want Russia to cut as much as possible,” Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters as the OPEC meeting concluded without yielding concrete figures. “I’m not confident but I hope to reach a deal ... Hopefully, he (Novak) will come tonight,” Falih said. Possible output cuts by OPEC and its allies range from 0.5-1.5 million bpd. A reduction of 1 million bpd would be acceptable and so far was the main scenario, Falih said.  Brent oil futures LCOc1 fell as much as 5 percent to below $59 per barrel on fears that there could be no deal but later recovered somewhat, trading down 3.5 percent at 1720 GMT. [O/R] “One million bpd may disappoint many. But should the cut be from a September or October baseline, rather than November, the net impact would be sufficient to limit storage builds,” Greg Sharenow, executive vice-president for Pimco, said on the sidelines of the OPEC meeting. “It is unlikely to spark a meaningful price rally, but also will not be so dire either. In many respects it is the middle road, which may be the optimal solution,” said Sharenow, who helps manage a $15 billion commodities fund at the $1.77 trillion U.S. investment management firm. OPEC delegates have said the group and its allies could cut by 1 million bpd if Russia contributed 150,000 bpd of that reduction. If Russia contributed around 250,000 bpd, the overall cut could exceed 1.3 million bpd.  Novak said on Thursday that Russia would find it harder to cut oil output in winter than other producers because of the cold weather. Oil prices have crashed as Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates raised output since June after Trump called for higher production to offset lower exports from Iran, OPEC’s third-largest producer.

The United States is not part of any output-limiting initiative due to its anti-trust legislation and fragmented oil industry. On Thursday, U.S. government figures showed the country had become a net exporter of crude oil and refined products for the first time on record, underscoring how the surge in production has altered the supply equation in world markets. Graphic: OPEC* crude production in November - Reuters Survey - tmsnrt.rs/2RqgctQ Iranian exports have plummeted after the United States imposed fresh sanctions on Tehran in November. But Washington gave sanctions waivers to some buyers of Iranian crude, further raising fears of an oil glut next year. “Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The world does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!” Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Thursday he would support a cut as long as Iran did not need to reduce its own output. Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer Ghadhban said Iraq as OPEC’s second-largest producer would support and join a cut. Possibly complicating any OPEC decision is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. Trump has backed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh.

2018-12-06,"LIMA (Reuters) - Peru has joined the club of countries cracking down on plastic. A new law in the South American nation of 32 million people outlaws the manufacturing, importation, distribution and consumption of single-use plastic bags within three years. Straws and other plastic products that cannot be recycled will also be prohibited. The phase-out was proposed by the government of centrist President Martin Vizcarra and sailed through the opposition-controlled Congress late on Wednesday. The law’s unanimous passage underscored growing support for efforts to tackle mounting plastic waste that winds up in oceans, rivers and soil and makes its way into the food chain. More than 60 countries now have bans or taxes on single-use plastics, according to the United Nations, which has called for such measures to stem the tide of pollution. Of the 9 billion tonnes of plastic the world has produced, only 9 percent has been recycled, the United Nations has said. Peru, a tourist destination celebrated for its seafood dish ceviche, has some 1,500 miles of Pacific coastline. The environment ministry has promoted the use of reusable bags with the campaign “I don’t want this in my ceviche.” “This cultural change relies on our daily decisions and convictions,” Environment Minister Fabiola Munoz said on Twitter.

The arrest of smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Co.’s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhouof in Canada for extradition to the United States came as Washington and Beijing prepared for key talks aimed at resolving a bitter trade spat. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 679.46 points, or 2.71 percent, to 24,347.61, the S&P 500 lost 67.8 points, or 2.51 percent, to 2,632.26 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 139.83 points, or 1.95 percent, to 7,018.60. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 2.53 percent, while the pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 3.31 percent. Emerging market stocks lost 2.76 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 2.28 percent lower, while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.91 percent. Canadian authorities late on Wednesday said they had arrested Meng, also the daughter of Huawei’s founder, on Dec. 1, the same day that U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping met at the G20 summit in Argentina. The world’s two economic superpowers had agreed on a 90-day trade truce period to hammer out a more permanent agreement, which sent global stock markets soaring on Monday. Equities reversed course the next day as uncertainty grew that the U.S. and China could, in fact, find common ground. “In general, we all have the same questions we did on Tuesday,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. “The news on Huawei throws another level of uncertainty on our ability to actually come to some agreement with China.” China’s foreign ministry said neither Canada nor the United States had clarified the reason for the arrest, but a source earlier told Reuters it was related to violations of U.S. sanctions. Earlier this week, shorter-dated yields rose above medium yields for the first time since early 2008, which fanned fears about a U.S. recession in the coming months and also sent Wall Street shares sliding. U.S. Treasury yields tumbled on Thursday with 10-year yields hitting three-month lows as worries about U.S.-China trade and Brexit spurred safe-haven bids. Additionally, traders scaled back expectations on the number of rate hikes the Federal Reserve would implement amid weakening economic data and market volatility. U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any serious weakness, markets are likely to react, said Shuji Shirota, HSBC’s head of macro economic strategy. The U.S. dollar weakened against major peers as Treasury yields slipped and traders scaled back rate hike expectations. The euro was 0.39 percent higher against the dollar at $1.1388. Also pulling down equity markets were oil prices. Oil fell more than 4 percent in choppy trading after OPEC ended a key meeting having made no decision on crude output, as it prepared to debate the matter with other exporters the next day. An OPEC delegate said the organisation had agreed a tentative deal to cut oil output but had not yet come up with a final figure. U.S. crude sank 4.65 percent to $50.43 per barrel and Brent was last at $58.86, down 4.39 percent on the day. The two have lost 30 percent in value this quarter alone, but this week’s OPEC meeting could bring more surprises. “The real impact of the meeting will be evident (on Friday) following the release of the OPEC+ joint declaration,” said Abhishek Kumar, Senior Energy Analyst at Interfax Energy.

2018-12-06,"NEW DELHI, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The Indian government on Thursday approved a plan by one state-owned lender to the power industry, Power Finance Corp to acquire a majority stake in a similar government-controlled lender, REC Ltd , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. The government did not disclose the price of the 52.63 percent stake but based on REC’s closing share price on Thursday, it would be worth around 108 billion rupees ($1.52 billion). The sale may allow the government to say that it is getting closer to meeting its target of raising 800 billion rupees through the sale of government stakes in various entities in the year ending March 31, 2019. PFC will have management control of REC, Jaitley told a news conference, adding that a ministerial panel will work out the pricing and other aspects of the deal. Jaitley had previously announced that the government would support mergers and acquisitions in cases where state-owned companies operated in the same area. Before the announcement, which followed a cabinet meeting, the government had raised 327.37 billion rupees from the sale of government stakes during the current fiscal year, according to an official website. If it falls short of the target, the government could struggle to meet its goal of bringing the fiscal deficit down to 3.3 percent of GDP in this fiscal year. However, because the sale involves two state-controlled entities, critics of the government’s privatisation programme say that any gains the administration of Prime Minister Narendara Modi seeks to book are not credible as the money would merely have gone from one pocket to another. “The acquisition is driven by the government’s intent to meet its disinvest target ... Instead of a sovereign money, it is a quasi-sovereign money. It is just creating a book entry,” said stock market expert Ajay Bagga. The government owns 66 percent of PFC. It would not be the first time that the government has sold a state-owned asset to another government entity and sought to count the proceeds towards its target. In the previous fiscal year the government sold its 51 percent stake in Hindustan Petroleum Corp to state-owned explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp. India’s April-October fiscal deficit was 103.9 percent of the target, indicating that the government - which faces a general election by May next year - must boost its tax and non-tax revenue to fund various welfare schemes.

2018-12-06,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela has signed deals securing investment from Russia in the South American country’s oil and gold sectors, President Nicolas Maduro said on Thursday at the end of a three-day trip to Moscow.  “We have signed contracts to guarantee investments of more than $5 billion with our Russian partners in joint ventures to raise oil production,” Maduro said in a video posted on his Twitter account. “We are also guaranteeing an investment of $1 billion for mining, mostly in gold.”  Maduro did not provide specifics about where the investments would be made or how much money Russian companies would contribute. Venezuela’s Information and Oil Ministries did not immediately respond to requests for additional details.  With Venezuela’s oil output collapsing amid hyperinflation and a fifth year of economic contraction, Maduro flew to Moscow on Monday to meet with his counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The two planned to discuss financial help for Caracas and cooperation on oil and gas, a Kremlin aide said. Russia has become a key lender of last resort for cash-strapped Venezuela in recent years, but Maduro’s government has struggled to pay its debts. The head of Russian oil company Rosneft flew to Caracas last month to press Maduro over delayed oil shipments aimed at repaying loans. “Russia and Venezuela are more united than ever,” Maduro said. Maduro has also sought to boost the country’s gold output as an alternative source of hard currency as revenue from oil, which makes up over 90 percent of exports, dries up. The United States has sought to restrict Venezuela’s gold trade through sanctions.

2018-12-06,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa’s government is discussing restructuring the debt of state-run utility Eskom but will only give details of what it plans to do next year, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan said on Thursday, in comments which sent Eskom’s bonds tumbling. The cash-strapped power firm said this week that it wanted the government to take on 100 billion rand ($7.1 billion) of its debts, about a quarter of its total borrowings of 420 billion rand. It is also eyeing a steep hike in tariffs in 2019 from the energy regulator. “That brings me to the last question about debt restructuring. That’s an issue that is being discussed in government and some time in the New Year government as a whole will give you some idea of where we are going,” Gordhan told a news conference. “It’s work in progress. We’re dealing with 400 billion rand of debt and its not something you can deal with easily.” “There is no possibility of haircuts,” Gordhan added, declining to elaborate on which Eskom debt instruments could be restructured or the maturities of those instruments. Eskom’s bonds fell sharply in response to the talk of restructuring, with its 2028 dollar-denominated bond  ZA186452275= sliding as much as 2.3 cents to an all-time low. The rand ZAR=D3 also slipped, adding to earlier losses to fall 2 percent to session low of 14.1500 per dollar. The idea of moving Eskom’s debt on to government’s balance sheet has unnerved investors as it puts even more pressure on South Africa’s sovereign credit ratings, already rated in sub-investment grade by two of the top three agencies. “Eskom poses a huge risk to the economy and the credit rating,” said independent energy analyst Mike Levington. “Moving 100 billion rand of the debt isn’t going to solve its systemic problems. It’s ability to raise capital is fast diminishing,” Levington said. Africa’s most industrialized economy has experienced a week of nationwide power outages, which Eskom has blamed on low coal supplies as well as maintenance of its ageing fleet of power stations. That has taken the shine off data showing the economy had emerged from recession. President Cyril Ramaphosa is at pains to kick-start economic growth by luring foreign investment ahead of national elections expected in May next year. But the South African economy is set to grow well below 1 percent in 2018. Growth could be dragged lower next year if power outages persist.

2018-12-06,"* “Yellow vest” movement caught Macron off guard * President gave in to its demand to scrap fuel tax rise * Movement unites people with various backgrounds and views * Some members look ahead to European Parliament elections By Michel Rose and Luke Baker PARIS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - It began as a home-spun Facebook campaign against French fuel tax increases. But in a few weeks it has spiralled into a movement powerful enough to force Emmanuel Macron into the biggest U-turn of his presidency. Yet the “yellow-vest” movement — named for the fluorescent jackets carried by French motorists — remains an amorphous, hard-to-define group with a rapidly shifting agenda. It has no leader. It named eight spokespeople, some of whom disagreed with each other and one of whom was promptly sacked. Members are broadly opposed to decision-making authority. One of its originators, a 51-year-old accordionist from Brittany called Jacline Mouraud who also works in hypnotherapy and makes YouTube videos, received death threats after suggesting the movement should talk to the government. Anyone who has a “gilet jaune” — and most people in France suddenly seem to — can put it on and become part of the movement, meaning it brings together people of hugely different ages, social classes, occupations and views. This is its strength but also its weakness. The government does not know who to engage with, even though the movement has drawn hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets, closing roads and fuel depots, and spurring riots and violence in the capital Paris on successive weekends. Since Macron gave in to the movement’s main demand on Wednesday by scrapping a fuel-tax increase set for January, the “yellow vests” have also been trying to agree on other issues to fight for — from boosting household incomes to reinstating a wealth tax or ousting Macron. “He betrayed us. He was elected promising to blow out political parties, no left, no right, to reconnect political power with the people,” Christophe Chalençon, a blacksmith from Provence in southern France who has become one of the more recognisable faces of the movement, told Reuters. “He’s done the opposite. We’re only the mirror of what he had proposed, what he sold to us. We need a new representative body,” said Chalencon, who has been criticised for postings on social media that some have seen as anti-Muslim. In an age of a populist backlash against globalisation in the Western world, the “yellow vest” movement shares many features with other populist forces, such as the Occupy movement in the United States and Italy’s Five-Star, which now governs. An opinion poll published by the Elabe Institute on Wednesday showed that in the presidential election in May 2017, many in the movement voted for candidates on the far-left or far-right, although many also didn’t vote. They mostly have a high-school diploma or a lower level of education and live in tight financial circumstances, often in rural or outer-urban areas, where depending on a car to get to work or go to the shops is essential, and increasingly costly. There is a high level of solidarity among volunteers who mount roadblocks, share food and post pictures together online. Polls show they still have the backing of about 70 percent of the population, despite the violence in Paris which the government blamed on “extremist” groups”. Some government officials play down the prospects of such a diverse movement uniting as a political force. “For the time being, no, they’re having trouble just structuring themselves,” a government source said. But, with elections to the European parliament coming up next May, others warn against complacency, especially as Macron was taken off guard by the protest. Some members of Macron’s team say privately they did not expect the planned rise in fuel prices to be more politically explosive than other reforms. Macron himself rose to power barely a year after creating his own movement, En Marche, in 2016 on a promise to be “neither of the left nor the right” and to introduce a new style of politics. His campaign book was called “Revolution”. The “yellow vests” do not have the same education or work background as Macron — he had experience in government as a former economy minister. Yet ironically, they are using some of the same techniques as he used on social media and echoing some of the anti-establishment rhetoric. “The yellow vests are a political movement, we need to stop feeling sorry for them,” Bruno Bonnell, a lawmaker in En Marche (On The Move) and an early follower of Macron, said. “In three weeks, it’s transformed itself into the fiery core of a strong populist movement,” he said. “It reminds me of the start of En Marche. They’re our future opposition.” Macron enjoyed high ratings at the start of his presidency and managed to ram through changes to France’s labour code. But his brash style alienated some voters and changes to a tax to reduce the burden on the wealthy earned him the label “president of the rich”. His ratings now hover in the low-20s and he is battling to keep his reform agenda on track. His biggest threat now is from a popular national uprising that, while not associated with a political party, has elements that sympathize with the far-right and far-left and want a radical shake-up — the sort of new politics U.S. President Donald Trump and his former strategist Steve Bannon advocate. “We can already see they (“yellow vests”) have huge appeal but this is because they are apolitical and can genuinely say they have nothing to do with political parties,” said Charles Lichfield, Europe analyst at Eurasia Group risk consultancy. “For the ‘gilets jaunes’ to become a political force, they need to accept the notion of leadership and get over the fact that their chosen leaders will need to balance between various contradictory demands.” France, a nation built on revolution, is not new to populist uprisings. In the 1950s, a shopkeeper called Pierre Poujade spurred anti-tax, anti-elite protests which eventually secured 52 seats in the French parliament in the 1956 election. Although Poujadism, as it became known, eventually faded from view when war-hero Charles de Gaulle returned to power, it left a lasting legacy. The youngest member of its deputies was Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the far-right National Front. One of the “yellow vests”, Andre Lannee, has launched Facebook pages for protesters to elect two representatives per region. Another, Jean-Francois Bernaba, has said he is working on a list of candidates for the European Parliament elections, in which French voters traditionally back more populist parties. Asked to assess the “yellow vests’” chances of contesting the European Parliament elections, which are based on a system of proportional representation, Lichfield said they would first have to organise quickly and find a charismatic leader. “They will understand that a proportional ballot gives them their best chance of making a splash,” he said.

2018-12-06,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy’s ruling parties were at odds on Thursday over an amendment to the 2019 budget law, introduced this week, that would raise taxes on traditional fossil-fueled cars. Late on Tuesday, Italy’s Lower House Budget Committee approved subsidies of up to 6,000 euros ($6,804) for those who buy low-emission vehicles, but at the same time it added a surcharge of up to 3,000 euros on sales of petrol and diesel cars. The new rules had been encouraged by Italy’s ruling 5-Star Movement, a pro-environment party, but on Thursday its coalition partner slammed the planned tax increase.  “I’m absolutely against any new tax on cars, which are already among the most taxed in the whole of Europe,” League party leader Matteo Salvini said in an interview with Radio Rai1, adding that people who turned to more polluting models did so out of necessity, not choice.    Before forming the government together in June and having a common policy platform, dubbed as “the contract with Italians”, the two parties were rivals and they run separately at local elections.  They have been at loggerheads several times since taking power, including over other measures 5-Star opposes in part for environmental concerns, such as the Franco-Italian high-speed rail link, which the League backs.    Luigi Di Maio, also deputy prime minister and leader of the 5-Star, replied to Salvini, saying the government would improve the measures.  “We do not want to harm families in difficulty .. who pick the cheapest car, nor do we want to create a shock to the Italian car market, to manufacturers or their workers,” Di Maio said on Facebook.  Changes to the amendment would be agreed with consumer associations, sector trade unions, and car producers, he said.  Electric, hybrid and methane gas-powered cars made up 7 percent of Italy’s car sales last month, according to data provided by foreign car manufacturers association UNRAE. However, Italy’s main car manufacturer Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI) does not sell any electric and hybrid cars at present in Europe. The expansionary budget - contested by Brussels for not respecting European rules - is currently being discussed by parliament and is due to receive a final green light by the end of the year.

China’s crackdown on pollution and its growing demand for more environmentally friendly sources of power, such as LNG, are boosting demand for ships to transport the fuel. “We would like to expand the portfolio and there are certain segments that we would like to expand in. One of them is on the LNG side,” Geir Atle Lerkerod, Nordea’s head of shipping for the Nordic region, told Reuters. “We see there is an underlying strong demand over time and we see that going forward as well,” he said on the sidelines of the Nordic bank’s investor event in London this week. LNG shipping officials at the event expected strong markets for the next two years. But they said that, with 40 to 50 LNG ships on order, a further build up of vessels through new ordering could undermine business prospects. Nordea’s shipping and offshore portfolio stands at 9 billion euros ($10.2 billion), with LNG lending accounting for about 15 percent, which includes the financing of specialist floating storage and regassification vessels, Nordea officials said. Thor-Erik Bech, Nordea’s head of international shipping and offshore, said the bank also wanted to boost lending to the dry bulk and tanker industries. “We expect that 2019 and 2020 will be decent years in dry bulk and potentially a surprise on the upside as we have seen now on tankers,” he told Reuters. Slowing orders for dry bulk vessels and tankers have helped boost prospects after years of tough conditions. German banks were once the top global shipping financiers, but they have been exiting the market or are trying to sell billions of euros in loans, much of them non-performing. Bech said Nordea did not want to buy portfolios from other banks. $1 = 0.8820 euros

2018-12-06,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global coal consumption is set to remain steady in absolute terms through the middle of the century, even as its relative share of total energy consumption declines in favour of oil, gas and renewables. The persistence of coal consumption is consistent with the experience of earlier energy transitions and is one of the central challenges for policymakers concerned about climate change. Continued coal combustion is one reason why policymakers are not on track to achieve their target of limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Coal is projected to be the slowest growing primary energy source over the next three decades, with its share of total primary energy consumption expected to decline to just 20 percent by 2050 from 27 percent in 2015. But in absolute terms, global coal consumption is still projected to be around 165 quadrillion British thermal units (BTUs) in 2050 up from 158 quadrillion BTUs in 2015, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Rising consumption in India and other developing economies is expected to offset reduced combustion in the United States and China (“International Energy Outlook”, U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2017). Long-term projections have proved notoriously inaccurate in the past because they are sensitive to small changes in the assumptions underlying the model, so any effort at future-gazing should be treated with caution. But the projections show how the impact of rising populations and prosperity in developing economies is likely to drive an enormous increase in total energy demand which will continue to support absolute coal consumption. Coal consumption is almost certain to remain a major part of the energy mix, especially in poorer countries, even as oil, gas, nuclear and renewables become relatively more important. The persistence of high-levels of coal consumption for many decades is consistent with earlier energy transitions in which incumbent and emerging energy sources and technologies co-existed for long periods. Energy historians have identified a “grand energy transition” in which human and animal muscle power has been successively replaced by wind and water mills, wood burning, coal and more recently oil and gas. At each stage, the dominant source of energy was replaced by a new one that was more convenient, more flexible and offered greater power or more and better energy services for the same cost. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2RE4egu) The same transition can be identified at micro-level for services such as lighting, where tallow candles were gradually replaced by stearin candles, kerosene lamps, gas lighting, incandescent electric bulbs and now light-emitting diodes. By making energy services such as heating, lighting, transportation and power dramatically cheaper, energy transitions have encouraged an enormous increase in total energy consumption (“Heat, power and light: revolutions in energy services”, Fouquet, 2008). In almost every case, the rise in total consumption has resulted in increased use of both the new emerging energy source or technology and the old incumbent one. In the United States, for example, wood burning continued growing for several decades, even as coal emerged as the fastest growing and eventually dominant energy source in the second half of the nineteenth century. Use of fuel wood continued to grow in absolute terms until 1875-1880 even as it declined per capita and as a percentage of total energy consumption continuously from the 1840s (“Fuel wood used in the United States”, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1942). Despite its increasing importance, coal consumption did not finally overtake wood as the dominant source of energy until 1885-1890 (“Energy in the American economy 1850-1975”, Resources for the Future, 1960). Coal itself was not replaced by oil as the dominant source of energy in the United States until 1955, almost a century after the petroleum revolution began with the first modern wells drilled in Pennsylvania. In Britain, the railways, which relied on steam, stimulated rather than replaced horse-drawn vehicles for decades because passengers and freight relied on horse-drawn carriages and carts to get to and from the rail stations. The use of horses, primarily for short journeys, continued to increase into the 1910s, long after the railways had come to dominate long-distance travel in the 1850s (“The transport revolution from 1770”, Bagwell, 1974). In both Britain and the United States, surging demand for lighting provided a growing market for gas and kerosene lamps long after the introduction of the incandescent lightbulb (“Burning to serve”, Goodall, 1999). The lesson from history is that energy transitions take a long time (usually many decades) and in the early and mid-stages the new energy source/technology tends to add to rather than displace the older one. Even once an energy source or technology goes into absolute as well as relative decline, consumption can remain substantial for decades. The United States was still using more fuel wood in the 1910s than it had in the 1840s - even though wood had been clearly overtaken by coal and to a lesser extent petroleum as an energy source. In specific sectors and applications, one energy source or technology can supplant another over a relatively short period of perhaps 20-25 years. But at a macro-level major transitions take much longer with legacy energy sources and technologies lingering for perhaps 50-100 years. The expected persistence of substantial global coal consumption through 2040 and beyond is consistent with the pattern from earlier transitions and poses a major challenge for climate policy.

2018-12-06,"* Iraq needs Iran gas for power stations * Gas output to reach 1.3 mcf/d by 2020 * New gas projects to start output in 2 years (Adds quotes, details, background) By Aref Mohammed BASRA, Iraq, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Iraq needs at least two years to boost the country’s gas production to stop importing Iranian gas used to feed its power stations, a senior Iraqi energy official said on Thursday. Hayan Abdul Ghani, head of state-run South Gas Co. (SGC), told reporters that Iraq’s gas output is expected to reach 1.3 million cubic feet per day by the end of 2020, an increase of 400 mcf/d from current levels. “Iraq’s current production of gas is not enough to meet our power stations’ demand and therefore we are still importing gas from Iran. We need at least 24 months to operate new gas projects and start production,” he said. The United States said last month that Iraq can continue to import natural gas and energy supplies from Iran for a period of 45 days as long as Iraq does not pay Iran in U.S. dollars. Sanctions on Tehran’s oil sector took effect on Nov. 5. Baghdad is seeking to renew and extend the exemption as it needs more time to find an alternative source, Iraqi officials said. Abdul Ghani said the expected rise in gas production would come from two new projects, including a $367 million deal with General Electric reached in April to process natural gas extracted alongside crude oil at two fields in southern Iraq. The project is expected to start producing 160 mcf/d in two years, Abdul Ghani said. Iraq is expected to sign another deal in early 2019 to build the Artawi gas plant in the south which is planned to produce around 300 mcf/d by end 2019. “We are close to signing the Artawi gas project deal with one of the foreign companies in January 2019 to maximise our gas production,” Abdul Ghani said. Iraq’s gas development plans have long focused on BGC, a $17 billion joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell, state-run South Gas Company and Mitsubishi. Abdul Ghani said Iraq is seeking to reach gas production of around 2000 mcf/d by the end of 2023, including 1.43 mcf/d from the Basra Gas Co. and additional 500 mcf/d from other future projects in the south. State-run South Gas Co. is still in talks with U.S. energy company Orion Gas Processors over the economic and technical aspects of a final deal to capture and process 100 million to 150 mcf/d of natural gas extracted from Nahr Bin Omar southern oilfield, the SGC chief said. On Jan. 22, Iraq signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. company to build facilities to capture the gas from the field located in southern Iraq and to transform it into usable fuels.

2018-12-06,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters. ) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 6 (Reuters) - It’s not shaping up as a merry Christmas for coal exporters to Asia as the region’s top buyers, China and India, pull back from the recent trend of strong imports. The Chinese authorities appear to be making good on a commitment to try and limit the country’s imports of the polluting fuel to levels the same as 2017. The restrictions have led to a sharp drop in the daily import of coal so far in December, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. Seaborne imports in the first five days of the month stood at 1.5 million tonnes, or a daily rate of just 300,000 tonnes. This compares to total seaborne imports of 226.2 million tonnes in the first 11 months of 2018, a daily rate of about 677,000 tonnes. The authorities in Beijing have told coal traders and utilities they want imports for the whole year to be similar to the 279 million tonnes in 2017. This is likely going to be a challenge since customs data showed imports for the first 10 months of the year were 252 million tonnes, up 11 percent from the same period in 2017. With vessel-tracking data pointing to November seaborne imports of about 18.3 million tonnes, this would in theory leave only about 9 million tonnes available for December. At the rate of imports for the first five days of December, this may just be possible, as it suggests about 9.3 million tonnes for the month as a whole. However, the ship-tracking data doesn’t cover overland imports, mainly from neighbouring Mongolia, meaning it’s likely that 2018 imports will probably exceed those of 2017. But the sharp reduction in imports so far in December shows Beijing’s message to the industry is being heeded. India, the second-largest coal importer behind China, also appears to be cutting back in December, with a mere 755,535 tonnes discharged in the first five days, a paltry daily rate of 151,107 tonnes. The daily rate of imports for the first 11 months of the year was 534,000 tonnes, according to the Refinitiv data. The lower imports so far in December are at odds with recent developments in India, as utilities and steel makers have resorted to buying more from overseas to overcome domestic transport bottlenecks. It’s possible that India’s December imports will be boosted by arrivals from Indonesia, given that it takes about two weeks to sail from the coal-producing region of Kalimantan to India’s west coast. Indeed, the vessel-tracking data shows 10.7 million tonnes of coal is likely to be imported by India in December, a figure certain to increase as more cargoes from Indonesia are fixed. However, even if the number does rise in coming days, it’s likely December will be below the 17.3 million tonnes imported in November and the 17.9 million in October. The weaker imports by both China and India are being reflected in coal prices in Australia and Indonesia, the world’s two largest exporters. Benchmark thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port , as assessed by Argus Media, rose slightly in the week to Dec. 2 to $97.94 a tonne. This was up from the seven-month low of $97.50 a tonne in the week to Nov. 25, but also 18.2 percent below the 7-1/2 year high of $119.74 reached in late July. Indonesian thermal coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram has fared even worse than its higher-quality Australian counterpart, dropping to $28.85 a tonne on the week to Nov. 30. This is down 43 percent from its seven-year high, and is the lowest price since July 2016, according to pricing agency Argus Media. If there is a positive for coal exporters it’s that the lower prices should act as a boost for India’s imports from Indonesia, and China’s restrictions may lead to pent-up demand in the early months of 2019.

2018-12-06,"* European stocks hit two-year low after Asia hammered * Arrest of Huawei CFO seen heightening U.S-China tension * U.S. futures down nearly 2 pct, Nikkei ends at five-week low * Adds to investor worries over trade outlook, global growth * Oil down ahead of key OPEC producers meeting * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Global stock markets slumped for a third day running on Thursday as the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei in Canada for extradition to the United States fed fears of fresh tensions between the two economic superpowers. The arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhouof, who is also the daughter of the company’s founder, came just as Washington and Beijing prepared for crucial trade negotiations. Asian markets took a beating. Huawei is not listed, but China’s second-largest telecom equipment maker, ZTE Corp, sank 9 percent in Hong Kong while most of the nearby national bourses lost at least 2 percent. London, Frankfurt and Paris then slumped to 2-year lows as tech companies, banks and carmakers fell nearly 3 percent. Oil stocks headed for their worst day in 2 1/2 years as crude prices spilled as much as 5 percent going into an OPEC meeting in Vienna. “We had this very ugly new turn and just the degree to which the market has reacted just suggests to me that they are vulnerable right now,” said John Hardy, Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy. “It think we should all be very careful. It is not looking good, especially if the S&P 500 goes to new lows.” S&P 500 futures were down almost 2 percent. Wall Street was closed on Wednesday, so there was an element of catch-up play but the strain on futures was clearly strong. CME Group’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange had implemented a series of 10-second trading halts in Asia that had limited the initial drops. Japan’s Nikkei had shed 1.9 percent, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 30, with semiconductor-related shares leading the losses. Huawei is one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and telecommunications network equipment. MSCI’s ex-Japan Asia-Pacific index lost 2.0 percent too . Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.5 percent and Chinese blue chips fell 2.1 percent to take their 2018 loss to 20 percent. Traders were also waiting to hear what kind of cuts OPEC and other oil producers meeting in Vienna would make to their output in the months ahead. Consensus among analysts was for somewhere between 1 million and 1.3 million barrels per day, but Brent dropped as much as 5 percent to back under $60 a barrel as Saudi Arabia said going into the meeting that 1 million “would be enough”. All the various spikes in volatility also shoved currency markets in all kinds of directions. The Australian dollar, which is highly sensitive to U.S. China tensions due to huge Aussie metals sales to China, shed 1 percent despite China’s commerce ministry saying it was “very confident” about striking a U.S. trade deal. It was last at $0.72 to the U.S. dollar while the greenback itself fell as much 0.4 percent against the yen to 112.77 yen as it suffered slightly too. China’s yuan was on course for its worst day in the offshore spot markets since August as it dropped to 6.9 per dollar, while the crude crunch sent oil currencies like Norway’s crown and Russia’s rouble down just as much. Another oil-sensitive currency, Canada’s dollar, also languished near an 18-month low. It had been hit hard the day before when a cautious-sounding Bank of Canada dampened expectations of a  January rate hike. “The concentration of the moves today is a direct function of what we have been seeing in the equity and commodity markets,” said TD Securities’ Currency Strategist Ned Rumpeltin. On the Huawei drama, Canadian authorities had said they had arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1, the day Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping  met at the G20 summit in Argentina. China’s foreign ministry said neither Canada or the United States had clarified the reason for the arrest, but a source earlier told Reuters it was related to violations of U.S. sanctions. The move heightened the sense of a collision between the world’s two largest economies, not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony. Britain’s BT Group said it was removing Huawei’s equipment from the core of its 3G and 4G mobile operations. Australia and New Zealand have also rejected Huawei’s products. “The U.S. has been telling its allies not to use Huawei products for security reasons and is likely to continue to put pressure on its allies,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. Yields on top-rated German government bonds held near six-month lows, while those on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were near a three-month low at 2.886 percent. Adding to worries about U.S. recession risks, the Treasury yield curve remained inverted between two- and five-year zones, with five-year notes yielding 2.763 percent, below 2.778 percent on two-year notes. U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any serious weakness, markets are likely to react, said Shuji Shirota, HSBC’s head of macro economic strategy.

2018-12-06,"WASHINGTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is expected on Thursday to roll back an Obama-era rule that requires new coal plants to capture their carbon emissions, a move that could crack open the door in coming years for new plants fired by the fossil fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will make an “energy policy announcement” at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT) on Thursday. Andrew Wheeler, EPA’s acting administrator, will speak alongside Harry Alford, president of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, a long-time opponent of former President Barack Obama’s limits on carbon emissions. The EPA is expected to propose allowing new coal plants to emit up to 1,900 pounds (862 kg) of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour of electricity, according to a New York Times report citing unnamed sources. The Trump proposal, which is sure to be challenged by lawsuits from environmental groups, would replace an Obama-era standard allowing only 1,400 pounds of carbon per megawatt-hour. That Obama rule would have forced new plants to install carbon capture equipment that is not yet commercially available. No company has plans to build a new U.S. coal plant due to competition from plentiful and less-expensive natural gas. That could change as President Donald Trump rolls back rules meant to curb emissions linked to global warming. “I’m not giving up on building a new generation of coal-fired power plants in this country,” said Myron Ebell, who led Trump’s EPA transition team last year. Ebell said Trump’s policies could allow new coal plants to be build in the next five, 10 or 15 years. The administration says coal plants can be made to burn coal far more efficiently. But high costs have made them uneconomic. The regulatory roll back comes ahead of the annual U.N. climate talks in Poland next week, where White House officials plan a panel on coal technology. It was unclear whether the proposal can withstand lawsuits. Jay Duffy, a legal associate at Clean Air Task Force, said the weaker carbon emissions level would not satisfy federal clean air law requirements for the best available emissions technology. While the carbon capture equipment the Obama rule would have required is technologically feasible, it is expensive. But Duffy said Obama’s rule would drive down costs. “If Trump is really interested in supporting coal miners, what he should be looking at is supporting and advancing carbon capture,” said Duffy. “That’s the only way coal survives,” in a future where rules on carbon constraints are likely, he said.

2018-12-06,"* Anger over taxes and lack of spending power * Authorities taking steps to quell unrest (Adds detail and background) By Benjamin Mallet PARIS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - In the wake of violent protests across France sparked by planned tax rises on gasoline and diesel the government is considering lowering taxes on electricity, two sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced late on Wednesday that he was scrapping the fuel tax increases planned for 2019, having announced a six-month suspension the day before, in a bid to defuse the worst crisis of President Emmanuel Macron’s presidency. The government also said it would prevent state-controlled EDF from raising its regulated power prices this winter, but rivals said they would challenge that decision in court. Earlier government attempts at freezing prices have been overruled. Household power prices are set by independent energy regulator CRE using a formula that includes the price of power generation, transport and distribution. A third part of the retail price is made up of taxes. “What is being discussed is that the share of taxes in the power price could be reduced in order to compensate for an increase in the generation cost, which on balance would keep prices stable,” said one of the two sources. The government could lower the valued-added tax (VAT) or so-called CSPE tax, which stands at 22.5 euros per megawatt-hour and raised 3 billion euros ($3.40 billion) this year. Money from that tax also funds power subsidies for low-income families. An energy ministry official told Reuters that the government was looking at ways to stabilise power bills but said that no final decision had been taken yet. $1 = 0.8829 euros

2018-12-06,"* Refiners ramp up output and new refineries also add to supply * Singapore complex refinery margin at lowest since 2014 * Margins at lowest in decade for this time of year By Florence Tan and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Oil refiners’ profits in Asia have slumped to the lowest in more than four years after refineries ramped up output in the fourth quarter and churned out excess fuel in anticipation of stronger demand during winter. Oil inventories are building as new refineries in China and Vietnam are running at full tilt, adding to Asia’s supplies. Oil demand also slowed after global Brent crude prices jumped to more than $80 a barrel in September and as the global economic outlook turned gloomy, although a sharp retreat in prices in the past month to below $60 could start to spur demand again. Factory activity and export orders weakened in November, prompting analysts to predict no quick rebound amid persistent trade tensions. The margins at a typical Singapore complex refinery, a reference for profits at refineries across Asia, fell to $2.49 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest since August 2014, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. DUB-SIN-REF The margins are also the lowest for this time of the year since 2008, the data showed. Weakness in the oil complex started in October in gasoline and naphtha, a feedstock for petrochemicals, as refiners processed more light oil that gives a bigger yield on these products also known as light distillates. “The glut in the market is in light oil,” Martijn Rats, Morgan Stanley’s global oil strategist said. “The gasoline crack has deteriorated an enormous amount and is very close to zero at the moment which is very unusual.” Refiners now face losses of more than $1 a barrel for every barrel of gasoline they produced. Spot gasoil and jet fuel cargoes are also being sold at deeper discounts after China issued more export quotas for state refiners to ship products overseas and added to supplies within Asia. The discount for gasoil, the main diesel grade with 10 parts per million (ppm) sulphur, is at its widest since 2011 when Reuters first started assessing the grade. GO10-SIN-DIF Several oil tankers are storing gasoil off Taiwan amid a mild winter that reduces demand to burn oil for heating purposes, traders said. “It’s weather driven ... a mild winter so far in Europe and Asia is the killer. The volatility will continue till you get strong weather support,” said Sri Paravaikkarasu, head of east of Suez oil for consultants FGE in Singapore. KY Lin, a spokesman at Formosa Petrochemical Corp, one of the largest fuel exporters in Asia, is hopeful that the recent drop in oil prices could boost demand. “Even though there’s an ongoing trade war, countries will still need to use oil,” he said.

2018-12-06,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change have begun in the Polish city of Katowice, the capital of the Silesian mining district.  The aim is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce global action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a flavor of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. Dozens of young people waved placards as the delegations trooped in for another day of negotiation. Shouting “Involve Us Now” and “Young Way”, they demanded seats on all official delegations. Some countries, such as Scandinavian and Pacific states, have youth members, but the decision is up to individual governments. St Nicholas’s Day, when Polish children wake up to stockings full of presents and the old mine shafts of Katowice are covered in Christmas lights glowing with coal-fired power. The stocking-filler in France was the decision of President Emmanuel Macron’s government to scrap a fuel tax because of protests. Delegates at the conference on the whole did not welcome the news as many support the principle of taxes on carbon and on fossil fuels to favor the transition to renewable energy.  They said the tax was poorly thought-out because it exaggerated the divisions between rich and poor, town and country, as those living in rural communities would be disproportionately affected. “The situation in France is an example of what happens when the much needed transition to a low-carbon world happens in a disorderly manner,” said Christian Aid Head of Policy Alison Doig. She said governments should ensure carbon taxes were used to “smooth the transition and ensure it does not become a political pawn”. Michal Kurtyka, the Polish politician who is leading the Katowice talks, took the view that the “polluter pays” principle is easier said than done:  “In my opinion, the problem is not in the principles, it is rather a problem at the level of implementing such a policy in the spirit of dialogue and understanding with people.”  Reporting by Barbara Lewis, Anna Koper, Wojciech Zurawski and Megan Rowling; Editing by Kevin Liffey",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climate-change-notebook/katowice-cop24-notebook-ill-thought-out-taxes-fuel-protest-idUKL8N1YB2H4,06 Dec 2018,"Talks billed as the most

2018-12-06,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China on Thursday expressed confidence in striking a trade deal with the United States within their 90-day ceasefire period, praising the recent meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping as highly successful. In Argentina last weekend, Trump and Xi agreed to a truce that delayed the planned Jan. 1 U.S. hike of tariffs to 25 percent from 10 percent on $200 billion (157.16 billion pounds) of Chinese goods while they negotiate a trade deal. “We are very confident in reaching an agreement (with the United States) within the next 90 days,” China’s commerce ministry spokesman Gao Feng said in a weekly briefing, adding both sides have been communicating and cooperating “smoothly” since the leaders met in Argentina. China’s ultimate goal during the 90-day trade talks is to remove all U.S. tariffs imposed on Chinese goods, Gao said. His comments come as the arrest of a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei [HWT.UL] by Canadian authorities, on Washington’s request, threatens to spark a flare-up in tensions between the world’s two economic powerhouses once again.  The two countries have hit each other with tit-for-tariffs on goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars in sectors from automobiles to agriculture and energy, stymying trade and redrawing global supply chains. Gao confirmed for the first time since the high-stakes meeting that China had agreed to implement consensus reached by both sides on agriculture, energy and cars, although he did not give details on any specific measures.  “We will start with agricultural products, energy, automobiles to immediately implement the issues that the two sides have reached consensus,” Gao said, when asked about what is on the negotiation agenda.  “Then, in the next 90 days, we will follow a clear timetable and roadmap to negotiate on issues such as intellectual property right protection, tech cooperation, market access and trade balance,” he said, stressing the consultations should be based on meeting the interests of both parties. The White House has said China had committed to start buying more American products and lifting tariff and non-tariff barriers immediately, while beginning talks on structural changes with respect to forced technology transfers and intellectual property protection. The United States has levied additional duties of between 10 percent and 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods this year as punishment for what it calls China’s unfair trade practices. China has responded with its own tariffs. “China and United States have reached very important consensus as both sides’ interests overlap,” Gao said. His comments echoed earlier remarks made by senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi, who said the meeting was “friendly and candid” and would help to avoid further trade tensions. “All of these help to safeguard China’s legitimate interests, and are also in the interests of the United States, and even more are in line with the expectations of the international community,” he added in a statement carried on the foreign ministry’s website. But global markets have been nervous about the prospects of a Sino-U.S. trade dispute spilling over to growing rivalry between both sides in areas such as technology, and many economists have remained cautious about being too optimistic on a temporary truce. The daughter of Huawei’s founder is facing extradition to the United States, dealing a blow to hopes of an easing of Sino-U.S. trade tensions and rocking global stock markets. Trump also warned this week of more tariffs if the two sides could not resolve their differences. Hannah Anderson, Global Market Strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, said there was a lot of uncertainty over the U.S.-China relationship now as both view each other more as a competitor than a strategic partner in trade and economics. “When it comes to the trade policies that have been proposed so far specifically, I think we can all expect that there will be further tariff increases on U.S. imports of Chinese goods, whether that’s within the 90-day window that we are now operating under a pause or outside that window,” Anderson told a small group of reporters in Beijing on Thursday.

The arrest of Huawei’s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhouof, who is also the daughter of the firm’s founder, triggered renewed fireworks coming just as Washington and Beijing prepare for crucial trade negotiations. Asian markets took a beating. Huawei is not listed but China’s second-largest telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp sank 9 percent in Hong Kong while most of the nearby national bourses lost at least 2 percent. Europe slumped too in early trading as 3 percent falls for the tech sector, miners and also carmakers kicked London , Frankfurt and Paris to two-year lows “We had this very ugly new turn and just the degree to which the market has reacted just suggests to me that they are vulnerable right now,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX strategy John Hardy. “It think we should all be very careful, it is not looking good, especially if the S&P 500 goes to new lows.” Hardy said that U.S. President Donald Trump may try to send some reassuring tweets later. For the time being though S&P 500 futures were down almost 2 percent. The losses might have been even steeper had CME Group’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange not implemented a series of 10-second trading halts in Asia that had limited the initial drop. Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.9 percent, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 30, with semi-conductor related shares leading the losses. Huawei is one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and telecommunications network equipment. MSCI’s ex-Japan Asia-Pacific index lost 2.0 percent too . Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.5 percent while Chinese bluechips lost 2.1 percent to take their 2018 slump to 20 percent. Saxo Bank’s Hardy highlighted that the Australian dollar, which is highly sensitive to trade tensions due to huge Aussie metals sales to China, had failed to lift after some reassuring comments from Beijing on the trade discussions. It shed 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar to $0.7229. The greenback itself fell as much 0.4 percent against the yen to 112.77 yen as it suffered slightly too. The yuan eased 0.3 percent to 6.8835 per dollar in offshore trade, the euro barely budged at $1.1338 and the Canadian dollar languished near the 18-month low it had hit the previous day after cautious noises from the Bank of Canada. On the Huawei drama, Canadian authorities had said they had arrested the firm’s CFO in Vancouver. China’s foreign ministry said neither Canada and the United States had clarified their reason for the move but a source had earlier told Reuters it was related to violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. The arrest heightened the sense of a major collision between the world’s two largest economic powers not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony. Britain’s BT Group said it was removing Huawei’s equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations. Australia and New Zealand have also rejected Huawei’s products. “The U.S. has been telling its allies not to use Huawei products for security reasons and is likely to continue to put pressure on its allies,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “So while there was a brief moment of optimism after the weekend U.S.-China talks but the reality is, it won’t be that easy,” he said. Traders were also waiting to hear from Vienna about what kind of cuts OPEC and other oil producers like Russia could make to their output. Consensus among analysts is for somewhere between 1-1.3 million barrels per day, and Brent dived back below $60 a barrel as Saudi Arabia’s energy minister said going into the day long meeting that 1 million “would be enough” Yields on top-rated German government bonds held near six-month lows in risk off environment, while those on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries were near a three-month low at 2.886 percent. Adding to worries about U.S. recession risks, the Treasury yield curve remained inverted between two- and five-year zones, with five-year notes yielding 2.763 percent, below 2.778 percent on two-year notes. U.S. jobs data is due on Friday. If the figures show any sign of serious weakness, markets are likely to react HSBC’s head of macro economic strategy, Shuji Shirota, said.

India’s state-owned UCO Bank is expected to announce the payment mechanism in the next 10 days, the source said. “An agreement had been signed by the Indian and Iranian government on Nov. 2 2018 for oil payment in rupees and 50 percent of those funds had been earmarked for exports,” according to an Indian government document reviewed by Reuters.

2018-12-06,"MOSCOW, Dec 5 (Reuters) - South Korea will receive its first cargo of Russian condensate from Novatek’s new Yamal LNG project this month as it looks for alternatives to Iranian supplies that have been complicated by U.S. sanctions. Yamal condensate is a type of light oil produced along with liquefied natural gas (LNG) and Asian customers are looking to increase purchases for the petrochemical industry. Traders expect demand for condensate to rise towards 2020 as it allows refiners to produce low-sulphur fuels - critical in light of upcoming shipping regulations. South Korea’s Hanwha Total Petrochemical Co Ltd will receive 74,000 tonnes of Yamal condensate in mid-December, traders said. According to the Refinitiv Eikon flows system, the vessel STI Veneto will arrive at Daesan port on Dec. 13. “The company has bought 74,000 tonnes of Yamal condensate which will arrive in December,” a Hanwha Total spokesman told Reuters, adding future purchases of condensate from Russia would depend on market conditions. Hanwha Total had previously increased imports of condensate from the United States and Australia for autumn delivery to replace Iranian supplies. Novatek didn’t respond to a request for comment. The Yamal LNG project is operated by the Yamal LNG Company, in which Russian independent gas producer Novatek holds a 50.1 percent stake, Total a 20 percent stake, China’s CNPC 20 percent and the Silk Road Fund 9.9 percent. Demand for condensate in Europe, historically the primary market for Russia’s energy resources, has been hit recently by weak naphtha margins. “Condensate sellers are desperately looking for ways to take it outside of the region,” a trader on the European market told Reuters. Prior to the South Korean deal, two cargoes of Novatek’s condensate, amounting to about 100,000 tonnes, were sold to ENOC for delivery to the United Arab Emirates in early autumn. Even including transport costs, it was more profitable to sell condensate to South Korea than northwest Europe, traders said. The sale was made at around minus $3 a barrel to BFOE on a CIF Rotterdam basis, compared with minus $1-1.5 a barrel CFR Yosu, they said. The two main sources of condensate for South Korea are normally Qatar and Iran. Despite getting a waiver from the United States to buy Iranian supplies, South Korean petrochemical companies are looking for alternatives, market participants said. Yamal condensate hit the market in January and exports are expected to reach around 621,000 tonnes this year, according to Novatek data from quarterly reports and the Refinitiv Eikon flows system. Novatek sells all condensate from Yamal LNG via spot tenders. Yamal condensate is loaded from Russia’s northern port of Sabetta in the Karsky Sea in small tankers, which then offload it to bigger vessels at Britain’s Southwold port for delivery to Asia and the Middle East. Next year, Yamal LNG plans to produce 1-1.2 million tonnes of condensate after it reaches capacity, according to Novatek.

2018-12-06,"* ‘Yellow vests’ plan protests in Paris on Saturday * Troops on anti-terrorism patrols may be redeployed - sources * Government ditched fuel tax hikes in 2019 in bid to quell anger * Budge minister says “books will be kept in order” By Richard Lough and Marine Pennetier PARIS, Dec 6 (Reuters) - French authorities are worried that another wave of “great violence” and rioting will be unleashed in Paris this weekend by a hard core of several thousand ‘yellow vest’ protesters, an official in the French presidency said on Thursday. Despite capitulating this week over plans for fuel taxes that inspired the nationwide revolt, President Emmanuel Macron has struggled to quell the anger that led to the worst street unrest in central Paris since 1968. Rioters torched cars, shattered windows, looted shops and sprayed and anti-Macron graffiti across some of Paris’s most affluent districts, even defacing the Arc de Triomphe. Scores of people were hurt and hundreds arrested in battles with police. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced late on Wednesday that he was scrapping the fuel-tax increases planned for 2019, having announced a six-month suspension the day before, in a desperate bid to defuse the worst crisis of Macron’s presidency. The Elysee official said intelligence suggested that some protesters would come to the capital “to vandalise and to kill”. The threat of more violence poses a security nightmare for the authorities, who make a distinction between peaceful ‘yellow vest’ protesters and violent groups, anarchists and looters from the deprived suburbs who they say have infiltrated the movement. The yellow vest protests, named for fluorescent jackets French motorists are required to keep in their cars, erupted in November over the squeeze on household budgets caused by fuel taxes. Demonstrations swiftly grew into a broad, sometimes-violent rebellion against Macron, with no formal leader. Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer urged people to stay at home during the coming weekend. Security sources said the government was considering using troops currently deployed on anti-terrorism patrols to protect public buildings. The fuel-tax volte-face was the first major U-turn of Macron’s 18-month presidency and points to an administration scrambling to regain the initiative as disenchanted citizens feel emboldened on the streets. The unrest has exposed the deep-seated resentment among non-city dwellers that Macron is out-of-touch with the hard-pressed middle class and blue-collar labourers. They see the 40-year-old former investment banker as closer to big business. Trouble is also brewing elsewhere for Macron: college students are agitating, farmers who have long complained that retailers are squeezing their margins and are furious over a delay to the planned rise in minimum food prices, and truckers are threatening to strike from Sunday. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he was committed to “fiscal justice” and on Thursday announced France would unilaterally impose a tax on big internet companies if European Union members failed to reach an agreement on a bloc-wide levy. While such a step might not be directly related to the ‘yellow vest’ movement — France has been leading negotiations for an EU-wide tax on digital revenues for months — the government will hope that it appeals to the protesters’ anti-big business sentiment. Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said abandoning plans to for further fuel-tax hikes in 2019 would cost the treasury 4 billion euros ($4.53 billion). Pressed on whether deficit targets were in jeopardy, he replied: “We will keep our books in order.” (Reporting by Richard Lough; additional reporting by Myriam Rivet)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests/french-authorities-fear-great-violence-as-yellow-vest-anger-endures-idUKL8N1YB1UV,06 Dec 2018,"* Troops on anti-terrorism patrols may be redeployed -

2018-12-06,"PARIS (Reuters) - France’s EDF will offer more financial support for households switching to electric from fuel oil central heating, the state-controlled utility said on Thursday, as President Emmanuel Macron’s government grapples with protests over living costs. “Fuel oil is expensive, it creates pollution and all of it has to be imported ... We have decided to make an effort to help people change their heaters,” EDF Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy told RTL radio. Levy said that on top of subsidies provided by the French state - 3,000 euros ($3,399) for low-income families and 2,000 euro for other families - EDF will provide financial support amounting to half of those subsidies.   That will raise support available to low-income families to 4,500 euros and to 3,000 euros for others. Heat pumps, which use electricity to draw heat from the air or from underground water pipes, are relatively expensive with a price of 10,000 euros. However, Levy said they cost 1,000 euros a year to run versus 2,000 euros for fuel heating.  About three million French people living in standalone houses use fuel oil for heating. On Wednesday, Macron’s government dropped further fuel-tax hikes planned in next year’s budget in the face of widespread protests over living costs, with more demonstrations due this weekend. Levy said those protests had had no impact on electricity production and distribution at EDF so far, and added that EDF would apply government directives regarding freezes to any hikes in bills. The state owns around 80 percent of EDF. Asked when EDF would close its two nuclear reactors in Fessenheim, close to the German border, Levy said the first one would certainly be closed in 2020 and the second one also probably around that time. Macron said last week that the Fessenheim nuclear plant would have to be closed by summer 2020 in a first step toward reducing France’s reliance on nuclear energy to 50 percent by 2035 from 75 percent today.  ($1 = 0.8827 euros) Reporting by Geert de Clercq; editing by Jason Neely",https://uk.reuters.com/article/france-protests-edf/frances-edf-boosts-help-for-households-switching-to-electric-heating-idUKL8N1YB1FS,06 Dec 2018,"France's EDF will offer

2018-12-06,"DUBAI (Reuters) - At least two policemen died and 48 people were injured in a rare suicide car bomb attack by a Sunni jihadist group on a police headquarters in the port city of Chabahar in southeast Iran on Thursday, state media reported. While suicide bombings are rare in Iran, Sunni militant groups have carried out several attacks on security forces in recent years in Sistan-Baluchestan province, where Chabahar is located. The province is home to a Sunni minority in the largely Shi’ite country, and it has also long been plagued by violence from both drug smugglers and separatists. State television also reported shooting in the area on Thursday. “Two policemen were killed in the terrorist attack in Chabahar this morning,” Hadi Marashi, deputy governor for security affairs, told state TV, which reported the figure of 48 hurt. Video clips posted on Twitter, purportedly from Chabahar, showed thick smoke rising. TV reported that four children, a pregnant woman and 10 policemen were among the wounded. “Police stopped the explosive-laden car and started firing at the driver ... who then set off the explosion near the police headquarters in Chabahar,” Chabahar’s acting governor Rahmdel Bameri told TV. The Washington-based SITE Intelligence Group and state media reported that Sunni jihadist group Ansar al-Furqan had claimed responsibility for the attack. “Such terrorist acts, which are designed and adopted by enemies to divide the Iranian nation, are doomed to failure and will make us more decisive in our fight against terrorism,” said First Vice President Eshagh Jahangiri, according to TV. Iran’s Revolutionary Guards promised to give a “crushing” response to the attack, state TV reported. In June, the Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had killed Ansar al-Furqan’s suspected leader, Molavi Jalil Qanbar-Zehi, in a mountainous area of Sistan-Baluchestan. A year ago the group claimed responsibility for a blast at an oil pipeline in southern Khuzestan province. Iran has stepped up security in border areas after gunmen in September opened fire on a military parade in the southwestern city of Ahvaz, killing 25 people, almost half of them members of the Revolutionary Guards. Last year, in the first deadly assault claimed by Islamic State in Tehran, 18 people were killed at the parliament and mausoleum of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.  Tehran accuses its Sunni-led regional rival Saudi Arabia and the United States of funding Sunni militants, a charge Riyadh and Washington deny.   “Foreign-backed terrorists kill & wound innocents in Chabahar. As we’ve made clear in the past, such crimes won’t go unpunished,” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted. “Mark my words: Iran WILL bring terrorists & their masters to justice.” Iran says militant groups are sheltering across the border in Pakistan, and it has threatened to attack their bases if Islamabad does not confront them. Chabahar is a free trade zone and the site of an Indian-backed port complex being developed as part of a new transportation corridor for landlocked Afghanistan. The Indian foreign ministry condemned Thursday’s attack. “The perpetrators behind this dastardly attack should be brought to justice expeditiously. There can be no justification for any act of terror,” the ministry said. India has said it is ready to invest up to $500 million to develop the port as it seeks to create a route to landlocked Central Asian countries and Afghanistan that bypasses Pakistan. Washington has granted exceptions to some U.S. sanctions on Iran for the project despite pulling out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major world powers and reimposing other sanctions that were lifted under the pact.

2018-12-06,"* U.S. stock futures down 1.3 pct, Nikkei ends at five-week low * Arrest of Huawei CFO seen heightening U.S-China tension * Adds to investor worries over trade outlook, global growth * Oil down ahead of key producers meeting By Hideyuki Sano and Daniel Leussink TOKYO, Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures and Asian shares slumped on Thursday after Canadian authorities arrested a top executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei for extradition to the United States, feeding fears of a fresh flare-up in tensions between the two superpowers. The news came as Washington and Beijing are set to begin negotiations aimed at de-escalating their bruising trade war, which is adding to deepening worries over higher U.S. interest rates and other risks to global growth. The sell-off looked set to extend into European trading, with spreadbetters expecting London’s FTSE 100 to drop 0.9 percent at the open, Frankfurt’s DAX to lose 1.5 percent and Paris’ CAC 40 to fall 1.4 percent. S&P500 e-mini futures fell almost 2 percent at one point in thin Asian morning trade and were last were down 1.3 percent. The losses in the first few minutes of trading might have been even steeper, but CME Group’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange implemented a series of 10-second trading halts that helped limit the initial drop. Japan’s Nikkei shed 1.9 percent, closing at its lowest level since Oct. 30, with semi-conductor related shares leading the losses. Huawei is one of the world’s largest makers of smartphones and telecommunications network equipment. MSCI’s ex-Japan Asia-Pacific index lost 2.0 percent . Hong Kong’s Hang Seng dropped 2.9 percent while Shanghai shares dipped 1.7 percent. Canadian authorities said they had arrested Huawei’s global chief financial officer in Vancouver, where she is facing extradition to the United States. The arrest is related to violations of U.S. sanctions, a person familiar with the matter said, though officials have so far stayed mum on her allegations. The arrest heightened the sense of a major collision between the world’s two largest economic powers not just over tariffs but also over technological hegemony. Britain’s BT Group said it was removing Huawei’s equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G mobile operations. Australia and New Zealand have also rejected Huawei’s products. “The U.S. has been telling its allies not to use Huawei products for security reasons and is likely to continue to put pressure on its allies,” said Norihiro Fujito, chief investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities. “So while there was a brief moment of optimism after the weekend U.S.-China talks but the reality is, it won’t be that easy,” he said. Shares of China’s second-largest telecom equipment maker ZTE Corp  sank 9.1 percent in Hong Kong and 6.5 percent in Shenzhen. ZTE had to temporarily halt much of its business earlier this year after the U.S. imposed an export ban on the company related to it illegally shipping U.S.-origin goods to Iran and North Korea. Markets had initially brightened this week after U.S. and Chinese leaders agreed a temporary trade truce at a meeting on Saturday. But the mood quickly soured on scepticism that the two sides can reach a substantive deal on a host of hugely divisive issues within the tight 90-day time frame set out. The benchmark Treasury 10-year yield hit a three-month low of 2.874 percent, its lowest level since Sept. 7, before pulling up to 2.884 percent. U.S. markets were closed on Wednesday to mark the death of former President George H.W. Bush. Adding to worries about U.S. recession risks, the yield curve remained inverted between two- and five-year zones, with five-year notes yielding 2.763 percent, below 2.778 percent on two-year notes. “If the upcoming U.S. jobs data on Friday shows some weakness, markets will face a major challenge,” said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy at HSBC. The yield inversion is a symptom of a weak economy, said Bryan Whalen, group managing director of TCW in Los Angeles, noting the U.S. economy has not been able to achieve sustainable economic growth of more than 2 percent in recent years. “If the U.S. couldn’t break the 2 percent growth environment, with zero-bound interest rates and a rapidly expanding balance sheet early in the economic cycle, why would you ever think we could do it when interest rates are rising and balance sheet is shrinking and we are basically 9-10 years into an aging economic cycle,” he said. “It’s hard to envision a scenario where U.S. growth doesn’t dip down, if not kind of going into a recession.” Oil prices fell ahead of a meeting by producer group OPEC that is expected to result in a supply cut aimed at draining a glut that has pulled down crude prices by 30 percent since October. A monitoring committee of OPEC and its allies, including Russia, agreed on the need to cut oil output in 2019, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Still, lack of details could suggest such an agreement could be elusive, some analysts also said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 1 percent, or 51 cents a barrel, to $52.38 by 0612 GMT. Brent crude oil futures were down 0.8 percent, or 49 cents, at $61.07. In the currency market, the dollar fell 0.4 percent against the yen to 112.77 yen on a risk-averse mood while the Australian dollar shed 0.6 percent to $0.7229. The yuan eased 0.3 percent to 6.8835 per dollar in offshore trade while the euro held steady at $1.1338.

2018-12-06,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates said on Thursday the Gulf Cooperation Council remained valid despite a bitter row with Qatar that has fractured the bloc ahead of an annual summit next week. Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-GCC member Egypt have imposed a diplomatic and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017 over allegations Doha supports terrorism. Qatar denies the charges and says the boycott aims to curtail its sovereignty. “The main success of the council is in its economic aspects and the creation of a Gulf common market,” UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash tweeted.  “The political crisis will end when the cause behind it ends and that is Qatar’s support of extremism and its interference in the stability of the region.” The dispute has undermined the regional role of the six-nation GCC, set up in 1980 as a bulwark against larger neighbors Iran and Iraq. Last week, Qatar abruptly announced it was quitting OPEC after 57 years to focus on gas in an apparent swipe at the oil-exporter bloc’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia. The move has deepened the sense among diplomats and analysts that any prospect for a near-term resolution to the dispute was unlikely to come at the GCC summit in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia’s king has invited Qatar’s emir to attend the Dec. 9 gathering of heads of state, but Doha has not yet said what level of representation it would send. Bahrain’s foreign minister said in remarks published on Thursday that the level of Qatari representation at the one-day summit was irrelevant. “It is the same whether they attend or not,” Foreign Minister Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa told the pan Arab daily Asharq Al-Awsat. “The crisis with Qatar has reached unprecedented levels and I don’t know how they will come back from that, as Qatar has joined itself with the region’s enemies such as Iran and distanced itself from the GCC.” Qatar’s ruler last month said the dispute “exposed the failure” of the GCC and harmed regional security by weakening the block which groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. At last year’s summit, held in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Bahrain sent ministers or deputy prime ministers.

2018-12-06,"NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stock investors are wary that a 30 percent slump in oil prices will pressure corporate profits while also presenting a sign of weakness in global growth at a time they are already weighing when the long economic expansion will end. Crude prices rebounded off of one-year lows to start the week, with investors focused on Thursday’s meeting in Vienna of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allied producing countries including Russia. A monitoring committee of OPEC and its allies agreed on the need to cut oil output in 2019, two sources familiar with the discussions said. Oil’s drop holds economic benefits, including lower costs for some companies and cheaper fuel prices for consumers. But investors were already bracing for a significant drop in U.S. profit growth next year, and the oil price slump is poised to bite into profits for energy producers and related companies that are part of Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 stock index . OPEC and allied producers used output cuts to curb an oil glut that sent prices from late 2014 into a prolonged slump, bringing prices to below $30 a barrel at the start of 2016. But supplies are growing again, and the U.S.-China trade war and other factors have investors worried that slowing economic growth could erase demand and send prices still lower. “What started the sell-off on oil was a supply issue,” said Alicia Levine, chief market strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. “In the last couple of weeks, what we are getting is fears of slowing demand. And fears of slowing demand are directly related to fears of global growth slowdown.” Crude oil prices have fallen 30 percent or more 13 times since 1982, according to Ed Clissold, chief U.S. strategist at Ned Davis Research. Of the prior 12 occurrences, the oil drop overlapped eight times with what Ned Davis Research defines as a cyclical bear market - a 30 percent drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average after 50 calendar days or a 13 percent decline after 145 calendar days. However, finds Clissold, in only three of those cases did the oil decline overlap with a U.S. economic recession. Futures contracts for U.S. crude, known as West Texas Intermediate (WTI), topped $75 a barrel in early October. The commodity slid to as low as $49.41 last week, but has clawed back since and is now trading around $53. Brent, the global crude benchmark, has notched a similar percentage drop. “Somewhere in the $50-60 level, it’s probably a good level for the market, because producers are making enough money and it’s also helping the consumer,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta. “But if you see an abrupt move down, the bigger concern is what is that signaling about the global economy.” Oil’s decline has coincided with increased turbulence in the stock market. The benchmark S&P 500 late last month confirmed a correction, a decline of more than 10 percent from its all-time high. Still, investor optimism about a less aggressive path of U.S. interest-rate hikes prompted a modest market rebound. Both oil and equities markets have been focused on international trade, China’s economic health and the global economy, said David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Asset Advisors in New York. “For the near term, the two are very closely correlated,” Katz said. Since oil’s October peak, the S&P 500 energy sector has dropped 16 percent, about twice the drop for the overall S&P 500. Analysts have been lowering earnings estimates for the sector, with S&P 500 energy companies now expected to increase earnings by 21.3 percent in 2019, down from an expectation of 26.2 percent on Oct 1, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Many investor see positives in the oil drop, including a potential stimulus for consumer spending through lower gasoline prices. Lower fuel prices could help check inflation, allowing the Federal Reserve to slow its program of U.S. interest rate hikes. But David Bianco, Americas chief investment officer for DWS, estimates that every $5 per barrel decline in oil prices shaves $1 to $1.50 per share from S&P 500 earnings. The S&P 500 is expected to earn $162.81 per share this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That earnings impact includes not just energy companies, but also industrial manufacturers that service the energy sector. It also accounts for any earnings boost for companies like airlines and consumer companies that benefit from lower fuel prices. “The S&P is much more of a commodity producer than a commodity user,” Bianco said. “Higher commodity prices bring higher profits and lower commodity prices bring lower profits...This is one of the most reliable relationships when it comes to corporate profitability of them all.” Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-oil/analysis-oils-sharp-price-drop-fuels-questions-for-stock-market-idUKL2N1Y51HG,06 Dec 2018,"U.S. stock investors are wary

2018-12-06,"WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand released a defense policy statement on Thursday calling climate change its greatest security threat and stressed the importance of the issue to the geostrategically contested Pacific region, which is seeing increased influence from China. The assessment came on the heels of a defense policy earlier this year that warned China’s rising influence in the South Pacific could undermine regional stability, drawing a complaint from the Asian giant. “It identifies climate change as one of the most significant security threats of our time, and one that is already having adverse impacts both at home and in New Zealand’s neighborhood,” said Defense Minister Ron Mark in an emailed statement. The report said that states could look to use assistance on climate change as a way to boost their influence and access in the region. “Working with Pacific Island countries on climate change, including in the security sphere, is an opportunity to learn lessons from each other while further strengthening strategic partnerships,” it said. That underscored comments from Samoa’s Prime Minsiter Tuilaepa Aiono Sailele Malielegaoi who told Reuters in November that Australia and the United States should follow the lead of China and do more to prevent climate change, which would devastate many island nations. “Traditional powers in the region have this anxiety about China’s intentions and so they are looking to assure Pacific islands that they are listening to their concerns,” said Wesley Morgan, an expert in Pacific politics at the University of the South Pacific in Suva, Fiji. The emergence of China as a key aid donor and major lender for Pacific countries has led to friction between the Asian giant and western nations, which boiled over at a recent APEC summit in Papua New Guinea. China’s foreign ministry has said it is helping Pacific nations with much needed assistance according to their wishes and is promoting their social and economic development. New Zealand’s defense minister said he was using the assessment on climate change to inform defense spending and investment plans set to be released next year.  New Zealand’s government led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has put combating climate change at the heart of its policies and on Wednesday announced a NZ$100 million ($68.62 million) investment fund to spur growth in projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2018-12-06,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government has decided to relax the conditions for cutting solar power subsidies for projects that have not started operations following opposition from power producers and other firms. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in October had proposed that companies granted permits for solar projects between the fiscal years of 2012 and 2014 under the so-called Feed-In-Tariffs (FIT) system that guarantees minimum power prices submit applications by March 2019 to connect to the grid. But the proposals had angered power producers and investors who say the cuts will undermine their profitability and violate earlier agreements. Following the opposition, METI late on Wednesday said it would delay the deadline for submission of applications for at least 2 megawatt projects to the end of September. The deadline for start of operations was also delayed by six months to the end of September 2020. Companies that miss the deadline will see their price guarantees under the tariffs of 32 to 40 yen ($0.28 to $0.36) per kilowatt hour (kWh) cut to 21 yen per kWh.  METI estimates show the subsidy cut could affect 23.5 gigawatts of solar capacity, or nearly 44 percent of the amount the government approved in the three-year period after the FIT scheme was created in 2012. METI has said the cuts are necessary to reduce the public burden of FIT subsidies, which are added to consumers bills. At the same time, METI is likely unhappy with the amount of unfilled permits. Data from the ministry shows 23 percent of the total capacity approved in the fiscal year 2012 is not operating, with 49 percent approved in 2013 and 59 percent approved in 2014 also not operating.  Japan introduced the FIT scheme to spur solar developments to fill the power gap after the country closed its nuclear power plants following the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

2018-12-06,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It’s not shaping up as a merry Christmas for coal exporters to Asia as the region’s top buyers, China and India, pull back from the recent trend of strong imports. The Chinese authorities appear to be making good on a commitment to try and limit the country’s imports of the polluting fuel to levels the same as 2017. The restrictions have led to a sharp drop in the daily import of coal so far in December, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. Seaborne imports in the first five days of the month stood at 1.5 million tonnes, or a daily rate of just 300,000 tonnes. This compares to total seaborne imports of 226.2 million tonnes in the first 11 months of 2018, a daily rate of about 677,000 tonnes. The authorities in Beijing have told coal traders and utilities they want imports for the whole year to be similar to the 279 million tonnes in 2017. This is likely going to be a challenge since customs data showed imports for the first 10 months of the year were 252 million tonnes, up 11 percent from the same period in 2017. With vessel-tracking data pointing to November seaborne imports of about 18.3 million tonnes, this would in theory leave only about 9 million tonnes available for December. At the rate of imports for the first five days of December, this may just be possible, as it suggests about 9.3 million tonnes for the month as a whole. However, the ship-tracking data doesn’t cover overland imports, mainly from neighbouring Mongolia, meaning it’s likely that 2018 imports will probably exceed those of 2017. But the sharp reduction in imports so far in December shows Beijing’s message to the industry is being heeded. India, the second-largest coal importer behind China, also appears to be cutting back in December, with a mere 755,535 tonnes discharged in the first five days, a paltry daily rate of 151,107 tonnes. The daily rate of imports for the first 11 months of the year was 534,000 tonnes, according to the Refinitiv data. The lower imports so far in December are at odds with recent developments in India, as utilities and steel makers have resorted to buying more from overseas to overcome domestic transport bottlenecks. It’s possible that India’s December imports will be boosted by arrivals from Indonesia, given that it takes about two weeks to sail from the coal-producing region of Kalimantan to India’s west coast. Indeed, the vessel-tracking data shows 10.7 million tonnes of coal is likely to be imported by India in December, a figure certain to increase as more cargoes from Indonesia are fixed. However, even if the number does rise in coming days, it’s likely December will be below the 17.3 million tonnes imported in November and the 17.9 million in October. The weaker imports by both China and India are being reflected in coal prices in Australia and Indonesia, the world’s two largest exporters. Benchmark thermal coal at Australia’s Newcastle port, as assessed by Argus Media, rose slightly in the week to Dec. 2 to $97.94 a tonne. This was up from the seven-month low of $97.50 a tonne in the week to Nov. 25, but also 18.2 percent below the 7-1/2 year high of $119.74 reached in late July. Indonesian thermal coal with an energy rating of 4,200 kilocalories per kilogram has fared even worse than its higher-quality Australian counterpart, dropping to $28.85 a tonne on the week to Nov. 30. This is down 43 percent from its seven-year high, and is the lowest price since July 2016, according to pricing agency Argus Media. If there is a positive for coal exporters it’s that the lower prices should act as a boost for India’s imports from Indonesia, and China’s restrictions may lead to pent-up demand in the early months of 2019.

2018-12-06,"(Adds company comment, paragraph 6) By Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Dec 5 (Reuters) - About 100 United Steelworkers union (USW) members rallied on Wednesday outside a LyondellBasell Industries Houston oil refinery to protest the lack of negotiations there on a new local contract. Talks on a national oil-workers agreement are due to begin next month with Shell Oil Co, the U.S. unit of Royal Dutch Shell Plc, as the lead industry negotiator. Existing union contracts expire on Feb. 1. Local groups are beginning discussions, however, on individual plant issues ahead of the national talks. At least four other plants also have begun exchanging proposals on local issues, according to the USW. LyondellBasell officials did not begin talks on union local issues as planned on Monday, Marcos Velez, a USW International representative, said in an interview on Wednesday. The existing contract covering the plant’s 485 union workers expires on Feb. 1. “They called and said they couldn’t make it (Monday) and would call about meeting Tuesday,” Velez said. “It’s Wednesday and we’re still waiting to meet.” “LyondellBasell and United Steelworkers Local 13-227 are in the process of entering good faith negotiations with the shared interest of reaching an agreement that is fair and equitable for the company and our represented employees,” said company spokeswoman Chevalier Gray. The USW group carried signs that read: “Coming soon” and showed silhouettes of people picketing. Union-represented Lyondell workers were off their jobs for 3-1/2 months during a strike and contract talks in 2015. The national agreement, which covers wages, job security, health and safety issues, will be combined with terms of the agreement on local issues at each plant to complete the contract for each location. Velez said Lyondell also canceled meetings during the 2015 strike. “It’s not uncommon, but it’s unacceptable,” he said. During the rally, USW activist Joshua Lege used a bullhorn to speak to the workers, many of them wearing blue work coveralls as they lined up in front of the refinery. “They say they want peace and professionalism, but they want war,” Lege said. The national contract covers about 30,000 refinery and chemical plant workers. In September, union officials agreed to seek 8 percent annual wage increases and a three-year contract in the coming negotiations. The contract would cover plants operated by Shell, Marathon Petroleum Corp BP Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp, Valero Energy Corp, and smaller refiners such as HollyFrontier Corp and Delek US Holdings Inc.
