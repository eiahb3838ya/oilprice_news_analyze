2018-12-21,"(Adds Parsley comment in paragraph 4.) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Jennifer Hiller NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are slamming the brakes on next year’s drilling with crude prices off 40 percent and mounting fears of oversupply, paring budgets that in some cases were set only weeks earlier. The reversal is alarming because blistering growth in shale fields has propelled U.S. crude output 16 percent to about 10.9 million barrels per day for 2018, above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Production has been expected to rise 11 percent more in 2019 as large oil firms and independents added wells this year. Shale producer Centennial Resource Development on Thursday joined rivals Diamondback Energy, and Parsley Energy in canceling drilling rig additions next year. Centennial, led by shale pioneer Mark Papa, withdrew its 2020 production target and canceled plans to add 2.5 drilling rigs, citing market weakness. “You’re really seeing folks pull back on extra spending, pull back on extra drilling and focus on being resilient,” said Matt Gallagher, president of Parsley Energy, who will become CEO in January. The company plans to cut its 2019 capital budget by about 15 percent compared to 2018 while increasing production. Right now, shale prices are close to break even levels. U.S. crude futures for 2019, based on an average of the year’s monthly contracts, this week dropped below $50 a barrel, near the $46-$50-per-barrel level that shale producers in the Permian Basin, the largest oil field in the United States, need to cover their costs. The price drop is “a shock,” said John Roby, chief executive of Dallas, Texas-based oil producer Teal Natural Resources LLC. “A lot of people are cutting back development programs and cutting rigs,” he said. On Friday, U.S. crude slipped below $46 a barrel. Centennial said in a securities filing it could no longer stand by its 2020 projections or add rigs next year “in light of the current macro environment.” Just six weeks ago, it forecast 2020 output of 65,000 bpd with “attractive” returns based on a U.S. oil price of $75 a barrel. Centennial’s Papa was not available for comment. “Realized pricing in the Permian Basin is near levels not seen since the end of 2016 while service costs have increased by about 35 percent during the same time period,” said Travis Stice, CEO of Diamondback. The company cut three rigs, and plans to operate 18 to 22 rigs next year, down from 24 now. “If commodity prices continue to decline, we will further reduce activity to match our budget to expected annual operating cash flow,” Stice said in a statement. Goodrich Petroleum Corp this week also cut its 2019 capital spending plan by $40 million and Abraxas Petroleum Corp said it has scrapped a $108 million budget draft and will release a new one early in the year. Ring Energy also disclosed plans to cut one of its two drilling rigs. Weaker oil prices are squeezing companies and increasing borrowing costs. Investors have sold shares in companies that increased their drilling budgets, pressuring for cuts. This year’s shale expansion by oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron also has helped drive up service costs for smaller companies working in West Texas, further pressuring margins. The shale cutbacks are the first of what is expected to be a wave of companies shedding rigs and slashing spending budgets, said Matthew Lemme, a portfolio manager with investment firm Cushing Asset Management. “You can’t stick your head in the sand and pretend that oil hasn’t fallen 20 bucks in a couple of months,” Lemme said. The message that investors continue to send oil and gas producers is: “Stay within cash flow no matter what the oil price is,” Lemme said. That conservative view of budgets will mean additional rigs and service crews that hydraulically fracture shale wells will be idled, slowing North American production growth in 2019, Lemme said. The number of active drilling rigs has dropped to the lowest since October, but producers in the Permian Basin have banked a record number of drilled wells waiting to be completed and tied to pipelines. That inventory could be tapped quicker than having to drill new wells. “Shale companies outside the Permian appear to face greater financial distress, and we think they would need to scale back activity more were prices to stay low,” Standard Chartered said in a note.

2018-12-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets continued a week-long sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and comments from a top White House trade adviser casting doubt that a breakthrough on trade tensions with China can be achieved compounded investor anxiety that global economic growth is slowing. MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.5 percent, dragged down by broad declines in Europe and Asia. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks initially moved higher after Commerce Department data showed the U.S. economy is on pace to grow by 3 percent this year. But they pared their gains and then turned lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 414.23 points, or 1.81 percent, to 22,445.37, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 50.8 points, or 2.06 percent, to 2,416.62 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 195.41 points, or 2.99 percent, to 6,333.00. Stocks fell after Trump administration trade adviser Peter Navarro told Nikkei it would be “difficult” for the United States and China to reach a long-lasting trade agreement that would end the simmering trade war between the world’s two largest economies.  The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped into a bear market, defined as a 20 percent decline from its recent highs, for the first time since the global financial crisis in 2008. Broad stock markets in the United States and Europe are on pace for the worst quarter since 2008, while the Dow finished its worst week since late 2008. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation that the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless Congress authorizes money for a Mexico border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. Adding to the air of crisis was news that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was also planned. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017. U.S. crude CLc1 fell 1 percent to $45.41 a barrel, while Brent LCOc1 fell 1.5 percent to $53.52.  Japan's Nikkei .N225 lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks  slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR last rose 2/32 in price to yield 2.783 percent, from 2.789 percent late on Thursday. As recently as October, yields had been at a seven-year high of 3.261 percent. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.76 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.74 percent to $1.1359.

2018-12-21,"(Corrects fourth paragraph to 2018 from last year) By David Alire Garcia MEXICO CITY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Mexico’s new leftist president has pledged to revive the fortunes of state oil company Pemex with a bigger budget next year - while proposing the oil giant pay even more in taxes. The former monopoly oil producer, officially known as Petroleos Mexicanos, is due to contribute more revenue to the federal government than lawmakers are scheduled to grant the company for its spending. “The Pemex tax burden is punitive, it’s extremely high and it doesn’t allow Pemex to reinvest,” said John Padilla, a Bogota-based consultant with IPD Latin America. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won office in July vowing to rescue Pemex from years of decline, has proposed increasing the firm’s discretionary budget by 14 percent from 2018 to some $23.4 billion (464.6 billion pesos). But the same budget proposal estimates total tax revenue from Pemex at about $26.4 billion (524.3 billion pesos), up about 11 percent. The finance ministry did not reply to requests for comment. Characterizing Pemex as a “piggy bank” for successive governments, Padilla said it was more heavily taxed than state-run peers including Brazil’s Petrobras and Colombia’s Ecopetrol. Pemex’s $106 billion in financial debt - the most of any national oil company in Latin America - could prove especially difficult to manage over the coming months if it were to lose its investment grade rating, he said. The budget blueprint also anticipates collecting nearly $4 billion (79 billion pesos) in additional gasoline taxes, but it is unclear if any of that revenue might be given to Pemex. The company, which receives funds to pay back the money it borrows, must pay back almost a third of its debt in the next three years. The spending plans must still be approved by Congress, but most analysts see that as a formality because Lopez Obrador’s MORENA party and allies have a comfortable majority. Lopez Obrador firmly opposed a 2013 constitutional overhaul championed by his predecessor that ended Pemex’s decades-long monopoly. The finance ministry is not proposing changes to the law that sets its tax regime, and the higher tax burden in 2019 is largely due to crude oil price assumptions. Next year’s budget assumes an average $55 per barrel price for Pemex’s oil exports, compared to $46 per barrel in 2018. Lopez Obrador also wants to end crude exports in three years so he can refine more at home. $1 = 19.8770 Mexican pesos

2018-12-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Friday to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017, heading for losses of more than 11 percent in a week, as global oversupply kept buyers away from the market ahead of holidays over the next two weeks. Crude has lost ground along with major equity markets as investors fret about the strength of the global economy heading into next year. The prospect of a possible government shutdown in the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer, has added to investors’ worries.  Oil markets have pulled back amid concerns about oversupply, despite planned production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.  “OPEC folks are not doing a good job of convincing the international oil community that they are going to be a strong advocate of their supply cut program,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York.  The price declines were exacerbated by thin trade and risk aversion ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays, traders said. Brent crude LCOc1 fell 53 cents, or nearly 1 percent, to settle at $53.82 a barrel, after falling during the session to $52.79 a barrel, the weakest since September 2017. U.S. light crude oil CLc1 settled down 29 cents at $45.59 a barrel, after earlier touching a session low of $45.13 a barrel. Both contracts fell more than 11 percent in the week. Since reaching multi-year highs at the beginning of October, both crude oil benchmarks have lost more than a third of their value in their steepest decline for three years. The big oil producers in OPEC, dominated by Middle East Gulf states reliant on energy exports, have agreed to reduce production to try to push up prices. But those output cuts - a reduction with Russia and other non-OPEC producers of 1.2 million bpd - do not kick in until next month, and meanwhile global inventories are growing fast. “The bear fest continues,” said Stephen Brennock, analyst at London brokerage PVM Oil. “According to OPEC’s own forecasts, global oil stocks will build by 500,000 bpd in the first half of 2019. This will compound a glut in OECD commercial oil stocks.” To show its commitment to reducing supply, OPEC will release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia, OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said in a letter reviewed by Reuters.  The proposed cut of 1.2 million bpd was an effective reduction for member countries of 3.02 percent, Barkindo said.  That is higher than the initially discussed cut of 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. Driving the sell-off has been sustained oversupply as the United States has emerged as the world’s biggest crude producer thanks to the success of its shale industry. The United States now pumps 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, more than either Saudi Arabia or Russia. U.S. energy companies added oil rigs for the first time in the past three weeks, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. Drillers added 10 oil rigs in the week to Dec. 21, bringing the total count to 883. RIG-OL-USA-BHI. This was the biggest gain in rigs since early November.

2018-12-21,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) * Canada nationalizes pipeline, Alberta intervenes to move crude * Environmental activism stymies pipeline projects * ‘Made-in-Canada crisis’ for world’s fourth largest oil producer * Ottawa pursues tighter regulation for pipelines By Rod Nickel and Julie Gordon WINNIPEG, Manitoba/VANCOUVER, Dec 21 (Reuters) - A decade ago, Canada’s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower, but a series of political missteps and formidable environmental activism has created a dysfunctional system requiring OPEC-style government intervention to move its oil to market. Canada produces 4.9 million barrels per day (bpd), more than any country other than the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia, but the world’s fourth largest producer has had to nationalize a pipeline and the province of Alberta is exploring buying trains to handle a glut of oil sitting in storage. Canada’s crisis coincides with big producers taking market share away from OPEC members, mostly clustered in the Middle East. Global oil demand is expected to surpass 100 million bpd in 2019. The United States has driven exports to record highs on growing demand from China, India and other developing countries. But Ottawa has failed under two governments to effectively counter the strategy of environmental activists to attack the oil sector’s heart by choking its arteries - pipelines. Roughly 35 million barrels, twice the normal amount, of Western Canadian crude used to produce diesel, gasoline and jet fuel is stuck in storage. The energy sector accounts for nearly 11 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product. However, Canadian oil trades at a fraction of global prices, costing the economy C$80 million per day, the Alberta provincial government said. Alberta took the unusual step this month of temporarily curtailing 325,000 bpd starting in January - in the aftermath of a retreat from the oil sands by global companies including ConocoPhillips and Statoil ASA. “It’s become dire now because the writing is clearly on the wall. The issue is market access,” said Jihad Traya, manager of energy advisory service HSB Solomon. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, facing an election next year, offered the oilpatch this week C$1.6 billion in aid. In May, Ottawa agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline in hopes of pushing through an expansion to nearly triple capacity as other proposed lines languished. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper boasted Canada would soon become an “energy superpower.” Canada was producing 2.6 million bpd, which moved smoothly to U.S. refineries through pipelines. Since then, production has nearly doubled, but pipeline growth has stalled. Both Conservative Harper and Liberal Trudeau squelched opportunities to complete pipelines just as opposition to more lines multiplied. Two projects were killed, and legal setbacks have stymied the development of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL and the government-owned Trans Mountain expansion. A year after taking office in 2015 Trudeau proposed a bargain aimed at satisfying both environmentalists and the oil industry - a national carbon-pricing plan to reduce Canada’s emissions while approving pipeline expansions. The strategy has inflamed both sides. When a court overturned Ottawa’s approval of the expansion of Trans Mountain in August, the deal was off and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley yanked support for Trudeau’s carbon plan just hours later. Indigenous and environmental opposition to pipelines has forced Trudeau to push for tighter regulations on future pipelines. The changes are necessary to “depoliticize” the system, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said. “We need to fix the broken system that we have now so we are able to build the pipeline capacity that is so necessary.” But Trudeau has already shelved Enbridge’s Northern Gateway proposal, which would have run through northern Alberta to the Pacific coast, and the National Energy Board in 2017 toughened its review of TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline while it was underway. Both projects are now dead. Alberta is seeking to buy rail cars to reduce the glut, and earlier this month, the province ordered producers to cut output after its oil fell to a discount of $52 per barrel from U.S. oil in October. Notley told reporters on Tuesday that people in Alberta can make profits from oil and gas, “but they need Ottawa to take the handcuffs off. We need rail. We need long-term support for getting that pipeline built.” Alberta’s oil sands, a mixture of sand, water, clay and thick, heavy oil, became a compelling target for environmentalists as production expanded dramatically in the early 2000s. The mining process scrapes away trees and vegetation across huge tracts of land, leaving a path of destruction captured in aerial images, while a different production method using steam consumes huge amounts of natural gas. Clayton Thomas-Muller, an indigenous activist, said environmentalists grew frustrated trying to stop the industry’s expansion through the Alberta Energy Regulator, but found a new strategy of opposing the pipelines. They built wider coalitions, tapping into anger of Nebraska ranchers and drawing the attention of Hollywood celebrities such as director James Cameron. Opponents of TransCanada’s Keystone XL began protests at the White House in 2011, seeking arrest and attention. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama finally rejected the project in 2015. “Full credit to climate-change advocates, they kicked the snot out of Corporate Canada,” said Tim Powers, a Conservative political strategist. He said Canadian resource companies have been too focused on the regulatory process, while climate-change advocates “laid out a better, more compelling narrative” to win public opinion. U.S. President Donald Trump resurrected Keystone XL in 2017. But both KXL and Trans Mountain remain in regulatory limbo after courts ruled in recent months that the U.S. and Canadian governments failed to properly do their jobs. The cases that overturned approvals for Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain led companies to question investment in Canada. The end result is a Canadian oil patch in retreat. “My main fear is that other nations will continue to produce at market price and Canada will be left behind,” said Duncan Au, chief executive of CWC Energy Services Corp. The well drilling company has cut about 70 employees, or nearly 10 percent, since the beginning of 2018. “This is a made-in-Canada crisis,” Au said.

2018-12-21,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock markets continued a week-long sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and further hikes in U.S. borrowing costs compounded investor anxiety that global economic growth is slowing. MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.5 percent, dragged down by broad declines in Europe and Asia. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks initially moved higher after Commerce Department data showed the U.S. economy is on pace to grow by 3 percent this year but pared their gains and then turned lower. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 101.31 points, or 0.44 percent, to 22,758.29, the S&P 500 lost 18.8 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,448.62 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 124.61 points, or 1.91 percent, to 6,403.80. Investor sentiment remained cautious. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market, while broad stock markets in the United States and Europe are on pace for the worst quarter since the financial crisis in late 2008. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless Congress authorizes money for a Mexico border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. [nL1N1YQ0E8] “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. “Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.” Adding to the air of crisis was news that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was also planned. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017. U.S. crude fell 1 percent to $45.44 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.3 percent to $53.10. [O/R] Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 2/32 in price to yield 2.7938 percent, from 2.789 percent late on Thursday. As recently as October, they had been at a seven-year high of 3.261 percent.

2018-12-21,"(Adds details, background) WARSAW, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Poland promised to give tax relief to energy consumers and asked its utilities to cut costs as part of measures designed to prevent surging electricity prices next year when the country holds a general election. The measures proposed by the government, ruled by the conservative Law and Justice party (PiS), will help keep 2019 power prices at the level seen in the first half of 2018, Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a televised press conference. Wholesale power prices in Poland surged earlier this year, mostly driven by rising coal prices and carbon emission costs, as Poland generates most of its electricity in polluting coal-fueled power plants. “As a result of the EU climate policies and mistakes by our predecessors, there are some mechanisms which are pushing power prices up. But we are launching mechanisms which will help keep prices stable,” Morawiecki said. The draft law says that the excise tax paid by all electricity consumers in Poland will be cut to 5 zlotys ($1.33) per megawatt hour (MWh) from 20 zlotys. Morawiecki also called on state-run power producers, which include PGE, Enea, Energa and Tauron, to cut costs. To cover the cost of the tax relief the government plans to sell extra CO2 emission allowances to the tune of around 4.5 billion zlotys. “The sum of all these assumptions will result in prices being stable at the level in the first half of 2018,” Morawiecki also said. While the head of the energy market regulator said earlier this year that higher energy prices would have to be reflected in household bills, the energy minister has said prices will remain unchanged. The expected rise in power prices has prompted the central bank to increase its inflation forecasts.

2018-12-21,"WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The United States has extended for 90 days a waiver granted to Iraq from sanctions against Iran, a State Department spokesman said on Friday, allowing Baghdad to keep importing Iranian gas that is critical for Iraqi power production. The extension was reached on Thursday, when a previous 45-day waiver was due to expire, during a visit to Washington by an Iraqi delegation, according to two Iraqi officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations. “A 90-day waiver was granted to allow Iraq to continue to pay for electricity imports from Iran,” a State Department spokesman said, adding that the waiver will apply to both electricity and gas. The Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran’s energy exports in November, citing its nuclear program and meddling in the Middle East, but has granted waivers to several buyers to meet consumer energy needs.  Washington gave Iraq a 45-day waiver for imports of gas from Iran when it reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil sector on Nov. 5. Iraqi officials have said they need around two years to find an alternative source. Iraq relies heavily on Iranian gas to feed its power stations, importing roughly 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day via pipelines in the south and east. The State Department spokesman said Washington continued to work with Iraq to end its dependence on Iranian natural gas and increase its energy independence. “These efforts will continue to promote the use of Iraqi natural resources, strengthen Iraq’s economy and development, and encourage a united, democratic, and prosperous Iraq free from malign Iranian influence,” the spokesman said. A senior Iraqi government official and a central bank official told Reuters that talks with the United States were continuing on Friday to finalize details, including how to pay Iran for energy imports, two sources said.  The Trump administration has said Iraq should not pay Iran in U.S. dollars or euros. A team from Iraq’s central bank joined the delegation to find a solution. Washington has said it wants to roll back Iranian influence in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where Iran holds broad sway over politics and trade.  Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said on Dec. 11 that the United States was working with Iraq on the matter of Iranian gas because it was “linked to a very sensitive issue which is electricity.” Persistent power shortages fueled protests this summer in the south of Iraq, which is still reeling from a three-year war against Islamic State.  The prime minister, who took office in October, met U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Baghdad this month. Perry, who came with a delegation of more than 50 business people, also met Iraq’s oil and electricity ministers. Iraq has reached a deal with General Electric Co (GE.N) and German rival Siemens AG (SIEGn.DE) to install liquefied natural gas-operated mobile power units at some small southern oil fields, Iraq’s state newspaper reported last month. The Financial Times reported in October that the U.S. government had intervened in favor of GE for a contract sought by both companies to supply 11 gigawatts of power generation equipment, reportedly worth about $15 billion.

2018-12-21,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said he hoped to finalise a new national unity government on Friday after more than seven months of political wrangling. By the early evening, there was still no sign of an announcement. Lebanese politicians have indicated a government deal is close but have yet to declare a final agreement. “Cross your fingers, don’t jinx me. I’m trying to work very hard to finalise today the government, Inshallah (God Willing). There are still some things to be done but I think we should be able to finalise,” Hariri told a Beirut business conference. “God willing we will finish today.” Efforts to form the government have been obstructed by conflicting demands for cabinet seats that must be parcelled out in line with a sectarian power-sharing system. “We don’t know the circumstances that have not yielded the government today,” said Qassem Hashem, one of six pro-Hezbollah Sunni MPs who have together demanded a cabinet post, in the latest standoff blocking a deal.  “We leave matters up to the coming hours,” he said in TV comments on Friday evening, adding that talks would continue.  Heavily indebted and suffering from a stagnant economy, Lebanon is in dire need of an administration that can set about long-stalled reforms to put public debt on a sustainable footing. Hariri said everyone was committed to reforms and said the government would try to bring down the subsidy it pays on energy by about $600 million in 2019. Lebanon has the third largest debt-to-GDP ratio in the world. Hariri also said a second round of bidding for Lebanese off-shore energy exploration should be open in February or March, adding that BP “is interested and the Americans are interested”. Lebanon’s first round of exploration began in May after authorities approved an exploration plan submitted by a consortium of France’s Total, Italy’s Eni and Russia’s Novatek.

2018-12-21,"MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsui & Co Ltd (8031.T), Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Aramco are in talks to buy stakes in Novatek’s (NVTK.MM) Arctic LNG 2 project, with the size of the investments still to be decided, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Novatek plans to start producing LNG at Arctic LNG 2 in 2022-2023. The plant, which is expected to cost around $25.5 billion, will have an annual production capacity of 19.8 million tonnes and will be Novatek’s second LNG plant after Yamal LNG.  Novatek owns a 90 percent stake in the project, with France’s Total (TOTF.PA) holding the other 10 percent. Novatek intends to keep a 60 percent stake in Arctic LNG 2, offering 30 percent to other investors.  However, under certain conditions Novatek may cut its stake further, although not to below 50 percent in order to keep control over the project. Two sources familiar with the talks said that Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and the Russian Direct Investment Fund are in talks with Novatek over taking stakes in the project, which should bring the Russian gas company closer to its goal of producing as much LNG as Qatar, one of the world’s top LNG suppliers.  “Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and RDIF are interested to buy a stake in Arctic LNG 2 but there is also an interest from South Asia,” one of the sources said.  Japan is the world’s top LNG consumer, with Russia among its key LNG suppliers. There are currently two LNG plants operating in Russia: Novatek’s Yamal LNG and Gazprom’s Sakhalin 2 and Moscow has ambitions for more.  A third source confirmed Mitsui’s interest in the project. Three other sources familiar with the talks confirmed the interest from Saudi Aramco and RDIF. “Saudi Aramco is currently holding technical due-diligence. When the commercial talks approach, RDIF will join(in),” one of the three sources familiar with the talks said.  While RDIF will invest in the project, its contribution is likely to be less than Aramco’s, the second of the three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Talks between Mitsui and Novatek are separate from talks with Saudi Aramco and RDIF, sources said. Each would have a stake in Arctic LNG 2 if their talks succeed, according to the sources. Saudi Aramco declined to comment and Novatek could not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment on Friday. RDIF declined to comment.  “We have a general interest in the project and we are exchanging our opinions with parties involved,” a Mitsui spokesman said when asked whether the company planned to invest in the project. This week, Novatek awarded a 2.2 billion euro ($2.51 billion) contract to Italian energy contractor Saipem (SPMI.MI) and Turkish oil and gas services firm Renaissance for the construction of gravity-based structure platforms that will stand on the seabed to support the LNG processing units.

2018-12-21,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway said on Friday it would build a wind park in an area used for reindeer grazing despite U.N. calls to suspend the project to study the impact on the indigenous herders’ livelihoods. The Petroleum and Energy Ministry said it would proceed with the 288 megawatt (MW) Storheia wind park, which is part of Europe’s largest onshore wind power project being developed by the Fosen Vind consortium. The group, owned by TroenderEnergi, Statkraft and the Nordic Wind Power consortium, is building six wind farms with combined capacity of 1,057 MW at a cost of 11 billion crowns ($1.26 billion). “After careful consideration, the ministry has concluded that there is no basis for stopping the (building) of the Storheia wind turbines,” the ministry said in a statement. In a Dec. 10 letter, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination asked Norway to suspend the project so it could examine a complaint that the project would disturb reindeer herding, a traditional activity of the Sami people. Reindeer herders have said the sight and sound of the turbines in the park, to be built in an area on Norway’s northwest coast used as pastures during winter months, could frighten the animals. The ministry said Norway tried to address U.N. requests but would disregard it on this occasion after the wind farm had passed all domestic legal checks. Most of the infrastructure was already completed so turbines could be installed between April and August, the ministry said. Storheia will have 80 wind turbines of 3.6 MW each, constructed by Vestas and is due to be commissioned in 2019. The whole project will be completed in 2020. Statkraft owns 52.1 percent of the consortium, followed by the Nordic Power group with 40 percent and TroenderEnergi with 7.9 percent.

2018-12-21,"PARIS (Reuters) - A Paris court fined French oil and gas group Total (TOTF.PA) 500,000 euros ($570,000) on Friday for bribing foreign public officials in a case related to Iranian contracts in 1997. Total, was charged with paying $30 million under the cover of a consultancy contract to facilitate a deal for the South Pars gas field more than two decades ago, which the Paris prosecutor said covered “corruption payments”. Court documents said that from around 1995 to 2004, at the request of an Iranian official cited as Medhi Hashemi Rafsanjani, the son of Iran’s former president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Total and intermediaries made illicit payments to middlemen designated by Medhi to help the company. Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani was not immediately available to comment on Friday. Total’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne said in a statement after the ruling that the company would no longer pursue the matter because none of the individuals under investigation were still alive. “Anyone who knew (former Total CEO) Christophe de Margerie knows that he would never be involved in any type of corruption,” Pouyanne said.  “However, given the specific circumstances of this case, which has been already judged in the U.S. and in which none of the individuals can defend themselves, Total doesn’t want to pursue it,” he added. It is not the first time that Total’s business with Iran has ended in court. In 2013 it agreed to pay $398 million to settle a U.S. criminal and civil allegation that it paid bribes between 1995 and 2004 to win oil and gas contracts. This was billed as the first coordinated action by French and U.S. law enforcement in a major foreign bribery case and at the time the Paris prosecutor recommended Total and its then CEO de Margerie face trial in France.

2018-12-21,"GENEVA, Dec 21 (Reuters) - A Geneva prosecutor is reviewing material in a suitcase seized nearly three years ago to decide what can be shared with Italian authorities in a case involving oil majors Eni and Royal Dutch Shell and corrupt payments in Nigeria, his office said on Friday. The prosecutor received the green light after Switzerland’s top court, the Federal Tribunal, rejected an appeal by Nigerian defendant Emeka Obi to prevent his bag from being unsealed. The Lausanne court’s Nov. 8 ruling, published online, said that the confiscated material - including documents, an external hard drive, British and African passports, and USB keys - could have “potential pertinence” in the criminal investigation and the sealing could be lifted without violating Swiss law. “The Geneva prosecutor now has access to all the material in conformity with the Federal Tribunal ruling,” it said in a reply to Reuters. He will select the material to be handed over, it said. Under Swiss law, privileged information cannot be shared in international judicial assistance in criminal matters and the prosecutor’s choice of documents can be appealed. Obi’s Geneva lawyers Paul Gully-Hart and Charles Goumaz told Reuters that they were cooperating with the prosecutor’s office. “With respect to the ongoing proceedings in Switzerland, regarding the suitcase of our client, we can confirm that no decision has yet been taken in respect of the transmission of any of its contents to the Italian authorities,” they said in a statement. “Our client has maintained his innocence in regards to the various allegations made by the Milan prosecutors and is confident that the final evaluation of the contents of his bag will confirm this. “Our position remains, as it has always been from the beginning, that the only material that should even be considered for transmission to the Italians must be strictly limited to non-protected material that is directly related to our client’s involvement in the OPL 245 transaction,” they added. An Italian judge said on Monday Eni and Shell were fully aware their 2011 purchase of a Nigerian oilfield would result in corrupt payments to Nigerian politicians and officials. Eni and Shell bought the OPL 245 offshore field for about $1.3 billion in a deal that spawned one of the industry’s largest corruption scandals. It is alleged that about $1.1 billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen. The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years. Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months. Eni has denied any wrongdoing. Shell said on Monday that neither Obi nor Di Nardo had worked for Shell, and that there was no basis to convict it or any of its former staff of alleged offences related to the deal. Obi brought the Swiss case to keep the contents of the bag seized in Geneva in April 2016 from being shared with foreign authorities. Its confiscation led the Geneva prosecutor to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and money-laundering. Days later Italian authorities requested judicial assistance, arguing that the suitcase and its contents had been deliberately stashed in Geneva, the Swiss ruling said. Italy’s proceedings targeted 13 defendants and two companies suspected of corruption activities from 2009 and 2014 linked to acquiring prospecting rights in Africa, it said.

2018-12-21,"* Policy mistake fears send investors running for exit * Investment-grade bond funds see $5.5 bln outflows * Record outflows from bank loans and financials stocks * Biggest EM equity inflows since Feb (Updates, adds quotes, details) By Helen Reid Dec 21 - Fears the U.S. Federal Reserve could make a policy mistake by sticking to plans to raise interest rates next year have driven investors to abandon stocks and pile into bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists said on Friday. Government bond funds had their biggest inflows since January 2016 with $5 billion ploughed into the assets seen as safer than stocks, BAML said in a note citing flows data from data provider EPFR. Investors dumped bank assets seen as among the most vulnerable to an economic downturn, pulling a record $3.3 billion from financial sector stocks and $2.9 billion from bank loans. The sharp reassessment of risk in markets comes after the Fed spooked investors by raising interest rates and sticking by a plan to keep withdrawing support from an economy it views as strong. Investors pulled $8.3 billion from equity funds this week, though that was composed of $27.7 billion of mutual fund redemptions tempered somewhat by $19.4 billion into ETFs. In fixed income, emerging market debt saw its 11th week of outflows ($2.0 billion), while high-yield bond funds lost $3 billion and investment-grade bond funds had “massive” redemptions of $5.5 billion. “We strongly believe liquidity & credit = “glue” for bull market and both have cracked in 2018,” wrote strategists at the U.S. bank. BEAR-Y CHRISTMAS This year has been disastrous for global markets which have lost $16.7 trillion in market value — equivalent to the European Union’s GDP, the BAML strategists wrote. The last year when cash had positive returns while all three of equity, credit, and government bonds were in the red was 1969. Investors will see 2018 as a year to forget as many entered it in an optimistic mood, only to be disappointed by sluggish growth, an escalating trade war and political turmoil. European stocks, which have been in the firing line throughout the year as investors fled the region facing uncertainty over Brexit, wrangling about the Italian budget, and a global trade war, suffered their fourth biggest outflows ever. Some $5.4 billion flowed out of European equity funds over the past week. U.S. equities saw more modest outflows with $4.4 billion pulled from the region. Sector flows also painted a picture of risk aversion with only utilities, seen as a “defensive” sector in times of market stress, enjoying modest inflows of $500 million. Materials, consumer, healthcare, real  estate, tech, and energy sectors all had outflows of between $0.5 billion and $1 billion. The financials sector was the worst-hit. The only silver lining was the resurgence of emerging market equity funds, which had their biggest inflows since February with $4.5 billion added to the asset class. That took the ten-week total inflows to $21 billion as investors turned more optimistic on emerging markets which have suffered this year from a potent combination of a strong dollar, global trade war and decelerating China.

2018-12-21,"NEW YORK, Dec 21 (Reuters) - World stock markets continued a week-long sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and further hikes in U.S. borrowing costs compounded investor anxiety that global economic growth is slowing. MSCI’s index of global equities fell 0.1 percent, dragged down by broad declines in Europe and Asia. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks moved higher after Commerce Department data showed the U.S. economy is on pace to grow by 3 percent this year . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 351.17 points, or 1.54 percent, to 23,210.77, the S&P 500 gained 5.1 points, or 0.21 percent, to 2,472.52 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 23.96 points, or 0.37 percent, to 6,504.45. Despite the early gains on Wall Street, investor sentiment remained cautious. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market, while broad stock markets in the United States and Europe are on pace for the worst quarter since the financial crisis in late 2008. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” U.S. President Donald Trump has refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless Congress authorizes money for a Mexico border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. “Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.” Adding to the air of crisis was news that U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was also planned. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017. U.S. crude fell 1 percent to $45.44 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.3 percent to $53.10. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.7991 percent, from 2.789 percent late on Thursday. As recently as October, they had been at a seven-year high of 3.261 percent. The dollar index rose 0.45 percent, with the euro down 0.38 percent to $1.1401.

2018-12-21,"LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Political instability and low credit ratings in emerging economies are putting some shipowners off ordering new floating storage and regasification units (FSRUs), as they shift focus to more mature gas markets. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) demand from emerging markets in Asia, Africa and South America was expected to be boosted by FSRU technologies that are less expensive and time-consuming than onshore import terminals. But a boom in speculative FSRU orders from shipowners led to an oversupply of units this year as import projects across the world were delayed or cancelled, suggesting demand had been overestimated. Norway’s Hoegh LNG announced on Friday a second contract for an FSRU in Australia this year. The FSRU project for the import of LNG at Crib Point in Victoria developed by Australia’s AGL Energy Ltd will allow Hoegh to charter out its FSRU for 10 years. The move comes as Australia’s eastern states suffer from gas shortages even though LNG production on the west coast made the country the largest LNG producer in November. In August, Hoegh LNG won a tender for an import project in New South Wales developed by Australian Industrial Energy, a consortium that includes Japan’s JERA and Marubeni Corp. “We will only work with either major energy or state companies now,” Hoegh’s chief executive, Sveinung Stoehle, told Reuters. Hoegh has pulled out of FSRU projects in Ghana, Chile and Pakistan due to delays and cancellations. Stoehle said he sees Asia as the main market for Hoegh FSRUs now. The FSRU Hoegh Esperanza started a contract for China’s CNOOC this year. Stoehle hopes to deliver one more FSRU to China in the next two years. “We will not place new orders until we have long-term deals for (our existing FSRUs),” he added. With the Australian deals concluded, Hoegh is thought to have two FSRUs still not committed to a long-term contract. However, the company is a frontrunner for an import project in an Asian country, with a decision due within a year, Stoehle said. Hoegh is also in advanced talks with Germany’s Uniper on the Sharjah FSRU project in the United Arab Emirates, a source familiar with the talks said. Other shipowners appear to be taking a similar strategy. Belgium’s Exmar said it also would look for long-term contracts before ordering new vessels. After the sale of a 50 percent stake in its four units to U.S. firm Excelerate Energy in 2017, the company has only one FSRU, a barge-based unit chartered for 10 years to Swiss trading house Gunvor for a Bangladesh import project, now halted by political uncertainty in the country. “We have not taken any final decision yet but its chances are very thin,” said Mohammad Quamruzzaman, managing director of Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co, the unit in charge of LNG imports at Bangladesh’s state-owned oil firm Petrobangla. Japan’s Mitsui O.S.K. Lines (MOL) said it had not placed new orders for FSRUs this year either, adding that it was awaiting a final investment decision (FID) on an import project in Germany, also developed by Uniper. “FID on this project is targeted to take place within 2019,” an MOL spokesman said. “We will order FSRU for the project after FID.” Keith Bainbridge, director of CS LNG shipping consultancy, said he would be surprised to see any FSRU orders apart from the MOL Germany FSRU in 2019. The oversupply of units led to around seven FSRUs being employed as LNG carriers this year, shipbrokers said. “The problem of oversupply goes back to domestic politics (in emerging economies),” Bainbridge said.

2018-12-21,"BAGHDAD/ERBIL, Dec 21 (Reuters) - The United States has reached an agreement in principle with Iraq to extend for 90 days an exemption to sanctions against Iran, allowing Baghdad to keep importing Iranian gas that is critical for Iraqi power production. The extension was reached on Thursday, when a previous 45-day waiver was due to expire, during a visit to Washington by an Iraqi delegation, according to two Iraqi officials with direct knowledge of the negotiations. A senior Iraqi government official and a central bank official told Reuters that talks were continuing on Friday to finalise details, including how to pay Iran for energy imports, two sources said. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said Iraq should not pay Iran in U.S. dollars or euros. A team from Iraq’s central bank joined the delegation to find a solution. Washington initially granted Iraq a 45-day waiver for Iranian gas when it reimposed sanctions on Nov. 5, after months of negotiations. Iraq relies heavily on Iranian gas to feed its power stations, importing roughly 1.5 billion standard cubic feet per day via pipelines in the south and east. Iraqi officials have said they need about two years to find an alternative source. Washington has said it wants to roll back Iranian influence in the Middle East, including in Iraq, where Iran holds broad sway over politics and trade. Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi said on Dec 11 that the United States was working with Iraq on the issue of Iranian gas because it was “linked to a very sensitive issue which is electricity”. Persistent power shortages fuelled protests this summer in the south of Iraq, which is still reeling from a three-year war against Islamic State. The prime minister, who took office in October, met U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Baghdad this month. Perry, who came with a delegation of more than 50 business people, also met Iraq’s oil and electricity ministers. Iraq has reached a deal with U.S. energy giant General Electric and German rival Siemens to install liquefied natural gas-operated mobile power units at some small southern oil fields, Iraq’s state newspaper reported last month. The Financial Times reported in October that the U.S. government had intervened in favour of GE for a contract sought by both companies to supply 11 gigawatts of power generation equipment, reportedly worth around $15 billion.

2018-12-21,"LAGOS (Reuters) - Plans to build another privately-financed power station in Nigeria to help end decades of chronic blackouts have been delayed because of concerns about persistent shortfalls in payments for electricity across the sector. The $1.1 billion Qua Iboe Power Plant being developed by energy infrastructure company Black Rhino and the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation won’t get a green light by the end of 2018 as planned and it was unclear when the deal might close, NNPC told Reuters. The delay is a setback for Africa’s biggest oil producer where 80 million people don’t have access to grid power supplies and it exposes the difficulties in attracting private investment to a sector that successive governments have tried to reform. The uncertainty surrounding the 540-megawatt Qua Iboe plant stems from the difficulties Nigeria’s first privately-financed independent power project - the 460-megawatt Azura-Edo plant - has encountered since it came online this year. Azura was meant to be a model for a string of independent power plants financed by international investors. To give them confidence to invest in the first major plant since the power sector was privatised in 2013, the World Bank provided a safeguard known as a partial risk guarantee - meaning the lender would step in if Nigeria defaulted on payments. Under the current system, the government-owned Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading company (NBET) buys power from generators and passes it on to distributors who then collect money from customers and reimburse NBET. But because NBET is not paid in full for the power it buys, generators such as Azura have been partly reimbursed from an emergency central bank loan fund created to keep the sector afloat. NNPC told Reuters one of the reasons the Qua Iboe plant (QIPP), which is due to be built in the southern state of Akwa Ibom, had been delayed was because NBET appeared reluctant to commit to new projects to avoid increasing its liabilities. “The continued delay relates to the current cashflow challenges at NBET, as highlighted by the Azura project,” a spokesman for NNPC said in an emailed statement. “This concern is justified by the fact that NBET is yet to see an improvement in collections from DISCOs (distribution companies).” NBET did not immediately respond to a request for comment on NNPC’s statement about QIPP. NBET chief executive Marilyn Amobi told Reuters in November that it was hard for the company to work because of poor infrastructure and shortfalls in cash from distributors needed to reimburse generators. “You don’t have the infrastructure, you don’t have the financial position to do it, you don’t actually have the products, and you don’t have the grid,” she said. NNPC said another problem for QIPP was that the World Bank had made a partial risk guarantee, similar to the one that helped Azura attract investors, contingent on the government’s implementation of an agreed power sector recovery plan. “In theory it is okay, but the risk is there are delays in the approvals which may impact QIPP,” NNPC said. Power ministry officials and the World Bank have been in talks about long-term structural changes needed to trigger the release of a $1 billion loan to help pay for reforms. A World Bank spokeswoman said the loan had yet to be submitted to its board for approval and that the Washington-based lender considered the recovery plan to be “critical for de-risking the sector for private investments”. Problems that need to be tackled include decaying infrastructure, mounting debts, low tariffs for electricity and a dilapidated government-owned grid that would collapse if all the country’s power generators operated at full tilt. Even though NBET has an agreement to buy 13 gigawatts (GW) from power generators, the system can only cope with distributors sending out an average of 4 GW, according to the ministry of power.  The World Bank spokeswoman confirmed any future guarantees for independent power plants (IPPs) would be linked to the plan’s implementation - because the economic and financial viability of generation capacity expansion was at risk. A spokeswoman for Black Rhino, which is one of private equity firm Blackstone’s portfolio companies, declined to comment on NNPC’s announcement of a delay to QIPP. When the project was unveiled, Nigerian cement giant Dangote Group was named as a joint venture partner - along with Black Rhino and the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation. But a Dangote executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the company, owned by Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, had pulled out. “The huge debt level, and, the fact the IPPs are not making profits, is another reason for prospective investors to be deterred,” he said. “Further, collecting revenue from the distribution companies is also becoming a mirage.” A Dangote Group spokesman declined to comment on the delay to QIPP, or whether the company had pulled out. The payment problems in the Nigerian power sector were thrust into the spotlight in March when four generating companies filed a lawsuit against the government and Azura. To ensure the generating companies were paid in full throughout 2017 and 2018, the government created a 701 billion naira ($2.3 billion) loan fund at the central bank to guarantee payments. When the fund was established in 2017, Azura wasn’t part of the calculations. But when Azura started producing electricity, the fund was also used to pay the new plant to ensure the terms of loan deals guaranteed by the World Bank were not breached. As a result, the other companies were told they would only receive 80 percent of the sums owed, according to the lawsuit filed in March. The four energy companies want the fund to reimburse them in full, rather than allocating part of the money to the new plant. Azura declined to comment on payments for power generated. “If the central bank wasn’t paying, the system would collapse,” an official at a multilateral lender said on condition of anonymity. “Qua Iboe IPP would enter a system that is illiquid and insolvent. The liquidity is being provided by the central bank.” The official said QIPP would need the same partial risk guarantee Azura received to get off the ground, but the handling of payments to Azura by the Nigerian authorities so far meant there was little appetite to offer the same support. Fola Fagbule, senior vice president and head of advisory at Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) - one of the multilateral lenders that invested in Azura - agreed that the Qua Iboe project would struggle without payment guarantees. “What you have is an insolvent system,” he said. “It is really difficult to make a case for a project on that scale.” A person with direct knowledge of QIPP who declined to be named said Azura’s experience was damaging international investors’ view of Nigeria, Africa’s most populous nation. “There has to be some understanding of how the sector is going to be able to afford new electrons coming into the grid,” the person said. “(Those involved) do not want QIPP to build a project that could just end up in a default situation.” Nigeria’s privatised power sector typically does not use meters to provide invoices, bill collections are low and energy tariffs have remained fixed for three years, meaning customers receive unsustainably cheap electricity. The effect, say industry experts, is that electricity distribution companies recover so little revenue from customers that they pay less than a third of what they owe to generating companies - and that’s why debts have ballooned. Sunday Oduntan, spokesman for the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors, said debt levels in the sector were caused by the artificial suppression of tariffs. He said there was a 1.3 trillion naira ($4.2 billion) market shortfall that meant distributors were unable to invest in improvements. “You cannot be selling a product below cost price and expect high remittance. The shortfall in the sector is because of the lack of a cost-reflective tariff,” said Oduntan, who speaks on behalf of Nigeria’s 11 electricity distribution companies. Debts across the sector partly stem from a currency crisis that took hold in 2016, just months after Azura secured its financing. The bulk of power company costs are in U.S. dollars but customers pay for power in naira. The naira lost about 30 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar in June 2016 but the devaluation was not factored into a government tariff structure that has remained unchanged. Louis Edozien, permanent secretary in the ministry of power, told Reuters there was evidence tariffs must rise, but it was also the responsibility of distributors to improve their collections, partly through better metering and infrastructure. As for the future of QIPP, the state oil company said it would take six to eight months from whenever NBET executes an agreement to purchase power from the plant before a final investment decision could be taken. The NNPC spokesman said there were a number of other “knotty issues”, including the completion of a transmission line from the project site. He said QIPP had now agreed in a major concession to pay $20 million for it to be finished. He also said there was a disagreement between QIPP and the central bank about the exchange rate at which power producers could buy U.S. dollars with naira. He said this had been escalated to the minister of finance. With the $1 billion World Bank power sector loan on hold for now, the government is considering putting another 600 billion naira into the central bank fund to pay generators when the initial amount runs out early next year, sources said. It was not clear how the central bank loans to the sector would be repaid. Central Bank Governor Godwin Emefiele told Reuters that payments from the fund could be made up to February and that the bank was holding talks with World Bank officials. “The loan negotiations are still in progress with no terminal date yet fixed,” the power ministry’s Edozien said.

2018-12-21,"MOSCOW/DUBAI (Reuters) - Japan’s Mitsui & Co Ltd (8031.T), Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF and Saudi Aramco are in talks to buy stakes in Novatek’s (NVTK.MM) Arctic LNG 2 project, with the size of the investments still to be decided, sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Novatek plans to start producing LNG at Arctic LNG 2 in 2022-2023. The plant, which is expected to cost around $25.5 billion, will have an annual production capacity of 19.8 million tonnes and will be Novatek’s second LNG plant after Yamal LNG.  Novatek owns a 90 percent stake in the project, with France’s Total (TOTF.PA) holding the other 10 percent. Novatek intends to keep a 60 percent stake in Arctic LNG 2, offering 30 percent to other investors.  However, under certain conditions Novatek may cut its stake further, although not to below 50 percent in order to keep control over the project. Two sources familiar with the talks said that Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and the Russian Direct Investment Fund are in talks with Novatek over taking stakes in the project, which should bring the Russian gas company closer to its goal of producing as much LNG as Qatar, one of the world’s top LNG suppliers.  “Mitsui, Saudi Aramco and RDIF are interested to buy a stake in Arctic LNG 2 but there is also an interest from South Asia,” one of the sources said.  Japan is the world’s top LNG consumer, with Russia among its key LNG suppliers. There are currently two LNG plants operating in Russia: Novatek’s Yamal LNG and Gazprom’s Sakhalin 2 and Moscow has ambitions for more.  A third source confirmed Mitsui’s interest in the project. Three other sources familiar with the talks confirmed the interest from Saudi Aramco and RDIF. “Saudi Aramco is currently holding technical due-diligence. When the commercial talks approach, RDIF will join(in),” one of the three sources familiar with the talks said.  While RDIF will invest in the project, its contribution is likely to be less than Aramco’s, the second of the three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.  Saudi Aramco and Novatek could not immediately respond to a Reuters request for a comment on Friday. RDIF declined to comment.  “We have a general interest in the project and we are exchanging our opinions with parties involved,” a Mitsui spokesman said when asked whether the company planned to invest in the project. This week, Novatek awarded a 2.2 billion euro ($2.51 billion) contract to Italian energy contractor Saipem (SPMI.MI) and Turkish oil and gas services firm Renaissance for the construction of gravity-based structure platforms that will stand on the seabed to support the LNG processing units.

2018-12-21,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - A decade ago, Canada’s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower, but a series of political missteps and formidable environmental activism has created a dysfunctional system requiring OPEC-style government intervention to move its oil to market.  Canada produces 4.9 million barrels per day (bpd), more than any country other than the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia, but the world’s fourth largest producer has had to nationalize a pipeline and the province of Alberta is exploring buying trains to handle a glut of oil sitting in storage.  Canada’s crisis coincides with big producers taking market share away from OPEC members, mostly clustered in the Middle East. Global oil demand is expected to surpass 100 million bpd in 2019. The United States has driven exports to record highs on growing demand from China, India and other developing countries.  But Ottawa has failed under two governments to effectively counter the strategy of environmental activists to attack the oil sector’s heart by choking its arteries - pipelines. Roughly 35 million barrels, twice the normal amount, of Western Canadian crude used to produce diesel, gasoline and jet fuel is stuck in storage. The energy sector accounts for nearly 11 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product. However, Canadian oil trades at a fraction of global prices, costing the economy C$80 million per day, the Alberta provincial government said. Alberta took the unusual step this month of temporarily curtailing 325,000 bpd starting in January - in the aftermath of a retreat from the oil sands by global companies including ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Statoil ASA STL.OL. “It’s become dire now because the writing is clearly on the wall. The issue is market access,” said Jihad Traya, manager of energy advisory service HSB Solomon. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, facing an election next year, offered the oilpatch this week C$1.6 billion in aid. In May, Ottawa agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline in hopes of pushing through an expansion to nearly triple capacity as other proposed lines languished. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper boasted Canada would soon become an “energy superpower.” Canada was producing 2.6 million bpd, which moved smoothly to U.S. refineries through pipelines. Since then, production has nearly doubled, but pipeline growth has stalled. Both Conservative Harper and Liberal Trudeau squelched opportunities to complete pipelines just as opposition to more lines multiplied. Two projects were killed, and legal setbacks have stymied the development of TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) Keystone XL and the government-owned Trans Mountain expansion.  A year after taking office in 2015 Trudeau proposed a bargain aimed at satisfying both environmentalists and the oil industry - a national carbon-pricing plan to reduce Canada’s emissions while approving pipeline expansions.  The strategy has inflamed both sides.  When a court overturned Ottawa’s approval of the expansion of Trans Mountain in August, the deal was off and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley yanked support for Trudeau’s carbon plan just hours later.  Indigenous and environmental opposition to pipelines has forced Trudeau to push for tighter regulations on future pipelines. The changes are necessary to “depoliticize” the system, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said. “We need to fix the broken system that we have now so we are able to build the pipeline capacity that is so necessary.” But Trudeau has already shelved Enbridge’s Northern Gateway proposal, which would have run through northern Alberta to the Pacific coast, and the National Energy Board in 2017 toughened its review of TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline while it was  underway.  Both projects are now dead. Alberta is seeking to buy rail cars to reduce the glut, and earlier this month, the province ordered producers to cut output after its oil fell to a discount of $52 per barrel from U.S. oil in October. Notley told reporters on Tuesday that people in Alberta can make profits from oil and gas, “but they need Ottawa to take the handcuffs off. We need rail. We need long-term support for getting that pipeline built.” Alberta’s oil sands, a mixture of sand, water, clay and thick, heavy oil, became a compelling target for environmentalists as production expanded dramatically in the early 2000s. The mining process scrapes away trees and vegetation across huge tracts of land, leaving a path of destruction captured in aerial images, while a different production method using steam consumes huge amounts of natural gas.  Clayton Thomas-Muller, an indigenous activist, said environmentalists grew frustrated trying to stop the industry’s expansion through the Alberta Energy Regulator, but found a new strategy of opposing the pipelines. They built wider coalitions, tapping into anger of Nebraska ranchers and drawing the attention of Hollywood celebrities such as director James Cameron. Opponents of TransCanada’s Keystone XL began protests at the White House in 2011, seeking arrest and attention. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama finally rejected the project in 2015. “Full credit to climate-change advocates, they kicked the snot out of Corporate Canada,” said Tim Powers, a Conservative political strategist. He said Canadian resource companies have been too focused on the regulatory process, while climate-change advocates “laid out a better, more compelling narrative” to win public opinion.  U.S. President Donald Trump resurrected Keystone XL in 2017. But both KXL and Trans Mountain remain in regulatory limbo after courts ruled in recent months that the U.S. and Canadian governments failed to properly do their jobs. The cases that overturned approvals for Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain led companies to question investment in Canada. The end result is a Canadian oil patch in retreat. “My main fear is that other nations will continue to produce at market price and Canada will be left behind,” said Duncan Au, chief executive of CWC Energy Services Corp. The well drilling company has cut about 70 employees, or nearly 10 percent, since the beginning of 2018. “This is a made-in-Canada crisis,” Au said.

2018-12-21,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Tom Hals WILMINGTON, Del, Dec 21 (Reuters) - As Venezuela collapses, one little-known U.S. investment fund is poised to win big from litigation against its socialist government: Tenor Capital Management. Since 2012, the New York firm has invested $76 million in Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp, largely to fund a lawsuit being waged against Venezuela for expropriating a gold mine. Now, Tenor stands to claim around $800 million of a $1.4 billion international arbitration award that Crystallex has been trying to collect since 2016. Tenor’s cash allowed Crystallex to force Venezuela to pay up by attempting a court-ordered seizure of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum Corp, the country’s overseas crown jewel. The case is part of wave of lawsuits bankrolled by firms specializing in so-called litigation finance, providing funding to plaintiffs in return for a slice of any financial winnings. While the practice dates back centuries, the business has boomed over the past decade, fueled by favorable court rulings and investors seeking juicy returns not correlated to stock markets. Between 2012 and 2016, the money committed to cases grew 40 percent a year, and is expected to top $2 billion annually by 2021, according to litigation financing firm Vannin Capital. These companies have backed a slew of big-dollar corporate lawsuits, including investor litigation in Volkswagen’s emissions scandal and a $213 million unjust enrichment case against U.S. billionaire Ira Rennert. But foreign governments are emerging as popular targets as well, putting taxpayers at risk for ever-larger claims. In addition to Tenor, firms working this niche include London Stock Exchange-listed Burford Capital, IMF Bentham Ltd of Australia and Therium Group Holdings Ltd of the UK. Litigation finance companies typically seek returns of three to 10 times their initial investment, industry players said. Now a market is developing for these firms to begin cashing out before a suit concludes by selling portions of their portfolios, or even slices of individual cases, to other investors. Burford, for example, scored a 736 percent return by selling for $107 million its entitlement in a case against Argentina over two expropriated airlines. Burford said it invested $12.8 million in the litigation. Critics fear this financing will embolden companies to bring weaker cases, and that developing countries will be more likely to be sued for adopting regulations to protect public health or the environment. Money from funders also discourages companies from sticking with long-term commitments in foreign markets, according to Lise Johnson, the head of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment at Columbia University in New York. “With third-party funding there is an incentive to sell a claim, extract cash and leave,” she said. Litigation finance companies say they are helping the underdogs: small companies wronged by governments. “It’s an easy story to tell that these are rapacious hedge funds trying to bring a struggling country to its knees,” said Zachary Krug, senior investment officer with funding firm Woodsford Litigation Funding in London. “That’s not what we do.” Eric Blinderman, who heads the North American business of funding firm Therium, said funders guard against weak cases by providing a neutral opinion on the strength of claims. He said his firm backs less than 5 percent of the cases brought to it, and requires a 70 percent chance of success. Otherwise, he said, “we’d lose a lot of cases we funded and Therium would be out of business shortly.” The Crystallex case started in 2011, when Caracas expropriated the company’s mining project at Las Cristinas, one of the world’s largest gold deposits located in southeastern Venezuela. Crystallex sought compensation through what is known as investor-state dispute settlement or ISDS, by bringing an arbitration case registered with the World Bank. Effectively bankrupted by the loss of its Venezuela project, Crystallex turned to Tenor. Tenor and Crystallex declined to comment. Court records show Tenor eventually provided $76 million to fund the litigation. In return, Crystallex agreed to give Tenor at least 70 percent of any payments it could collect from Venezuela, once Crystallex paid off Tenor’s loan and other creditors, the documents show. In 2016, the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, entered an award that has grown to $1.4 billion with interest. Crystallex said in November it had already received $500 million. Just weeks later the company accused Venezuela of breaching the agreement. It is not clear whether it will receive a full payout. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Companies increasingly are taking on foreign governments in the ICSID and other tribunals, including the International Chamber of Commerce and the United Nations. In the 2000s, there were typically around 40 cases per year, but since 2013 the number has jumped to an average of 69 cases annually, according to a United Nations report. The UN noted that figure could be even higher as some cases remain entirely confidential. Funding arrangements generally are not disclosed. The World Bank has proposed changing that, in part to shed light on potential conflicts of interest between arbitrators and funders. For now, it is unclear how many companies are funding such cases using litigation financing, also known third-party funding, but industry executives and lawyers say the practice is common. “In some respects, every claimant in ISDS cases has considered the use of funding,” said Krug of Woodsford Litigation Funding. Tenor, for example, is financing two other arbitration cases for Canadian companies with allegedly expropriated mining projects: a $4.4 billion claim by Gabriel Resources Ltd against Romania, and a $764 million claim by Eco Oro Minerals Corp against Colombia, according to company records. The firm also invested in a case against Uruguay over the demise of that nation’s former flagship airline, Pluna. While payouts are potentially eye-popping, the risks are considerable, industry veterans say. Three of every 10 cases is a complete loss, said Mick Smith, the co-founder of London-based litigation financing firm Calunius Capital, speaking at an industry conference in Europe this year. Even successful cases can tie up capital for years. A Calunius client, Rusoro Mining Ltd of Canada, settled with Venezuela in October on a $1.3 billion arbitration award, six years after Calunius first extended the money, according to a statement from Rusoro. Venezuela’s final payment on the settlement is not due for five years, Rusoro said. Meanwhile, backlash against the investor-state arbitration system is growing. South Africa, India, Indonesia and several Latin American nations have terminated investment treaties containing ISDS clauses with a number of countries. Some clients, too, have been left disgruntled by financing terms that leave them with pennies on the dollar from big settlements. Crystallex shareholders sought to reduce Tenor’s share of the Venezuela arbitration settlement, alleging in court documents that Tenor violated Canadian laws against excessive interest rates. A Canadian judge rejected their argument this year. He said there would have been no payout at all if not for Tenor’s cash. Reporting by Tom Hals in Wilmington, Delaware;

2018-12-21,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) [CNPC.UL] may stop its banking unit from conducting most of its Iranian-related financial services because of concerns over U.S. sanctions, two persons with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.  Bank of Kunlun, which has been the main official channel for money flows between China and Iran since before the last round of sanctions which started in 2012, is majority owned by CNPC’s listed financial arm CNPC Capital 000617.SZ. U.S. President Donald Trump in May ordered sanctions to be reimposed after withdrawing from a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that ended the previous round of restrictions. The U.S. left the accord because of concerns over the country’s ballistic missile program and its support for Syria’s embattled leader Bashar al-Assad and rebel fighters in Yemen. Iran was the world’s fourth-largest producer of liquid hydrocarbons, including crude oil, in 2017, according to data from BP Plc. China is the country’s biggest oil buyer. With U.S. authorities applying increasing pressure on global institutions to cut off trade with Iran, CNPC now views the bank’s Iran business as a liability that is hindering the company’s other regular financial services that cover insurance and leasing, the sources said.  Reuters reported in October that Kunlun, which started in a remote oil town in northwest China, stopped handling payments from Iran because of the sanctions. However, Kunlun still holds an Iranian central bank account into which Chinese national oil companies make about $18 billion worth of payments for annual oil imports. The sources said CNPC is lobbying Beijing to let one or more smaller Chinese commercial banks take over the business, or put it directly under a government agency. “CNPC is exploring the possibility of having some mid- or small-sized bank or banks that barely handle any dollar-denominated transactions take over (Iran transactions),” said one of the sources, who has direct knowledge of CNPC’s internal discussions over Kunlun’s Iran business. The bank may continue to handle only CNPC’s own investment in Iranian oil fields. The sources did not identify potential candidates or indicate if CNPC has initiated any discussions with them,  adding that it would not be easy to find local banks willing to take over the business.   A CNPC spokesman declined comment.  The secretary of CNPC Capital’s Board of Directors did not respond to an email seeking comment. The Bank of Kunlun did not respond to repeated requests for comment.  A second source, who is involved in discussions about China’s Iranian financial settlements, said the bank has become a talking point in trade negotiations between China and the United States.  CNPC Capital in late 2016 injected 5.848 billion yuan ($849 million) into Kunlun Bank and holds a 77.09 percent stake, CNPC Capital said in its 2017 annual report.   CNPC Capital said in the same report that its financial status could be adversely affected due to Kunlun’s Iranian ties.  “Subsidiary units such as Kunlun Bank... may fall under local laws and sanctions from other countries because of their operations in politically unstable regions... that will have unfavorable impact on the company’s financial performance,” it said.

2018-12-21,"* Shares across world extend precipitous sell-off * Further rise in U.S. borrowing costs also spooks markets * Oil prices fall to their lowest since 2017 3rd quarter By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - World stocks extended a steep sell-off on Friday as the threat of a U.S. government shutdown and further hikes in U.S. borrowing costs compounded investor anxieties over the trajectory of global economic growth. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off half a percent, indicating a lower open on Wall Street. Nasdaq futures were down 0.6 percent. European shares traded in negative territory, following in the footsteps of U.S. and Asian markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell over half a percent, continuing its slide towards lows not seen since the end of 2016. It had last pared some losses to trade 0.2 percent lower. Most European bourses and industry indexes were in the red after the S&P 500 fell overnight, heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of the financial crisis in late 2008, with a loss of 15 percent so far. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market. Oil prices, which slid just over 4 percent on Thursday, tumbled to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017 on Friday. The dollar, which had suffered its biggest one-day drop on the yen since November 2017 on Thursday, lost a further 0.1 percent against the yen. “China is cooling and the euro zone is slowing down, and some of the economic indicators from the U.S. have been a bit soft recently, but yet the Fed hiked rates and suggested that two more interest rate hikes were lined up for 2019,” said Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. He said speculation the U.S. economy could be headed for a recession has picked up, dampening global sentiment. “Fear about a U.S. government shutdown is playing into the mix too.” Eyes will be on U.S. inflation numbers due at 1330 GMT on Friday, which include the Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of core inflation. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.2 percent. The MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.2 percent on the day. It was set for its worst week since March. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. Chinese blue chips lost 1.4 percent, in part after the United States accused Beijing of orchestrating the hacking of government agencies and companies around the world. Sentiment had turned sour on Thursday when the U.S. Federal Reserve largely retained plans to increase interest rates despite mounting risks to growth. Markets were further spooked when U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless he received money for a border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. “Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.” Adding to the air of crisis was news U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump announced a withdrawal of all U.S. forces from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was on the cards. The brittle mood showed on Wall Street where the Dow ended Thursday with a loss of 1.99 percent. The S&P 500 dived 1.58 percent and the Nasdaq 1.63 percent. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. There was also a sense of capitulation in currency markets as the dollar dived 1.1 percent on the yen on Thursday to hit a three-month trough at 110.80. It was last changing hands at 111.16 having shattered several layers of chart support. The euro dipped 0.2 percent to $1.1420, having jumped to its highest in over six weeks at $1.1485. Against a basket of currencies the dollar regained lost ground, up 0.3 percent at 96.563 after suffering its largest single-session fall in two months. Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury were back up to 2.792 percent after hitting their lowest since early April at 2.748 percent on Thursday’s bid to safety. As recently as October, they had been at a seven-year top of 3.261 percent. The gap between two- and 10-year yields was back up to just 12.8 basis points, after flattening to 9 basis points overnight. The rally in longer-dated bonds has been fuelled by the huge slide in oil prices, which will pile downward pressure on inflation at a time when the global economy is already slowing. Both Brent and U.S. crude futures reached their lowest in more than a year overnight, but edged higher on Friday on talk that production cuts by OPEC might be larger than first thought. U.S. crude fell 1 percent to $45.44 a barrel, while Brent fell 2.3 percent to $53.10. Gold was flat at $1,259.46 an ounce.

2018-12-21,"ZAGREB, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Croatia has received few binding bids for the use of a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal planned for construction in the northern Adriatic, the state-owned company running the project said on Friday, casting doubt over its viability. “We received binding bids for terminal capacity amounting to 0.52 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas. We also have non-binding bids for an additional 0.3 bcm,” LNG Croatia said in a statement. The deadline to submit binding bids has been extended twice this year, a move LNG Croatia attributed to a request by potential bidders. “On the basis of received bids we will now test the economic viability of the project. Depending on the result, a decision on a potential model for this terminal will be made,” LNG Croatia added. The terminal on the northern Adriatic island of Krk is being partially financed by the European Union as part of EU efforts to diversify away from Russian energy imports. The targeted markets are countries in central and southeastern Europe. The value of the terminal is seen at 250 million euros ($285 million), with the EU providing just over 120 million euros. The rest would be financed on commercial terms. Last month, Croatia picked Golar Power Ltd to provide a floating vessel as a storage and regasification unit for the terminal. The vessel would give an annual capacity of 2.6 bcm of gas. A tentative start date for the terminal’s operations was set for January 2021. Croatia annually consumes gas volumes roughly equal to the terminal’s planned capacity. Domestic production, which has fallen in recent years, accounts for slightly more than 40 percent of the country’s requirements. Energy and Environment Minister Tomislav Coric recently said the government saw the Krk terminal as a strategic project that it might consider co-financing.

2018-12-21,"STONAVA, Czech Republic (Reuters) - A methane explosion killed 12 Poles and one Czech at an eastern Czech coal mine, the OKD mining company said on Friday, in the worst disaster of this kind in almost three decades. The state-run firm said that a methane blast more than 800 metres (875 yards) underground devastated areas of the CSM hard coal mine near the town of Karvina and the Polish border on Thursday afternoon. “We stopped underground work immediately, evacuated miners to the surface, and rescuers arrived who inspected the whole location thoroughly,” OKD spokesman Ivo Celechovsky said on Czech public television. OKD had previously said that 11 Poles and two Czechs died, but added later one of those thought to be Czech was in fact a Polish citizen. The accident is the worst mining disaster in the Czech Republic since 1990, when 30 miners died in a fire at a mine near Karvina in the same region, according to a list compiled by CTK news agency. Polish President Andrzej Duda declared Sunday a day of national mourning. OKD said that attempts to rescue eight miners originally reported as unaccounted for had had to be abandoned due to conditions in the shaft.          “Unfortunately, we have reached a point where it was impossible to move forward, because there was a fire raging and zero visibility,” OKD managing director Boleslav Kowalczyk said. The affected part of the mine was being sealed off to starve the fire of air and rescue teams would only be able to return to recover the victims at an unspecified date when conditions allowed, he said.  Kowalczyk said a network of methane sensors deployed in the mine had not detected anything unusual prior to the blast. The Polish victims were miners employed via the ALPEX company, OKD said. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and his Czech counterpart, Andrej Babis, visited the mine separately on Friday morning. Babis pointed out the risks that search teams facing. “They were 50 metres from those trapped there, but it was not possible (to advance) without threatening the lives of the emergency workers,” he said, adding that the company was looking into ways to compensate the victims’ families. Morawiecki spoke on a similar note. “Of course we will offer care to all of the families of the mining (accident) victims and for all those who survived,” he said, according to the PAP news agency.

The crew were unhurt in the incident, in which 51 wagons derailed, the state-run company said. “The export line has been closed to allow engineers and maintenance crew to re-rail the wagons and repair the line. The closure will impact all commodities that are transported on the line, like coal and chrome,” Transnet’s freight rail unit said in a statement.

Staff were evacuated from the site, Europe’s biggest methanol plant, after an explosion on Wednesday caused the fire. Equinor has yet to establish the cause of the explosion, which happened in one of the plant’s high-voltage rooms. An investigation is ongoing. “The plant will be shut down for a period of time,” said a company spokeswoman on Friday. She declined to say how long it would be closed for, saying time was needed for the investigation and repair work. The plant accounts for more than 25 percent of Europe’s production of methanol and has an annual capacity of around 900,000 tonnes, according to Equinor data. Tjeldbergodden takes natural gas from the offshore Heidrun field via the 250-km Haltenpipe pipeline. Production at the field was not affected by as the field’s gas was rerouted elsewhere.

2018-12-21,"LONDON (Reuters) - Centrica (CNA.L) owner of Britain’s largest energy supplier British Gas, said it is seeking a judicial review of the way regulator Ofgem has calculated part of its price cap, although it does not plan to delay the cap coming into effect. Ofgem is due to impose a price cap from Jan. 1 on the most commonly used default tariffs as the government seeks to limit household utility bills. The cap is expected to save UK households around 1 billion pounds a year. Centrica said it sought to challenge the way Ofgem treated suppliers’ ability to recover wholesale energy costs when calculating the cap. “Through this action Centrica has no intention to delay implementation of the cap, and does not expect the cap to be deferred in any way,” Centrica said in a statement published late on Thursday. Ofgem set the cap at 1,138 pounds a year for a typical use customer, 68 pounds lower than British Gas’s current standard variable tariff, and well below the average prices of all of the big six energy firms. “Ofgem carried out an extensive consultation process when setting the price cap and we believe that it offers consumers on poor value tariffs a fairer deal,” a spokesman for the regulator said via email. When it announced the plan in September, the regulator said it would review the cap to take into account any changes in wholesale prices and other costs, with the first review to take place in February, and any changes to take effect in April.

2018-12-21,"HARARE, Dec 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The giant solar panels mounted on the roof of Budiriro Polyclinic, a public health centre in Harare, bring a smile to the faces of patients, including 40-year-old Alen Tafirei. The steady power supply from the sun means vaccines can be refrigerated, for example, without disruption from frequent outages as in the past. “We are now no longer inconvenienced with excuses from nurses of the unavailability of electricity to cater for some services,” said Tafirei, who was suffering from a bad headache. “Solar helps us quite a lot.” So far, 405 healthcare facilities have been equipped with solar systems across Zimbabwe’s 10 provinces, in a partnership between the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Health and Child Care. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is funding the project. Amid a global trend to equip health facilities in developing countries with solar power systems, Zimbabwe is one of the first to benefit in southern Africa. Installations under the “solar-for-health” programme started in early 2017. Then, Zimbabwe had been experiencing power cuts of up to 18 hours a day for about two years as drought shrank water levels for hydro and electricity imports were unable to fill the gap. The outages were damaging for pharmaceuticals and laboratories that must be kept at certain temperatures, said Emmanuel Boadi, a UNDP programme manager in Zimbabwe. “It was creating problems, affecting the quality of health products,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Barbara Mashonga, a sister-in-charge at Budiriro Polyclinic, said the health centre’s electricity bill had dropped sharply since it started producing its own solar power. Mothers no longer have to give birth by candlelight, and vaccines do not need to be sent for storage elsewhere during power cuts, she added. UNDP’s Boadi said other facilities had also experienced similar benefits. In a letter to UNDP, the Regina Coeli Mission Hospital in Manicaland Province, for example, said its 10-kilowatt solar system had gone “a long way in supporting and enhancing quality service delivery”, as well as saving on electricity costs. The solar power supply serves as a back-up for the maternity ward, operating theatre, outpatients, women’s and child health departments, and the administration block, it added. Despite the benefits of the new clean energy systems, there have been teething troubles, which project officers have sought to address. Boadi said panel breakdowns and tampering could be detected using remote monitoring systems on rooftops. Engineer Clive Marimo, director for hospital planning and infrastructure at the Ministry of Health and Child Care, said theft of solar panels was a major issue, as was maintenance. To protect the equipment, metal fences have been provided, and the ministry has also employed security guards at some sites, he added. Other clinics have hired private guards or are working with local police. What to do with expired solar batteries, which last for eight to 10 years, is another challenge. UNDP is working with a sustainability consultant to find an environmentally friendly way to dispose of them, said Boadi. Before the new solar systems were installed, the vast majority of the clinics used grid power, when it was available. A few without a grid connection had solar systems provided by the Rural Electrification Agency, but those had broken down, forcing them to rely on candles and small petrol generators. The U.N. children’s agency, UNICEF, is also now planning to install solar systems in clinics and schools, said UNDP Zimbabwe Country Director Georges van Montfort. An evaluation of the project in 2019 will be used as a basis to seek funding from private-sector companies to expand the initiative, he added. Data from 2018 is not yet available but initial feedback from sites with solar power is “very positive”, he noted. For HIV/AIDS activists like 47-year-old Melvin Chinovava, a member of the Mudavanhu support group in Mwenezi district, Masvingo Province, the solar-for-health scheme has made it easier and quicker to get his antiretrovirals. “With access to solar power, nurses just turn on their computers to see which line of drugs I’m supposed to get as per my medical records,” he said. In the past, patients had to wait for nurses to go through piles of records manually to find out which treatment regime suited them, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The online data system enables patients who need to move for their work to continue treatment uninterrupted at a new healthcare centre, said UNDP spokesman Anesu Freddy. It was while helping the health ministry computerise its data on HIV/AIDS patients that UNDP understood the need for a constant electricity supply, which was a key driver of the solar-for-health initiative, Freddy added. Besides improving access to high-quality health services, the project also aims to reduce planet-warming carbon emissions from the health sector, said UNDP’s Boadi. The solar-for-health programme can help Zimbabwe meet its goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement to curb global warming, which include boosting renewable energy, officials said. Eventually, UNDP hopes solar systems can be installed to power schools, local government offices, farms and homes too. “Setting up solar mini-grids for clean energy in communities remains an idea which we will implement on getting more funding,” said Freddy.

Financial spreadbetters pointed to a modestly lower start in Europe, with London’s FTSE likely to drop 0.3 percent, Paris’ CAC down 0.2 percent and Frankfurt’s DAX off half a percent. The S&P 500 was heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of late 2008, with a loss of 15 percent so far. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market. Oil prices slid just over 4 percent overnight, bringing Brent’s losses since its October top to 37 percent. The dollar had suffered its biggest one-day drop on the yen since November 2017 as investors stampeded to safe havens. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said the downward spiral was becoming self fulfilling with selling begetting more selling. “Negative momentum is a key factor in driving investor behaviour. Fundamental justifications are following the action,” said McCarthy. “The selling will finish when it is done.” E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off another 0.1 percent, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.1 percent to close at its lowest since mid-September last year, after giving up 5.6 percent this week. Australian stocks slipped 0.7 percent, hovering just above a two-year trough hit earlier in the session. Chinese blue chips lost 1.4 percent, in part after the United States accused Beijing of orchestrating the hacking of government agencies and companies around the world. Sentiment had turned sour on Thursday when the U.S. Federal Reserve largely retained plans to increase interest rates despite mounting risks to growth. Markets were further spooked when U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless he got money for a border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. “Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.” Adding to the air of crisis was news U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump proposed withdrawing troops from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was on the cards. The brittle mood showed on Wall Street where the Dow ended Thursday with a loss of 1.99 percent. The S&P 500 dived 1.58 percent and the Nasdaq 1.63 percent. The mood change has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. There was also a sense of capitulation in currency markets as the dollar dived 1.1 percent on the yen on Thursday to hit a three-month trough at 110.80. It was last changing hands at 111.41 having shattered several layers of chart support. The euro stood at $1.1454, having jumped to its highest in over six weeks at $1.1485. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar stood at 96.399 after suffering its largest single-session fall in two months. The flight from risk was a boon to sovereign bonds, where U.S. 10-year yields struck their lowest since early April at 2.748 percent. As recently as October, they had been at a seven-year top of 3.261 percent. The gap between two- and 10-year yields shrank to just 9 basis points at one stage, the kind of flattening that has heralded recessions in the past. The rally in longer-dated bonds has been fuelled by the huge slide in oil prices, which will pile downward pressure on inflation at a time when the global economy is already slowing. Both Brent and U.S. crude futures reached their lowest in more than a year overnight, but edged higher on Friday on talk production cuts by OPEC might be larger than first thought. U.S. crude eked out a 34 cent bounce to $46.22 a barrel, while Brent rose 32 cents to $54.67. Gold was underpinned by the reversal in the dollar to hold at $1,259.00 an ounce.

2018-12-21,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - As Indonesia struggles with mountains of plastic waste going into landfill and polluting its rivers and oceans, business groups are pushing to overturn restrictions on importing plastic scrap into Southeast Asia’s biggest economy. Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, is estimated to be the world’s second-largest contributor of plastic pollutants in the oceans after China, according to a 2015 study published in Science journal. To tackle this, the government last year pledged up to $1 billion a year to reduce marine plastic debris by 70 percent by 2025. But emerging divisions in the government on the issue of waste pose a fresh challenge to these targets. Partly driving this rift is a push by the plastics industry to overturn a halt in scrap imports, which was introduced in June on concerns about a flood of waste from western countries arriving after China barred such imports. Industry minister Airlangga Hartarto last month sent a letter urging the environment ministry to lift its bar on imports because Indonesia does not currently produce enough suitable plastic waste to feed its recycling industry. In the letter, reviewed by Reuters, Hartarto argued Indonesia needs 600,000 tonnes of imported scrap a year, much bigger than its usual 110,000 tonnes. He said the country enjoyed about a $40 million trade surplus by exporting recycled plastics. “This is a potential industry that creates a lot of jobs,” said Taufiek Bawazier, director of downstream chemical industry at the industry ministry, cautioning that focusing only on the environmental risks could harm the industry. According to the 2015 Science journal report, almost half of the 3.2 million tonnes of plastic waste Indonesia produces in a year ends up in the sea. The issue was graphically highlighted in November when a sperm whale was found dead with 6 kg of plastic waste in its stomach on an Indonesian beach. But the government’s waste reduction targets are complicated by a lack of recycling culture or awareness of environmental damage in the developing country of 260 million people. Poor waste management means plastic trash that goes to landfills is too dirty to feed Indonesia’s recycling industry, Bawazier said, adding that business would take more than the annual 1.1 million tonnes of local scrap if it was available. Plastics lobby groups say downstream to upstream plastic industries employ 130,000 directly, while millions make a livelihood by scavenging for waste like plastic bottles for a small bit of cash.  “We must not hate plastic,” said Christine Halim, chairwoman of Indonesia’s recycling association, noting that buying foreign scrap was much cheaper than making products with virgin plastic and, as long as the environment was protected, should be seen as a business opportunity. Safri Burhanuddin, deputy Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs, which overseas the environment ministry, said there were no plans to reopen scrap imports. Nonetheless, the industry ministry argues there is no legal basis to stop imports, while the plastic industry has successfully lobbied policymakers before.  A 2016 plan to slap excise on all plastic packaging was watered down to only apply to plastic bags and even this has not been implemented yet.  The industry is currently also fighting a ban on plastic bags in supermarkets by some city governments. The Indonesia Olefin, Aromatic and Plastic Industry Association was cited in media saying the move had led to an oversupply of bags. Burhanuddin of the maritime affairs ministry, however, applauded local action on waste management, pledging to award the best regional performers and shame laggards on social media. Tiza Mafira, director of the Indonesia Plastic Bags Diet Movement, a group pushing to cut use of plastic, said it was a “ridiculous idea” to import waste. “It is proven that we cannot handle plastic trash. It will end up in the landfill,” she said.

2018-12-21,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China, the world’s top oil importer, is set to start 2019 buying little or no crude from the United States despite a three-month truce in a trade scrap between the two nations, with relatively high freight costs and political uncertainty choking demand. That muted appetite means the United States, which became the world’s top oil producer this year as its shale output hit record levels, will continue to hold only a sliver of China’s market even as a wave of new refining capacity starts up there. It also suggests that China is unlikely to use crude purchases to help plug a widening trade gap with the United States, which remains a core source of tensions between the world’s top two economies.     The U.S. trade deficit with Beijing hit a record $43 billion in October as its firms stockpiled inventory from China to avoid higher tariffs that may kick in next year.   (GRAPHIC: U.S. finishes 2018 as world's top crude oil producer as shale output scales new highs - tmsnrt.rs/2R69s7G)  “Chinese companies have little incentive to buy U.S. crude due to the wide availability of crude supplies today from Iran and Russia,” said Seng Yick Tee, an analyst at Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy. “Even though the trade tension between China and the U.S. had been defused recently, the executives from the national oil companies hesitate to procure U.S. crude unless they are told to do so.”  (GRAPHIC: U.S.-China trade gap widens to all-time high amid trade war - tmsnrt.rs/2R5DNmT)  China stopped U.S. oil imports in October and November after the trade war intensified. It resumed some imports in December, but purchased just 1 million barrels, a minute portion of the more than 300 million barrels of total imports, Refinitiv data showed.     (GRAPHIC: Tankers carrying U.S. crude oil to China - tmsnrt.rs/2Qh0BjN)  Chinese refineries that used to purchase U.S. oil regularly said they had not resumed buying due to uncertainty over the outlook for trade relations between Washington and Beijing, as well as rising freight costs and poor profit-margins for refining in the region. Costs for shipping U.S. crude to Asia on a supertanker are triple those for Middle eastern oil, data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.  (GRAPHIC: China's appetite for U.S. crude muted by high freight costs, competitive Mid East supplies - tmsnrt.rs/2GyFnJI)  A senior official with a state oil refinery said his plant had stopped buying U.S. oil from October and had not booked any cargoes for delivery in the first quarter. “Because of the great policy uncertainty earlier on, plants have actually readjusted back to using alternatives to U.S. oil ... they just widened our supply options,” he said. He added that his plant had shifted to replacements such as North Sea Forties crude, Australian condensate and oil from Russia. “Maybe teapots will take some cargoes, but the volume will be very limited,” said a second Chinese oil executive, referring to independent refiners. The sources declined to be named because of company policy.  A sharp souring in Asian benchmark refining margins has also curbed overall demand for crude in recent months, sources said.  (GRAPHIC: Singapore refining margins slump 50 pct in 3 ths amid demand growth concerns - tmsnrt.rs/2RhnHXv)  Despite the impasse on U.S. crude purchases, China’s crude imports could top a record 45 million tonnes (10.6 million barrels per day) in December from all regions, said Refinitiv senior oil analyst Mark Tay.  Russia is set to remain the biggest supplier at 7 million tonnes in December, with Saudi Arabia second at 5.7-6.7 million tonnes, he said. China’s Iranian oil imports are set to rebound in December after two state-owned refiners began using the nation’s waiver from U.S. sanctions on Tehran.

2018-12-21,"WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - As Venezuela collapses, one little-known U.S. investment fund is poised to win big from litigation against its socialist government: Tenor Capital Management.  Since 2012, the New York firm has invested $76 million in Canadian mining firm Crystallex International Corp, largely to fund a lawsuit being waged against Venezuela for expropriating a gold mine.  Now, Tenor stands to claim around $800 million of a $1.4 billion international arbitration award that Crystallex has been trying to collect since 2016.  Tenor’s cash allowed Crystallex to force Venezuela to pay up by attempting a court-ordered seizure of Houston-based Citgo Petroleum Corp, the country’s overseas crown jewel.   The case is part of wave of lawsuits bankrolled by firms specializing in so-called litigation finance, providing funding to plaintiffs in return for a slice of any financial winnings. While the practice dates back centuries, the business has boomed over the past decade, fueled by favorable court rulings and investors seeking juicy returns not correlated to stock markets. Between 2012 and 2016, the money committed to cases grew 40 percent a year, and is expected to top $2 billion annually by 2021, according to litigation financing firm Vannin Capital. These companies have backed a slew of big-dollar corporate lawsuits, including investor litigation in Volkswagen’s emissions scandal and a $213 million unjust enrichment case against U.S. billionaire Ira Rennert. But foreign governments are emerging as popular targets as well, putting taxpayers at risk for ever-larger claims. In addition to Tenor, firms working this niche include London Stock Exchange-listed Burford Capital, IMF Bentham Ltd of Australia and Therium Group Holdings Ltd of the UK. Litigation finance companies typically seek returns of three to 10 times their initial investment, industry players said. Now a market is developing for these firms to begin cashing out before a suit concludes by selling portions of their portfolios, or even slices of individual cases, to other investors. Burford, for example, scored a 736 percent return by selling for $107 million its entitlement in a case against Argentina over two expropriated airlines. Burford said it invested $12.8 million in the litigation. Critics fear this financing will embolden companies to bring weaker cases, and that developing countries will be more likely to be sued for adopting regulations to protect public health or the environment. Money from funders also discourages companies from sticking with long-term commitments in foreign markets, according to Lise Johnson, the head of the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment at Columbia University in New York. “With third-party funding there is an incentive to sell a claim, extract cash and leave,” she said. Litigation finance companies say they are helping the underdogs: small companies wronged by governments.  “It’s an easy story to tell that these are rapacious hedge funds trying to bring a struggling country to its knees,” said Zachary Krug, senior investment officer with funding firm Woodsford Litigation Funding in London. “That’s not what we do.” Eric Blinderman, who heads the North American business of funding firm Therium, said funders guard against weak cases by providing a neutral opinion on the strength of claims. He said his firm backs less than 5 percent of the cases brought to it, and requires a 70 percent chance of success. Otherwise, he said, “we’d lose a lot of cases we funded and Therium would be out of business shortly.”     The Crystallex case started in 2011, when Caracas expropriated the company’s mining project at Las Cristinas, one of the world’s largest gold deposits located in southeastern Venezuela. Crystallex sought compensation through what is known as investor-state dispute settlement or ISDS, by bringing an arbitration case registered with the World Bank. Effectively bankrupted by the loss of its Venezuela project, Crystallex turned to Tenor. Tenor and Crystallex declined to comment. Court records show Tenor eventually provided $76 million to fund the litigation. In return, Crystallex agreed to give Tenor at least 70 percent of any payments it could collect from Venezuela, once Crystallex paid off Tenor’s loan and other creditors, the documents show. In 2016, the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or ICSID, entered an award that has grown to $1.4 billion with interest. Crystallex said in November it had already received $500 million. Just weeks later the company accused Venezuela of breaching the agreement. It is not clear whether it will receive a full payout. Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Companies increasingly are taking on foreign governments in the ICSID and other tribunals, including the International Chamber of Commerce and the United Nations. In the 2000s, there were typically around 40 cases per year, but since 2013 the number has jumped to an average of 69 cases annually, according to a United Nations report. The UN noted that figure could be even higher as some cases remain entirely confidential. Funding arrangements generally are not disclosed. The World Bank has proposed changing that, in part to shed light on potential conflicts of interest between arbitrators and funders. For now, it is unclear how many companies are funding such cases using litigation financing, also known third-party funding, but industry executives and lawyers say the practice is common. “In some respects, every claimant in ISDS cases has considered the use of funding,” said Krug of Woodsford Litigation Funding. Tenor, for example, is financing two other arbitration cases for Canadian companies with allegedly expropriated mining projects: a $4.4 billion claim by Gabriel Resources Ltd against Romania, and a $764 million claim by Eco Oro Minerals Corp against Colombia, according to company records. The firm also invested in a case against Uruguay over the demise of that nation’s former flagship airline, Pluna. While payouts are potentially eye-popping, the risks are considerable, industry veterans say.  Three of every 10 cases is a complete loss, said Mick Smith, the co-founder of London-based litigation financing firm Calunius Capital, speaking at an industry conference in Europe this year. Even successful cases can tie up capital for years.  A Calunius client, Rusoro Mining Ltd of Canada, settled with Venezuela in October on a $1.3 billion arbitration award, six years after Calunius first extended the money, according to a statement from Rusoro. Venezuela’s final payment on the settlement is not due for five years, Rusoro said. Meanwhile, backlash against the investor-state arbitration system is growing. South Africa, India, Indonesia and several Latin American nations have terminated investment treaties containing ISDS clauses with a number of countries. Some clients, too, have been left disgruntled by financing terms that leave them with pennies on the dollar from big settlements. Crystallex shareholders sought to reduce Tenor’s share of the Venezuela arbitration settlement, alleging in court documents that Tenor violated Canadian laws against excessive interest rates.  A Canadian judge rejected their argument this year. He said there would have been no payout at all if not for Tenor’s cash.

The S&P 500 was heading for its worst quarter since the dark days of late 2008, with a loss of 15 percent so far. The Nasdaq has shed 19.5 percent from its August peak, just shy of confirming a bear market. Oil prices slid just over 4 percent overnight, bringing Brent’s losses since its October top to 37 percent. The dollar had suffered its biggest one-day drop on the yen since November 2017 as investors stampeded to safe havens. Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets, said the downward spiral was becoming self fulfilling with selling begetting more selling. “Negative momentum is a key factor in driving investor behaviour. Fundamental justifications are following the action,” said McCarthy. “The selling will finish when it is done.” E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were off another 0.25 percent on Friday, while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.6 percent. Japan’s Nikkei fell 1.8 percent, and was down more than 6 percent for the week so far, while Australian stocks slipped 1 percent to a two-year trough. Chinese blue chips lost 1.2 percent, in part after the United States accused Beijing of orchestrating the hacking of government agencies and companies around the world. Sentiment had turned sour on Thursday when the U.S. Federal Reserve largely retained plans to increase interest rates despite mounting risks to growth. Markets were further spooked when U.S. President Donald Trump refused to sign legislation to fund the U.S. government unless he got money for a border wall, thus risking a partial federal shutdown on Saturday. “Political brinkmanship in Washington is further heightening market uncertainty,” said Westpac economist Elliot Clarke. “Friday will be a tense day in Washington, and for financial markets, as a last-minute compromise is sought.” Adding to the air of crisis was news U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had resigned after Trump proposed withdrawing troops from Syria and sources said a military pullback from Afghanistan was on the cards. The brittle mood showed on Wall Street where the Dow ended Thursday with a loss of 1.99 percent. The S&P 500 dived 1.58 percent and the Nasdaq 1.63 percent. The sea change in sentiment has triggered a rush out of crowded trades, including massive long positions in U.S. equities and the dollar and short positions in Treasuries. Lipper data on Thursday showed investors pulled nearly $34.6 billion out of stock funds in the latest week and were heading for the biggest month of net withdrawals on record. There was also a sense of capitulation in currency markets as the dollar dived 1.1 percent on the yen on Thursday to hit a three-month trough at 110.80. It was last changing hands at 111.19 having shattered several layers of chart support. The euro stood at $1.1455, having jumped to its highest in over six weeks at $1.1485. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar sagged to 96.389 after suffering its largest single-session fall in two months. The Swedish crown was a big gainer after its central bank on Thursday raised interest rates for the first time in more than seven years.

2018-12-21,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed on Friday after tumbling 5 percent in the last session, with OPEC production cuts that start next month seen being deeper then previously expected. Benchmark Brent crude futures were up 1.51 percent at $55.17 per barrel at 0112 GMT, recovering from losses of $2.89 per barrel the session before. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 1.53 percent, or 70 cents, to $46.58 per barrel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plans to release a table detailing output cut quotas for its members and allies such as Russia in an effort to shore up the price of crude, OPEC’s secretary-general said in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. Mohammad Barkindo said to reach the proposed cut of 1.2 million barrels per day, the effective reduction for member countries was 3.02 percent. That is higher than the initially discussed 2.5 percent as OPEC seeks to accommodate Iran, Libya and Venezuela, which are exempt from any requirement to cut. “The current oil prices will force OPEC to increase compliance with the production cut deals, supporting Brent prices,” said Wang Xiao, head of crude research at Guotai Junan futures. “The temporary recovery in prices has been driven by short- sellers buying back.” ANZ Research said in note that investors had been trading on macroeconomic factors and technical analysis rather than market fundamentals, keeping prices under pressure. U.S. crude prices broke through a support level at $45.94 per barrel during the last session and rebounded after sinking to $45.67, their lowest since late August 2017. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at OANDA said in note that market volatility was “getting exaggerated by immensely thin liquidity conditions, risk sentiment, and holiday market participation”. Oil Prices are down more than 30 percent from their peak in October.
