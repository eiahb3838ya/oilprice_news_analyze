2019-02-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal judge allowed most claims against Daimler AG to move forward in a 2016 lawsuit by vehicle owners that claims the German automaker’s Mercedes diesel vehicles used illegal software to emit excess emissions. In a ruling late on Friday, Judge Jose Linares of U.S. District Court in New Jersey also said that claims against auto supplier Robert Bosch GmbH can proceed, rejecting a bid by the German companies to throw out the lawsuits. There has been growing scrutiny of diesel vehicles in the United States since Volkswagen AG admitted in September 2015 to installing secret software on 580,000 U.S. vehicles that allowed them to emit excess emissions. Steve Berman, one of the lawyers representing Mercedes U.S. diesel owners, said “like Volkswagen, Mercedes tried to scam consumers by green-washing its line of diesel cars. With the help of some crafty marketing, and Bosch’s defeat device, the duo set out to rake in profits from unknowing purchasers.” Daimler spokeswoman Andrea Berg said Monday, “These claims are without merit, and we are pleased that the court recognized the deficiencies in some of plaintiffs’ claims. We intend to continue vigorously defending against the remaining claims.” Bosch, which makes software for Daimler, VW and other automakers’ diesel emissions systems, declined to comment Monday. The Justice Department, Environmental Protection Agency, California Air Resources Board and German prosecutors in Stuttgart are investigating Daimler for alleged excess emissions in Mercedes-Benz diesel vehicles. Daimler has acknowledged it faces investigations in Germany and the United States. In October, Daimler said operating profit would fall by more than 10 percent, blaming “government proceedings and measures in various regions” related to diesel emissions issues. In 2017, Daimler abandoned plans to seek U.S. approval to sell new Mercedes-Benz U.S. light-duty diesel models. VW pleaded guilty in the emissions scandal and agreed to spend more than $25 billion in the United States to address claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV last month agreed to a settlement worth about $800 million to resolve claims from the  Justice Department and California that it used illegal software that produced false results on diesel-emissions tests, but still faces an ongoing criminal probe. Last month, Bosch agreed to pay nearly $131 million to settle claims from Fiat Chrysler diesel owners and resolve all investigations by 47 U.S. state attorneys general into its involvement with diesel vehicles, including into the Volkswagen emissions cheating.

2019-02-04,"Feb 4 (Reuters) - The most extreme period of volatility in U.S. natural gas futures in nearly 10 years is set to a close as the winter weather turns warmer, but not before the wild price swings caused one trading firm to collapse. While some firms took losses, the volatility likely helped others make money — something that may be harder to do now that prices are trading in a narrower range, analysts said. “There certainly were more winners and losers in November and December than in recent years when the market was fairly quiet,” said Daniel Myers, market analyst at Gelber & Associates in Houston, noting there is more interest in a market that provides the opportunity to take advantage of big price swings. For an interactive graphic on extreme volatility in U.S. natural gas futures, see: tmsnrt.rs/2HEHGM0 The combination of colder forecasts, concerns about low levels of gas in storage and the falloff of hedge fund bets on gas kicked off the longest streak of extreme volatility since 2009. Gas futures posted their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Nov. 14, only to follow with their largest one-day loss in 15 years the next day. Those types of swings repeated for several weeks into late January. Since November, the difference between the highest trading level and the lowest for front-month gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange averaged 8.2 percent of the previous closing price, the highest for an extended period since 2009, when the average reached 8.7 percent. That compares with extremely low intraday price movements from early February to early November when the spread averaged just 2.4 percent, the lowest since early 1992. Those massive price swings caused commodities trading advisor OptionSellers of Tampa, Florida, to suffer huge losses and collapse. In addition, hedge funds in general were forced to shift positions as many were caught betting on a sleepy, lackluster pricing environment. Investors are once again betting on low volatility, but with winter more than half over, that bet is a safer one, as demand for heating will decline. “I think volatility will decline in coming weeks as the weather gets warmer,” said Steve Crossin, chief executive of Long & Crossin Investments LLC, a private investment firm in Denver, noting the sharp increase in volatility since November was “caused by the market’s assessment of winter weather and its effect on heating demand.” Over the past four trading sessions, gas prices slipped to their lowest level in nine months even as demand for the fuel spiked to a record high during a polar vortex that froze the U.S. Midwest and Northeast and caused several utilities to call on customers to use less fuel. Traders said prices declined because the market has moved past the brief, brutal freeze as it focused on warmer weather expected to last through late February. Over the past four sessions, including Monday, the high-low spread averaged just 3.4 percent. “Volatility is going to be substantially reduced as we exit the winter but I don’t think we will see the incredibly depressed volatility we saw for much of 2018,” said Kyle Cooper, consultant at ION Energy in Houston.

2019-02-04,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he would nominate David Bernhardt, a former energy lobbyist, to be secretary of the interior, the department that oversees U.S. public lands. Bernhardt, currently the acting secretary at the Interior Department, is widely expected to continue pushing the Trump administration’s plan to boost domestic fossil fuels production by opening more U.S. public lands to drilling and mining. “David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived, and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed,” Trump said on Twitter.  Bernhardt would replace Ryan Zinke, who was under a cloud of ethics investigations and announced his resignation in December.  The Interior Department, which employs more than 70,000 people and oversees more than 20 percent of the U.S. land surface, has been central to Trump’s “energy dominance” policy of boosting energy production. As Zinke’s deputy, Bernhardt has played a role in efforts  to open Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, ease Obama-era protections on a bird called the greater sage grouse to boost drilling and mining across the West, and open federal lands to leases for coal mining. Ann Navaro, a former Department of Interior official who served in the Obama and Trump administrations and worked closely with Bernhardt, said he is a rare “lawyer’s lawyer” who prepares thoroughly for meetings, often being the only one in a room to have read full environmental assessments of projects and plans.  Bernhardt, who prefers conservative suits to Zinke’s cowboy hats and boots, also worked a series of jobs at the Interior Department under former President George W. Bush from 2001 to early 2009, including as the department’s solicitor.  After working under Bush, Bernhardt became a lawyer and lobbyist at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck for water and oil interests. He represented Noble Energy Inc , Rosemont Copper Co, Sempra Energy , and California’s Westlands Water District, among others.  Bernhardt has long been an advocate of reforming the Endangered Species Act, the law that protects plants and animals at risk from resource extraction and development. If he is approved by the Senate, Bernhardt is expected to continue that work. Critics say Bernhardt’s previous work as a lobbyist could risk conflicts of interest, unless he recuses himself from certain issues, because he worked for companies that could benefit by opening up lands to development. About 150 environmental groups in 2017, including the business-friendly Natural Resources Defense Council, urged senators to oppose Bernhardt in the confirmation vote for his deputy position, saying his previous lobbyist work raised questions about his ability to act in the public interest. Despite their letter calling him a “walking conflict of interest”, the Senate confirmed Bernhardt 53-43, on a mostly party-line vote, and with strong support from Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski and other lawmakers who have large areas of U.S. lands in their states.  If Bernhardt ascends to secretary, it would mirror the change of guard at the Environmental Protection Agency where last July Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, replaced Scott Pruitt, who stepped down after a series of probes into his conduct. Wheeler is a staunch proponent of Trump’s energy dominance agenda to produce oil, gas and coal for both domestic use and export.

No other details were immediately available. But Reuters reported on Feb. 1 that Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil were expected to announce plans this week to proceed with a $10 billion project expanding the Golden Pass export facility in Texas. ConocoPhillips, the third partner in the existing LNG export terminal, plans to sell its 12.4 percent stake and does not plan to participate in the expansion, Reuters reported, citing three people familiar with the transaction. Golden Pass LNG started as a receiving and regasification facility in Sabine Pass, Texas able to handle up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas imports per day. But as U.S. gas production has soared, the demand for export capacity has risen. The facility expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the firm seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas footprint.

2019-02-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stocks hit a two-month high on Monday, as gains for technology and industrial shares fueled a rise on Wall Street, while the U.S. dollar gained for a third straight session against a basket of currencies and U.S. Treasury yields rose. Oil prices pulled back after reaching their highest levels in roughly two months. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.33 percent, reaching a fresh two-month high. Investors were parsing the significance for financial markets from Friday’s strong U.S. jobs report, which came on the heels of the Federal Reserve saying it would be patient on future rate hikes amid a cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. “Investors are realizing that the Fed is at least going to be friendly here in the near term,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. “Some of these things that were weighing as negatives...  namely a tighter Fed, lack of progress on the tariffs, those things are starting to improve or have improved, and as a result there are more reasons to be investing in stocks,” Hellwig said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 175.48 points, or 0.7 percent, to 25,239.37, the S&P 500 gained 18.34 points, or 0.68 percent, to 2,724.87 and the Nasdaq Composite added 83.67 points, or 1.15 percent, to 7,347.54. Technology and industrials were the biggest risers among the S&P 500 sectors, as investors braced for another big week of fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.06 percent as the heavyweight banking sector fell following poor results from Julius Baer. The U.S. dollar strengthened across the board, as investors took heart from Friday’s strong payrolls number. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies. rose 0.27 percent, with the euro down 0.18 percent to $1.1433. Improved risk appetite helped lift the dollar to a five-week high against the safe-haven yen. U.S. Treasury prices fell in generally thin volume, pressured by upcoming debt supply, as well as indications that inflation expectations are rising. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 10/32 in price to yield 2.7253 percent, from 2.691 percent late on Friday. Oil prices fell after disappointing U.S. factory data sparked fresh concerns about a slowdown in the global economy.

2019-02-04,"HOUSTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Activist investor Fir Tree Partners on Monday called on oil producer Halcon Resources Corp to appoint two independent directors to its board, threatening a proxy fight at the next shareholder meeting if it fails to do so or fails to put itself up for sale. Fir Tree, in a letter to the Halcon board of directors, accused Halcon of “excessive” spending, pointing to executive compensation that outpaced its peers and private plane use by Chief Executive Officer Floyd Wilson, which it said was on track in the third quarter to top $1 million in 2018. Halcon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A representative for Fir Tree Partners did not respond to a request for comment. Halcon was hard hit by the 2014 crash in oil prices and emerged from bankruptcy restructuring in 2016. While U.S. crude prices rebounded in the first half of 2018, the producer posted an $81.8 million loss in its third quarter and a $100.7 million loss for the nine-month period. Fir Tree, which owns about 7.2 percent of Halcon, in October called for a sale of the company. On Monday, it said that if Halcon does not cut expenses and appoint new board members, Fir Tree may run a proxy contest at the next annual general meeting to replace its entire board. Since October, Halcon shares have fallen by 56 percent. They were trading at around $1.75 per share on Monday. Although Halcon’s assets are in the Permian Basin, the largest and fastest growing oilfield in the United States, Wall Street values its land at less than $5,000 an acre, compared with peers whose land is valued above $20,000 an acre, Fir Tree said in its letter. “The unfortunate reality for Halcon is that it is an over-levered and sub-scale operator that cannot organically grow out of its problems in the current (or most any) commodity environment,” Fir Tree said. Fir Tree also took issue with CEO Wilson’s compensation package, which it said was valued at $24 million when the company emerged from bankruptcy in 2016 and roughly $7 million in 2017, a year in which its stock fell by more than 50 percent.

2019-02-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday after disappointing U.S. factory data sparked fresh concerns about a slowdown in the global economy, but losses were limited as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela pointed to tighter supply. Brent crude futures dropped 24 cents, or 0.38 percent, to settle at $62.51 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 70 cents, or 1.27 percent, to settle at $54.56 a barrel. Weighing on oil markets, U.S. government data showed new orders for U.S.-made goods unexpectedly fell in November, with sharp declines in demand for machinery and electrical equipment. “In a market that’s looking for direction, there’s concern that any slowdown in the manufacturing sector would slow down demand. Because the number was a little disappointing, it played into the slowing demand scenario,” said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Prices also dipped after data showed U.S. crude inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for U.S. crude futures, rose by more than 943,000 barrels in the week to Feb. 1, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape. Crude futures earlier posted around two-month highs. Brent reached $63.63 a barrel, the highest since Dec. 7, while WTI climbed to $55.75 a barrel, the strongest since Nov. 21. Prices have been buoyed by a new round of supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies that began in January. OPEC supply fell last month by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey last week found. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October. The impact of OPEC+’s supply curbs has been boosted by U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The sanctions will limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to those imposed on Iran last year, some analysts said after examining details announced by the U.S. government. The European Union is considering imposing more sanctions on the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro but has not discussed an oil embargo, Malta’s foreign minister said on Monday. However, while OPEC is cutting output, the United States has expanded supply, with production most recently totaling 11.9 million bpd.  GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production & drilling levels - tmsnrt.rs/2Tm4u4I Market participants are also watching for developments surrounding the U.S.-China trade war, which has dragged on world markets as investors worry that the dispute could contribute to a potential global economic slowdown. “The market seems to be turning on renewed worries that there doesn’t seem to be a lot of progress on the U.S.-China trade talks,” said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.

Guaido, who last month invoked a constitutional provision to declare himself president and has won the support of most the Western hemisphere, has repeatedly accused Maduro’s government of stealing public funds. Venezuelan traders say Maduro’s government has been using the Bandes subsidiary in Uruguay to get around debilitating U.S. sanctions that the administration of President Donald Trump has imposed in its bid to help the opposition oust Maduro. “We call on Uruguay in this case to not allow them to steal,” Guaido said in a televised speech in front of the National Assembly, which he heads. Uruguay, like Mexico, has chosen to stay neutral on Venezuela’s political crisis and instead called for dialogue.

2019-02-04,"(Adds more from statement, EU’s two-track approach) BRUSSELS, Feb 4 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Monday it was gravely concerned by Iran’s ballistic missile launches and tests and called on Tehran to stop activity that deepened mistrust and destabilised the region. Iran has expanded its missile programme, particularly its ballistic missiles, in defiance of opposition from the United States and expressions of concern by European countries. Tehran says the programme is purely defensive. “The Council is ... gravely concerned by Iran’s ballistic missile activity and calls upon Iran to refrain from these activities,” the EU said in a rare joint statement on Iran. “Iran continues to undertake efforts to increase the range and precision of its missiles, together with increasing the number of tests and operational launches ... These activities deepen mistrust and contribute to regional instability.” Tehran should refrain in particular from any work on missiles designed to be capable of delivering a nuclear weapon, the EU said. A U.N. Security Council resolution that enshrined Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers called upon Tehran to refrain for up to eight years from work on ballistic missiles designed to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran says its missile tests are not in violation of the resolution and denies its missiles are capable of carrying nuclear warheads. In the 12-point statement, the European Union said it was committed to the landmark 2015 accord and welcomed Iran’s implementation of its nuclear-related commitments. However, the bloc also expressed concern at Iran’s role in growing Middle East tensions, including support for groups in Lebanon and Syria and Iran’s own forces in Syria. In addition, it called on all parties involved in Yemen, including Iran, to work towards ending the conflict there. The bloc was also critical of Iran’s human rights record, highlighting its use of the death penalty and urging it to respect equal rights for women and girls and minorities. The European Union has adopted a so-called two track approach aims to Iran. It aims to uphold the nuclear accord with Iran that U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of last May, while warning the Islamic Republic that the EU can no longer tolerate what it says are Iranian assassination plots on its soil and missile tests. Britain, France and Germany last week launched a system to facilitate non-dollar trade with Iran and avoid U.S. sanctions. although Iran’s top judge said the systems conditions were unacceptable.

2019-02-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain promised Nissan up to £80 million of support and offered Brexit-related assurances to help secure a major investment from the Japanese carmaker in 2016, according to a well-guarded letter released on Monday. Nissan said in October 2016 that it would build the next generation of its Qashqai and X-Trail sport utility vehicles at its northern English Sunderland plant, but on Sunday cancelled plans to build the X-Trail as diesel sales slide in Europe.  The original decision, which would have created 740 new jobs, was hailed by Prime Minister Theresa May, who had newly taken office at the time, as a major boost to Britain as it began the process of extricating itself from the European Union.  But the letter, which the government refused to publish on multiple occasions, had prompted accusations that ministers were doing secretive deals with firms, prompting some Brexiteers to question whether pledges made might keep Britain tied to EU mechanisms such as the customs union.  “The government fully recognises the significance of the EU market to your presence in Sunderland,” wrote business minister Greg Clark to then Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn. “It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK’s future relationship with the EU.” “We will set our ambitions high and vigorously pursue continued access to the European market as an objective in future negotiations.”  The up to 80 million pounds of support on skills, research and development and innovation was contingent on the new Qashqai and X-Trail models being built in Britain, Clark wrote.  Clark told parliament on Monday that as the terms of Nissan’s investment had changed, they would need to re-apply for the funding. He said that of 61 million pounds’ worth of grants which had already been approved, only 2.6 million pounds had so far been paid to Nissan. Nissan, which builds 30 percent of Britain’s 1.52 million cars at its factory, the country’s biggest car plant, exports the vast majority of the vehicles to EU countries and, like the rest of the industry, is worried about tariffs if there is a no-deal Brexit.  “The letter, written in October 2016, shows Nissan and the UK Government’s continued desire to support investment in the UK and maintain Sunderland as one of Nissan’s manufacturing hubs in Europe,” the company said on Monday.  The firm will still build its new Juke and Qashqai models at the factory which opened in 1986 after then prime minister Margaret Thatcher successfully encouraged Japanese companies to pick the country as a gateway into Europe.

2019-02-04,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - German utility RWE could preserve a forest in the west of the country after a deal to phase-out coal mining and generation, although the cost of doing so would run into tens of millions of euros, its chief executive said on Monday. Germany’s coal commission said on Jan. 26 that preserving the Hambach forest was “desirable”, in a blow to one of RWE’s main sources of lignite, where mining operations have been halted since a court order in October. Rolf Martin Schmitz told an industry conference in Essen that once it was clear what the “roadmap” was then RWE would have to draw up a new plan for brown coal (lignite) and would decide whether it was feasible not to fell trees. While it would be technically possible, but would cost tens of millions of euros given the space needed for mining waste, said Schmitz, adding: “One would have to ask oneself how much is a tree worth.” RWE is Germany’s largest operator of coal-fired power plants and employs about 10,000 staff in the Rheinische coal mining area, which also includes power plants. Plans to expand the mine by clearing the forest, which has become a symbol of anti-coal industry protest, have been delayed and Schmitz has warned that 4,600 jobs could be lost if it cannot continue mining activities in Hambach.

2019-02-04,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi President Barham Salih said on Monday that President Donald Trump did not ask Iraq’s permission for U.S. troops stationed there to “watch Iran.” Speaking at a forum in Baghdad, Salih was responding to a question about Trump’s comments to CBS about how he would ask troops stationed in Iraq to “watch” Iran. U.S. troops in Iraq are there as part of an agreement between the two countries with a specific mission of combating terrorism, Salih said, and that they should stick to that. Trump said it was important to keep a U.S. military presence in Iraq so that Washington can keep a close eye on Iran “because Iran is a real problem,” according to a CBS interview broadcast on Sunday. “Don’t overburden Iraq with your own issues,” Salih said. “The U.S. is a major power...but do not pursue your own policy priorities, we live here.” Iraq is in a difficult position as tensions between its two biggest allies, the United States and Iran, increase. “It is of fundamental interest for Iraq to have good relations with Iran” and other neighbouring countries, Salih said. Trump announced in December that the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria would be withdrawn on the grounds that Islamic State militants no longer pose a threat.  During a recent visit to Iraq, Trump said he had no plans to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. In a report released on Monday, the Pentagon Inspector General said Islamic State remained an active insurgent group and was regenerating functions and capabilities more quickly in Iraq than Syria. “Absent sustained (counterterrorism) pressure, ISIS could likely resurge in Syria within six to twelve months and regain limited territory,” the report said. The report, citing information from U.S. Central Command, said Islamic State would portray the withdrawal as a “victory” and conduct attacks on U.S. personnel during it.

MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.11 percent, but remained near two-month highs, as the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 equity index opened little changed. Investors were parsing the significance for financial markets from Friday’s strong jobs report, which came on the heels of the Federal Reserve saying it would be patient on future rate hikes, amid a cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.25 percent, while benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 2.7307 percent, from 2.691 percent late on Friday. “People are still trying to figure out between what the Fed said last week and what the data said last week, what the path for U.S. rates is going forward,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 52.58 points, or 0.21 percent, to 25,011.31, the S&P 500 lost 0.31 points, or 0.01 percent, to 2,706.22 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.07 points, or 0.62 percent, to 7,308.94. Technology was the biggest riser among the S&P 500 sectors, as a busy fourth-quarter earnings season was set to continue later on Monday with the report due from Google parent Alphabet. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.21 percent, as Germany’s DAX index fell 0.4 percent. European investors were also grappling with concerns about the euro zone economy and about Britain’s plan to leave the European Union. The euro was down 0.2 percent to $1.1431 against the dollar. Improved risk appetite helped lift the dollar to a five-week high against the safe-haven yen. Oil prices fell on uncertainty about prospects for the global economy, retreating after benchmark Brent crude hit a two-month high near $64 a barrel as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s oil exports brightened the supply outlook. “Oil prices have lacked direction in today’s trading session because of mixed market cues,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. U.S. crude fell 2.64 percent to $53.80 per barrel and Brent was last at $61.82, down 1.48 percent on the day.

2019-02-04,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is complying fully with its pledge to cut oil production gradually, Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday. He said Russian oil production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October, the baseline for the global deal aimed at reducing oil supply. “Russia is completely fulfilling its obligations in line with earlier announced plans to gradually cut production by May this year,” Novak said in a statement. The pace of Russia’s output cuts has drawn criticism from Saudi Arabia, de facto leader of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. According to Energy Ministry data published on Saturday and Reuters calculations, Russia cut its output in January by around 35,000 bpd from October to 11.38 million bpd. The ministry report was in tonnes. Reuters uses a ratio of 7.33 when converting tonnes into barrels. The Energy Ministry has not revealed its calculations in barrels. Novak earlier said Russian oil production reached 11.41 million bpd in October 2018. OPEC and other global oil producers agreed in December to cut their combined output by 1.2 million bpd in order to support oil prices and try to balance the market. Of that, Russia pledged to cut its production by around 230,000 bpd in the first quarter.

France, Germany and Britain have opened a new channel for non-dollar trade with Iran to get around the sanctions, reimposed on Iran after President Donald Trump’s decision in May to exit a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and six major powers. “After nine months of procrastination and negotiation, Europeans have created a mechanism with limited capacity ... only for food and medicine,” Tasnim quoted Sadeq Amoli-Larijani as saying. “Iran will never accept their strange and humiliating conditions of joining the FATF (the Financial Action Task Force) and negotiations on its missile programme.” A French, British and German statement on Friday made no mention of any preconditions, although the European powers must now establish a budget and define its rules before the mechanism can be operational. Welcoming their move, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday Tehran would also have to set up a mirror company. The two sides are to hold talks this week on the process.   The European statement said they expected Iran to swiftly implement all elements of its FATF action plan. “FATF is not a precondition, it’s a strong expectation,” said a senior European diplomat, dismissing any suggestion that ballistic missile talks had anything to do with creating the mechanism.   Iran has threatened to pull out of the nuclear deal unless the European powers enable it to receive economic benefits. The Europeans have promised to help companies do business with Iran as long as it abides by the deal.  New U.S. sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to abandon business with Iran, and Washington said it did not expect the EU effort - known as INSTEX, or  Instrument for Supporting Trade Exchanges - to change that. Even as European powers have worked to preserve the nuclear deal, relations with Tehran have been worsening. The EU this month imposed its first sanctions on Iran since the nuclear pact, in response to assassination plots on European soil. They are also considering whether to push for sanctions on Iran’s ballistic missile programme if talks between the two sides on the issue do not progress.

2019-02-04,"ESSEN, Germany (Reuters) - Boosting renewables to 65 percent of Germany’s power mix by 2030 could cost 20 billion euros more than previously planned, which will mean higher consumer energy bills, the four main grid operators said on Monday. Last year, Germany raised its target for the contribution of renewables to 65 percent by 2030 from 50 percent in a bid to reduce CO2 emissions by 55 percent over 1990 levels. It is set to miss a 2020 target aimed at cutting emissions by 40 percent. About two fifths of power needs in Europe’s largest economy are now met by renewables, but this needs to rise as it seeks to close nuclear plants by 2022 and coal power stations by 2038. As a result, power grids need to be extended to reach renewable energy sites. This will include new transmission lines to connect the industrial south with northern wind power farms. The grid companies, known as transmission system operators (TSOs), have presented plans for a four-week consultation outlining spending on onshore lines of 52 billion euros ($60 billion), compared to the 32 billion euros previously envisaged. The four main TSOs — EnBW’s TransnetBW, 50Hertz, TenneT, and Amprion — said in a statement that an additional 18 billion to 27 billion euros would be needed to link up offshore wind farms. Total spending of 70 billion to 79 billion euros over 12 years would be shouldered by consumers via higher grid fees, which account for about a quarter of their electricity bills. However, the energy regulator Bundesnetzagentur said between a quarter and a third of costs estimated by TSOs in the past were not approved. The TSOs said some of extra costs arose from digitalising transmission systems and running more lines underground. The TSOs demands include adding two more cross-country lines on top of three underground ones already planned for 2025. Between a quarter and half of power demand in southern Germany will have to be met by renewable generation in the north, where plants now generate double the north’s needs. The additional lines to be built would run from Schleswig-Holstein to Baden Wuerttemberg via North-Rhine Westphalia, with capacity for 4 gigawatts (GW) over a distance of 1,160 kms (725 miles), the TSOs said. “We will study the draft plan very carefully to decide whether all transport capacities are being exploited,” Peter Franke, vice president of Bundesnetzagentur, told a panel discussion at an industry event in Essen. The regulator said in January it would seek to rein in run-away costs, especially as Germany’s long-term plan to quit coal generation would demand new spending.

2019-02-04,"* Eskom forecasts annual losses until 2022 * Utility seeks even higher power tariff hikes * Firm supplies more than 90 percent of S.Africa’s power (Adds bond moves) By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Feb 4 (Reuters) - South Africa’s struggling power firm Eskom expects to make a wider 20 billion rand ($1.5 billion) loss in the current financial year and wants steeper tariff hikes than it previously sought, its chief financial officer said on Monday. The chief executive also said the government should consider injecting extra capital into state-owned Eskom to help it cope with what he said were low electricity tariffs. Eskom, which previously forecast a 15 billion rand loss in the financial year ending in March, is vital to South Africa’s economy because it supplies more than 90 percent of its power but is drowning in around 420 billion rand of debt. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa is trying to turn around the ailing company and has said he will announce a plan to shore up its finances in the coming weeks. Eskom’s dollar-denominated bonds have rallied in recent days on hopes that Ramaphosa will unveil a restructuring plan soon. On Monday, many issues fetched their highest since June 2018. The 2025 issue rose 0.8 cent to trade at 99.5 cents in the dollar and the 2023 bond nearly matched those gains to change hands at 99.45 cents, according to Tradeweb data. Chief Executive Phakamani Hadebe told a mining conference in Cape Town the government should consider splitting the utility, using the term “functionally unbundling”. Chief Financial Officer Calib Cassim said in Johannesburg the larger forecast loss would be due to higher-than-anticipated power plant maintenance costs and increased use of diesel and gas, which is typically more costly than coal for generation. Cassim said Eskom was now requesting electricity tariff hikes of 17.1 percent in 2019/20, 15.4 percent in 2020/21 and 15.5 percent in 2021/22, steeper than a previous application for increases of 15.0 percent in each of those three years. Eskom said the new request was based on changes to its sales forecasts and production plans, arguing that significant time had elapsed since it made its initial request. South Africa’s energy regulator is expected to make a decision on Eskom’s tariff request in March this year. “We need Eskom to be sustainable to supply electricity,” Cassim told a public hearing on the tariff increases. “We are using one credit card to pay for another,” he said, saying Eskom was funding debt servicing with further borrowing. If granted the revised tariff hikes, Eskom would still turn a profit only in 2022, Cassim said, showing the challenge facing the firm.

2019-02-04,"BOGOTA, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A Colombian rebel commander killed over the weekend had ties to Venezuela’s embattled leader Nicolas Maduro, President Ivan Duque said on Monday. Duque did not provide details on the connection between the guerrilla, a member of a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) known by his nom de guerre Rodrigo Cadete, and Maduro’s administration. “Rodrigo Cadete had been creating organizations for more than a year, also nurtured by the patronage of some sectors close to Venezuela’s dictatorship,” Duque told reporters, referring to efforts the government says Cadete was making to form new rebel factions. Maduro is embroiled in a showdown with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has declared himself Venezuela’s legitimate president. Colombia, along with the United States, Canada, most of Latin America and at least 10 European countries, has officially recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s leader. The 51-year-old Cadete, whose birth name was Mesias Salgado Aragon, was a long-time member of the FARC rebel group, which demobilized in 2017 after a peace deal with the government, Defense Minister Guillermo Botero said. Cadete originally participated in the demobilization but months later returned to factions of the FARC that rejected the accord, Botero added. At least 13 other guerrilla fighters have been killed during the operation, which is ongoing and has included bombings and ground combat, the minister said. The dissidents have an estimated 1,800 combatants spread across about 30 units. Some 13,000 FARC members, including 6,000 combatants, demobilized under the peace accord. The group is now a political party, with 10 seats in Congress guaranteed through 2026. The FARC fought the government for more than five decades in a conflict that has killed more than 260,000 people.

2019-02-04,"DETROIT (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG unit Electrify America said on Monday it will install Tesla Inc battery storage packs at more than 100 charging stations across the United States to keep costs down for drivers charging electric vehicles. Electricity users can incur high-demand charges from many U.S. utilities when they draw a lot of energy from the grid in a short time, which can happen charging an electric vehicle or a number of them at once at a single station. “If you pass the demand charge onto the customer in a high-demand charge market” it can cost anywhere from $70 to $110 to charge a vehicle, Electrify America’s chief operating officer Brendan Jones told Reuters. “If you did that, obviously nobody would buy an electric vehicle.” Tesla Powerpack battery systems draw power from the grid during off-peak hours and store it for use during peak hours to avoid or reduce demand charges. Electrify America will install most of its battery packs in areas of the United States where there is a higher concentration of electric vehicle owners, particularly on the West Coast and the Northeast. During a conference call with analysts this week, Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk said “stationary storage” is a growth opportunity for the automaker.  “I expect that to grow, I mean, probably twice as fast as automotive for... a long time,” Musk said. VW has agreed to spend $2 billion nationwide on clean car infrastructure as part of an agreement with federal regulators after admitting to diesel emissions cheating.  A lack of EV recharging infrastructure is seen as a major barrier to mass adoption as consumers remain concerned over their limited range.  By this June Electrify America will have 484 charging stations built across America. The company is discussing using more battery storage packs with regulators for its next round of infrastructure investment, company CTO Jones said. He said that apart from keeping charges down for consumers, Electrify America will examine the possibility of selling stored energy to lower charging stations’ costs. Global automakers are planning a $300 billion surge in spending on electric vehicle technology over the next five to 10 years, with nearly half of the money targeted at China, accelerating the industry’s transition from fossil fuels and shifting power to Asian battery and electric vehicle technology suppliers.

2019-02-04,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell CAPE TOWN, Feb 4 (Reuters) - There may be some irony in climate change being blamed for an increase in weather delays that resulted in South Africa’s coal exports dropping 4 percent last year, but in reality the rough seas at the country’s Richards Bay terminal are the least of the industry’s worries. Shipments from Richards Bay declined to 73.5 million tonnes in 2018 from 76.5 million the prior year, well below the 91 million tonnes capacity of the terminal, which is the second-biggest in the world behind Newcastle Port in Australia. The terminal lost 36 days of loading last year because of rough weather, down slightly from 38 days in 2017, with both these years being considerably higher than in preceding years. But even if the terminal was fully available all 365 days of the year, it’s still unlikely that much more coal would have been shipped. The blame for South Africa’s lower exports was placed on market conditions by the head of Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT), Alan Waller, with high prices crimping demand in the main export destination of India. However, RBCT chair Nosipho Siwisa-Damasane said the weather disruptions are also likely a challenge for future years, and terminals around the world were going to have to deal with the “new norm” of what was previously abnormal weather patterns. While high prices were undoubtedly a contributing factor to the lower exports, it’s also likely that infrastructure constraints and an inability of many of South Africa’s coal miners to boost production were perhaps of greater importance. The rail network has a theoretical capacity of delivering 81 million tonnes a year from South Africa’s inland mines to RBCT, meaning that even if it was working at full steam, there still wouldn’t be enough coal to use up RBCT’s export capacity. Mandisa Mondi, the general manager of coal freight at state-owned rail operator Transnet told the IHS Markit Southern African Coal Conference in Cape Town last week that plans were in place to boost the rail capacity to match that of RBCT. These include initial steps to improve technology and operational efficiencies to reduce bottlenecks, followed by later infrastructure improvements such as a new tunnel through a mountain between the inland coal fields and the coast. Transnet said it could eventually boost the rail capacity available for exports by 25 million tonnes above current levels, but whether this happens depends on whether miners commit to producing and exporting more. It’s here where the situation becomes less clear, with companies having been reluctant in recent years to invest in building new mines or even expanding existing operations. Part of this was because of a long-running dispute over South Africa’s mining laws, although that appears to have been settled recently. Still, South Africa’s coal miners would have to take a positive view of likely demand before committing capital to new projects. The IHS Markit conference heard some rosy forecasts of demand for coal, mainly on a surge in new power plants being built in India. However, these forecasts are likely to prove hopelessly optimistic, especially as renewable energies become cheaper and more reliable, and as more liquefied natural gas (LNG) becomes available from projects in Australia, the United States and Russia. Just under half of South Africa’s coal went to India in 2018, a country with an official policy of reducing coal imports to zero over time. Other major buyers include South Korea, which also plans to lower coal burning, and Pakistan, which has concerns over the foreign exchange cost of importing fuels. While South African coal is viewed as a good quality product, and superior to supplies from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia, there are serious questions as to whether there will be sufficient demand in Asia to justify spending the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to boost mine supply and rail capacity. This makes it likely that South Africa will continue to be a relatively steady supplier of around 75 million tonnes of coal a year to the seaborne market. This could increase somewhat if Transnet can de-bottleneck and RBCT doesn’t lose more days to rough weather. But for now, any ambitious plans to boost coal exports are exactly that, just plans.

2019-02-04,"BARCELONA, Feb 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - At the mouth of a picturesque rural valley in southern France, near the Spanish border, Odessa Roitg has a tough job: trying to get people to use private cars less and greener transport more. The area of 10 communes, with its base in the arty town of Céret, approved a new climate change plan in December that aims to improve the public bus service and encourage car-sharing for people to get to work, the young bureaucrat said. The administration itself uses electric bikes and vehicles for some of its operations. But in this less-prosperous part of France, with few transport alternatives to driving a car, Roitg can understand why some people support ongoing protests by the “gilets jaunes” (yellow vests), sparked in November by a planned hike in diesel taxes. “People get a bit annoyed when (the government) speaks to them about the environment and sustainable development because it comes with taxes and things costing more, when it should cost them less,” she said. The “yellow vest” protests caused concern among officials gathered at the annual U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, many of them looking for ways to curb planet-warming emissions without stoking social discontent. Growing pressure to slash emissions - to meet global warming limits set in the 2015 Paris Agreement and prevent the worst impacts of climate change - means more governments are considering pricing carbon. Usually that is done by taxing fossil fuels, or by capping industry emissions and setting up a scheme to trade allowances. Mathilde Bouyé, an associate with the climate programme at the Washington-based World Resources Institute, said France’s aborted attempt to hike fuel prices came on top of a tax cut for the wealthy, and was the last straw for hard-up families. “What is behind this is a matter of equity,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “There is no opposition in principle to carbon pricing.” But citizens are unwilling to bear the brunt of the costs when they feel the burden should be shared with large corporations, she added. She noted that the “gilets jaunes” have called for higher taxes on shipping and aircraft, for example. Another problem in France was that the extra income from fuel price hikes had been earmarked for the French state budget rather than to support concrete projects to help people adopt clean energy. In response to social unrest, France has now launched a nationwide “Grand Debate” on four themes, including the “ecological transition” and taxation, to which anyone can contribute online or at municipal meetings. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said French voters had little trust in the government on climate change policies - but all may not be lost. “I think the Grand Debate will offer the possibility for the government to reshape its policy because it will give (the president) a new legitimacy to do that,” she said. George Marshall, a lead author of a World Bank guide issued in December on communicating carbon pricing, said consulting the public was crucial - though often skipped - in designing policies to make people pay more for fossil fuels. Including a wide range of views from the outset is key, he told a briefing on the guide. “We cannot sell something that is a poorly constructed policy,” said Marshall, founder of Climate Outreach, a UK-based organisation that works to improve communication around climate change. Addressing people’s most immediate concerns - which may well not include climate change - is crucial too. The top environmental issue for many responding to France’s “Grand Debate” online survey is air pollution, for instance - and action on that could also help reduce emissions. Marshall said the public often responds badly to a conventional narrative that lays out the threats and costs of climate change, then goes on to explain in economic terms why it is cheaper to act now than cough up for the damage later. Instead, “the benefits have to be put first and foremost”, he explained. How the money raised from a carbon levy will be used is also key to gaining public acceptance, he said. In Canada’s British Columbia province, revenue from its carbon tax, introduced in 2008, is given back to individuals via a “climate action tax credit”. The tax has proved largely successful, both in terms of curbing per-capita emissions and public buy-in. A similar policy is now being rolled out at national level. In the United States, meanwhile, a bi-partisan bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate calling for a fee on fossil fuels, with the money collected paid back in equal shares to Americans each month as a “carbon dividend” - an idea that is supported by eminent economists. Researchers at Georgia State University and the Oslo-based CICERO Center for International Climate Research surveyed nearly 5,000 people in five countries - Britain, the United States, Australia, South Africa and India - in 2017 on how funds from a hypothetical global carbon tax ought to be used. The three methods that garnered more than 50 percent approval in all five countries were lowering income taxes, redistributing revenues domestically to each citizen, and investing the funds in renewable energy projects in every nation worldwide. Reporting their findings in the journal Nature last month, the researchers wrote that returning revenue in the form of a “people’s payout” is becoming increasingly popular. It appeals to the political right because it does not swell state coffers, and the left is happy because the average tax burden is unchanged and low-income households end up better off. Co-author Stefano Carattini, assistant economics professor at Georgia State University, urged countries and jurisdictions with carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes - which now cover about a fifth of global emissions - to form an international club aimed at harmonising systems and raising the carbon price. Such a club could also lobby the World Trade Organization to reform rules to allow carbon taxes to be levied on imports, he said. Eventually, if enough states came onboard, the existing messy system of each nation setting an emissions target in the hope of keeping global warming in check could be jettisoned for a single global carbon price, he argued. U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa, meanwhile, called for a more positive narrative on the benefits of a green transformation. ""Yes, we are fighting climate change, but we are working towards a sustainable, resilient, low-carbon world that is good for health, for nutrition, for the quality of life of people,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

2019-02-04,"* French, German stocks slip after mixed Friday on Wall St * Britain’s FTSE gains as sterling weakens * Dollar gains for third straight session * Oil hits 2019 high on Venezuela sanctions * China markets closed all week for Lunar New Year By Karin Strohecker LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - World stocks clung to near two-month highs on Monday, with the dollar strengthening and oil prices racing to a 2019 peak, though some European bourses struggled as momentum provided by U.S. employment and manufacturing data started to fade. MSCI’s All Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, traded within a whisker of Friday’s two-month high thanks to gains in Hong Kong, Australia and Japan. In London, the FTSE rose 0.3 percent to a two-month peak after sterling softened against the dollar. Yet the pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.2 percent, with Paris’s CAC losing 0.6 percent and Frankfurt’s DAX down 0.3 percent as a flurry of corporate news triggered sharp individual moves. U.S. stock market futures also pointed to a more muted start to the week, with both S&P 500 and Nasdaq e-mini futures treading water. “The tone we took away from the end of last week and the dovish tilt from the Federal Reserve is positive for risk assets,” Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “The benign outlook for monetary policy should support risk assets but the elephants in the room are Brexit, trade talks and political instability in Europe,” Hewson said. The Sentix survey on investor morale in the euro zone released on Monday hit its lowest level in more than four years in February, largely due to concerns about Britain’s looming departure from the European Union. That looked quite different to data from the United States, where non-farm payrolls on Friday jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs in January - the largest gain since February 2018. That report, along with better-than-expected January ISM manufacturing activity numbers, pointed to underlying strength in the world’s biggest economy. Many Asian markets were closed on Monday for the Lunar New Year. China’s financial markets are closed all week, while those in South Korea are shut until Thursday. In FX markets, the dollar index extended gains for a third straight day, strengthening 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. The greenback climbed a third of a percent to 109.89 yen while the euro was slightly lower at $1.1447 after pulling back from Friday’s high of $1.1488. Sterling softened towards a one-week low as Prime Minister Theresa May met lawmakers to try and overcome a parliamentary impasse that raised fears among investors about a disorderly ‘no-deal’ Brexit. Yet analysts were watching closely how long the momentum in the dollar could last. “Overall, the emergence of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data should help to ease downside risks for the U.S. dollar in the near-term following the recent dovish shift in Fed policy,” Lee Hardman at MUFG Bank wrote in a note to clients. “However, it is unlikely to prove sufficient to trigger a sustained turn around for the U.S. dollar.” China’s yuan weakened 0.3 percent in offshore trading despite data showing that China’s sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January, albeit at a slower pace, offering continued support for the world’s second-largest economy as manufacturing cools. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.6948 percent after climbing nearly 6 basis points on Friday to pull away from a four-week low of 2.619 percent hit earlier last week. In commodity markets, Brent crude futures hit a two-month high close to $64 a barrel as OPEC-led supply cuts and U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s petroleum industry offset forecasts of weaker demand and an economic slowdown. Spot gold fell 0.5 percent to their lowest in nearly a week to $1,310.76 per ounce, having hit $1,326.30 on Thursday - its highest since April 26.

2019-02-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - British chemical manufacturer Ineos has called on the UK  government to change its ‘unworkable’ rules on gas fracking which it says could force the closure of the industry. Ineos has the largest shale gas license acreage in Britain and wants to develop the sites to cut its reliance on imported gas, which it says will dramatically reduce its costs. “The Government is shutting down shale by the backdoor and is betting the future of our manufacturing industry on windmills and imported gas,” Ineos said in a statement on its website. Ineos said Britain must change its so-called traffic light seismicity regulations which mean fracking must be halted for 18 hours if seismic activity of magnitude 0.5 or above is detected at sites. “Ineos calls upon the Government to either make shale workable or shut it down,” Ineos said. Cuadrilla, currently the only company to have fracked for gas in Britain, had to halt operations several times last year at its Preston New Road site in northwest England due to seismic events which exceeded the limit. It has also said the current regulations are too stringent and experts agree that the limit for tremors could be safely raised at fracking sites. However, the government, which initially supported fracking to cut Britain’s reliance on imports as North Sea gas supplies dry up, said earlier this year it has no plans to change the rules. Britain currently imports around 60 percent of its gas needs via pipelines from Norway and continental Europe and tankers of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from countries including Qatar, Russia and the U.S.. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who have raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination and say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

2019-02-04,"(Adds quotes on Brexit, recasts lead) By Andreas Rinke and Elaine Lies TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Monday that he and German Chancellor Angela Merkel share a responsibility to work towards global peace and prosperity, with both hoping for a prompt, democratic solution to Venezuela’s leadership crisis. Merkel, on a two-day visit to Japan, said that Germany recognises opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation’s interim president, joining many European nations, and said he should organise new elections as soon as possible. “Guaido is the person with whom we are talking and who we expect to initiate an election process as quickly as possible, and he is the legitimate interim president for this task from the German perspective and also from the perspective of many European partners,” Merkel told a news conference with Abe. “And we hope that this process is as short as possible and of course peaceful,” she added. Abe emphasized his cooperation with Merkel during a visit aimed a forging an “alliance of multilateralists” to resist U.S. President Donald Trump’s “America First” approach to trade and China’s pursuit of narrow national interests. “Our responsibility towards working for global prosperity and security has merely increased,” he said, adding that the two leaders would work for a global order “based on rules.” Merkel referred to an EU-Japan trade deal that entered into force on Feb. 1, saying: “All in all, a trip at a time in which we have demonstrated that, even at times when multilateral agreements are in difficult straits, we are ready to conclude such things.” “..very good win-win situations can occur when all partners talk to each other. Of course, fairness and reciprocity are part of this, but that is what we advocate.” Abe did not comment on Guaido’s status, but he said Japan wanted a stable, democratic and prompt solution to Venezuela’s political crisis. Several European nations have joined the United States in recognising Guaido as interim president, intensifying a global showdown over Nicolas Maduro’s socialist rule. Merkel said Germany would do everything possible to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but she did not want to see Britain’s divorce deal with the EU - the so-called Withdrawal Agreement - renegotiated. British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday she would seek a “pragmatic solution” to a parliamentary impasse over the terms on which Britain leaves the European Union when she tries to reopen talks with Brussels less than two months before Britain is due to leave the bloc on March 29. “There are definitely options for preserving the integrity of the single market, even when Northern Ireland isn’t part of it because it is part of Britain, while at the same time meeting the desire to have if possible no border controls,” Merkel said. “To solve this point you have to be creative and listen to each other, and such discussions can and must be conducted,” she added. “We can still use the time to perhaps reach an agreement if everyone shows good will.” (Reporting by Elaine Lies; additional reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; editing by Darren Schuettler)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/japan-germany/update-2-japan-germany-share-responsibility-to-work-towards-global-peace-pm-abe-idUKL3N1ZZ2JR,04 Feb 2019,"Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe

2019-02-04,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming steadily less bearish towards oil as OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela remove large volumes of crude from the market amid increasing confidence a global recession can be averted. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of another 30 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to position data from ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers have been net buyers in seven of the last eight weeks and have increased their position by 96 million barrels since Dec. 4. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4) In common with previous weeks, fund managers mostly closed out old bearish short positions (-18 million barrels) rather than opening new bullish long ones (+12 million). Bearish short positions have fallen by more than 60 percent from a peak of 122 million barrels on Dec. 11 to 48 million as fund managers have become convinced that the fourth-quarter sell-off is over. In contrast, bullish long positions have risen by just 27 million barrels over the same period, as portfolio managers remain cautious. However, weekly increases have started to accelerate, in a sign of growing confidence. Funds now hold almost 6 bullish long positions for every bearish short one, up from a ratio of 2:1 in mid-December, and the most bullish overall position since mid-October. OPEC’s early and aggressive output reductions have removed some of the downside supply risk to oil prices even as traders remain uncertain about the risk of recession and the potential hit to consumption growth in 2019. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA, since broadened to include third-country purchasers of Venezuela’s heavy crude, are also likely to reduce global oil supplies. Besides crude, fund managers were buyers of 7 million barrels of European gasoil futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to exchange data. Net long positions in gasoil have risen in each of the last four weeks and now stand at 22 million barrels, up from just 2 million barrels at the end of 2018. Gasoil is the part of the barrel most closely geared to the business cycle, so cautious buying suggests fund managers see a reduced probability of recession this year.

2019-02-04,"LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Representatives from Britain’s biggest union Unite and Nissan are meeting on Monday after the Japanese carmaker scrapped plans to build its next-generation X-Trail model at its Sunderland plant in northern England. Falling demand for diesel cars in Europe has forced Nissan to invest in other technologies as the segment is hit by levies and crackdowns. But the company also said the “continued uncertainty around the UK’s future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,” prompting renewed fears among some in Britain that Brexit was hitting the economy. “I think that is a serious signal to all of us in parliament that now is the time to resolve that uncertainty so it doesn’t impinge on any decisions in the future,” business minister Greg Clark told the BBC TV. Britain secured the Nissan investment just four months after the June 2016 vote to leave the EU with promises to maintain the competitiveness of the plant. Since then lawmakers have rejected a negotiated Brexit deal, raising the prospect of an exit without agreement, leading to tariffs and customs checks. Clark said 740 new jobs were due to be created by the X-Trail investment but none of the existing workforce would be hit by the decision to pull the model, which will solely be built in Japan. Unite’s acting national officer for the automotive sector Steve Bush said he now wanted Nissan to work with their employees regarding the future. “Unite now expects the company to work with us to ensure full preparations for Brexit in which jobs and investment are prioritised, which can be best achieved by our representation on the task force established by Nissan.” (Reporting by Costas Pitas; additional reporting by Kate Holton; editing by Michael Holden)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/britain-eu-nissan/union-meets-nissan-after-it-axes-plans-to-build-new-model-in-britain-idUKL5N1ZZ24F,04 Feb 2019,"Representatives from Britain's

The pan-European STOXX 600 slipped 0.1 percent in early trading with Paris’s CAC and Frankfurt’s DAX both falling around 0.2-0.3 percent. MSCI’s All Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, traded within a whisker of Friday’s two-month high after Hong Kong’s Hang Seng ended a half day of trade up 0.2 percent while Australian shares and Japan’s Nikkei ended half a percent higher. London’s FTSE rose 0.2 percent to a two-month high after sterling softened against the dollar. Trade was subdued with many of the region’s markets closed for the Lunar New Year. China’s financial markets are closed all week, while those in South Korea are shut until Thursday. “The tone we took away from the end of last week and the dovish tilt from the Federal Reserve is positive for risk assets,” Michael Hewson, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “The benign outlook for monetary policy should support risk assets but the elephants in the room are Brexit, trade talks and political instability in Europe,” Hewson said, adding he expected Tuesday’s services PMI data to confirm a darkening picture for Europe. U.S. stock market futures also pointed to a more muted start to the week: S&P 500 and Nasdaq e-mini futures both traded a touch softer. On Wall Street on Friday, optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a disappointing outlook from Amazon.com Inc battering retail stocks. The Dow rose 0.26 percent while the Nasdaq shed 0.25 percent. Friday’s U.S. non-farm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs in January - the largest gain since February 2018. That report, along with better-than-expected January ISM manufacturing activity numbers, pointed to underlying strength in the world’s biggest economy. However, global equity markets performed strongly last week after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle. Meanwhile in FX markets, the dollar index extended gains for a third straight day, strengthening 0.1 percent against a basket of currencies. Against the yen, the dollar climbed a third of a percent to 109.89 yen while euro was slightly lower at $1.1447 after getting pulled back from Friday’s high of $1.1488 on Friday. But analysts were watching closely how long the momentum in the dollar could last. “Overall, the emergence of stronger than expected U.S. economic data should help to ease downside risks for the US dollar in the near-term following the recent dovish shift in Fed policy,” Lee Hardman at MUFG Bank wrote in a note to clients. “However, it is unlikely to prove sufficient to trigger a sustained turn around for the U.S. dollar.” On the day, China’s yuan suffered some of the biggest losses against the dollar, weakening 0.4 percent in offshore trading. The latest falls took the losses of the yuan over the past two days to more than 1 percent - falls last seen in August last year when a broader selloff hammered emerging market assets. The tumble came despite data showing that China’s sprawling services sector maintained a solid pace of expansion in January albeit at a slower pace, offering continued support for the world’s second-largest economy as manufacturing cools. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.702 percent after climbing nearly 6 basis points on Friday to pull away from a four-week low of 2.619 percent hit earlier last week. In the commodity market, spot gold fell more than half a percent to $1,310.88, moving away from a more than 9-month high of $1,326.30 reached last week. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) U.S. crude oil futures rose 0.3 percent to $55.43 a barrel while Brent crude futures added 0.7 percent to $63.19. On Friday, WTI futures had rallied 2.7 percent on the upbeat U.S. job report, signs that Washington’s sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply and data showing U.S. drillers cut the number of oil rigs.

2019-02-04,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - P.C. Mohanan grew up in a village without electricity, studied statistics at a public university, and then spent more than three decades crunching numbers for the Indian government. But in the past week, the mild-mannered official has been caught up in a political storm that has threatened to undermine Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government months before a general election. On Jan. 28, Mohanan resigned as acting chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), a government-funded advisory body that checks the quality of India’s official data, in protest at a delay in releasing a new set of jobs statistics. Another member of the NSC, J. Meenakshi, quit with him.  Three days later, some of those jobs numbers were leaked to the Business Standard newspaper, which reported that India’s unemployment rate in the year ending June 2018 rose to 6.1 percent, its highest level in at least 45 years. The figures are potentially crucial before the election, due to be held by May, as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) struggles to win over voters concerned about depressed farm incomes and a lack of job creation. India needs to create more than a million jobs each month just to find employment for young people entering the workforce. Officials from NITI Aayog, a government think tank formed by Modi in 2015 that is not normally involved in official releases of economic data, have rejected the job numbers reported by the Business Standard. They said the report was still in “draft” form and argued that more quarterly data was required to publish a “comparable” jobs report. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley also told Reuters news partner ANI the report was a draft “which has not been approved.” But in an interview with Reuters this weekend, Mohanan, 63, says he has no regrets about walking out in protest at the delay. He said the NSC, which was supposed to be the final authority on statistics before they were published, had been repeatedly sidelined by the government in recent months, and the delay in the jobs figures was the final straw. “Data should be released as per the calendar, whether it is to your liking or not liking,” he said. “Otherwise, where is credibility in the system?” It is unclear where the Business Standard got the figures. Mohanan stresses it wasn’t from him, and declined to discuss the specifics of the jobs report with Reuters. Mohanan, who says he is not active politically, said the NSC approved the report on Dec. 5, and expected it to be released soon after.  When it didn’t happen, he reached out to top officials, including the chief statistician, Pravin Srivastava, even flying to New Delhi from Mohanan’s home in southern India, for a meeting with him in late January. He says he didn’t get a satisfactory explanation for the delay in any of those discussions. With the report still unreleased, Mohanan and Meenakshi quit a few days later.  Mohanan said he felt it was important that he stood up for the integrity of the organisation, the NSSO, where he built his career. He had joined the NSC as a member in 2017, two years after retiring from India’s statistics service, which includes the NSSO. When he became the acting head in November 2018 he found the NSC’s role had diminished under the Modi government. It was starved of resources and it wasn’t engaged in major statistical initiatives as they should be under ministry guidelines. There was also a controversy over the release in November of historical GDP data with a new base year, which was used by the government to attack the opposition Congress party. The data showed growth was lower than previously thought during the previous Congress-led government.  He said his concern was the way NITI Aayog was involved in releasing the numbers. The government think tank said they had been brought in to assess the numbers before that announcement, according to local media.  As to NITI Aayog’s arguments against publishing the jobs data, both Mohanan and a senior former NSSO official said they are bogus. “There is no relation between this report and the quarterly data,” the former NSSO official said, requesting anonymity. Radha Binod Barman, who chaired the NSC between 2016 and 2018, said the National Statistical Commission should have been the final authority on whether to release the jobs report. NITI Aayog and India’s statistics ministry did not respond to emails seeking comment. For Mohanan, it has been a stressful past week. He realizes this might be the end of his government life but is ready to settle into retirement in the village he grew up in the state of Kerala.   Having made his point, Mohanan’s one big hope is that the NSC and the Indian statistics team will now be shown more respect.

2019-02-04,"ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Mongolia has extended school winter holidays in the world’s coldest capital and many families have sent children to live with relatives in the vast, windswept grasslands to escape choking smog and respiratory diseases such as pneumonia. The temperature is expected to drop to minus 32 degrees Celsius (minus 26F) in Ulaanbaatar on Monday night, as residents burn coal and trash to try to keep warm and concentrations of smog particles known as PM2.5 routinely exceed 500 mg per cubic meter, 50 times the level considered safe by the WHO. Mongolia, a former Soviet satellite landlocked between Russia and China, has invested public money and foreign aid to tackle pollution, but improvement has been slow, with residents saying inaction has been compounded by a corruption scandal that has paralyzed parliament. In a crowded township more than 40 miles from Ulaanbaatar, Jantsandulam Bold’s five grandchildren are breathing more easily after fleeing the capital. “Fresh air and sun are most important for kids to grow healthy and robust,” says Jantsandulam, 57, making milk tea for her grandchildren in her home, a thickly padded felt hut known as a “ger”, or in Russian, a “yurt”. “This little one had flu when he came here but the fresh air has treated him well,” she said, pointing at her five-year-old grandson. The children are nearing the end of a two-month break, with schools due to reopen next Monday. About 60 percent of Mongolia is covered by grassland, where the mining of copper, gold, coal and other minerals provides employment, while the Gobi desert envelops the South. But almost half the population live in Ulaanbataar.      Reuters calculations based on U.S. Embassy data show annual average PM2.5 concentrations hit 100 micrograms in Ulaanbaatar in 2018. They soared to 270 in December. PM2.5 in China’s most polluted city of Shijiazhuang stood at an average 70 micrograms last year, down 15.7 percent from 2017. The World Health Organisation recommends a concentration of no more than 10 micrograms.  The WHO said 80 percent of Ulaanbaatar’s smog was caused by coal burning in “ger” districts, where thousands of rural migrants, used to a nomadic lifestyle, have pitched huts. It estimates air pollution causes more than 4,000 premature deaths a year. A joint study by the U.N. International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and Mongolia’s National Centre for Public Health said children living in one smog-prone district of Ulaanbaatar had 40 percent less lung function than those living in the countryside.      “Air pollution aggravates respiratory diseases and children under five are most vulnerable as their organs are still not mature,” said Bolormaa Bumbaa, a doctor at Bayangol District’s Children’s hospital in Ulaanbaatar. Families have already set up a pressure group known as Moms and Dads Against Smog, but after the protests they organized in Ulaanbaatar were ignored, the group decided to focus on encouraging residents to take action to protect themselves, said Mandakhjargal Tumur, a group coordinator.  “I don’t believe the government will do enough to reduce pollution in coming years,” she said. “That’s why we are now focusing on raising awareness.”       At the Bayangol hospital, Ulzii-Orshikh Otgon, 34, was forced to bring her 10-month-old daughter Achmaa in with pneumonia for the second time in a month.  “I believe it’s because of the pollution,” she said, adding that home air purifiers did little to help.  “Just by opening the door, our home fills with smog,” she said while breastfeeding Achmaa in the waiting room. Doctors advised her to take her children out of Ulaanbaatar but she has no relatives in the countryside and rent is expensive.  “Decision makers have said for years they are fighting pollution,” she said. “They just wasted billions of tugriks on useless stoves and processed coal, which don’t change anything.” Reporting by Munkhchimeg Daavasharav; Editing by David Stanway and Nick Macfie",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mongolia-pollution/desperate-mongolians-send-children-into-countryside-to-escape-choking-winter-smog-idUKL3N1ZV3KH,04 Feb 2019,"Mongolia has extended school

Spread-betters expect European markets to start on a cautious note, with London’s FTSE and Paris’s CAC seen falling marginally and Frankfurt’s DAX expected to open up a tad. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was a shade weaker. It had scaled a four-month peak on Friday amid a surge by its global peers.

U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures last traded basically flat. On Wall Street on Friday, optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc that battered retail stocks.

A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018. That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the world’s biggest economy. “After last week’s risk appetite revival, the data pulse and the tone of Fed speakers will be important.

Global equity markets performed strongly last week after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with further interest rate hikes, signalling a potential end to its tightening cycle. Friday’s robust economic data triggered a sharp rebound in U.S. Treasury yields, in turn lifting the dollar. On Monday, the U.S. currency climbed a quarter of a percent to 109.76 yen, after advancing 0.6 percent on Friday. The euro was slightly lower at $1.1442 after getting pulled back from a high of $1.1488 on Friday.

2019-02-04,"* Imports do not reflect growth in domestic demand * CNOOC resold at least one LNG cargo in January * Gas demand growth to decelerate -analyst By Jessica Jaganathan and Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - China’s imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) rose to another monthly record in January, even as the country grapples with high gas inventories amid a warmer-than-usual winter, according to shipping data and industry sources. The world’s second-largest LNG importer took 6.55 million tonnes of LNG in January, beating the previous record hit in December by nearly 2 percent, according to Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. China’s imports last year surged 41 percent from 2017 after gas shortages the previous winter prompted Chinese companies to stock up on supplies and pre-order cargoes, with Beijing continuing to push millions of households to switch to gas from coal for heating. But the import growth is not wholly due to a rise in demand, said an industry source familiar with the Chinese market. “When people see these numbers, they think Chinese demand is up ... but actually it is causing a headache (for importers) as (they) have overbought and can’t find demand to absorb the cargoes,” the source said, declining to be identified as he was not authorised to speak with media. China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) resold at least one LNG cargo in January and possibly another, an unusual move during what is typically a peak demand period and highlighting this year’s warmer weather, industry sources said. Chinese traders are offering LNG cargoes to international buyers or selling into their domestic market at lower-than-expected prices, the first source said. The Lunar New Year holiday has also made the situation worse because factories are shutdown for a least a week, he said. Wholesale LNG from small, land-based liquefaction plants fell to 3,500-3,950 yuan ($519-$586) a tonne on Feb. 2, less than half levels of last year, according to Chinese gas-price monitoring agency yeslng.com. Quotes at receiving terminals in East China’s Shandong and North China’s Tianjin last stood at 4,500 yuan ($667) a tonne, down 17 percent and 5 percent, respectively, from late November, shortly after heating season started. China’s gas demand growth should decelerate from the past two years, said James Taverner of energy consultancy IHS Markit. “Coal-to-gas switching mandates are moderating due to ... security of supply concerns, and weakening economic growth,” Taverner said. There is also limited capacity in North China for further LNG ramp-up after big increases the past two years, he said. Trade tensions between the United States and China have also tightened financial conditions, dragging China’s growth last year to its weakest in 28 years.

2019-02-04,"CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - There may be some irony in climate change being blamed for an increase in weather delays that resulted in South Africa’s coal exports dropping 4 percent last year, but in reality the rough seas at the country’s Richards Bay terminal are the least of the industry’s worries. Shipments from Richards Bay declined to 73.5 million tonnes in 2018 from 76.5 million the prior year, well below the 91 million tonnes capacity of the terminal, which is the second-biggest in the world behind Newcastle Port in Australia. The terminal lost 36 days of loading last year because of rough weather, down slightly from 38 days in 2017, with both these years being considerably higher than in preceding years. But even if the terminal was fully available all 365 days of the year, it’s still unlikely that much more coal would have been shipped. The blame for South Africa’s lower exports was placed on market conditions by the head of Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT), Alan Waller, with high prices crimping demand in the main export destination of India. However, RBCT chair Nosipho Siwisa-Damasane said the weather disruptions are also likely a challenge for future years, and terminals around the world were going to have to deal with the “new norm” of what was previously abnormal weather patterns. While high prices were undoubtedly a contributing factor to the lower exports, it’s also likely that infrastructure constraints and an inability of many of South Africa’s coal miners to boost production were perhaps of greater importance. The rail network has a theoretical capacity of delivering 81 million tonnes a year from South Africa’s inland mines to RBCT, meaning that even if it was working at full steam, there still wouldn’t be enough coal to use up RBCT’s export capacity. Mandisa Mondi, the general manager of coal freight at state-owned rail operator Transnet told the IHS Markit Southern African Coal Conference in Cape Town last week that plans were in place to boost the rail capacity to match that of RBCT. These include initial steps to improve technology and operational efficiencies to reduce bottlenecks, followed by later infrastructure improvements such as a new tunnel through a mountain between the inland coal fields and the coast. Transnet said it could eventually boost the rail capacity available for exports by 25 million tonnes above current levels, but whether this happens depends on whether miners commit to producing and exporting more. It’s here where the situation becomes less clear, with companies having been reluctant in recent years to invest in building new mines or even expanding existing operations. Part of this was because of a long-running dispute over South Africa’s mining laws, although that appears to have been settled recently. Still, South Africa’s coal miners would have to take a positive view of likely demand before committing capital to new projects. The IHS Markit conference heard some rosy forecasts of demand for coal, mainly on a surge in new power plants being built in India. However, these forecasts are likely to prove hopelessly optimistic, especially as renewable energies become cheaper and more reliable, and as more liquefied natural gas (LNG) becomes available from projects in Australia, the United States and Russia. Just under half of South Africa’s coal went to India in 2018, a country with an official policy of reducing coal imports to zero over time. Other major buyers include South Korea, which also plans to lower coal burning, and Pakistan, which has concerns over the foreign exchange cost of importing fuels. While South African coal is viewed as a good quality product, and superior to supplies from top thermal coal exporter Indonesia, there are serious questions as to whether there will be sufficient demand in Asia to justify spending the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to boost mine supply and rail capacity. This makes it likely that South Africa will continue to be a relatively steady supplier of around 75 million tonnes of coal a year to the seaborne market. This could increase somewhat if Transnet can de-bottleneck and RBCT doesn’t lose more days to rough weather. But for now, any ambitious plans to boost coal exports are exactly that, just plans. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.  Editing by Christian Schmollinger",https://uk.reuters.com/article/column-russell-coal-safrica/column-south-africa-will-struggle-to-boost-coal-exports-even-if-it-wants-to-russell-idUKL3N1ZW4A6,04 Feb 2019,"There may be some irony in

2019-02-04,"SINGAPORE, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Crude oil prices slipped on Monday after gains of about 3 percent in the previous session, but they were buoyed by expectations of tightening supply and signs that China-U.S. trade tensions could ease. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $55.06 per barrel at 0122 GMT, down 20 cents, or 0.36 percent, from their last settlement. WTI settled 2.73-percent higher in the last session at its strongest closing level since Nov. 19. International Brent crude oil futures on Monday were down 24 cents, at $62.51 a barrel, after closing up 3.14 percent in the previous session at their highest since Nov. 21. “Crude oil prices (had) surged higher as recent supply side-issues were joined with easing concerns of weaker economic growth,” ANZ Bank said in a research note. U.S. energy firms last week cut the number of oil rigs operating to their lowest in eight months as some drillers followed through on plans to spend less on new wells this year. Elsewhere, pressure on crisis-hit oil producer Venezuela continues to mount as U.S. sanctions bite. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to those imposed on Iran last year, experts said after examining details posted by the Treasury Department. Meanwhile, oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in January by the largest amount in two years despite sluggish production declines from Russia, according to a Reuters survey. Russian oil output declined to 11.38 million barrels per day (bpd) in January, or by around 35,000 bpd from the October 2018 level, the baseline for a global oil accord to curb production, missing the deal’s target, Energy Ministry data showed on Saturday. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak has said the country’s overall cuts would total 50,000 bpd in January from October. Russia has pledged to reduce oil output by 230,000 bpd from October. Hopes for thawing China-U.S. relations have also helped ease concerns over slowing economic growth. “While the United States and China have yet to reach a deal, markets were buoyed by reports that they have made significant progress,” said ANZ. U.S. President Donald Trump last week said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping, perhaps twice, in the coming weeks to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal with Beijing, but acknowledged it was not yet clear whether a deal could be reached.

2019-02-04,"(Corrects 3rd paragraph to remove reference to South Korean market, which is closed until Thursday, Feb 7.) * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Stocks subdued after Wall St’s mixed Friday performance * Dollar supported by stronger-than-expected US jobs report * China markets closed all week for Lunar New Year By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Asia stocks were barely moved on Monday, staying near a four-month high after Wall Street’s tepid pre-weekend performance, while the dollar was supported against the yen following strong U.S. jobs and manufacturing data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was basically unchanged, capped below the four-month peak scaled on Friday. Japan’s Nikkei added 0.4 percent. China’s financial markets are closed all week for the Lunar New Year holiday. Wall Street ended mixed on Friday, as optimism from a surge in January U.S. job growth was offset by a weaker-than-expected outlook from Amazon.com Inc that battered retail stocks. The Dow nudged up 0.26 percent while the Nasdaq shed 0.25 percent. “Key points for the markets this week will be how the remaining U.S. corporate earnings releases turn out, and whether they are in line with recent upbeat data,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. “While corporate earnings and fundamentals remain key, political developments, notably the U.S.-China trade situation, remain potential risk factors,” he said. A U.S. Labor Department report on Friday showed nonfarm payrolls jumped by a stronger-than-forecast 304,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since February 2018. That report, along with better-than-expected ISM manufacturing activity numbers for January, pointed to underlying strength in the world’s biggest economy. The robust economic data triggered a sharp rebound in U.S. Treasury yields, in turn lifting the dollar. On Monday, the U.S. currency was a shade higher at 109.55 yen after advancing 0.6 percent on Friday. The euro was little changed at $1.1455 after getting pulled back from a high of $1.1488 on Friday. The Australian dollar was steady at $0.7250 after slipping 0.4 percent the previous session. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 2.691 percent after climbing nearly 6 basis points on Friday to pull away from a four-week low of 2.619 percent earlier last week. U.S. crude oil futures inched down 0.04 percent to $55.24 per barrel after surging 2.7 percent on Friday. Oil prices had rallied on the upbeat U.S. jobs report, signs that Washington’s sanctions on Venezuelan exports have helped tighten supply and data showing U.S. drillers cut the number of oil rigs.
