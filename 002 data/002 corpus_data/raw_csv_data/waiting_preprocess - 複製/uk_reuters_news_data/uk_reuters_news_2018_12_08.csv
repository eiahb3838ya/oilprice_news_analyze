2018-12-08,"TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libyan state security on Saturday threatened to shut down production at the giant El Sharara oilfield but the field remains open, state oil firm NOC said, denouncing what it called an “occupation” of the 315,000 barrels-a-day facility. “The oilfield at present remains open,” NOC said in a statement, after tribesmen had announced a closure of output after driving with jeeps into the field, located deep in the often lawless southern desert. But the situation remained tense at the field where engineers said NOC was trying to convince the security guards and tribesmen to back off. The field is linked to the Zawiya port and refinery on the western coast. A Libyan oil source said oil was still flowing from the field but this could change on Sunday if the situation continued to be tense. It usually takes times to close a field even after protesters announces it — NOC was now trying to use last-minute negotiations to avoid a shutdown, engineers said.  The tribesmen and the local unit of the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG) had in the afternoon announced a shutdown to press for demands of more development. “We as the force securing the field inform you that the Fezzan Anger Movement entered the field and stopped the production in line with the demands of the movement,” the local PFG unit said in a statement. Responding to the comments after seven hours of silence, NOC accused the security guards of having facilitated the protests and threatened staff to close the field. “I salute the bravery of our workers who refused to shut down production in spite of threats faced,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in the statement, warning of “catastrophic consequences” should the field get indeed closed. NOC demanded the PFG leadership to take “swift action” against the local unit, listing their names in the statement. Guards have previously forced production stoppages at El Sharara and other oil fields, complaining about salary delays or demanding other financial benefits. A group of tribesmen calling themselves the Fezzan Anger Movement living in the impoverished areas hosting the El Sharara filed had first appeared in October at the facility threatening to close it unless demands were met. Fezzan is the historic name of the southern region of Libya where El Sharara oilfield is located. “El Sharara is closed. We had given authorities a deadline but we got no response,” said the group’s spokesman Mohammad Maighal. In March the field shut briefly after a local landowner closed a valve in protest against pollution near a pipeline crossing his land. NOC said he had tried to extort a contract, a common complaint in Libya where many see the oil firm as entity to go for demands rather then the weak state. Libya managed recently to boost production to 1.3 million bpd, the highest level since 2013 when a wave of blockages and protests started, part of turmoil since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

2018-12-08,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change are nearing the end of a first week in the Polish city of Katowice, the capital of the country’s Silesian coal mining district.  The aim of the gathering is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Subscribers to Eikon can also find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Below is a flavour of the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the “Spodek”, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue. Negotiations continue to clean up a messy text ahead of a Saturday night deadline to have a document ready for ministers to wrestle over in the second and final week of the conference. Negotiators say there has been progress, but it is slow and, as ever, finance is a stumbling block. Although highly technical, negotiators say the Katowice talks are an essential follow-up to the Paris Agreement, which agreed on the aim of limiting global warming but did not provide rules on how to achieve that. A U.N. spokesman said a record number — more than 32,800 — had registered to attend the conference. Those arriving at the start of next week will include former Maldives President Mohamed Nasheed, who will be returning from exile in Britain to lead his country’s delegation. At noon, demonstrators, accompanied by a heavy police presence, took to the streets of Katowice to demand an agreement that will prevent temperatures rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The marchers’ symbol is an alarm clock, as organisers seek to wake governments up to the urgency of action. “Our message for the politicians and the companies is that they should stop making money at our expense, at the expense of our health,” said one of the demonstrators, who gave his name only as Jeremi.  “They shouldn’t just think about the next 10 years, but see that it’s possible to live on our planet for much longer,” he said. A police spokesman estimated that 3,000 people took part in the march.     Environmental campaigners in Katowice said violent protests by “yellow vest” demonstrators in Paris about fuel costs were about social justice and should not be confused with the need for a price on carbon to help shift the energy mix away from fossil fuel. French President Emmanuel Macron was forced to scrap a planned fuel tax because of the angry demonstrations about living costs. Numbers on the streets of Katowice could have been reduced by at least a dozen after Polish border guards refused to let some environmental campaigners enter the country, non-governmental organisations said. One of those stopped was Nugzar Kokhreidze, a delegate from Georgia.  “I was stopped at the passport control at Katowice International Airport. They said that my name and surname is in the banned list in some system,” he said in an email. Environment organisation 350.org said in an email that those denied entrance had been told they were “a threat to national security, which as you can imagine is ludicrous”.  A spokeswoman for the Polish border guard said 161 people had been forbidden entry to Poland on Friday for many reasons, including a lack of correct documents and being on security lists. She could not immediately say whether there was any connection to the climate talks in Katowice.  Since the beginning of this year, Poland has denied entry to 74,000 people.

2018-12-08,"(Adds details, context) By Rania El Gamal VIENNA, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s crude oil exports are expected to drop next month by some 1 million barrels per day (bpd) from November levels, two sources familiar with the matter said on Saturday. The world’s top oil exporter is expected to ship about 7.3 million bpd in January, one of the sources said, due to softening seasonal demand and as Riyadh follows through on a global deal to cut output to prevent a build up in oil supplies. The sources did not give a figure for December oil exports. OPEC and its Russia-led allies agreed on Friday in Vienna to slash oil production by more than the market expected in a bid to shore up prices despite pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to reduce the price of crude. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said in Vienna this week that the kingdom’s oil exports would be less than 8 million bpd in December, down from around 8.3 million bpd in November. He also said Saudi Arabia would pump about 10.2 million bpd in January, down from about 10.7 million bpd in December. His ministry tweeted on Saturday that the decision taken by the oil exporters who met in Vienna would be “reflected in the stability and the equilibrium of the oil market.” Reporting by Rania El Gamal

2018-12-08,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has “ordered” the central bank to boost the value of rial, the bank’s governor said on Saturday, after a months-long plunge in the currency due to a faltering economy and U.S. sanctions. The state news agency IRNA quoted governor Abdolnaser Hemmati as saying Ayatollah Khamenei “ordered the bank at a recent meeting to increasingly strengthen the national currency and called for the observance of the independence of the central bank”. “The central bank and the banking system will use all of its managerial power and expertise to fulfil the Leader’s goals,” Hemmati said.  He did not say which policies he would follow to support the rial, which has lost about 65 percent of its value in 2018. The rial’s plunge had reached about 75 percent in the past few months, but it has recovered some of its value in recent weeks. The currency has been volatile for months because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians to protect their savings as the United States withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear accord and piled pressure on Iran by reimposing sanctions.

2018-12-08,"KHARTOUM, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Air fares in Sudan skyrocketed this week after aviation authorities ordered airlines to price tickets in line with a new exchange rate mechanism that sharply devalued the local currency. Under the exchange regime introduced in October in a bid to tackle an acute shortage of foreign currency, the Sudanese pound was devalued to 47.5 per U.S. dollar from 29 pounds per U.S. dollar previously. That has led to a surge in the cost of many goods and services, but air ticket prices had been set according to the customs exchange rate — 18 pounds per dollar — until Wednesday when the country’s Civil Aviation Authority announced the hike in a memo sent to airlines. The order caused prices to jump about 66 percent, according to travel agencies’ estimates. Prices in dollars were not affected, but only foreigners and Sudanese residents of other countries may buy tickets in dollars. “This decision has led to a drastic 60 percent drop in travel in the last two days. This situation puts the aviation industry in Sudan and travel agencies at risk of unbearable losses,” said Mahjoub Almack, head of the Sudanese Association of Travel and Tourism Agents. Despite October’s devaluation, the pound remains under pressure and the gap between the official and black market rates has continued to widen. A dollar cost 57 pounds on the black market on Saturday.

2018-12-08,"* PGG CEO says concerned about planet, sees need to change * Poland not ready to end coal use until has alternative * Transition plan includes supplying services, gasification By Anna Koper and Barbara Lewis KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Polish state-owned PGG, the European Union’s biggest producer of thermal coal, said it plans to sink a new mine near where U.N. talks to wean the world off fossil fuels are taking place. The Imielin North project, around 20 kilometres from Katowice, would cost at least 1.5 billion zloty ($400 million), with up to half the funding provided by PGG, its chief executives Tomasz Rogala told Reuters. Poland’s president said this week he would not allow anyone “to murder coal”, outraging many of the thousands of delegates representing nearly 200 countries at the conference. Rogala expects the new mine to be completed in around five years’ time and have a reserve base of 60 million tonnes. That compares with PGG’s annual output of around 30 million tonnes. While coking coal is on the EU list of strategic minerals because of its use in steel, coal for power generation is more difficult to justify. Rogala said he understands the need to move on from coal, but alternative sources must be in place first. “I have pressure to find new business,” he said, adding that when effective electricity storage was developed, coal generation would be obsolete. Large-scale battery storage is a holy grail for those who favour green energy, as it would make wind and solar power as reliable as coal, nuclear and gas. “It (battery storage) can change everything. The first effective electricity storage will end coal generation,” Rogala said. “We have to stop climate change. But I don’t agree that European coal is responsible (alone), as the greatest use of coal is elsewhere,” he added. Poland’s coal output has shrunk by 100 million tonnes over the last 40 years, Rogala said, while global production has at least doubled and electricity demand has kept rising. For now, Rogala said Poland needs the fuel because it does not have nuclear generation and it does not want to depend on imports from Russia, which have been rising. PGG has a transition plan which includes supplying its technical services, such as precision welding, to other Polish industries and producing gas from coal for energy and as a feedstock for the chemical industry. Rogala said the aim is a transition that will create jobs with salaries equivalent to coal, which in Silesia are around 50 percent better paid than the average.

2018-12-08,"BEIJING, Dec 8 (Reuters) - China’s imports of crude oil hit a fresh monthly high in November, customs data showed on Saturday, beating the record set in October on heavy buying from private refiners and trial starts of new mega-refineries. Crude oil arrivals last month rose 8.5 percent compared with the same month a year ago to 10.43 million barrels per day (bpd), marking the first time China imported more than 10 million bpd. October’s imports were 9.61 million bpd. For the first 11 months, China imported 418.11 million tonnes of foreign crude oil, or 9.17 million bpd, putting it on track to make this year a record high for imports. Strong demand is being driven in part by new refineries, such as the 400,000 bpd project operated by major private firm Hengli in northeastern port Dalian that planned test runs last month. Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp is also planning trial runs at some refining units at its 400,000 bpd facility off the archipelago city of Zhoushan at the end of this year, and imported several cargoes of Oman crude in the fourth quarter. The private refiners, known as “teapots”, bought 8.57 million tonnes of crude in November, or 1.94 million bpd, according to Refinitiv Oil Research and Forecast. Zhejiang Petrochemicals received two VLCCs of crude in November while Dalian Hengli received 540,000 tonnes of Arab crude in November, Refinitiv analyst Emma Li wrote in a note on Dec. 5. Meanwhile China’s total natural gas imports rose 25.6 percent year on year to 9.15 million tonnes in November, also a record monthly number, as China’s energy majors boosted imports to meet demand from the second year of a government campaign to switch to cleaner fuels for winter heating. For the first 11 months, gas imports stood at 81.19 million tonnes, up 33.8 percent from last year. Reporting by Meng Meng and Dominique Patton; Editing by Simon
