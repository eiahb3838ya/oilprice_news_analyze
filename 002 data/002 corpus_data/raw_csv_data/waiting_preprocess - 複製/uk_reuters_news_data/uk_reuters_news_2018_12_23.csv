2018-12-23,"GEORGETOWN/CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s navy “intercepted” a ship exploring for oil on behalf of Exxon Mobil Corp in Guyanese waters over the weekend, Guyana’s foreign ministry said in a statement, while neighbouring Venezuela said the incident occurred within its territory. The latest incident in a century-old border dispute comes after a series of offshore oil discoveries have given Guyana the potential to become one of Latin America’s largest producers. In OPEC member Venezuela, by contrast, crude output has tumbled to the lowest levels in nearly 70 years amid an economic crisis. The Ramform Tethys vessel, which belongs to Norwegian company Petroleum Geo-Services (PGS) and was conducting seismic survey work on behalf of Exxon, stopped exploration and turned east after being approached by the Venezuelan navy, PGS spokesman Bard Stenberg said in a statement. “Guyana rejects this illegal, aggressive and hostile act,” Guyana’s foreign ministry said in a statement late on Saturday, adding that the move “demonstrates the real threat to Guyana’s economic development by its western neighbour” and “violates the sovereignty and territorial integrity of our country.” The ministry added that it would report the incident to the United Nations and send formal communication to Venezuela’s government. It said it would inform the governments of the various homelands of the 70 crew members aboard the vessel, flagged by the Bahamas, of the “threat to their safety.” A spokeswoman for Exxon said the U.S. oil firm’s seismic explorations in the western portion of Guyana’s Stabroek Block “have been paused until they can be safely continued,” and that the vessel was operating in Guyana’s exclusive economic zone. In a statement on Sunday, Venezuela’s foreign ministry said its navy, during a routine patrol, had encountered two boats hired by Exxon in an area under “undoubtedly Venezuelan sovereignty” and “proceeded to apply the appropriate international protocols.”  The ministry said the boats’ captains told the navy they had permission from Guyana’s government to explore in the area, and that the boats turned around after being told Guyana did not have jurisdiction in that area. It also said it informed the UN and sent a protest note to Guyana’s government. Neither PGS nor Guyana’s foreign ministry immediately responded to requests to clarify whether one or two research ships were involved in the incident. Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro has previously criticized Guyana’s decision to allow oil exploration in the waters off the shore of the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated and dense jungle area equivalent to around two-thirds of Guyanese territory that Venezuela also claims. Guyana says Caracas agreed to relinquish the area after a ruling by an international tribunal in 1899, but Venezuela later backtracked on that decision. The U.N. earlier this year referred the dispute to the International Court of Justice, a move welcomed by Georgetown but criticized by Caracas. The dispute has heated up in recent years as Exxon has announced the discovery of more than 5 billion barrels of oil off the shore of Guyana, an English-speaking nation of 750,000 with no history of oil production. In a statement, U.S. State Department deputy spokesman Robert Palladino faulted Venezuela for the latest incident. “The Venezuelan Navy aggressively stopped ExxonMob‎il contracted vessels operating under an oil exploration agreement with the Cooperative Republic of Guyana in its Exclusive Economic Zone,” he said, saying Guyana had the right to explore there and urging Venezuela to respect international law and its neighbours’ rights. Washington is a critic of Maduro’s government, which it accuses of corruption and human rights violations.  On Friday, Guyana’s parliament toppled the government in a no-confidence vote, paving the way for elections in three months.

2018-12-23,"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy will offer subsidies of up to 6,000 euros (£5,391.3) to buyers of new low emission vehicles while slapping taxes on the purchase of larger petrol and diesel cars, according to measures approved in parliament. The measures, contained in Italy’s 2019 budget passed by the upper house on Sunday, made changes to rules proposed by Rome earlier this month which drew criticism from the car industry. Unions and auto sector associations have warned about the proposed new tax, saying it could hurt not only carmakers but also the entire supply chain and could cost jobs. Italy’s ruling parties - the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League - have been at odds over the issue, with the latter opposing any new taxes on cars, while the pro-environment 5-Star has encouraged the new rules. In their new form, the taxes proposed for cars running on traditional fuels will no longer apply to small family cars but only to larger high-powered vehicles, including SUVs. A tax of 1,100 euros will be slapped on new petrol and diesel cars that generate 161-175 grams of CO2 emissions per kilometre. That will rise to 1,600 euros for emissions of 176-200 and to 2,000 euros for emissions of 201-250. Incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles, meanwhile, will vary according to emissions generated and will not apply to models that cost more than 50,000 euros ($57,000). The new measures, which still need to be approved in the lower house, will come into effect on March 1 and last to the end of 2021. Electric, hybrid and methane gas-powered cars currently make up only around 7 percent of Italy’s car sales. Italy’s Fiat Chrysler (FCHA.MI), which at present sells no electric or hybrid cars in Europe, said in November it was planning to spend more than 5 billion euros on new models and engines in Italy between 2019-2021. In December, in reaction to the original measures, Fiat said it could review its Italian investment plan if Rome raised taxes on petrol and diesel cars. Fiat has not commented since changes to the original proposals were made.  Italy’s 2019 budget is expected to be approved by the lower house of parliament this week.

2018-12-23,"(Repeats story from Friday with no changes to text.) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Jennifer Hiller NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producers are slamming the brakes on next year’s drilling with crude prices off 40 percent and mounting fears of oversupply, paring budgets that in some cases were set only weeks earlier. The reversal is alarming because blistering growth in shale fields has propelled U.S. crude output 16 percent to about 10.9 million barrels per day for 2018, above Saudi Arabia and Russia. Production has been expected to rise 11 percent more in 2019 as large oil firms and independents added wells this year. Shale producer Centennial Resource Development on Thursday joined rivals Diamondback Energy, and Parsley Energy in canceling drilling rig additions next year. Centennial, led by shale pioneer Mark Papa, withdrew its 2020 production target and canceled plans to add 2.5 drilling rigs, citing market weakness. “You’re really seeing folks pull back on extra spending, pull back on extra drilling and focus on being resilient,” said Matt Gallagher, president of Parsley Energy, who will become CEO in January. The company plans to cut its 2019 capital budget by about 15 percent compared to 2018 while increasing production. Right now, shale prices are close to break even levels. U.S. crude futures for 2019, based on an average of the year’s monthly contracts, this week dropped below $50 a barrel, near the $46-$50-per-barrel level that shale producers in the Permian Basin, the largest oil field in the United States, need to cover their costs. The price drop is “a shock,” said John Roby, chief executive of Dallas, Texas-based oil producer Teal Natural Resources LLC. “A lot of people are cutting back development programs and cutting rigs,” he said. On Friday, U.S. crude slipped below $46 a barrel. Centennial said in a securities filing it could no longer stand by its 2020 projections or add rigs next year “in light of the current macro environment.” Just six weeks ago, it forecast 2020 output of 65,000 bpd with “attractive” returns based on a U.S. oil price of $75 a barrel. Centennial’s Papa was not available for comment. “Realized pricing in the Permian Basin is near levels not seen since the end of 2016 while service costs have increased by about 35 percent during the same time period,” said Travis Stice, CEO of Diamondback. The company cut three rigs, and plans to operate 18 to 22 rigs next year, down from 24 now. “If commodity prices continue to decline, we will further reduce activity to match our budget to expected annual operating cash flow,” Stice said in a statement. Goodrich Petroleum Corp this week also cut its 2019 capital spending plan by $40 million and Abraxas Petroleum Corp said it has scrapped a $108 million budget draft and will release a new one early in the year. Ring Energy also disclosed plans to cut one of its two drilling rigs. Weaker oil prices are squeezing companies and increasing borrowing costs. Investors have sold shares in companies that increased their drilling budgets, pressuring for cuts. This year’s shale expansion by oil majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron also has helped drive up service costs for smaller companies working in West Texas, further pressuring margins. The shale cutbacks are the first of what is expected to be a wave of companies shedding rigs and slashing spending budgets, said Matthew Lemme, a portfolio manager with investment firm Cushing Asset Management. “You can’t stick your head in the sand and pretend that oil hasn’t fallen 20 bucks in a couple of months,” Lemme said. The message that investors continue to send oil and gas producers is: “Stay within cash flow no matter what the oil price is,” Lemme said. That conservative view of budgets will mean additional rigs and service crews that hydraulically fracture shale wells will be idled, slowing North American production growth in 2019, Lemme said. The number of active drilling rigs has dropped to the lowest since October, but producers in the Permian Basin have banked a record number of drilled wells waiting to be completed and tied to pipelines. That inventory could be tapped quicker than having to drill new wells. “Shale companies outside the Permian appear to face greater financial distress, and we think they would need to scale back activity more were prices to stay low,” Standard Chartered said in a note.

2018-12-23,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - The planned start-up of a proposed Finnish-Russian nuclear reactor in western Finland has been pushed back by four years to 2028 as more time is needed to secure the project’s licenses. “The goal is to receive the construction licence and to start the construction of the plant in 2021. Accordingly, the commercial operation of the plant would begin in 2028,” the consortium behind the project, Fennovoima, said in a statement. A delay had been expected due to Fennovoima’s problems in submitting documents to the Finnish nuclear safety authority. The consortium includes Russian state nuclear company Rosatom, whose involvement has raised concerns in Finland about Russia’s influence in the country. The Finnish parliament, however, approved the project to build the 1.2-gigawatt reactor, which is expected to cost 6.5 billion to 7 billion euros ($7.5 billion-$8 billion), to boost domestic energy production. The consortium also includes Finnish power company Fortum and stainless steel maker Outokumpu, among other companies.

2018-12-23,"BEIJING, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports hit record levels in November, customs data showed on Sunday, with traders rushing to buy the fuel as households and businesses crank up their heating over the freezing winter months. LNG imports totaled 5.99 million tonnes in November, up 48.5 percent from the same month last year, data from the General Administration of Customs showed. That surpassed the previous record of 5.18 million tonnes hit in January this year. China has been pushing to switch parts of the country to gas for heating, shifting away from coal as it pushes to clean up its environment. For the first 11 months of 2018, LNG imports were up 43.6 percent from a year earlier to 47.52 million tonnes, on track to beat 2017’s annual record of 38.13 million tonnes. Meanwhile, Chinese exports of gasoline and diesel fell in November from the year before, the data showed, with local refiners reducing production as profit-margins fall. China exported 1.23 million tonnes of diesel in November, down 37.5 percent year-on-year. Gasoline exports last month fell 39.2 percent year-on-year to 630,000 tonnes.
