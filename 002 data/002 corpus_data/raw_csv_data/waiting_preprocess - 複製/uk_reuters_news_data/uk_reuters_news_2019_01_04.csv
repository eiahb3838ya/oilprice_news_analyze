2019-01-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Equities around the globe rallied on Friday while bond yields rose after sharply declining earlier in the week as U.S. employment data pointed to economic strength and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the U.S. central bank would be patient with monetary policy. U.S. and European stocks got a boost as the stronger-than-expected jobs report soothed some concerns of slowing economic growth. That was welcome news to investors after sharp declines on Thursday following Apple Inc’s (AAPL.O) cut in its revenue forecast. Stocks surged further, with Wall Street up more than 3 percent, after Powell said policymakers were paying attention to market activity and would be flexible in deciding future interest rate hikes and reducing the Fed’s balance sheet. He also said that he would not resign if asked to do so by U.S. President Donald Trump. Powell’s comments alleviated some worries that the Fed’s course of monetary tightening may be too aggressive in the event of an economic slowdown. Earlier, stock markets were buoyed by news that China and the United States will hold trade talks in Beijing on Monday and Tuesday. “The market’s been grappling with growth, the Fed and China,” said Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust in Wilmington, Delaware. “Those have been addressed today in a direct way.”  Keeping with Friday’s risk-on theme, oil prices rose in tandem with equities.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.11 to settle at $57.06 a barrel, a 1.98 percent gain. U.S. crude CLc1 futures settled 87 cents higher at $47.96 a barrel, a 1.85 percent gain. Safe-haven assets retreated. Treasury yields rose sharply, and the dollar gained 0.8 percent against the yen. Spot gold prices, which reached a six-month peak on Thursday, dropped 0.7 percent.  “Longer-term bonds have sold off here today in price,” said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Inverness Counsel in New York. “There aren’t signs of significant economic weakness.” Powell's dovish comments pushed down the dollar index .DXY, which gave up earlier gains and last traded down 0.1 percent.

In U.S. equities, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 746.94 points, or 3.29 percent, to 23,433.16, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 84.05 points, or 3.43 percent, to 2,531.94 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 275.35 points, or 4.26 percent, to 6,738.86.

2019-01-04,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose nearly 2 percent on Friday after proposed trade talks between the United States and China eased some fears about a global economic slowdown, but gains were capped after the United States reported a sharp build in refined product inventories.  Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.11, a 1.98 percent gain, to settle at $57.06 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures increased 87 cents to settle at $47.96 a barrel, a 1.85 percent gain. After both benchmarks fell sharply last year, prices posted solid gains in the first week of 2019, despite recent data that added to concerns about a slowing global economy.  Brent increased about 9.3 percent for the week, while WTI rose about 5.8 percent. Prices pared gains on Friday after data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed a sharp increase in product inventories as refiners ramped up utilization rates USOIRU=ECI to 97.2 percent of capacity, the highest rate on record for this time of year. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI rose 6.9 million barrels last week, while distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI grew 9.5 million barrels, the EIA said, compared with forecasts for builds under 2 million barrels. U.S. crude stockpiles were little changed. USOILC=ECI “Winter-grade gasoline supplies could be approaching burdensome levels if Gulf Coast runs remain elevated at a near full-out pace,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. U.S. energy firms this week cut oil rigs for the first time in three weeks, reducing the rig count RIG-OL-USA-BHI by eight to 877, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said. Some analysts were forecasting the first decline in the rig count - an indicator of future production - in three years in 2019. Oil drew support from comments by China’s commerce ministry, which said Beijing would hold vice-ministerial trade talks with U.S. counterparts on Jan. 7-8. The news helped boost sentiment across riskier assets including the U.S. equity and oil markets. [.N] Washington and Beijing have been locked in a trade war for much of the past year, disrupting the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods and hampering growth. China’s services sector extended its expansion in December, a private survey showed on Friday, bucking a trend of downbeat economic data. “Recent Chinese data is not confirming the doom-and-gloom trend,” said Olivier Jakob, oil analyst at Petromatrix. “And you’ve got OPEC cutting.” A robust U.S. jobs report also added to broader market optimism. Despite some demand-side worries, oil has received support as supply cuts announced by the global coalition of producers known as OPEC+ kick in. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and other non-members agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. A Reuters survey on Thursday found OPEC supply fell by 460,000 bpd in December. The focus now will be on whether producers deliver further curbs in January to implement the deal fully. Iraq said on Friday it was committed to the deal and would keep its oil production at 4.513 million bpd for the first half of 2019.

2019-01-04,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The partial government shutdown is increasing the chances of delays in U.S. energy initiatives from the release of President Donald Trump’s proposed offshore drilling plan to allowing higher levels of ethanol in gasoline during summer months, energy industry groups said on Friday.   The U.S. Department of Interior had been expected to release its highly anticipated 2019 to 2024 offshore oil and gas drilling plan in early January. The Trump administration has made opening up greater areas to offshore drilling, and holding more frequent lease sales, part of its energy dominance agenda to boost fossil fuel output for both domestic use and exports. Industry interest in several lease sales has been tepid, but the administration has said more interest is expected in the future.   The Interior Department is operating at reduced staffing levels due to the partial shutdown, which has stretched two weeks.  Nicolette Nye, a spokeswoman at the National Ocean Industries Association, said her group is expecting the shutdown will lead to a delay in the proposed plan’s release. But she said members of her group should not be overly affected as long as the final drilling plan, expected to be released this summer, comes on time. “It’s always a good thing to have something in place that they can use to plan on. But it’s more important to have the final plan on schedule for our companies,” Nye said. The Interior Department did not comment on a potential delay. “Due to the lapse in appropriations the Department is unable to respond to inquiries unrelated to shutdown,” Heather Swift, a spokeswoman, said in an email in response to a request on the drilling proposal timeline.  Biofuel producers are worried the shutdown could lead to delays in Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules that would allow sales in summer of gasoline containing up to 15 percent ethanol, called E15. Agricultural interests have lobbied for the sales after the Trump administration gave breaks on ethanol requirements to some oil refiners.  “From the outset, the EPA gave itself very little wiggle room to complete the year-round E15 rulemaking before summer, so the shutdown is making a tight timeline even tighter,” Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said in a release.  Still, Cooper said we he was confident the EPA will allow year-round E15 sales before June 1.  When asked about the potential for delays, an EPA spokeswoman said the agency will only be responding to queries directly related to the government shutdown or to environmental emergencies.  This week, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, an office of the Interior Department, warned that public meetings related to what is slated to be the largest U.S. offshore wind farm will be rescheduled if the shutdown continues into next week.      The five meetings are meant to allow the public to comment on the 800 megawatt project’s environmental impacts and are currently scheduled to take place in Massachusetts and Rhode Island between Jan. 8 and 17. The project is being developed by Avangrid Inc (AGR.N) and Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners. The Trump administration has said development of a domestic offshore wind industry is critical to its energy strategy,  The Department of Energy and its independent office the Federal Energy Regulatory Committee are both already funded for 2019, so the shutdown has minimal effect on their programs.

2019-01-04,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan authorities issued arrest warrants for 37 suspects over attacks on key oil ports in the east of the country and a military base in the south, a source in the attorney general’s office said on Friday. The source, who asked not to be named, confirmed the authenticity of the arrest warrants, which were dated Jan. 2  and were leaked on Facebook on Thursday. The warrants showed that 31 members of the Chadian and Sudanese opposition based in Libya, along with six Libyan nationals, are wanted for attacks on the oil ‘crescent’ in the east of the country and on the Tamanhint military base as well as for their participation in fighting between Libyan rivals. After the toppling of veteran Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, fighters from neighbouring Chad and Sudan joined the ensuing turmoil. Competing Libyan armed factions frequently accuse each other of deploying mercenaries from sub-Saharan Africa. The Libyan suspects include Abdul Hakim Belhadj, a rebel leader who helped to topple Gaddafi in 2011 and is now an Islamist political leader. Last year Britain apologised to Belhadj and his wife over the role of British intelligence officers in their 2004 rendition from Thailand to Libya.  Ibrahim Jadhran, who is accused of launching an attack last June on the oil crescent, is also among those sought by the Libyan authorities. Jadhran’s forces controlled the oil crescent for years until it was taken over in 2016 by the Libyan National Army, which is loyal to Commander Khalifa Haftar in eastern Libya.  The closure of the oil crescent, where key oil ports are located, has led to production losses of up to 450,000 barrels per day (bpd) from a total national output of little over one million bpd. Last September, the U.N. Security Council added Jadhran to the list of individuals subject to an assets freeze and a travel ban. Libya’s east-west division, in place since disputed elections and an escalation of fighting in 2014, has split key institutions and produced a deadlock between the rump parliaments and the shifting military factions they are aligned with.

2019-01-04,"Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut oil rigs for the first time in three weeks as producers started to reduce their 2019 drilling plans with the collapse in crude prices at the end of last year. Drillers cut eight oil rigs in the week to Jan. 4, bringing the total count down to 877, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 742 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. Some analysts, however, were forecasting the first decline in the rig count in three years in 2019 after drillers added 138 oil rigs in 2018 and 222 in 2017. They cut 11 rigs in 2016. U.S. shale producers have slammed the brakes on 2019’s drilling with crude prices off 40 percent and mounting fears of oversupply, paring budgets that in some cases were set only weeks earlier. U.S. crude oil output hit an all-time high of more than 11.5 million barrels per day in October, according to monthly government data released this week. U.S. oil production broke its 1970 record of 10 million bpd in November 2017, and has set monthly record highs for five straight months since June. The United States has become the world’s leading crude producer, surpassing Russia and Saudi Arabia. U.S. crude futures were trading around $48 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to gain 5 percent this week on proposed trade talks between the United States and China eased some fears about a global economic slowdown. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $50 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and $52 for calendar 2020. Spot crude prices at the U.S. West Texas Intermediate WTC- benchmark averaged $65.23 in 2018. The U.S. Energy Information Administration projected spot WTI prices would average $54.19 a barrel in 2019. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided mixed guidance for 2019 after indicating they would spend about $88.9 billion in 2018, a 23 percent increase over the $72.2 billion they spent in 2017. Cowen said the firms it tracks were so far only expecting to add 11 oil and gas rigs this year. There were 1,075 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall to 1,001 in 2019 before rising to 1,094 in 2020 - a significant decline from mid-December when they forecast 1,092 for 2019 and 1,227 for 2020. In 2018, the combined rig count averaged 1,032, the most since 2014 when 1,862 rigs were active, according to Baker Hughes. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2019-01-04,"(Adds details, oil prices, quotes) Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline and distillate inventories rose sharply last week as refineries ramped up activity, while crude oil stocks were barely changed, the Energy Information Administration said on Friday. Crude inventories rose by 7,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 28, compared with analyst expectations for a decrease of 3.1 million barrels, the EIA said in its report delayed by two days due to the New Year’s Day holiday. Distillate stockpiles, however, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 9.5 million barrels, the greatest one-week jump since December 2016, the EIA said. Analysts were expecting a 1.6 million-barrel increase. Gasoline stocks also rose dramatically, rising by 6.9 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.0 million-barrel gain. In the U.S. Gulf Coast region, gasoline stocks rose to 89.2 million barrels, a new record. Nationwide, gasoline inventories rose to 240 million barrels, the highest since June, suggesting a glut in U.S. motor fuel has developed during the less active winter. The gains in product inventories resulted in part from a notable move up in refinery crude runs, which rose by 410,000 barrels per day. Refinery utilization rates rose by 2.1 percentage points to 97.2 percent, the highest rate on record for this time of year. “It’s extraordinary that refinery utilization is over 97 percent at this time of year as refiners continue to run full out, supply the domestic market and export significant quantities of product to overseas markets,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. Refiners have been running at relatively high rates even during the most recent maintenance period, but seasonal heating oil demand has kept overall inventories of diesel and jet fuel contained. Oil prices were higher on the day, though the market was already rallying after Friday’s release of monthly U.S. employment data. U.S. crude gained $1.38, or 2.9 percent, to $48.47 a barrel as of 11:15 a.m. EST (1615 GMT), while Brent rose $1.44, or 2.6 percent, to $57.40 a barrel. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 641,000 barrels, EIA said. Net U.S. crude imports rose last week by 468,000 bpd, while crude production was unchanged at 11.7 million bpd.

2019-01-04,"* Mexico, Pakistan open buy tenders * Supply ample from Far East, Middle East * Falling charter rates offer trade opportunities By Ekaterina Kravtsova and Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell this week although few cargoes were heard to swap hands in a well-supplied market with some traders still on their New Year’s break. Spot prices for February delivery to Asia LNG-AS were assessed at $8.75 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) compared to $9.10 last week, industry sources said, citing low liquidity as the reason for the fall. Trading activity started to rise towards the end of the week and was mainly focused on late January and February cargoes, with nothing yet heard for March volumes, traders said. Tumbling shipping charter rates, however, were expected to boost liquidity next week, they said. Demand stayed low, with two buy tenders issued. Pakistan sought five cargos for delivery over March to April, with offers due by Jan. 30, according to documents. It is only its second LNG tender since June. Mexico’s CFE sought five cargoes to be delivered to its Manzanillo terminal between February and April in a tender due by Monday, traders said. CFE also purchased a cargo in a tender for mid-January delivery. China’s Unipec will load a cargo from Australia in February, having arranged a spot vessel for that shipment. On the supply side, a number of cargoes in Southeast Asia and the Middle East have been offered. Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Co (KUFPEC) will close on Monday a tender for mid-February loading from the Wheatstone plant in Australia. Exxon closed a tender for a spot vessel to load February volumes from Australia’s Gorgon plant. Malaysia’s Petronas sold at least two January cargoes from the Bintulu plant, with prices at around $8.50-$8.70/mmBtu free-on-board (FOB). A spot FOB cargo is being marketed from Qatar’s Ras Lafan plant for mid-January loading. Gunvor will lift a spot cargo from Oman’s Qalhat plant this month, having chartered the Gaslog Singapore for the loading. Gunvor has also chartered the Flex Rainbow, which it will likely use to load a U.S. cargo, sources said. LNG delivery volumes into Northeast Asia accelerated in December, exceeding 20 million tonnes and setting a new record, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Deliveries into China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan are set to be robust in January with 7.4 million tonnes, or 114 cargoes, already scheduled to arrive, according to the data. Lower shipping rates are aiding flows into the region, industry sources said, although the flow of Atlantic cargoes to the Far East is unlikely to resume soon, with closed arbitrage. Spot charter rates for a vessel with modern propulsion dropped to about $80,000 to $85,000 per day this week from $110,000 to $120,000 the previous week and could fall further as more vessels are becoming available. On Friday, seven ships were open for a spot charter, which could grow to 10 by the end of next week, shipbrokers said.

2019-01-04,"(In Jan 3 story, corrects age to 58) WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Kevin McIntyre, who served briefly as the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and had been suffering from brain cancer, died on Wednesday, the agency said on Thursday. He was 58. McIntyre was a lawyer representing clients from energy industries, including natural gas, oil and wind and hydropower, for nearly 30 years before President Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, nominated him in August 2017 to head the five-member commission. Most of McIntyre’s time as a lawyer was spent with the firm Jones Day. FERC is an independent arm of the Department of Energy that regulates the interstate transmission of electricity, oil and gas. McIntyre’s death leaves the commission with two Republicans and two Democrats, which could lead to deadlocks on issues including pipeline approvals and liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants if members vote on party lines. His seat will remain vacant until the White House nominates and the Senate approves a candidate. McIntyre, who underwent surgery in 2017 for brain cancer, stepped down from his chairmanship to become a commissioner in October last year after he had sat out two of FERC’s monthly open meetings due to health issues. Neil Chatterjee, a fellow Republican who succeeded McIntyre as FERC chairman, said he would miss his friend’s guidance and camaraderie. “In the face of adversity, Kevin’s dedicated faith, devotion to family and sharp wit never faltered,” Chatterjee said in a release. Soon after he became chairman in December, 2017, McIntyre led the agency’s unanimous rejection of Energy Department Secretary Rick Perry’s directive to subsidize aging nuclear and coal plants that were facing competition from plentiful natural gas. McIntyre’s initiatives at FERC included a proceeding on resilience of the wholesale electricity grid, an inquiry into the commission’s pipeline certification process, and an agreement with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration on the siting and safety review of LNG facilities, FERC said in a release.

2019-01-04,"OTTAWA, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Canadian employment gains hit a three-year low in 2018, official data showed on Friday, reinforcing market expectations that the Bank of Canada will keep interest rates unchanged next week. Canada added 9,300 jobs in December on an increase in part-time hiring, slightly more than markets had expected, while the unemployment rate remained at an all-time low 5.6 percent, Statistics Canada said. That said, employment as a whole in 2018 rose by 163,300 position, or just 0.9 percent, the lowest yearly increase since the 0.9 percent seen in 2015. The Bank of Canada has raised rates five times since July 2017 as the economy strengthens but analysts say there is no chance it will tighten again on Jan. 9. “I don’t think this nondescript employment report will change the outlook. We’re expecting them to keep rates unchanged next week,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets. Porter, speaking by phone, said the central bank was focused more on financial markets and weak oil prices. Analysts in a Reuters poll had forecast a gain of 5,500 positions in December and for the jobless rate to increase to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent in November, a month when a record 94,100 jobs were created. The economy shed 18,900 full-time jobs in December while part-time positions grew by 28,300. The average year-over-year wage growth of permanent employees - a figure closely watched by the central bank - remained at 1.5 percent in December, the lowest since the 1.2 percent seen in July 2017. “(That) suggests that there is a bit more capacity in the economy than the bank had expected in October and it fits with the idea that there is going to be a Bank of Canada pause,” said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. The six-month average for employment gains dipped to 30,100 from 33,800 in November. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said on Dec. 17 that the pace of tightening, which he stresses will be heavily dependent on data, could be interrupted or sped up depending on the economic circumstances. The Canadian dollar pared its gains on the report and touched C$1.35688 to the U.S. dollar, or 74.32 U.S. cents. Statscan said Canadian producer prices fell by 0.8 percent in November from October, the largest drop in almost two years, thanks largely to cheaper energy and petroleum products.

After selling off its opioid and tablet businesses in 2017, Vistin said last March it would set up an energy trading arm to complement its remaining drugmaking operations, which it said offered “solid growth prospects” but lacked scale. Having hired a team of oil market veterans, it bought derivatives betting on a widening price difference between high-sulphur and low-sulphur bunker fuel ahead of regulations on shipping fuel emissions that come into effect in 2020. Announcing the losses on Friday, the company said it would now evaluate the strategy of the energy trading unit. “There’s a board meeting next week. For the time being we’re still holding the contracts and have not yet decided what we will do with them,” Chief Executive Gunnar Manum told Reuters. The initial value of the investment amounted to around 400 million crowns, he added. On Thursday, Vistin announced the abrupt resignation of its head of energy trading, Torbjoern Kjus, but did not at that point reveal the extent of its losses. Vistin said the counterparty for the derivatives contracts was a Norwegian commercial bank, but declined to name it. At 1345 GMT, Vistin’s shares were down 8.1 percent at 6.8 crowns, having traded as low as 6.1 crowns.

Markets were buoyed by the resumption of trade talks between China and the United States and by encouraging surveys of China’s services sector. A slew of weak data had showed China’s economy was losing steam. China’s central bank said on Friday it was cutting the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves for the fifth time in the past year — freeing $116 billion for new lending as it tries to reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown. The boost from China brought some respite to battered markets, with MSCI’s world stock index up a third of a percent and U.S. stock futures around 1.5 percent firmer . “We’re not expecting a major breakthrough [in trade talks] on Jan. 7-8,” said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at Brooks Macdonald. “That said, where equity markets are in terms of valuations, if you look at the two core risks - U.S./China trade and the Fed – there’s room for markets to be positively surprised in both of those areas.” Global markets have had a rough start to 2019, hurt by a revenue warning from iPhone maker Apple and concern about slowing global economic growth. But on Friday, a rally in European markets gathered steam after a cautious move higher in Asian stocks. Europe’s STOXX 600 index rose 1.3 percent while Germany’s DAX jumped 1.8 percent, and was set for its best day in a month. In Asia, Shanghai blue chips rose 2.4 percent, while South Korean shares bounced 0.8 percent. But Japan’s Nikkei skidded over 2 percent on its first trading day of the year, hobbled by growth worries and the strength of the yen. The yen edged back from its recent surge on Friday on hopes the U.S.-China trade talks would make some progress, but the Japanese currency remains well bid by investors fretting about a global economic slowdown. The yen fell as much as 0.7 percent against the dollar to 108.45 before recovering some of those losses to trade at around 108. The euro held above $1.14. The single currency traded up 0.1 percent at $1.1410 despite a survey showing that euro zone business activity fell to a four-year low in December 2018 and official data showing that inflation in December had slowed by more than expected. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against a basket of rivals, was 0.2 percent lower at 96.152. The improving tone also fed through to Europe’s bond markets, pushing yields on safe haven assets such as Germany’s 10-year government bond off two-year lows hit this week. But analysts are unconvinced that the trade talks and subsequent relief rally signal sustained improvements, particularly in a new era of tightening liquidity. “(Central banks) are trying to get markets weaned off the idea that they will come riding to the rescue and people are trying to learn what the new rules of the game are,” said Colin Harte, head of research, multi-asset solutions at BNP Paribas Asset Management. Harte added that he was sceptical that the talks would have a meaningful resolution. “The picture will remain unclear for the first half of this year,” he said. German bond yields, while higher on Friday, were still set for their biggest weekly fall since October - down around 6 basis points. The move is evidence of a key change in central bank expectations, Bob Michele, chief investment officer and head of fixed income at JP Morgan Asset Management said. “With rate cut expectations and a slowdown in the U.S., does it look realistic that the ECB will raise rates at all this year?” he added. In such a risk-off environment, Michele said the European Central Bank might conceivably return to quantitative easing, which would push bond yields even lower. Money markets are pricing in just a 30 percent chance of a 10-basis-point ECB rate hike in 2019. The risk of a U.S. economic downturn, or even a recession, has caused a tectonic shift in expectations for interest rates, with investors now pricing in the possibility of a cut. Investors will be looking for any clues from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is due to speak on Friday, as well as the latest jobs numbers, released later this session. While the Fed is still projecting two more rate increases this year, the futures market implies the next move will be down with around a 40 percent probability of a move by year end. The market is fully pricing in an easing to 2.00-2.25 percent by May next year, from the current range of 2.25-2.50 percent. The mounting speculation sent yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries as low as 2.37 percent, taking them under the effective federal funds rate for the first time since 2008. They were last trading at 2.43 percent. Three- and five-year yields were even lower, an inversion that has sometimes heralded recessions in the past. Yields on 10-year benchmark paper dropped to 2.54 percent overnight, a turnaround from the highs of 3.25 percent seen as recently as November. Elsewhere, the news of the U.S./China trade talks boosted oil prices, with Brent crude oil was 1.9 percent higher at 57 dollars per barrel.

2019-01-04,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Awgzge By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar has recently appreciated to its highest level in real terms since the start of 2017 and before that September 2003. Dollar appreciation weighed on oil prices in 2018 as prices in some non-dollar currencies hit record levels earlier in the year and dampened consumption growth. Yet there are signs that the dollar’s rise may be coming to an end as trade tensions with China weigh and pressure to raise rates dissipates, lifting prospects for oil prices to recover. For now, dollar strength has helped hold down U.S. inflation even as unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in decades. But it has contributed to a worsening trade deficit and cut the dollar value of overseas earnings of U.S.-based companies. The United States is currently running a mix of expansionary fiscal policy (tax cuts and increased spending on the military) and a less accommodative or contractionary financial policy (rising interest rates). The consequence is an improvement in the trade-off between employment and inflation (internal balance) but a deterioration in the trade deficit (external balance). Exchange rate movements have suppressed inflation despite the booming economy but at the cost of declining international competitiveness despite tariffs. The strong dollar has posed a dilemma for the Federal Reserve: halting interest rates hikes runs the risk of pushing down the real exchange rate and pushing up inflation. (tmsnrt.rs/2Awgzge). The Trump administration and the Federal Reserve are to some extent re-running the policy mix of the Reagan administration and the central bank under Paul Volcker in the 1980s. The Reagan administration’s tax cuts and defence build-up coupled with higher interest rates caused the dollar to surge and the trade deficit to soar. The Reagan administration pressed trading partners to cut exports to the United States (especially cars, steel and electronics) and boost their currencies. Eventually, the White House pushed the Fed to adopt a more accommodative policy, triggering the departure of the chairman. It is worth noting the current U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was the deputy trade representative in the Reagan administration when it forced Japan to accept “voluntary export restraints” to curb its exports to the United States. The administration went on to press the other major economies to appreciate their currencies and depreciate the dollar as part of the Plaza Accord in 1985. The strong dollar of the early 1980s worsened the demand destruction and oversupply of oil in the early 1980s and contributed to the price crisis of 1985 and 1986. Subsequent dollar depreciation likely helped steady oil prices in the second half of the 1980s, at least it did once Saudi Arabia’s oil minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani was replaced and the kingdom abandoned netback pricing and its volume warfare strategy. Just as Japan was the target for U.S. policymakers in the 1980s complaining about unfair trading practices, China has become the target in the 2010s. The experience of the fiscal expansion, strong dollar and trade deficits of the 1980s hold important lessons for the next two years and a possible roadmap. The trade war between the United States and China has pushed both economies as well as their trading partners towards a slowdown or even a recession in 2019. As economic growth slows, both countries are likely to become increasingly eager for a negotiated solution that kickstarts business activity and raises equity prices. The worse the economic news becomes, the greater the pressure on both countries, particularly the United States which holds a presidential election in 2020, to reach a deal. Lighthizer’s involvement suggests any eventual deal with China (and deals with the European Union and other trading partners) will likely employ some combination of managed trade to reduce the deficit. Voluntary export restraints, purchases of big ticket items such as aircraft and farm products, together with selective tariffs and quotas are likely to form part of the eventual deal. U.S. negotiators will also push for structural reforms on intellectual property, subsidies and state-owned enterprises, probably even harder than they did with Japan in the 1980s. The Trump White House has already made its displeasure with the Fed over recent interest rate increases very clear. Signs of a domestic slowdown will give the central bank an opportunity to re-examine the case for further rises, or even contemplate a cut, if policymakers wish to do so, without more pressure from the White House. The White House has been vigilant over the strength of the dollar, pressing other trading partners not to depreciate their currencies further. It is not clear whether the administration will try to repeat the Plaza Accord or include exchange rate conditions in any trade with China. Even without a formal exchange rate agreement, an end to U.S. interest rate increases could halt the currency’s upward move and interest rate cuts would probably send it lower again as they did between 2009 and 2011. In the short term, lower oil prices have been an important part of global rebalancing and will support economic activity in consuming countries and ultimately buy back some demand growth in 2019. But a scenario with lower U.S. interest rates, dollar depreciation, easing trade tensions and an improving global economic outlook could ultimately help push oil prices higher. Everything hinges on whether policymakers in the United States and China can find a way to avoid further escalation of their economic war and avert a prolonged global recession.

2019-01-04,"TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian merger-and-acquisition activity is expected to strengthen in 2019 as a slump in oil prices could fuel consolidation among energy companies and cannabis deals gain momentum, M&A advisers said. Deal volume jumped 15 percent to a 12-year high of $275.2 billion in 2018, from a year ago, according to figures from Refinitiv. Buyout firms dominated big-ticket deals in the financial services, real estate and energy sectors, the data showed. While energy formed a part of deal activity, it did not make the outsized contribution seen in recent years. The sector made up about 12 percent of deals in 2018, compared with 19 percent in 2017. Some bankers expect that to change, given small and midsize companies have been struggling with the effects of lower oil prices and may be under pressure to merge. “Energy has the potential to be more active in 2019 than it was in 2018,” said David Rawlings, head of JPMorgan Canada. “Energy is going to be a bigger part of the story again.” The biggest deal of the year was the $17 billion acquisition of a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters Corp’s Financial and Risk business by a Blackstone Group-led consortium. Brookfield Asset Management was involved with the second- and third-biggest deals of 2018. Brookfield agreed to buy Johnson Controls International Plc’s batteries division for $13.2 billion and Forest City for about $11.4 billion. “Despite the level of activity we saw in 2018, global private-equity dry powder is even higher than it was last year,” said Geoff Barsky, head of Canadian and international M&A at BMO.  Barsky expects an increase in cash-based M&A as private equity firms have raised a lot of capital to put to work. The mining sector, a key part of the Canadian market, has been coming back to life, with Barrick Gold Corp’s $6.5 billion acquisition of miner Randgold Resources expected to spur more deals. “We expect the strong backdrop for mining M&A will continue,” said Grant Kernaghan, Citigroup’s managing director of Canadian investment banking. The challenge for deal activity will be elevated levels of volatility and equity market weakness. This is expected to create a disconnect between buyer and seller expectations in M&A deals, as well as possibly weigh on equity issues. “What we’re waiting for is the stable tone by which those boards and management teams feel comfortable to go to market,” said Nitin Babbar, head of Canadian equity capital markets at RBC. In 2018, Canadian equity capital markets deal volume slumped to a 14-year low as there was a dearth of major deals in the natural resource sectors.  Rima Ramchandani, co-head of the capital markets practice at Torys LLP, said “greater volatility can mean less attractive IPO pricing relative to other capital raising options.” She anticipates 2019 initial public offerings in the cannabis, healthcare, technology and consumer industries. Canada’s legalization of recreational marijuana in 2018 is expected to result in more deals, advisers said. “We’re a unique beneficiary of the federally legalized cannabis sector,” said Emmanuel Pressman, chair of the corporate department at Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt, who advised Constellation Brands on its $4 billion investment in Canopy Growth.

2019-01-04,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A technology platform launched by China’s state-run Sinochem Group last year to help create value ahead of a now-shelved share offering is slashing jobs after poor reception from the market, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said.  Sinochem Energy Technology Co Ltd, an internet-based subsidiary, was created to promote the “integration of traditional petroleum and chemical industry with emerging technologies such as cloud computing, big data, block chains, artificial intelligence, and the internet of things,” Sinochem says on its website.  But more than 300 out of about 1,000 jobs at the unit were cut at end-November, and there are plans to slash another 200 or so positions over the next few months, three sources said.  A Sinochem spokeswoman declined to comment on last year’s layoffs but said for now there is no plan for further cuts.  The job cuts came as Sinochem shelved its plan for a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) of about $2 billion for its energy business that included the technology division, after receiving unsatisfactory investor valuations during pre-marketing, Refinitiv’s IFR reported.  Under Sinochem chairman Frank Ning, who took his post in early 2016, the state group has experimented with new ways of expansion and asset management, such as creating digital platforms for energy trading and logistics services, to add value to its traditional oil and chemicals operations.  “Sinochem created the tech firm in the hope of aiding the IPO of the traditional energy business,” said a company official.  “But as it was exploring an unknown territory, the company expanded too fast too early without a very coherent strategy,” said the official, who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press.  Investors were not impressed by the way the Sinochem unit grew and spent with little prospect for immediate revenue boost, said a second Beijing-based source who was briefed by the group’s management about the scale-back.  Most of the job cuts were related to operations, marketing and customer services, while the core divisions such as data analysis and product development have been retained, said the company official.  Sinochem announced its foray into internet-based energy services in August 2017, and at the beginning of 2018 launched the new company in a tech park in Beijing, with a registered capital of 1 billion yuan  ($145 million).  “The digital platforms cover the supply chain from oil trading, refinery optimization, oil and chemicals marketing, gas station chain management ... in a push for digital revolution in petroleum and chemical industry,” Sinochem said on its website.

2019-01-04,"GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - Indian rescuers trying to reach a group of miners trapped in a remote and illegal “rat-hole” coal mine are struggling to pump out water from the 370-foot-deep pit, further dimming their chances of survival more than three weeks into their ordeal. The slow progress in the rescue efforts in the northeastern state of Meghalaya has been contrasted with the dramatic rescue of 12 Thai boys and their football coach from a flooded cave in July last year, which drew a massive international audience. The mine became flooded after at least 15 miners went down the narrow pit on Dec. 13. Rat-hole mines killed thousands of workers in Meghalaya before India’s environmental court banned the practice in early 2014. Many mines continued operation, despite the ban, requiring workers, often children, to descend hundreds of feet on bamboo ladders and dig coal out of narrow, horizontal seams. “We are continuously engaged in our efforts but the terrain and conditions out here are extremely difficult,” Santosh Kumar Singh, an assistant commandant with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), told Reuters from the site. Navy divers and NDRF personnel had not been able to reach the trapped miners, he said. Rescuers are now placing their hopes on a huge pump from state miner Coal India Ltd that is being installed on a concrete platform near the mine. India’s Supreme Court on Friday ordered the federal government and Meghalaya to file a report by Monday on the rescue operation. Meghalaya told the court on Thursday that nearly 86 people had been working on the rescue effort. At its peak, the state produced coal worth $4 billion a year, or about a tenth of India’s total production.  While the Thailand drama got round-the-clock international media coverage, the trapped miners in Meghalaya are getting very little attention, even within India. “Whole media, government and us, the common people, have completely ignored them,” one Twitter user, Rahul Sribastab, wrote. “The government, opposition and media have failed us.” Writing by Krishna N.

2019-01-04,"MUMBAI, Jan 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Ongoing efforts to reach victims of a mining disaster in northeastern India have exposed what campaigners say is poor enforcement against such illegal mines, where undocumented workers risk injury or death. At least 15 people were trapped when an illegal coal mine in Meghalaya state flooded on Dec. 13. Rescue efforts continue, although relatives said this week they had lost hope that the miners were still alive. Environmental concerns have led to India imposing bans on the mining of coal, mica and sand, among other minerals. Yet, workers across the country continue to put themselves at risk as illegal mining continues. “A ban does not mean you close your eyes to (mining). It means you physically protect (natural resources) in some way,” said Sumaira Abdulali, founder of the environmental advocacy group Awaaz Foundation. “But we never set systems in place. We would prefer for things to remain invisible.” The most recent disaster highlighted the dangers of so-called “rat-hole” mines, where workers crawl into narrow shafts on bamboo ladders to extract low-quality coal. In Meghalaya, campaigners estimate that 5,000 rat-hole mines continue to function despite a ban imposed in 2014 by India’s environmental court, the National Green Tribunal (NGT). India’s courts have ordered bans on mining various minerals, but it is up to state authorities to enforce them, according to Niranjan Kumar Singh, a joint secretary in the mining ministry. “The role of states has become important as the centre’s role is in policy making,” he said by phone. “We do not have the machinery to monitor or regulate.” But Teining Dkhar, commissioner of Meghalaya’s mining and geology department, said his state has no “regulatory mechanism” to enforce bans on illegal mining. “Only when we give a licence for mining, we ensure that all environmental and labour laws are followed,” he said by phone on Friday. Illegal mining tends to attract workers from around India and neighbouring countries who are lured by the promise of relatively high wages, but are faced with dangerous conditions once they arrive. Workers in the coal mines are promised about 2,000 rupees ($28.46) per day - more than 10 times the average Indian daily wage, said Angela Rangad of Thma U Rangli-Juki (War of the Oppressed), a collective of democracy and human rights groups. “They think they will work a few days and return. But they are never paid on time and remain trapped as they keep waiting for their wages,” said Rangad. Other workers - including children - are trafficked. When the anti-trafficking charity Impulse NGO Network surveyed rat-hole mines in Meghalaya between 2007 and 2013, it found 1,200 children, many of whom were trafficked from Nepal and Bangladesh. India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries to be a coal miner, with one miner dying every six days on average in 2017, according to government data. The number is likely even larger, as deaths in illegal mines are common but often go unreported, according to campaigners. A 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation investigation in Maharashtra state found that workers were drowning as they illegally extracted sand from the bottom of a creek near Mumbai, India’s commercial capital. The deaths were not reported and employers paid only a few families a small amount of money. In response to the revelations, the Maharashtra state government promised to end illegal mining along the creek, impose regulations, and provide alternate jobs. But a year later, sand mining was continuing and most of those promises remained unfulfilled. Campaigners said state governments need to draw up protocols on how to monitor and enforce bans against illegal mining, while the central government must follow up as well. “If the state fails to take action, the centre should intervene to check the negligence and apathy,” said Hasina Kharbhih, founder of the Impulse NGO Network, whose petition against rat-hole mines led the NGT to ban them in Meghalaya.

A final investment decision (FID) could be taken on more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year, well above the previous record of about 45 million tonnes in 2005 and triple last year’s 21 million tonnes, Wood Mackenzie’s research director for global gas and LNG, Giles Farrer, said. The new capacity would bulk out the pipeline of gas set to come on stream in coming years, adding to the more than 320 million tonnes of LNG shipped globally in 2018, according to shipping data in Refinitiv’s Eikon. “If you have seen the potential demand for LNG, you have seen costs where they are now... that is motivating companies to push projects forward and motivating buyers to come forward to support some of these projects,” Farrer said. Frontrunners this year include the $27 billion Arctic LNG 2 project by Russia’s Novatek, at least one project in Mozambique and three in the United States, Woodmac said in a report to its clients. The three potential U.S. projects are Qatar Petroleum’s Golden Pass joint-venture with Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips, Venture Global LNG’s Calcasieu Pass project, and Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass train 6, the consultancy said. Canada’s Woodfibre LNG project, developed by Singapore-based Pacific Oil and Gas, may also get the go-ahead in 2019, WoodMac said. New projects typically take several years to develop, with many of those under consideration likely to be ready to ship gas in the early 2020s if approved. A final investment decision on Golden Pass is expected by this month, while a decision on Sabine Pass 6 is expected in the first quarter and one on Calcasieu Pass is expected in the first half. Amid a plethora of potential new production from Russia, Australia, East Africa and the United States, top 2018-LNG exporter Qatar is also expanding. “Qatar is recognizing that it needs to capture demand for its LNG now, so it’s bringing forward its projects,” Farrer said. “Now is a good time to invest. If you look at industry costs, they have really come off a cliff from 2 to 3 years ago. So if you’re investing now, you’re investing in the bottom of the cost cycle,” said Farrer. Other projects awaiting FID include train 7 of Nigeria LNG, and a three-train expansion in Papua New Guinea, although some projects are widely expected to be pushed into the 2020s. Huge increases in China’s demand growth as part of a programme to shift households and factories from coal to gas, increased LNG import dependency in Europe, and a backlash against dirtier coal is driving optimism in the industry. LNG supply will already grow by an estimated record 40 million tonnes, or 13 percent, this year, potentially putting pressure on Asian LNG prices LNG-AS, currently around $9 per million British thermal units. Most of this year’s new supply will come from the United States with new trains at Cameron LNG, Corpus Christi LNG, Elba Island LNG and the Freeport LNG start-up, said Edmund Siau, analyst at FGE. In terms of demand, China continues to post strong growth while Europe could also see increases after years of stagnation, growing by about 20 million tonnes and playing a key role in absorbing new American supply, Siau said. But risks loom, especially from the U.S.-China trade war which threatens global growth which, in turn, could pull down oil and gas prices and delay or cancel FIDs, analysts said.

2019-01-04,"MARIMANTI, Kenya, Jan 4 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Stooped over knee-high rows of green gram plants at her farm in eastern Kenya, Grace Kaari hums to herself as she slices out weeds with a blunt machete. Two years ago, Kaari would not have had time to tend her crop in the morning. Instead, she would have been traveling to gather water, at a river 12 kilometres (7 miles) away. “I used to spend the whole day fetching water. I could not do anything else for the day because of tiredness,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. But a recently installed solar-powered water pump has now brought the precious resource direct to her village. And with the village water storage tanks full, she has time for the endless other tasks on her one-acre piece of land, she said. Access to clean water remains a struggle for many of rural Kenya’s poorest households, with families blaming the problem on everything from a lack of infrastructure to a lack of government commitment to help the country’s most marginalised. But some counties, such as Kaari’s Tharaka Nithi – where rural electrification is widely lacking – now are tapping solar energy to pump water to villages from nearby rivers. The water is then directed into village storage tanks where household members can fetch it free of charge. “People have been struggling with water scarcity, yet this county has three permanent rivers. The challenge was to tap water from the sources and bring it near homes,” said Jasper Nkanya, the county’s executive commissioner for agriculture, water, irrigation and fisheries. Nkanya said the county has plenty of sunshine, a resource that went untapped for years, though that is now changing. “The solar units are able to absorb energy which can be used to pump water during the day and at night” using a a battery system, he said in an interview. Established at a cost of 8 million Kenya shillings ($80,000), the solar pump project, which serves over 40,000 people, is funded by the county government, Nkanya said. Residents say easier access to water has made a difference in their lives, particularly those of women and girls, who are traditionally charged with gathering water. “My daughter used to miss school as she accompanied her mother to fetch water,” said Martin Mwiti, a motorbike taxi operator in Marimanti. Now, “her performance has improved because she is always at school”, he said. Nkanya said the government hopes to expand the project to other parts of the the county that face similar water security problems once more funds are available. Another 14 Kenyan counties also are seeing solar power put in place to boost development, including access to water, as part of a World Bank-funded effort, said Joseph Njoroge, the energy ministry’s principal secretary. “The aim is to use solar energy to bring development in marginalised parts of Kenya, including access to water, lighting and heating,” Njoroge said of the $150 million project, launched in 2017. Mbeo Ogeya, an African research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute, said the use of solar power to fuel water pumping and irrigation “can be a game changer in energy and food security for marginalised parts of Kenya”. In Marimanti, the impact of access to solar-pumped water is already becoming visible. Modern homes are gradually replacing grass-thatched huts in the area, long one of the poorest in Kenya, as easier access to water spurs new businesses, in part by freeing women’s time. Health centers now have enough stored water to ensure good hygiene while babies are delivered, while children no longer have to spend lesson time at school fetching water, said John Kibaara, a Marimanti resident. Njoroge, of the energy ministry, sees much more use of solar power ahead for Kenya. “We are looking at the potential we have, looking ahead and counting on renewable energy to supply our energy needs. This is will reduce energy costs and spur the growth of micro and medium enterprises especially in rural areas,” he said. Reporting by Kagondu Njagi ; editing by Laurie Goering :

2019-01-04,"SEOUL (Reuters) - When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year speech to highlight coal as a “primary front” in developing the economy, he was making a case for what analysts see as a flawed but key resource on which his country increasingly relies. Coal has long been a major resource for North Korea, and Kim’s call for self sufficiency in the face of international pressure is a recurring theme. But as international sanctions have increased over the past year, coal is one of the few local resources to which Kim can turn as he tries to make good on promises to improve life in a country notorious for limited electricity, analysts and defectors say. Last year Kim declared that his nuclear arsenal was “complete” and vowed to focus on building the economy. South Korea-based analysts and North Korean defectors report that with sanctions still blocking most coal exports, the North has put more of its stockpile to use domestically. “My acquaintances in North Hamgyong province told me... they got power for 14-15 hours a day in 2018, versus 8-10 hours in 2017,” said Kim Young Hui, a defector who now works as an economist at South Korea’s state-run Korea Development Bank. A “highly noticeable” increase in electricity in 2018 compared to the year before has increased power availability for many homes and boosted the operations of factories and trains, said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who now writes about North Korea for the website Daily NK and speaks to sources inside the North. “As Kim Jong Un said in the New Year speech, North Korea will focus on the domestic economy,” she said. “Instead of finding another route to sell coal, they will continue to use it domestically.” But the ageing technology is limited in how much it can contribute to the broader economy, analysts said. “Focussing on coal and electricity is a way to survive, and Kim Jong Un is trying hard to make the country a bit more self-sufficient, but (coal is) not enough to turn around the whole economy as long as exports are capped,” economist Kim Young Hui said. In the New Year speech, Kim Jong Un called for the coal industry to focus on helping power stations “normalise electricity generation without letup.” He noted that output at the country’s largest coal power plant in Pukchang had increased “remarkably” and called for more progress on a “far-reaching plan” to develop tidal, wind and atomic power. Politically and economically isolated and repressed under Kim’s authoritarian regime, North Korea has long suffered from electricity shortages. In recent years, the lack of a reliable power supply led many North Koreans to install cheap household solar panels to charge mobile phones and light their homes. During a reporting trip to Pyongyang in September, multiple North Korean sources told Reuters that more electricity could help make some of Kim’s most prized building projects usable. At some recently constructed high-rise apartment buildings, for example, potential residents fear facing dozens of flights of stairs during power outages. Electricity in North Korea is prioritised for factories or areas of political importance, but people with money or connections are often able to tap power lines illegally. A source who regularly speaks to Pyongyang residents told Reuters that pre-ordering coal for boilers was no longer necessary because it had become more abundant. “People had to book coal early, about two months before running boilers when the weather gets chilly. But thanks to reduced coal exports, it is not hard to buy it anymore after last year. Sanctions have been tougher, but North Koreans can buy coal whenever they want if they have money,” the source said.  North Korea generates nearly 50 percent of its electricity from seven coal power plants and one oil-fired plant, and the rest from hydroelectric facilities. Many of its decades-old coal plants were built by the former Soviet Union and China, according to South Korean data.  Since 2015 North Korea has been working to convert the oil power plant to coal, according to U.S.-based monitoring group 38 North. In the last year it has added generators to the biggest coal power complex and built a new hydro power plant. A 1994 deal for an international consortium to provide two light-water reactors to North Korea in exchange for its ending some of its weapons-related operations fell through. Since then, the country has been working on an experimental light water reactor. Coal exports to China fell to 4.83 million tonnes in 2017, from more than 20 million tonnes in 2016, according to Chinese data. China says it imported no North Korean coal from January to March 2018.  North Korea’s coal production rose from 2013 to 2016, but fell 30 percent to 21.66 million tonnes in 2017 from 2016, according to South Korean government data. Reliable data on North Korea’s reserves is hard to come by, but 2015 BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy reported that North Korea has 600 million tonnes of coal as proven reserves, while South Korea says the North has 20.5 billion tonnes in reserve. North Korea is known to have 4.5 billion tonnes of anthracite, a higher quality of coal, and the rest is lignite, which is mainly suitable for power plants. The North mostly exports anthracite, according to South Korean government data.  North Korea has tried unsuccessfully to circumvent sanctions by smuggling coal into China and South Korea, monitors say. “Smuggling coal into China is not easy these days as even bribes for Chinese traders have become more expensive,” said Choi Kyung-soo, head of the North Korea Resources Institute.

2019-01-04,"(Adds Asian shares, U.S. stock futures, oil prices) * Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * China-U.S. trade talks to resume on Jan. 7 * Futures price in real chance of Fed rate cut this year * Dollar off 9-mth lows vs yen, still down 1.7 pct for week * Safe-haven gold around 6-1/2 month peak By Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Asian shares found a crumb of comfort on Friday as Beijing announced a new round of trade talks with Washington, though recession fears still had markets betting the next move in U.S. interest rates might be down. Despite past disappointments, investors cheered news the U.S. and China would hold vice-ministerial level talks next week on their year-long trade dispute. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang also flagged further policy easing and support for small business. Shanghai blue chips swung 2.1 percent higher, while South Korea bounced 0.6 percent. Steadying after an overnight bruising, E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 rose 0.5 percent. The overall mood was still fragile as Japan’s Nikkei skidded 2.75 percent on its first trading day of the year, weighed by growth worries and the strength of the yen. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent, but was still down 1.8 percent at the end of another rough week. Fears that the Sino-U.S. trade war would sap world growth roiled risk-sensitive assets in 2018, driving a surge in volatility and sending major stock markets deep into the red. Analysts now expect the two economic giants to find some common ground in their dispute, with impetus possibly coming from weak stock markets on both sides. However, there are less than two months left in a short negotiating window and recent data suggests the standoff is taking an ever-greater economic toll. A survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday showed U.S. factory activity hit the brakes in December as new orders slowed sharply. The dismal report came after Chinese data on Monday showed its manufacturing activity contracted in December for the first time in more than two years. Adding to the gloom, Apple Inc cut its revenue forecast on Wednesday for the first time in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. Its shares crashed nearly 10 percent overnight. “This is more proof, if needed, that U.S. President (Donald) Trump’s trade actions against China are now hurting the U.S. as much as they are China, rather than being, as Trump would have us believe, a zero sum game where the U.S. takes the spoils at all others’ expense,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. There is “more reason to think a Sino-U.S. trade deal is in the offing in coming weeks.” Concerns about a U.S. recession had battered Wall Street overnight. The Dow shed 2.8 percent, while the S&P 500 lost 2.5 percent and the Nasdaq 3 percent. U-TURN FOR FED? The risk of a U.S. economic downturn, or even a recession, has caused a tectonic shift in expectations for interest rates with investors now pricing in the possibility of a cut. While the Fed is still projecting two more hikes this year, the futures market implies the next move will be down with around a 40 percent probability of a move by year end. The market is fully pricing in an easing to 2.00-2.25 percent by May next year, from the current range of 2.25-2.50 percent. The mounting speculation sent yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries as low as 2.37 percent, taking them under the effective federal funds rate for the first time since 2008. They were last trading at 2.42 percent. Three- and five-year yields were even lower, an inversion that has sometimes heralded recessions in the past. Yields on 10-year benchmark paper dropped to 2.55 percent overnight, a staggering turnaround from the highs of 3.25 percent seen as recently as November. The decline has been a drag on the dollar, especially against the low-yielding yen.  The greenback plumbed a more than nine-month low of 105.25 against the yen on Thursday, driven partly by technical factors. It had bounced to 108.32 by Friday, but was still down 1.7 percent on the week so far. The dollar was a shade firmer on basket of currencies at 96.357, while the euro held steady at $1.1391. Keeping with the risk-off theme, gold hit a 6-1/2-month peak of $1,298.42 an ounce on Friday. Oil prices wavered either side of flat after another volatile week. U.S. light crude added 19 cents to $47.28 a barrel, while Brent rose 16 cents to $56.11. Reporting by Swati Pandey and Wayne Cole; Editing by Sam

2019-01-04,"* Inventories climb: tmsnrt.rs/2GU0ExS * Surge comes amid high supplies, concerns of demand slowdown (Recasts lead, adds analyst comments in paragraph 4, 6-7) By Roslan Khasawneh and Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Light distillate fuel stocks at Asia’s refining hub in Singapore have climbed to a record on surging supply just as fears emerge of an economic downturn heading into 2019, but holiday demand and refinery maintenance could lend some relief. Light distillate stocks in Singapore, which include the key transportation fuel gasoline and important petrochemical feedstock naphtha, rose by 1.47 million barrels in the week to Jan. 2, to a record 16.1 million barrels, according to data from Enterprise Singapore released on Friday. The record comes on soaring supply from refineries across Asia, including China where exports have surged amid a broad expansion of the country’s refining capacity. A slow-down in demand growth in key consumers such as China and India has also contributed to growing gasoline supplies, said Matthew Chew, principal oil analyst at IHS Markit in Singapore. Weighed down by excess supply and sluggish demand, gasoline producers began losing money from gasoline after Asia’s benchmark gasoline margin GL92-SIN-CRK in December turned negative. The benchmark has since recouped some losses. “We expect the weakness to persist in January but there could be some relief in February with higher seasonal demand during Lunar New Year (Feb. 5-6) easing some of the oversupply,” said Chew. “Planned refinery maintenance season thereafter could also help.” However, traders said a slowdown in economic growth and, by extension also in fuel and petrochemical consumption, could keep inventories elevated. “If factory utilisation rates fall, then purchases of raw materials like petrochemical feedstocks will also weaken,” Singapore-based shipping brokerage Eastport said on Friday. Data for December from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday showed the broadest U.S. slowdown in growth for more than a decade, as the trade conflict with China, falling equity prices and increasing uncertainty started to take a toll on the world’s biggest economy.

2019-01-04,"QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador’s President Lenin Moreno on Thursday asked the country’s prosecutor to probe $4.9 billion (3.9 billion pounds) of oil-related infrastructure projects, alleging that the OPEC nation’s money was looted during the decade-long tenure of his leftist predecessor. Moreno said there were massive cost overruns, operational failings and non-transparent bidding processes at the five projects built during Rafael Correa’s presidency, including a $2.2 billion upgrade to the Esmeraldas refinery.  “Nearly $5 billion of Ecuadoreans’ money, when it should have cost half that,” Moreno said in a national broadcast. “This theft of public funds cannot go unpunished.” Moreno took office in May 2017 after earning Correa’s endorsement during the campaign, but the two later fell out over Moreno’s market-friendly policies. Last year, Moreno asked a United Nations unit to conduct a technical and economic review of the five projects undertaken by the previous administration. Correa has denied allegations of corruption in his administration, calling them a political smear campaign. He lives in Belgium and has not returned to Ecuador since a judge last year ordered that he be jailed as part of a case involving the kidnapping of a lawmaker, in which he denies involvement. The other projects Moreno mentioned included a natural gas liquefaction plant, a seaport, a fuel distribution centre, a pipeline and a partly-built refinery that has run out of financing after receiving some $1.5 billion in investment.

But nerves were soothed somewhat by news that the United States and China would hold vice-ministerial level talks next week on their trade dispute, with the Chinese blue-chip index turning 0.4 percent higher. U.S. stock futures, which had slipped in early Asian trade, also reversed early losses. E-Minis for the S&P 500 edged up 0.1 percent while Nasdaq futures climbed 0.2 percent. Japanese shares skidded on their first trading day of the year on Friday, with the Nikkei spiralling about 3.6 percent lower on growth worries and a sharp jump in the yen. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.1 percent lower to near two-month lows, weighed by a drop of about 1 percent in Australian shares. Fears that the Sino-U.S. trade war would drag down world growth roiled risk-sensitive assets in 2018, driving a surge in volatility and sending major stock markets deep into the red. Analysts now expect the two economic giants to find some common ground in their dispute, with added impetus possibly coming from a run of disappointing data and weak stock market on both sides. However, there are less than two months left in a short negotiating window. Data this week showed a marked loss of momentum in the world’s two largest economies. Thursday’s survey data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December. The dismal ISM report came after Chinese data on Monday showed its manufacturing activity contracted in December for the first time in more than two years. Adding to the gloom, Apple Inc cut its revenue forecast on Wednesday for the first time in nearly 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China. Its shares crashed nearly 10 percent overnight. “This is more proof, if needed, that U.S. President (Donald) Trump’s trade actions against China are now hurting the U.S. as much as they are China; rather than being, as Trump would have us belief, a zero sum game where the U.S. takes the spoils at all others’ expense,” said Ray Attrill, head of forex strategy at National Australia Bank. There is “more reason to think a Sino-US trade deal is in the offing in coming weeks.” The spectre of a deep economic downturn in the United States, or even a recession, spooked global investors who flocked away from risky equities to the safety of bonds. Investors had expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to stay on its tightening path after three hikes last year, but the trade war and recent disappointing data have put those expectations to rest. Investors are now fully pricing in a rate cut to 2.00-2.25 percent by April next year. The December Fed funds contract implies a cash rate of 2.23 percent, below the current 2.25-2.50 percent and expectations of 3 percent just a couple of months ago. In response, U.S. Treasuries rallied with yields on two-year paper sinking below 2.4 percent to reach parity with the federal funds effective rate for the first time since 2008. Three- and five-year yields were even lower, an inversion that has sometimes heralded recessions in the past. Yields on 10-year benchmark paper dropped to 2.55 percent overnight, a staggering turnaround from the highs of 3.25 percent seen as recently as November. The falls kept the dollar on the defensive. The greenback plumbed a more than nine-month low of 105.25 against the safe-haven yen on Thursday, driven by technical factors amid thin holiday trade. It has fallen more than 2 percent so far this week, the biggest weekly loss since last February, and was last at 107.93. “The ISM has a long track-record and big moves often prove to be meaningful. The December drop therefore gives pause, even to us economic optimists,” said Michelle Girard, U.S. economist at RBS.. “Now...a closely-watched indicator is flashing yellow, putting ourselves, and likely the Fed, on higher alert.” Concerns about a U.S. recession battered Wall Street overnight, with the Dow skidding 2.8 percent, the S&P 500 down 2.5 percent and Nasdaq losing more than 3 percent. Keeping with the risk-off theme, gold hit a 6-1/2-month peak of $1,298.42 an ounce on Friday. U.S. light crude slid 15 cents to $46.94 a barrel but held slightly above a 1-1/2 year trough touched just last month. Brent slipped 27 cents to $55.68.

2019-01-04,"(Repeats JAN. 3 story. No change to text.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Sy98Mh By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers reported the broadest slowdown in growth last month for more than a decade, as the trade conflict with China, falling equity prices and increasing uncertainty finally started to take a toll on the economy. The Institute for Supply Management’s purchasing managers’ index slumped by 5.2 points in December from the previous month, the largest monthly fall since October 2008 (tmsnrt.rs/2Sy98Mh). Manufacturers reported increases in orders, output, employment and inventories, indicating the sector continues to expand, but at a much slower rate than before, according to survey results published on Thursday. The new orders component slumped by 11 points and remained barely above the 50-point threshold that divides expanding activity from a contraction, suggesting the loss of momentum could extend into early 2019. Major U.S. equity indices have been trending lower for months, suggesting investors were anxious about the earnings outlook, even as the purchasing managers survey continued to point to strong expansion. That contradiction has now been resolved - with the decline in the survey results confirming the signal coming from the equity markets. Until recently, the United States had appeared immune to the slowdown in growth evident in most other major economies since the middle of 2018. But the loss of momentum reported at the end of last year shows the economy is not immune from broader global trends. The slowdown in the United States is consistent with other indicators suggesting a significant deceleration in global export orders and trade flows. Oil prices and calendar spreads have been falling since October, as traders anticipate weaker consumption growth in 2019. Through tariffs, sanctions and other actions that have heightened uncertainty for businesses, policymakers have taken the expansion for granted and pushed the global economy to the brink of a slowdown. Unless they reverse course and start adopting a more business-friendly approach, a further global slowdown or even a recession is more likely than not in 2019.

2019-01-04,"* U.S. factory activity follows Asia into downturn * Global stock markets pulled down by trade war concerns * Start of OPEC oil supply cuts provides some support By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 4 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell on Friday after the United States showed signs of following Asia into an economic slowdown, although crude supply withdrawals by producer club OPEC prevented prices from dropping even further. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $46.82 per barrel at 0024 GMT, down 27 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude futures had yet to trade. Data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Thursday showed U.S. factory activity slowed more than expected in December, mirroring similar data releases in Asia over the past week. The slowdown comes over concerns that the trade war between the United States and China will drag down economic growth, triggering a surge in volatility and sending major stock markets deep into the red. Despite this, oil prices are expected to receive some support as supply cuts announced late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) start to kick in. OPEC oil supply fell by 460,000 barrels per day (bpd) between November and December, to 32.68 million bpd, a Reuters survey found on Thursday, as top exporter Saudi Arabia made an early start to a supply-limiting accord, while Iran and Libya posted involuntary declines. OPEC, Russia and other non-members - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed last December to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 versus October 2018 levels. OPEC’s share of that cut is 800,000 bpd. “If OPEC is faithful to its agreed output cut together with non-OPEC partners, it would take 3-4 months to mop up the excess inventories,” energy consultancy FGE said. Considering the planned cuts versus ongoing increases in U.S. crude production, which hit a record 11.7 million bpd by late 2018, FGE said it expected Brent prices to range between $55-$60 per barrel in the first months of 2019.

Investors had initially expected the policy tightening to continue through this year but the ongoing trade war and recent disappointing corporate earnings have put those expectations to rest. The interest rates futures market also reacted sharply on Thursday with the December Fed funds contract surging 18 ticks to 97.77, implying a cash rate of just 2.23 percent. A couple of months ago, it was pricing in a rate of 3 percent. Investors now see rates at 2.00 percent by the middle of next year. “Whether this pessimism continues for the rest of 2019 will largely depend on whether there is a near-term resolution to the trade war,” said Tapas Strickland, markets strategist for National Australia Bank. “Some sort of truce should be more likely given recent market developments – data including the ISM suggests both China and the US will slow in 2019, effectively giving (the United States and China) little choice but to seek a truce.” Concerns about a U.S. recession whacked Wall Street overnight, with the Dow skidding 2.8 percent, the S&P 500 down 2.5 percent and Nasdaq losing more than 3 percent.
