2019-02-05,"NEW YORK, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Plains All American Pipeline LP said on Tuesday it expects the reversed Capline crude pipeline, from the U.S. Midwest to the Gulf Coast, to begin service in the third quarter of 2020. The target in-service date for the reversed line is third quarter 2020 for light oil service and early 2022 for heavy oil service, the company said on its quarterly earnings call with analysts. “The capacity from Cushing (Oklahoma) down to St. James (Louisiana) should be available on a quicker time frame than heavy moving down from Patoka (Illinois),” Chief Executive Officer Willie Chiang said on the call. Pending a successful open season, in which companies gauge shipper interest for the proposal, the Cushing to St. James movement would include a 200,000 barrel a day of expansion and a modest extension of the Diamond JV pipeline that will connect to Capline, Plains said. Capline is the largest crude pipeline that currently runs from the Gulf Coast to refineries in the Midwest. Volumes on Capline, once a major artery for imports and Gulf of Mexico crude used by U.S. Midwest refiners, have declined sharply as the U.S. shale boom pushed inland crude to the East Coast and Gulf Coast. The company said it is also making progress on its Cactus II pipeline with partial service expected in late third quarter of 2019 and full service plan by April 2020. Plains said its Corpus Christi, Texas and St. James facilities could both could explored further for crude export capabilities. “We think we’re the best solution to get barrels to the coast and what we strive to do is to have connectivity to the many, many docks that are being expanded to be able to get access to water ... so far there’s been a lot of interest in us being able to get connections,” Chiang said. Plains has previously said it was monitoring demand for building a crude export facility capable of handling supertankers. Several midstream companies have announced multimillion-dollar crude terminals along the Gulf Coast looking to take advantage of a surge in U.S. crude exports. Plains said it has a 20 percent ownership interest in the joint venture with ExxonMobil and Lotus Midstream for a pipeline system that is expected to provide more than 1 million barrels per day of crude and condensate capacity from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. Plains expects a net 2019 capital investment of about $250 million towards the project.

2019-02-05,"(Adds details from earnings release, context) HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Roughly 20 percent of the hydraulic fracturing fleets that were active in mid-2018 have now been idled or are being idled, as lower oil prices prompt producers to tighten their budgets, Liberty Oilfield Services Inc estimated on Tuesday. The company in its fourth-quarter earnings said a number of customers made last-minute decisions to defer well completions, in part because of a drop in oil prices at the end of last year. U.S. oil prices fell by almost 40 percent in the fourth quarter of last year amid concerns of growing supply and slowing economic growth. The steep decline has negatively impacted many oilfield service companies that are still working to recover from the 2014 price crash. Liberty said its customers are still finalizing budgets for 2019 and that it expected more clarity on 2019 completions demand by the end of the first quarter. The company reported a fourth-quarter profit of 27 cents per share, missing analysts’ estimates of 31 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Fourth-quarter revenues of $473 million also missed consensus estimates of $496.9 million.

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices slipped on Tuesday, falling from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market, and a stronger dollar also weighed.  Prices sagged after a survey showed euro zone business expansion nearly stalled in January. That, coupled with disappointing U.S. factory orders data a day earlier, stoked worries about softer demand, analysts said.  Brent crude futures fell 53 cents to settle at $61.98 a barrel. They touched their highest level in more than two months at $63.63 the previous day. U.S. crude futures dropped 90 cents to settle at $53.66 a barrel, or down 1.7 percent.  Futures held lower after the close, when the American Petroleum Institute said U.S. crude stocks rose by 2.5 million barrels last week, more than analyst expectations. Oil also felt pressure from a strengthening dollar, which rallied for a fourth straight session, which makes crude more expensive for non-U.S. buyers. “It really seemed to be a dollar influence here today,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management. “It was interesting that we didn’t catch a bid along with the stock market because that had been the correlation.”  Investors were shifting assets into equities and away from markets more sensitive to Washington-Beijing trade relations and movements in the dollar, said Phillip Streible, senior commodities strategist at RJO Futures.  “Oil is just not in favor today, and they are going after the equity markets,” he said. Wall Street was slightly higher on Tuesday. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have been viewed as supportive of prices by helping tighten global supplies. Numerous tankers are currently in the water off the Venezuelan coast, unable to move because state-owned PDVSA is demanding payment, which would run afoul of U.S. sanctions. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed to production cuts effective from last month to beat back supply growth. A Reuters survey found that supply from OPEC states had fallen the most in two years.  Concerns about the pace of global economic growth were fanned by a weak start for the year for euro zone businesses. A Tuesday survey showed demand declined for the first in over four years.  New orders for U.S.-made goods fell unexpectedly in November, according to data released a day earlier.

2019-02-05,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Holiday airline Germania collapsed on Tuesday and canceled all flights immediately, the latest to succumb to turbulence in the European airline industry as it failed to secure financing to navigate a short-term cash squeeze. The insolvency of the German company, which carried about 4 million passengers a year, followed the failure of Germany’s second-biggest carrier, Air Berlin, in 2017. Britain’s Monarch Airlines and Alitalia also filed for insolvency in 2017. German charter carrier Small Planet Airlines hit financial trouble last year after an expansion drive.  Germania cited rising fuel prices, a stronger dollar, delays in integrating new aircraft into its fleet and high maintenance costs. “Unfortunately, we were ultimately unable to bring our financing efforts to cover a short-term liquidity need to a positive conclusion,” Chief Executive Officer Karsten Balke said in a statement. The carrier’s 37 aircraft mainly flew German sun-seekers to more than 60 destinations in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. The Berlin-based company, founded in 1986, also offered flights to less conventional destinations including Iran, Iraq and Armenia.  It said all flights had been halted overnight after it filed for bankruptcy late on Monday. A spokesman for the airline’s administrators said it was unclear whether operations could resume and whether the company could continue. CEO Balke thanked Germania’s staff and apologized to passengers who had booked directly and would not be entitled to alternative flights. A Germania spokesman declined to comment on the number of passengers or staff affected. “I have no idea whether we are going to be put on another flight or whether we can book our own new flight through another carrier. No idea,” passenger Iris Fenske told Reuters TV at Duesseldorf airport. The Federal Association of the German Aviation Industry said other airlines, including Condor, Tui Group’s TUIfly and those belonging to the Lufthansa Group, would offer stranded Germania passengers special rates to return to Germany. Tour operators will organize alternative travel arrangements for holidaymakers who have booked package deals, the German Travel Association (DRV) said.  Germany’s Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, a conservative, said he had no specific plans to offer help to Germania, adding the government would watch the situation closely. The Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition, vowed to push for creation of a European system to protect passengers in the event of bankruptcies, the Handelsblatt newspaper reported late Tuesday. “The new EU commission and the new European parliament must tackle this urgent problem,” it quoted the party’s legal spokesman, Johannes Fechner, as saying. “The horror for German air travelers continues,” Klaus Mueller, head of the Federation of German Consumer Organisations, said of the airline’s demise. On Monday, Europe’s largest budget airline Ryanair, posted its first quarterly loss since 2014 and said it expects further consolidation over the next 12-18 months because of overcapacity. It predicted a further rise in oil prices would hit smaller airlines that cannot afford to increase their oil price hedging. In a video message on Twitter, Ryanair’s chief operating officer on Tuesday said the airline will offer Germania pilots, engineers and cabin crew “immediate” starts if they apply for vacancies in Germany, Austria and across Europe.  Germania’s financial problems emerged at the start of January when it said it was examining several financing options to secure short-term liquidity. On Jan. 19 it said it had a commitment for 15 million euros ($17 million) in funding that would secure its medium- and long-term future, but at the end of last week it confirmed media reports that it had delayed paying wages.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp said on Tuesday they are investing in a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, as companies race to meet global demand for the fuel. Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin early this year. The project will add production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024. Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.   “Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said of the final investment decision. Woods and Qatar Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi signed the deal at the Four Seasons hotel in Washington in the presence of U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry. The deal is proof that two of the world’s top energy producers can work together and “support rather than subvert an open energy marketplace,” Perry said. The Trump administration has promoted gas drilling and LNG exports in part to offer European customers alternatives to piped natural gas from Russia, while slashing Obama-era environmental regulations on energy operations. “To understand how critical this is, imagine how Europe feels when the winter winds begin to blow and Russia has its hand on the pipe valve,” Perry said. Russia has in recent years slashed gas shipments to Europe through Ukraine during pricing disputes. Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds 70 percent. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique.  Exxon has signed an agreement to buy a 12.4 percent interest in the existing terminal and a pipeline from ConocoPhillips, and the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals, both companies said.   The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-24. Qatar left the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country. Energy industry construction firm McDermott International Inc and its partners, Chiyoda International Corp and Zachry Group, have won a contract worth more than $1 billion to build the export project, McDermott said separately on Tuesday. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year.

2019-02-05,"(Adds comment from EQT, recasts) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Two of the founders of Rice Energy, which EQT Corp bought in 2017, are pushing for a change in the company’s strategy and replacement of its board due to its ongoing underperformance. Appalachian-focused EQT acquired rival Rice Energy for $6.7 billion, making it the largest natural gas producer in the United States. However, its share price has tumbled more than 30 percent since the merger, which brothers Toby and Derek Rice blame on operational and managerial mismanagement. In a presentation to shareholders on Tuesday, the brothers proposed appointing Toby Rice, former chief operating officer of Rice Energy, as the company’s new chief executive. When EQT released its 2019 guidance in January, the brothers said they would challenge the board in a shareholder ballot. The brothers, who own around 3 percent of EQT, said in their presentation they could improve EQT’s free cash flow by $500 million per year. They proposed streamlining aspects of the organization, digitizing workflows, and improving planning to reduce well costs. A spokeswoman for EQT said on Tuesday the company disagreed with the analysis put forward by the Rices and that the firm looked forward to continued discussions with shareholders. “EQT remains focused on reducing costs and generating substantial free cash flow to create further value for EQT shareholders,” she added. Shares of EQT were down 2.4 percent to $19.31 in afternoon trading on Tuesday and are off 28 percent in the past 52 weeks. EQT’s average Marcellus well cost for a 12,000-foot lateral was $1,250 per foot in 2018, while Rice Energy, before its merger with EQT, averaged $790 per foot for wells with laterals reaching 8,800 feet in the same region, according to the Rice presentation. The brothers also said EQT has “erroneously adjusted downwards” its well costs. In a presentation, the brothers said operations could be improved by altering well designs to include more sand, water and stages per foot. The presentation also said they had initiated dialogue with EQT to improve its business, but claimed those suggestions have been ignored, prompting it to bring their concerns to shareholders. The Rice brothers owns 7.5 million shares in EQT, worth more than $145 million. Reporting by Liz Hampton

2019-02-05,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stocks rose to a fresh two-month high on Tuesday to keep up their fast start to 2019 while the U.S. dollar strengthened for a fourth straight session as investors looked toward an annual address by the U.S. president later in the evening. Boosted by U.S. and European equity performance, MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.64 percent, increasing for a sixth straight session as it hit a two-month high.  President Donald Trump was due to give his State of the Union speech at 2100 ET (0200 GMT), with investors awaiting indications of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and watching for signs of tensions with Democrats following a 35-day partial federal government shutdown. The Federal Reserve’s dovish recent statement on interest rate policy, along with optimism over U.S.-China tensions, has fueled recent risk appetite, even as estimates for U.S. corporate earnings have been falling. “We could move significantly higher if the geopolitical environment improves, and we could also decline if things break down,” said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. “There will be lots of hints tonight about the U.S. political landscape.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 172.15 points, or 0.68 percent, to 25,411.52, the S&P 500 gained 12.83 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,737.7 and the Nasdaq Composite added 54.55 points, or 0.74 percent, to 7,402.08. Shares of Estée Lauder Cos and Ralph Lauren reacted favorably to the companies’ respective quarterly reports. “The main focus of the market has just been that people are getting more comfortable that the prices for stocks are reasonable,” said Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments in New Vernon, New Jersey. Fourth-quarter earnings for companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index were on track to have climbed 15.8 percent, but profit in the first quarter is now expected to rise by only 0.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.41 percent, helped by a recovery in banks and a solid update from BP. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.21 percent, up for a fourth straight session, with the euro down 0.23 percent to $1.1409. Continued recovery in investors’ appetite for risk taking exerted pressure on safe-haven currencies, dragging the Swiss franc to an 11-week low against the dollar.    U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors priced in the Fed’s dovish interest rate outlook amid an uncertain global economic outlook. “Yields are consolidating around levels that are more consistent with the new position at the Fed,” that it could effectively hold rates steady over the next six months, said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.7001 percent, from 2.724 percent late Monday.    Oil prices pulled back from two-month highs as concerns over a global economic slowdown crept back into the market and a stronger dollar also weighed.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has sent food and medicine to Colombia’s border with Venezuela, U.S. officials said on Tuesday, although it is still unclear how the aid will get past the objections of President Nicolas Maduro, who has blocked shipments in the past. Two officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the aid will be staged at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta. One official said more supplies would be staged in Brazil and in the Caribbean. “I anticipate having perhaps a dozen locations all around Venezuela where such aid will be staged,” the official said. The U.S. officials said trucks carrying the aid, including high-protein foods, would arrive in Cucuta this week at the request of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself to be the South American nation’s interim president. Opposition lawmaker Miguel Pizarro told reporters in Caracas on Tuesday that Guaido’s team would talk about how the aid would move once it was in place. Shipments were also coming from Venezuelan companies abroad, Colombia, Canada and Germany. A senior U.S. administration official said it was up to Guaido to decide when and how to move the supplies into the country. “We will seek to help him to do so by whatever means possible,” the official said. Prepositioning aid in warehouses or in truck convoys at border posts for weeks, or sometimes months, is common while officials negotiate safe passage. Franklin Graham, chief executive of relief group Samaritan’s Purse and the son of renowned Christian evangelist Billy Graham, said until humanitarian groups had access inside Venezuela, most aid likely would remain outside. Samaritan’s Purse has operated for the past three years in Cucuta, giving food, medicine and backpacks to Venezuelans heading to Colombia on foot. The group also has managed to get a small amount of aid inside the country, which Graham called “a drop in the bucket” compared to what is needed. “The government of Venezuela needs to open the borders, that’s it: Open the borders and let food convoys come into your country, open up your airports and let food flights fly in,” said Graham, who said he spoke to U.S. President Donald Trump about the situation in December. “We are preparing to fly in as soon as we get the green light,” he said. The Cucuta crossing was mainly quiet on Tuesday, but police officials told Reuters that more migrants have been asking where humanitarian aid will be delivered. In the nearby border town of La Parada, hundreds of people, some in wheelchairs, lined up in the hot sun to buy medicine. Maria Gomez, a 53-year-old seamstress, arrived from San Cristobal in northern Venezuela to buy her elderly mother the Losartan pills she needs for hypertension. “It’s cheap here, I always come,” she said as a pharmacist handed over the pills. “We cannot buy drugs in Venezuela, you die before you get them.” Pressure is growing on Maduro to step down after more than a dozen European Union nations on Monday joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognising Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. However Russia, China and Turkey continue to back Maduro, accusing Western nations of meddling. The 35-year-old Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, has galvanized the opposition with a hopeful message. He has repeatedly called on Venezuela’s military, which has remained loyal to Maduro, to support a transition to democracy. The United States could attempt to seek the approval of the United Nations Security Council to deliver aid without Maduro’s cooperation, but Russia would likely block such a move. So far, Maduro has rejected foreign aid. “We are not beggars. You want to humiliate Venezuela, and I will not let our people be humiliated,” he said on Monday. Maduro’s government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations for recognising Guaido, accusing them of submitting to a U.S. “strategy to overthrow the legitimate government.” With Maduro in control of Venezuela’s military and all the territory, getting aid in will be hard, said Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, who cautioned against politicizing the assistance. “The more it looks like an overt attack on the authority of Maduro, that makes the aid more of a target,” said Konyndyk, who has led U.S. government responses to international disasters.

The Federal Reserve’s dovish recent statement on interest rate policy, along with optimism over U.S.-China tensions, has fueled recent risk appetite, even as estimates for U.S. corporate earnings have been falling. “Despite the State of the Union tonight, investors seem increasingly certain that we are going to avoid any escalation of the trade tensions with China and avoid another government shutdown,” said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. “Investors are viewing policy considerations offsetting falling earnings expectations,” Kleintop said. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 99.25 points, or 0.39 percent, to 25,338.62, the S&P 500 gained 2.88 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,727.75 and the Nasdaq Composite added 24.91 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,372.44. Shares of Estée Lauder Cos and Ralph Lauren reacted favorably to the companies’ respective quarterly reports. Fourth-quarter earnings for companies on the benchmark S&P 500 index were on track to have climbed 15.8 percent, but profit in the first quarter is now expected to rise by only 0.4 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The pan-European STOXX 600 index added 1.41 percent, helped by a recovery in banks and a solid update from BP. The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.17 percent, up for a fourth straight session, with the euro down 0.17 percent to $1.1415. Continued recovery in investors’ appetite for risk taking exerted pressure on safe-haven currencies, dragging the Swiss franc to an 11-week low against the dollar. U.S. Treasury yields fell as investors started to price in the Fed’s dovish interest rate outlook amid an uncertain global economic outlook. “Yields are consolidating around levels that are more consistent with the new position at the Fed which is ... it is effectively on hold at least in the next six months,” said John Herrmann, rates strategist at MUFG Securities in New York. Benchmark U.S. 10-year notes last rose 7/32 in price to yield 2.6983 percent, from 2.724 percent late Monday. Oil prices pulled back from two-month highs after weak U.S. factory orders data rekindled economic slowdown worries. U.S. crude fell 1.43 percent to $53.78 per barrel and Brent was last at $62.10, down 0.66 percent. Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss and Saqib

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar Petroleum and Exxon Mobil Corp will proceed with a $10 billion project to expand a liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plant in Texas, Exxon said on Tuesday.  Construction of the Golden Pass LNG project, in Sabine Pass, Texas, is expected to begin in early 2019. The project will add  production capacity of around 16 million tonnes of LNG per year after it starts up in 2024. Reuters had first reported details of the deal on Feb. 1, based on sources familiar with the matter.   “Golden Pass will provide an increased, reliable, long-term supply of liquefied natural gas to global gas markets, stimulate local growth and create thousands of jobs,” said Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods in a press release. Executives from Exxon and Qatar Petroleum were due to make a joint announcement with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry Tuesday afternoon, the Energy Department said on Monday. Worldwide consumption of LNG is expected to more than double to 550 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by 2030, triggering a race among oil and gas companies eager to dominate the market. The expansion is part of Qatar Petroleum’s plans to invest about $20 billion (15 billion pounds) in the United States as the company seeks to increase its overseas oil and gas business.  Qatar, a tiny but wealthy country, is one of the most influential players in the LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes. It plans to boost capacity 43 percent by 2023-2024. Currently, Exxon has a 30 percent stake in Golden Pass and Qatar Petroleum holds a 70 percent stake. The two have been strengthening a global alliance across LNG projects from the United States to Mozambique. The Golden Pass project is one of many that could be approved this year. Companies are expected to make final decisions on projects that could add more than 60 million tonnes per annum of LNG capacity this year. Qatar left the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries last year, allowing it to expand in the United States without concerns about proposed legislation that could limit OPEC members’ investments in the country.

2019-02-05,"(Adds vote count, comment from environmental group) By Humeyra Pamuk WASHINGTON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - A key Senate committee approved U.S. President Donald Trump’s new pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday, putting the former coal lobbyist a step closer to becoming the permanent head of America’s top environmental regulator. Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler, a Washington insider with years of experience in Congress, was nominated by Trump last month to replace Scott Pruitt, who resigned in July after widespread criticism for alleged ethical missteps. His nomination has cheered business interests keen to see reduced regulation, but upset Democrats and conservation groups worried that environmental rollbacks under the Trump administration are going too far. The Republican-controlled U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works advanced Wheeler’s nomination with 11 Republican members in favor and 10 Democrats against. A full Senate vote must now be scheduled to complete his confirmation. “Mr. Wheeler has done an outstanding job as the acting administrator over the past six months,” Republican Senator John Barrasso, chairman of the committee, said. Shelley Moore Capito, Republican Senator from West Virginia, said Wheeler worked to improve transparency at the agency. Wheeler was not present at the meeting. Democratic Senators questioned Wheeler’s years of past experience serving for the interests of the industries that he would be regulating. “In many instances, Mr. Wheeler has gone further than his predecessor in his rejection of important measures,” Democrat Senator Tom Carper, ranking member of the committee, said in his opening remarks. While running EPA on an interim basis, Wheeler oversaw the weakening of Obama-era rules limiting carbon and mercury emissions from power plants, and advanced an initiative to lift a summertime ban on higher ethanol blends of gasoline that was enacted to curb smog. Like Pruitt, he held nearly 20 times more meetings with industry representatives than with conservationists during his first two months on the job, according to a copy of his schedule reviewed by Reuters. And during his confirmation hearing last month, he said he did not believe climate change was not a major crisis - a stance that resonates with Trump’s skepticism but which clashes with the scientific consensus that global warming will have devastating consequences if not addressed urgently. “Andrew Wheeler is ... a coal lobbyist masquerading as the EPA Administrator,” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said in a statement.

2019-02-05,"KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwanda said on Tuesday it had signed a $400 million deal to produce bottled gas from Lake Kivu, which emits such dense clouds of methane it is known as one of Africa’s “Killer Lakes”.  The project by Gasmeth Energy, owned by U.S. and Nigerian businessmen and Rwandans, would suck gas from the lake’s deep floor and bottle it for use as fuel. This should, in turn, help prevent toxic gas bubbling to the surface.  The seven-year deal, signed on Friday, was announced on Tuesday. Rwanda already has two companies that extract gas from Lake Kivu to power electricity plants.  Clare Akamanzi, chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, told Reuters bottled methane would help cut local reliance on wood and charcoal, the fuels most households and tea factories use in the East African nation of 12 million people.     “We expect to have affordable gas which is environmentally friendly,” she said. “We expect that people can use gas instead of charcoal, the same with industries like tea factories instead of using firewood, they use gas. It’s part of our green agenda.” The deep waters of Lake Kivu, which lies in the volcanic region on Rwanda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo, emit such dense clouds of methane that scientists fear they might erupt, killing those living along its shore.  Eruptions from much smaller methane-emitting lakes in Cameroon, one causing a toxic cloud and another sparking an explosion, killed a total of nearly 1,800 people. The shores of Lake Kivu are much more densely populated.  Gasmeth Energy said it would finance, build and maintain a gas extraction, processing and compression plant to sell methane domestically and abroad. The bottled gas should be on sale within two years, Akamanzi said, adding that prices had yet to be determined.

2019-02-05,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft said on Tuesday the political upheaval in Venezuela was only temporary, while the country had cut its debt, and expected its own total oil output to grow in 2019.  Kremlin-controlled Rosneft’s operations in Venezuela have come into focus as the country has plunged into political turmoil and the United States imposed sanctions on state oil company PDVSA last week. PDVSA is paying debt back to Rosneft via oil supplies.  Rosneft’s operations in Venezuela have come to public attention amid a power struggle between the National Assembly and pro-Moscow President Nicolas Maduro. In a presentation on its website, Rosneft said Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA’s principal amount of debt to Rosneft stood at $2.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter, down from $3.1 billion at the end of the previous three months. The company does not expect oil output to decline at its projects in Venezuela this year, Rosneft’s First Vice President Eric Liron said on a conference call, adding that the company saw the current situation in Venezuela as temporary. Venezuela’s own oil production has plummeted due to years of underinvestment and weak oil prices. Earlier on Tuesday, Rosneft, in which BP controls a 19.75 percent stake, said its net profit fell by almost a quarter to 109 billion rubles ($1.7 billion) in the fourth quarter, hit by weaker oil prices.  Rosneft is the first Russian oil and gas producer to report results for 2018, the first year of annual losses for oil prices since 2015.  Rosneft said the production of liquid hydrocarbons in the fourth quarter stood at 4.79 million barrels per day, up 1.4 percent from the third quarter. The company expects its crude oil and gas condensate to grow by 3 percent to 4.5 percent this year, depending on the implementation of a global oil output deal in the first half of the year. Rosneft also said its fourth-quarter revenue fell 5.3 percent quarter on quarter to 2.2 trillion rubles, while earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 24.1 percent to 488 billion rubles, hit by increased spending by the end of the year along with higher export taxes and lower oil prices.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Moves by the European Commission to make Britain charge value-added tax on commodity derivatives trading will include ICE Futures Europe, the London Platinum and Palladium Market (LPPM) and the London Metal Exchange (LME), trading sources say. The Commission has been looking at zero-rated VAT on commodity derivatives trading in the UK for some years, but sources say recent activity is part of a drive to pressure Britain ahead of its European Union withdrawal in March. Last month, the Commission referred Britain to the European Court of Justice for extending the scope of measures that allow commodity derivatives traded on “terminal markets” in the UK to be zero rated for VAT. “(The) referral follows the United Kingdom’s failure to bring its legislation into line with EU VAT law following the Commission’s reasoned opinion in July 2018,” the Commission, executive arm of the EU, said on its website. If Britain leaves the EU without an exit deal, there will be no case to answer. But any deal that keeps the UK subject to EU rules could mean significantly higher costs for Europe’s commodity trading community.  “This is the latest stage in ongoing discussions with the Commission over the UK’s VAT treatment of certain commodity derivatives,” the UK Treasury said. “This does not have any immediate effect on UK tax law on commodity derivatives. We will respond in due course.” The “terminal markets order” (TMO), which allows zero VAT to be applied to commodity derivatives trading, was agreed in 1973. “Why hasn’t this come up before? They are trying to kill our commodity markets,” a commodity trading source said. The source added that UK authorities would have made sure “everything was in order” as commodities trading had expanded over the years. Futures and options contracts for crude oil, natural gas, power, coal, emissions and soft commodities are traded on ICE Futures Europe. ICE declined to comment. The LPPM is an over-the-counter trading centre for platinum and palladium. It is a members association and not an exchange. LPPM consultant Anne Dennison said it was monitoring the situation. Base metals such as copper, aluminium and zinc are traded on the LME, one of the 11 original exchanges named in the deal agreed after Britain joined the European Union.  “The LME continues to work with its stakeholders to ensure ongoing effective trading on the LME’s market,” the exchange said.

2019-02-05,"(Reuters) - The government of Curacao is resuming talks with two candidates to operate the nation’s 335,000-barrel-per-day Isla refinery after its preferred bidder withdrew from consideration, the refinery said in a statement on Tuesday. The government-owned refinery has operated under a contract with Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA that lasts through December, but it began a search for a replacement last year after a dispute between PDVSA and U.S. oil producer ConocoPhillips kept the plant idled.   Selection of a new operator has been delayed by an  investigation into corruption allegations related to the evaluation process. In its statement, the refinery said that delay and a review of other opportunities led its preferred bidder to withdraw.  “The team in charge of the process is already working together with international experts to quickly take the necessary steps,” the Refineria di Korsou, as it is known formally, said in its statement.  Curacao did not identify the preferred bidder in its statement, but local media said it was Motiva Enterprises, the U.S.-based arm of Saudi Aramco. A spokesperson for Motiva declined to comment.  Motiva last year said it was “actively exploring a number of opportunities and locations” to boost its North American oil refining capacity to as much as 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd). Its plant in Port Arthur, Texas, is the largest U.S. refinery by capacity, processing 603,000 bpd.  A memorandum of understanding with PDVSA’s replacement was expected to be signed and disclosed in the middle of January, a refinery executive had said late last year.  The Isla refinery is committed to keeping the facility open, and in its statement on Tuesday said that PDVSA has expressed interest in continuing at the site. It did not identify the two remaining candidates in the evaluation of a new operator.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - There is ample spare capacity in other oil producers and strategic reserves to compensate for a loss of Venezuela’s crude exports, helping explain the tepid reaction of global oil prices to U.S. sanctions announced a week ago. Venezuela exports around 1 million barrels of oil per day, about 1 percent of global production, of which half heads to the United States. Many U.S. refineries are designed to run heavier, sour grades of crude, a good portion of which comes from Venezuela. Top oil exporter Saudi Arabia could replace this volume from spare capacity of about 1.8 million bpd, and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are also able to pump more after an OPEC-led supply cut began in January. Venezuela is one of the founding OPEC members and was once a top three producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country’s economy. Together with Libya and Iran, it is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut. That earlier decline makes the potential loss of Venezuelan exports less significant. Brent crude, the global benchmark, was trading below $63 a barrel on Tuesday compared to $61 on Jan. 29, the day after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA. “Cutting out Venezuela from the global oil markets would provide a short term positive strength to oil prices, but its significance would be limited,” said Mihir Kapadia, chief executive of Sun Global Investments. “The U.S. would look elsewhere for oil imports, and refiners will adapt to it.”  In contrast, a 2002-2003 strike against former President Hugo Chavez’s government cut supplies and boosted prices to then outrageous levels above $30 a barrel, prompting Saudi Arabia to step in to avert a supply shortage. In addition to other producers being able to pump more oil, the United States holds about 650 million barrels of crude in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which oil executives expect President Donald Trump would tap if prices spiked. Two-thirds of the total volume in the SPR is sour crude. “The market reaction is quite subdued,” a senior oil industry official said. “There is plenty of spare capacity plus the SPR if needed. Trump will not allow prices to rise sharply.”  Reporting by Alex Lawler; Editing by Kirsten Donovan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-oil/graphic-loss-of-venezuelan-oil-exports-wont-leave-huge-gap-in-global-market-idUKL5N2004KL,05 Feb 2019,"There is ample spare capacity in

2019-02-05,"VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania’s intelligence agencies fear Russia will interfere in its forthcoming elections, including one in May to find a successor to the staunchly anti-Kremlin president, Dalia Grybauskaite. The Baltic state, ruled from Moscow for much of the 20th century but now a member of both the European Union and NATO, was rattled by Russia’s annexation of Crimea, and hosts a German-led multinational battalion to deter any Russian invasion. It holds presidential, municipal and European Parliament elections this year and a parliamentary election in 2020. “Russian intelligence will step up its activity during the 2019-2020 election cycle,” the agencies wrote in a joint annual assessment published on Tuesday. “It is possible that Russia will seek to sway the course of the elections by information and cyber means.” Moscow could “disseminate propaganda and disinformation in Lithuanian social media”, it said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the suggestion was “absolute nonsense”, adding: “Russia does not interfere in elections in other countries.” Russia is also suspected of carrying out a number of notable cyber attacks, including a concerted assault on the information systems of another Baltic state, Estonia, in 2007, and an attack that knocked out power stations in Ukraine in 2016. Russia denies being behind any cyber attack. Special counsel Robert Mueller is also investigating allegations of collusion between Russia and Donald Trump to help him win the U.S. presidential election in 2016 - allegations that both sides deny. The Lithuanian report said Russia was basing more tanks and bombers in the Kaliningrad enclave, which borders Lithuania and Poland, and upgrading its bases there to be able to deploy missiles including the nuclear-capable Iskander. The report also said there was a growing risk of “unintentional incidents” from increased military manoeuvres on the other side of the Russian-Lithuanian border. The agencies said they had observed Russian intelligence targeting people in Lithuania’s energy sector and trying to hack into control systems to gain the ability to disrupt Lithuania’s electricity supply. “This is far from our priority,” the Kremlin’s Peskov said. “Recently, in Kaliningrad, Putin opened a gas liquefaction plant, which guaranteed Kaliningrad’s self-sufficiency in energy.” Lithuania is expanding its liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Klaipeda and, together with fellow Baltic states Latvia and Estonia, reducing its dependence on Russian energy.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The United States is sending food and medical supplies to Colombia’s border with Venezuela where it will be stockpiled until it can be delivered to the economically shattered nation, U.S. officials with knowledge of the plan said on Tuesday. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the aid would be prepositioned at the main Colombian-Venezuelan border crossing at Cucuta. It is unclear how the aid will get to Venezuela without the blessing of President Nicolas Maduro and cooperation of the Venezuelan military, which has remained loyal to the socialist leader and is stationed on the Venezuelan side of the border. The U.S. officials said trucks carrying the humanitarian aid were headed to Cucuta at the request of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who last month declared himself to be the South American nation’s interim president. Pressure is growing on Maduro to step down after more than a dozen European Union nations, including Britain, Germany and France, on Monday joined the United States, Canada and a group of Latin American countries in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate leader. However Russia, China and Turkey continue to back Maduro, accusing Western nations of meddling in Venezuela’s internal affairs. The 35-year-old Guaido, the head of Venezuela’s National Assembly, has galvanized the opposition with a hopeful message. He has repeatedly called on Venezuela’s military, which has remained loyal to Maduro, to support a transition to democracy. The United States could attempt to seek the approval of the United Nations Security Council to deliver aid without Maduro’s cooperation, but Russia could block such a move. Maduro’s government, overseeing an economic collapse that has prompted 3 million Venezuelans to flee the country, lashed out at the EU nations, saying their move would affect relations with Caracas. In a statement, it accused them of submitting to a U.S. “strategy to overthrow the legitimate government” and singled out Spain, which had previously led mediation efforts, for acting “cowardly.” U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told an audience in Miami on Friday that the United States was ready to deliver aid to Venezuelans. “The United States of America stands ready to deliver humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan people in Venezuela as well,” Pence told a crowd of Venezuelan exiles. “We are prepared to work with the provisional government of Venezuela, the National Assembly and President Guaido.” With almost no information about how aid will be distributed, the Cucuta crossing from Venezuela appeared to be quiet on Tuesday. The largest city along the frontier, Cucuta has borne the brunt of the arriving migrants. Thousands of people cross the pedestrian bridge daily lugging suitcases and plastic bags. “Maduro doesn’t want help,” said Carolina Rozo, 20, as she crossed the bridge with a wheeled metal shopping cart. “He wants us to be poor. We have to come to buy food because we cannot even get cooking oil and eggs in Venezuela.” Those who settle in Cucuta are often Venezuela’s poorest. Others walk and bus hundreds of kilometers to other cities in Colombia, or follow thousands of others to Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina.

2019-02-05,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2019 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * World shares extend two-month highs as miners, banks make ground * Iron ore at near 2-year high after Brazil orders dam closures * Dollar waits for Trump State of Union Address * Aussie dollar gains as central bank stays firm with message * Euro slips on lacklustre economic data By Marc Jones LONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - World stocks extended their white-hot start to the year on Tuesday, while the dollar was straining for a fourth day of gains as traders awaited U.S. President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s recent caution continued to feed risk appetite but there were a number of idiosyncratic factors marching markets higher. News that oil giant BP had doubled its profits saw Europe’s oil and gas sector jump 1.5 percent and propelled London’s FTSE toward its longest winning streak since April. Wall Street futures were pointing up again while miners were strong globally as well after news that Brazil had ordered the world’s largest iron ore miner, Vale, to close eight of its dams in the wake of a deadly collapse last month. Iron ore prices surged 14 percent at the end of last week in anticipation of the move and are now at a near two-year high. “Our fundamental view is there no reason for this incredible move, so is it just speculation, a frenzy about possible stimulus in China?” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. “What should we do with it? I don’t know, but it should be noted.” China and large parts of Asia had been closed for Lunar New Year celebrations overnight but the markets that were open made some headway. Japan’s Nikkei average marked its highest level in seven weeks before fading to finish slightly lower. Australian shares suffered no such fatigue. They jumped 2 percent, with long-battered financials surging after a government-appointed misconduct inquiry left the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. Wall Street was still being cheered after technology and industrials helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq break through 100-day moving averages on Monday and sent the VIX “fear gauge” to a four-month low. Futures had the S&P, Dow and Nasdaq opening 0.2-0.3 percent higher, and with Europe still rallying, MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe scaled fresh two-month highs following its best January on record. In the currency markets, the dollar held on to recent gains against its major peers as investors waited on monthly ISM survey data, having lapped up Friday’s strong payrolls number and a manufacturing survey. After reining in rate hike expectations last week the Fed took the unusual step of issuing a statement on Monday saying that its head Jerome Powell had told U.S. President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that “the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information.” The dollar’s index against six major currencies was a fraction higher at 95.916, having gained 0.27 percent on Monday, while U.S. Treasury yields were also creeping up again. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1420 after data showing euro zone business growth almost stalled in January but the bigger moves were elsewhere. The Swiss franc looked to be heading for another spell of parity against the dollar  after falling across the board. Some of its sharpest losses were against high-yielding currencies such as the Australian dollar, which was lifted to $0.72 overnight when the central bank sounded less dovish than markets had wagered as it kept interest rates on hold. “With the dollar/Swiss franc breaking through parity, some stops seem to have triggered in a broadly risk-on market,” said Kamal Sharma, director of G10 FX strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Traders’ attention was already shifting to Trump’s delayed State of the Union address, due at 2100 ET Tuesday/0200 GMT Wednesday. He told a White House event over the weekend that he might declare a national “emergency” because Democrats in Congress weren’t moving toward a deal to provide money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Such a step would likely prompt a court challenge from Democrats but there will also be focus on what message Trump sends on issues like the ongoing trade war with China and potentially some other parts of the world. “If President Trump persists in his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the upcoming address, it would cap the dollar’s rally,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities.

2019-02-05,"ESSEN, Germany/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - European energy bourse EEX Group is delaying to the second quarter a major expansion into Asia involving the launch of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) contract that it had initially planned for this month, its Asia head said on Tuesday. Would-be participants active in European gas fear the effects of a disorderly Brexit and need to prepare for this scenario first, Egbert Laege, a member of EEX’s management board and chief executive of EEX Asia, told Reuters. “The contract will now be launched in the second quarter of 2019,” he said on the sidelines of the E-World of Energy industry fair in Essen, Germany. “Brexit is binding many resources in each of our clients’ organisations as well as with the clearing banks, and we can all understand that it has the highest priority that there is seamless cooperation on our European energy markets,” he added. EEX, the world’s biggest power exchange, hopes the contract will attract interest from major LNG participants that have entered the Asian physical spot market in recent years as it widens its global presence in other products. The move will pit the German-based exchange, owned by Deutsche Boerse, against local players in the world’s fastest-growing energy region as it looks to build a global presence. “LNG is the perfect platform to move from regional gas to global gas,” Laege said.  “It is very natural that we take our product offering to the region where the demand is and where the clients are,” he added. The EEX is the first exchange to try to become a globally integrated power, natural gas, dry-bulk, freight and emissions permit trading exchange. Its LNG products will be settled against the Platts daily JKM assessment published by S&P Global Platts, which has come to dominate the booming physical LNG spot market in Asia. Together with its gas hub prices in Europe, EEX says traders will be able to hedge their LNG cargoes and optimise their energy portfolio up to two years in advance. EEX hopes this will attract interest from major LNG market participants who have entered the Asian physical spot market in recent years, so far mostly European-based, and that this will spread more to local players. EEX also plans to start offering wholesale power products in Japan, although this was more medium term. It also plans iron ore and freight futures. “There is a high level of overlap of clients interested in all these products,” Laege said. EEX’s Asian expansion, flagged by Deutsche Boerse last year,     will put EEX into competition with incumbents in a market where a number of contacts have failed in recent years due to a lack of support. “Many have come and few have succeeded in this area. What is required is a set of committed ... market makers across products, who are given a natural position to trade from the start,” said Andrew Koscharsky, director for energy products at commodity trading house RCMA Group in Singapore. The Singapore Exchange (SGX) launched Asian LNG futures in 2015, but trading has been light, while the Japan Electric Power Exchange’s (JEPX) wholesale electricity futures have attracted only moderate interest since launching in 2016. In freight and iron ore, EEX will have to compete with SGX and China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE). To succeed, traders say the German group needs to open itself to smaller participants as well as major companies that can act as market makers by providing constant liquidity. China’s exchanges, such as Dalian and the Shanghai International Energy Exchange, which last year launched crude oil futures, have been driven by local traders. To attract liquidity, EEX says it will exploit the cross-margining and netting opportunities that exist within its contract range, cutting down payments to cover open liabilities. EEX currently has participants from around 30 countries. The bourse bought Czech power rival PXE in 2016 and U.S. power and gas rival Nodal in 2017.

2019-02-05,"* Tenaris, Severstal to invest $240 mln in JV in Russia * Their welded pipe plant to start production in 2021 * Seen reaching production capacity in 2024 (Adds details, quotes, context) MOSCOW, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Steel pipe maker Tenaris will team up with Severstal, one of Russia’s largest steel producers, to make steel pipes in the heart of Russia’s oil and gas sector in Siberia, they said on Tuesday. New industrial projects with Western partners have been rare in Russia in the last five years because of sanctions imposed on Moscow, but the venture between Tenaris and Severstal relies on the main source of Russia’s budget revenue - oil and gas exports. “The production will be located in close proximity to the main oil and gas companies which will ensure cost efficiency both for us and our customers’ operations,” Alexey Mordashov, Severstal’s board chairman, said in the statement. Tenaris and Severstal aim to serve the market for welded OCTG pipe products in Russia and neighbouring countries. OCTG stands for Oil Country Tubular Goods, which are tubes that are used in oil and gas production. The OCTG market is dominated by seamless pipes, but welded pipes are cheaper, and the partners hope to turn this factor to their competitive advantage, Mordashov told a briefing in Moscow. Their joint venture will build a welded pipe plant to produce OCTG products in Siberia’s Surgut area. The plant with annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes will require an investment of $240 million. Severstal will obtain a 51 percent interest in the joint venture with Tenaris owning the remaining 49 percent. Partners plan to share the investment on the same basis, and do not expect to borrow funds for it. The plant will launch production in 2021 but will reach full capacity only in 2024. “We will need time to reach the required level of quality and build mutual relationship with customers. At the same time, of course, we will try to make it faster,” Mordashov said. Once running at full capacity, the plant will supply between 15 and 20 percent of Russian OCTG market, Paolo Rocca, Tenaris’ chief executive, told the same briefing. The final market share will depend on demand for welded pipes and services which the partners plan to offer to the market, Mordashov said. “Today, we see that oil companies have to conduct production at more complex fields... All this may cause additional growth in demand for such products. We just expect that our production in Surgut will be the answer to those challenges that oil companies may encounter,” he added.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil and gas operating costs in the U.S. shale basins have come down recently following a drop in crude prices, BP’s head of upstream Bernard Looney said on Tuesday. Costs of drilling, labour and materials such as sand in shale fields rose last year amid a surge in output, particularly in the prolific Permian oil basin straddling Texas and New Mexico. But a near 40 percent drop in crude prices in the last quarter of 2018 have helped reverse the rise in service costs, Looney said. “We’re not seeing inflation around the world and in fact, even in the Lower 48, we are now beginning to see deflation again as prices have come back down,” Looney said in a analyst call after BP reported a doubling of profits in 2018.     BP became a major shale oil and gas producer following the acquisition of BHP’s onshore U.S. portfolio, known as the Lower 48. Its production rose to 349,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) in 2018 from 297,000 boed the previous year. BP’s global production costs dropped by 45 percent from around $13.10 per barrel in 2013 to $7.24 last year, Looney said.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - New partnerships are emerging in the global hunt for oil discoveries, with some explorers essentially offering an outsourcing service for the riskiest part of the energy business. Central to this new strategy are efforts to find an ally earlier in the process of discovering new fields, and on a larger scale, in order to save money as budgets remain tight after the oil price slump of 2014. While giants such as Total and Eni revamp exploration in-house, BP and Royal Dutch Shell have been more open to having partners do the heavy lifting of exploration in certain geographies. Kosmos Energy and BP, for example, joined forces to hoover up exploration licenses in the northern part of the African Atlantic, rather than competing against each other. In October, Kosmos entered a similar partnership with Shell to search for new oil off southern Africa. “Having a built-in partner with a supermajor from the beginning is very different and allows us to share cost and share risks from the inception of a project,” said Kosmos’ exploration chief Tracey Henderson. “That differs from what used to be a traditional model where a company like Kosmos would pick up acreage in frontier and emerging basins and take more risk upfront ... Then we would spend a year and a half identifying and maturing that prospectivity and then go through a farmout process (to sell a stake).” In such partnerships, responsibilities are clearly defined. Kosmos is in charge of exploration and BP of developing discoveries into producing fields. BP gets a nimble partner with a proven frontier-basin track record in Kosmos, which employs around 350 people. This compares to BP’s 74,000 employees in hundreds of sites around the globe, all vying for budget allocation and embedded in complex decision-making structures. “We can make decisions at lightning speed because we’re all within two floors in the same building,” Henderson said. “What vendors or what contractors we can use ... It can be as simple as taking a piece of paper to another person’s office.” Exploration projects move between two and three years faster in full-cycle partnership, Henderson said. “I wouldn’t be surprised to see other sorts of joint ventures announced as the year progresses,” Andrew Latham, vice president for global exploration at research firm WoodMac, said of partnerships targeting acreage together from the outset.  Other oil firms are partnering early at a different point in the exploration cycle, but the aim is the same - to cut costs. Private equity firm Seacrest and technology provider iPulse, backed by a sovereign wealth fund and private equity, founded oil exploration venture Seapulse. The three entities combined employ only about 60 people. Seapulse in December teamed up with Maersk Drilling in a contract worth several hundred million dollars to drill 12 wells. Such an all-in services contract, Maersk estimates, can shave at least 10 percent off the cost of drilling. Seapulse says its portfolio targets 11 billion barrels of gross prospective resources, according to an external estimate, stretching across the North Sea, the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, Latin America, southern Africa and Latin America. Over the next two years, its 12 wells will hone in on 4 billion barrels of prospective resources - a volume which, if realised, would rival Exxon’s gargantuan oil find offshore Guyana. Oil majors BP, Chevron, Eni, Equinor, Exxon, Shell and Total, on average, drilled and operated around 15 offshore wells over the last two years, WoodMac data shows. “Imagine it as an industrial approach to exploration,” said Seapulse chief Scott Aitken, adding he put the cumulative chance of success of the campaign at over 90 percent with schedule control to streamline the use of rigs, teams and vessels. “Maersk is the single contractor in the alliance and they manage all the supply chain. So many overlaps are eliminated.” The venture also leaves behind the traditional day-rate model that contributes to gyrations in drilling costs, whereby low rates hurt services firms when prices slump, and high rates hit operators. With Seapulse, Maersk gets more money for drilling faster and shares in the upside of a discovery. Global exploration spending fell from more than $90 billion in 2014, when crude oil sold for over $110 a barrel, to under $30 billion last year when it fell below $55 a barrel, according to WoodMac. Costs per well also slumped as service companies scrambled for contracts.  But the number of wells and companies drilling them have shrunk since 2014 and success rates stagnated following a brief spike in 2017, which stemmed largely from a focus on low-risk wells near existing discoveries, Westwood Energy data shows. “Lots of smaller exploration companies have disappeared since $100 a barrel. New players are emerging, often private equity-backed,” Rob Stevens from Westwood said. U.S. companies such as Marathon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips have shifted away from conventional exploration to focus on shale at home. In the North Sea, Faroe Petroleum was bought by DNO, while Dyas and ONE merged in recent months. “Finding new partnerships to make everyone’s budget go further is really a big priority for everyone in the sector. The slump has forced companies to consider change in the way business is done, existentially,” Seapulse’s Aitken said.

2019-02-05,"(Writes through with Nazarbayev’s comments, context) ALMATY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev on Tuesday dismissed reports that he was planning a snap election after he sought clarification on a clause in the constitution covering the length of his term. In a video address published online, Nazarbayev said his request to the Constitutional Court on Monday had been a routine one meant to clarify gaps in sections covering the replacement of a president, an incumbent’s resignation and other areas. “Of course, everyone is interested... in the elections, (political) transition,” he said. “Yes, the president has the right to call an early election, but this is not something we should be worried about, so let us calm down and work as usual,” he added. Nazarbayev, 78, has run the oil-rich Central Asian nation for three decades and has no apparent successor. He won 97.7 percent of the vote in his last vote in 2015. Kazakhstan is scheduled to hold both presidential and parliamentary elections next year, and some commentators had suggested authorities might bring one of the votes forward to avoid a clash. Nazarbayev’s government has also pushed through a number of popular policies in recent months - including raising public-sector salaries and forcing utilities to cut and freeze tariffs - stoking speculation that he was preparing for a vote. Nazarbayev, the only Soviet-era leader still in charge of his country, made no mention of the parliamentary election in his brief address on Tuesday.

2019-02-05,"WASHINGTON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday was set to deliver a State of the Union speech challenging Democrats to approve funding for his long-sought border wall, but stopping short of declaring a national emergency over it, at least for now. At 9 p.m. (0200 GMT Wednesday) before a joint session of Congress, Trump will likely stir contention with remarks on immigration policy, after his demand for $5.7 billion in wall funds triggered a historic 35-day partial government shutdown that more than half of Americans blamed him for, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Millions of Americans were expected to be watching the address on television, giving Trump his biggest opportunity to date to explain why he believes a barrier is needed on the U.S. southern border with Mexico. The speech was delayed for a week because of the shutdown that ended on Jan. 25. When he takes center stage in the chamber of the House of Representatives for the big speech, sitting behind him over his shoulder will be his main congressional adversary, Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who became House speaker after her party won control of the chamber in November’s elections. She has shown no sign of budging from her opposition to Trump’s wall-funding demand. That has led Trump to contemplate declaring a national emergency, which he says would let him reallocate funding from elsewhere without congressional action. But a source close to Trump said the president was not expected to take that step, which would likely draw a swift court challenge from Democrats. Instead he will urge a congressional committee to do a border security deal by Feb. 15. “He’s going to set the stage,” the source said. “He’ll tell people: ‘Here’s why I should,’ but say: ‘I’m giving Congress another chance to act.’” Trump’s speech will also offer an olive branch to opponents as he looks toward the 2020 election, targeting areas he sees for potential bipartisan agreement, such as infrastructure improvements, lowering prescription drug costs and healthcare. A senior administration official said Trump would “encourage Congress to reject the politics of resistance and retribution, and instead adopt a spirit of cooperation and compromise so we can achieve it.” But that message could be undermined with Trump threatening to go his own way on the wall if he cannot get Congress to approve the funding he wants. On Sunday, Trump tweeted: “If there is no Wall, there is no Security.” He has said the wall, which he promised in his 2016 campaign, is needed to deter illegal immigration and drugs. Some Republicans are urging Trump not to declare an emergency. “I’m for whatever works that prevents the level of dysfunction we’ve seen on full display here the last month, and also doesn’t bring about a view on the president’s part that he needs to declare a national emergency,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters last week. Trump will also address foreign policy, including support for an effort to coax Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro into leaving power, declaring the Islamic State militant group all but defeated, and perhaps announcing where he will next meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. He will also give an update on trade talks with the Chinese. Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and White House acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney went over the speech on Monday night with about a dozen supporters including former campaign aides Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, as well as Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, a source familiar with the meeting said. The source said Trump would discuss troop drawdowns in Syria and Afghanistan, and that about half the speech would be devoted to foreign policy. Trump will also claim success on economic policy, including cutting federal regulations, the source said. Some Democrats have invited guests to the speech to highlight various causes, some at odds with Trump’s policies, making a raucous atmosphere possible inside the House chamber. Representative Pramila Jayapal said on Monday she would invite climate scientist Lisa Graumlich, dean of the College of the Environment at the University of Washington, as her guest, to underscore the climate change issue. “One thing you will see is that the chamber is full and the president is surrounded by women, by people of color, by individuals who have really been hurt by this president and many of the actions that he has taken,” Jayapal said. Republican strategist and former White House official Raj Shah said the speech offered Trump a chance to turn the page. “Washington right now looks a little bit petty and a little bit small and the State of the Union is an opportunity to go big and talk in broad themes about what’s good about America and look beyond some of the issues of the last few weeks,” he said.

2019-02-05,"(Adds quotes, detail) JOHANNESBURG, Feb 5 (Reuters) - South African trade union federation COSATU said on Tuesday that it opposed a proposal to split power firm Eskom into three different entities, arguing this would not solve the struggling utility’s governance and debt problems. COSATU Deputy General Secretary Solly Phetoe said the proposal to split Eskom into three firms was made by a task team appointed by President Cyril Ramaphosa at a meeting with members of the ruling African National Congress. Phetoe said the task team’s plan to save Eskom meant that thousands of the utility’s staff could lose their jobs, an assessment that COSATU said it could not support. Ramaphosa is trying to turn around the ailing company - which supplies more than 90 percent of South Africa’s power but is drowning in 420 billion rand ($31 billion) of debt - and has promised to announce a plan to shore up its finances. “We don’t support unbundling as the only option to turn around Eskom,” COSATU’s Phetoe said at a news conference. “It doesn’t suggest that when you unbundle you shall have resolved the governance problems that Eskom has been facing. When you unbundle you have not resolved the debt that Eskom is owing,” Phetoe said. COSATU is planning a nationwide strike on Feb. 13 to try to prevent large-scale layoffs, including at Eskom.

Tenaris and Severstal aim to serve the growing market for welded OCTG pipe products in Russia and neighbouring countries, they said in a statement. OCTG stands for Oil Country Tubular Goods, which are tubes that are used in oil and gas production. The companies are creating a joint venture which will build a welded pipe plant to produce OCTG products in the Surgut area of West Siberia. The plant, which is estimated to require an investment of $240 million and a two year construction period, will have an annual production capacity of 300,000 tonnes. “The production will be located in close proximity to the main oil and gas companies which will ensure cost efficiency both for us and our customers’ operations,” Alexey Mordashov, Severstal’s co-owner and board chairman, said in the statement. Paolo Rocca, Tenaris’ chief executive, said both companies “believe that we can support the Russian and CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) oil and gas industry with a world-class and very competitive alternative for high quality OCTG products and services.” Severstal will have a 51 percent interest in the joint venture with Tenaris owning the remaining 49 percent. The project is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions.

The Federal Reserve’s cautious turn last month was continuing to drive up appetite for riskier assets but there were also a number of idiosyncratic factors feeding outsized moves. News that oil giant BP had doubled it profits and another tickup in crude prices overnight pushed the oil and gas sector up 1.5 percent. Miners were also up sharply as traders digested news that Brazil had ordered Vale, the world’s largest iron ore miner, to close eight of its dams following a deadly collapse that killed over 300 people last month. Iron ore prices surged 14 percent at the end of last week in anticipation of the move and are now at a near 2-year high. “Our fundamental view is there no reason for this incredible move, so is it just speculation, a frenzy about possible stimulus in China?,” said Saxo Bank’s head of FX Strategy John Hardy. “What should we do with it? I don’t know, but it should be noted.” China and large parts of Asia were closed for Lunar New Year celebrations overnight but the bits that were open made some headway too. Japan’s Nikkei average marked its highest level in seven weeks at one point before fading to finish slightly lower. Australian shares suffered no such fatigue. They jumped 2 percent, with long-battered financials surging on short-covering after a special government-appointed misconduct inquiry left the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained on Monday, with technology and industrials the biggest winners, 100-day moving averages sliced through and the VIX “fear gauge,” dropping to its lowest in four months. With Europe continuing to rally, MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe reached a two-month high. It has just had its best January on record, rising more than 13 percent from a near two-year low hit in late December. Having changed tack on rate rises last week the Fed took the unusual step of issuing a statement on Monday saying that its head Jerome Powell had told President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that “the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information.” In the currency markets, the dollar held on to recent gains against its major peers as investors continued to lap-up Friday’s strong payrolls number and a manufacturing survey. The dollar index against six major currencies was a fraction higher at 95.916, having gained 0.27 percent the previous day. The euro weakened slightly to $1.1420, as data showing Euro zone business growth almost stalled in January knocked it further away from a three-week high of $1.15405 set last week. The Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7260 , erasing earlier losses, after the Reserve Bank of Australia left policy unchanged at its first meeting this year but sounded less dovish than the markets had wagered on. The Aussie had earlier fallen fell as much as 0.5 percent after a slump in retail sales reinforced concerns about the health of the economy. Traders’ focus was already shifting to U.S. President Donald Trump’s delayed State of the Union address, due at 2100 ET Tuesday/0200 GMT Wednesday, as well as U.S. ISM non-manufacturing figures, also due later in the day. Trump told a White House event over the weekend that he might declare a national “emergency” because Democrats in Congress weren’t moving toward a deal to provide money to build a wall on the border with Mexico. Such a step would likely prompt a court challenge from Democrats. “If President Trump persists in his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in the upcoming address, it would cap the dollar’s rally,” said Kengo Suzuki, chief FX strategist at Mizuho Securities.

2019-02-05,"LONDON (Reuters) - BP joined its competitors in posting a strong 2018 performance, with a doubling of profits driven by strong growth in oil and gas output following a large U.S. shale acquisition.     Record utilization of its oil and gas fields and refining capacity further helped BP seal what was a transformational year as the aftermath of the deadly 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster eased. But while the London-listed firm’s revenue beat forecasts, debt rose and the pace of its share buyback scheme slowed in the last quarter after it paid the first and largest tranche of the $10.5 billion BHP acquisition. BP shares rose more than 3.3 percent in early trade, hitting their highest since early December.  “We now have a powerful track record of safe and reliable performance, efficient execution and capital discipline. And we’re doing this while growing the business,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said in a statement on Tuesday. Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron all reported stronger-than-forecast earnings last week driven by higher production in U.S. shale basins where Oil Majors have invested billions in recent years. The strong gains came despite a sharp drop in crude prices at the end of the year that wiped out most gains made in share prices throughout the year. Uncertainty over the outlook for oil prices as well as concerns over global economic growth and sino-American trade tensions are likely to continue to weigh on the sector. Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters he expected Brent crude prices to hold around current levels of $60 a barrel in 2019, while demand was expected to rise by 1.3 to 1.4 million barrels per day, a similar pace to that seen in 2017. Capital expenditure will be $15 to $17 billion this year, after reaching $15.1 billion in 2018, Gilvary said. BP plans to sell $10 billion of assets over the next two years to help pay for the BHP deal, including a suite of fields in the United States as it focuses on the most attractive basins, he added. After settling the vast majority of payments for the 2010 spill in the Gulf of Mexico, totaling nearly $70 billion, BP has more recently focused on growing production into the next decade, including the BHP deal which is its largest in 30 years. For the year, BP’s profit rose to a five-year high of $12.7 billion, double the previous year’s $6.17 billion and above analyst expectations of $11.88 billion. “Overall, we see this as a strong set of results, with stronger underlying earnings translating into cash,” Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.  Graphic: BP annual results - tmsnrt.rs/2Bl1O05 Graphic: BP quarterly profits - tmsnrt.rs/2HNkHOO Production rose to 3.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018 after BP completed the acquisition of BHP’s onshore U.S. shale portfolio and thanks to the start up of new fields including the 120,000 barrel per day Clair Ridge project in the North Sea.  Excluding its share of production from its 20 percent stake in Russia’s Rosneft, BP’s production was up 8.2 percent from 2017. Gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s market value, rose to 30.3 percent at the end of 2018 from 27.4 percent a year earlier. Net debt was $44.1 billion at the end of last year.

2019-02-05,"(Adds quotes, details) KUWAIT, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The head of state-run Kuwait Petroleum Corp, Hashem Hashem, said on Tuesday that global oil supply could be hit this year by big reductions in exports from Venezuela. The Trump administration has imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at severely curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States and at pressuring socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down. “One of the known risks of supply shortage in 2019 would include the continuing decline of Venezuelan crude oil production beyond current expectations,” Hashem told an industry conference in Kuwait. “However the wild card recently has been market perceptions of potential shortages mainly from geopolitical pressures that have caused supply disruptions in the past and therefore pose a real threat for 2019.” Hashem also said that the threat of a U.S.-China trade war and mixed messages from the United States on whether it would raise interest rates is causing volatility in the global equity markets and could increase oil price volatility this year. OPEC, Russia and other non-OPEC producers - an alliance known as OPEC+ - agreed in December to reduce supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from Jan. 1. OPEC’s share of the cut is 800,000 bpd, to be delivered by 11 members - all except Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Hashem said OPEC+ actions should help re-balance the oil markets this year but he also warned of the impact of underinvestment in the oil industry which could cause a supply crunch by 2025. “OPEC and the non-OPEC producing countries... have successfully provided stability to the market since 2017 and reduced volatility in oil prices. The resultant prices, are critical to stimulate investment and growth,” he said. Reporting by Ahmed Hagagy; Writing by Rania El Gamal; editing

The so-called coal commission said last month that Germany should shut down all of its coal-fired power plants by 2038 at the latest and proposed at least 40 billion euros ($45.7 billion) in aid to coal-mining states affected by the phase-out. “We want to be out of coal in 2038. Then we need more gas,” Merkel said in a speech at Keio University in Tokyo, in her first clear indication that she supported the recommendation. The proposals highlight Germany’s shift to renewables, which made up more than 40 percent of its energy mix last year, surpassing coal for the first time. They must now be implemented by the German government and 16 regional states. The plan, however, has drawn criticism from some in industry who fear the impact of higher energy prices. A senior legislator from the most pro-business wing in Merkel’s party hinted in a weekend newspaper interview that the phase-out could be delayed beyond 2038 if the deadline created problems for the security of electricity supply.

2019-02-05,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4Long-battered Australian financial shares jump * Many Asian markets closed for Lunar New Year holiday * Trump’s State of the Union address due later in the day By Hideyuki Sano and Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Asian stocks extended their gains on Tuesday as overnight strength on Wall Street and the Federal Reserve’s dovish turn underpinned risk appetite, while the dollar held firm on last week’s upbeat U.S. data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 0.4 percent and hovered near its four-month high marked on Friday. Japan’s Nikkei average was flat on the day but at its highest level in seven weeks. Australian shares jumped 2.5 percent, with long-battered financials surging on short-covering after a special government-appointed inquiry excoriated Australia’s financial sector for misconduct but left the structure of the country’s powerful banks in place. Elsewhere in Asia, trade was light, with markets in greater China, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and Indonesia all closed for the Lunar New Year. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 gained, with technology and industrials the biggest winners as investors braced for another big week of fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports. After the bell, Google operator Alphabet fell about 3 percent as its higher spending in the fourth-quarter worried investors even as its revenue and profits beat the Street’s expectations. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe reached a two-month high, having risen more than 13 percent from its near two-year low late in December, helped by the Fed’s change of tack. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has signalled its three-year tightening drive may be coming to an end amid a suddenly cloudy outlook for the U.S. economy due to global growth concerns and the U.S.-China trade dispute. The Fed said in a statement that Powell had told President Donald Trump and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin late on Monday that policy will “depend entirely” on incoming economic information. Data announced on Friday showed U.S. job growth surged in January while a key gauge of U.S. manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience after December’s shocking fall, allaying fears the U.S. economy might be losing momentum quickly. Hiroshi Nakamura, senior manager of investment planning at Mitsui Life Insurance, said financial markets’ positive reaction to the U.S. data is diminishing with time, but hopes for a U.S.-China trade deal “will continue to support markets until the two sides come to formal decisions”. The dollar was on a firm footing as investors continued to lap-up Friday’s strong payrolls number and a manufacturing survey. The dollar’s index against six major currencies was little changed at 95.823, having gained 0.27 percent on Monday. The euro was also steady at $1.1439, off three-week high of $1.15405 set on Thursday. The greenback firmed to 109.99 yen, having risen to 110.165 the previous day, its highest level in five weeks. The British pound barely moved and was at $1.3041. On Monday, sterling quickly erased brief gains following a newspaper report that goods shipped to Britain from the European Union could be waved through without checks in the event of a “no-deal” Brexit. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent to $0.7207 after local retail sales reinforced concerns about slowing growth in Australia. The Reserve Bank of Australia is all but certain to leave policy unchanged at its first meeting of 2019 later on Tuesday after sitting on the fence since August 2016. In commodity markets, oil prices inched up on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply amid U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 0.4 to $54.79 a barrel, after hitting a 2-1/2-month high of $55.75 in the previous session, while Brent crude futures were last up 0.4 percent at $62.77.

2019-02-05,"(Repeats Feb. 4 column. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4 By John Kemp LONDON, Feb 4 (Reuters) - Hedge funds are becoming steadily less bearish towards oil as OPEC output cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela remove large volumes of crude from the market amid increasing confidence a global recession can be averted. Hedge funds and other money managers were net buyers of another 30 million barrels of Brent crude futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to position data from ICE Futures Europe. Fund managers have been net buyers in seven of the last eight weeks and have increased their position by 96 million barrels since Dec. 4 (tmsnrt.rs/2Bfloe4). In common with previous weeks, fund managers mostly closed out old bearish short positions (-18 million barrels) rather than opening new bullish long ones (+12 million). Bearish short positions have fallen by more than 60 percent from a peak of 122 million barrels on Dec. 11 to 48 million as fund managers have become convinced that the fourth-quarter sell-off is over. In contrast, bullish long positions have risen by just 27 million barrels over the same period, as portfolio managers remain cautious. However, weekly increases have started to accelerate, in a sign of growing confidence. Funds now hold almost 6 bullish long positions for every bearish short one, up from a ratio of 2:1 in mid-December, and the most bullish overall position since mid-October. OPEC’s early and aggressive output reductions have removed some of the downside supply risk to oil prices even as traders remain uncertain about the risk of recession and the potential hit to consumption growth in 2019. U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s national oil company PDVSA, since broadened to include third-country purchasers of Venezuela’s heavy crude, are also likely to reduce global oil supplies. Besides crude, fund managers were buyers of 7 million barrels of European gasoil futures and options in the week to Jan. 29, according to exchange data. Net long positions in gasoil have risen in each of the last four weeks and now stand at 22 million barrels, up from just 2 million barrels at the end of 2018. Gasoil is the part of the barrel most closely geared to the business cycle, so cautious buying suggests fund managers see a reduced probability of recession this year.

2019-02-05,"SYDNEY, Feb 5 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched up on Tuesday, buoyed by expectations of tightening global supply amid U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and production cuts led by OPEC. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $54.73 per barrel at 0020 GMT, up 16 cents from their last settlement. They closed down 1.3 percent on Monday, after earlier touching their highest since Nov. 21 at $55.75 a barrel. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing down 0.4 percent in the previous session. Analysts said that U.S. sanctions on Venezuela had focused market attention on tighter global supplies. The sanctions will sharply limit oil transactions between Venezuela and other countries and are similar to but slightly less extensive than those imposed on Iran last year, experts said on Friday after looking at details posted by the Treasury Department. Oil supply from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries fell in January by the largest amount in two years, a Reuters survey found, as Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies over-delivered on the group’s supply-cutting pact while Iran, Libya and Venezuela registered involuntary declines. Russia has been in full compliance with its pledge to gradually cut its oil production, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement on Monday, adding that production decreased by 47,000 barrels per day (bpd) in January from October.
