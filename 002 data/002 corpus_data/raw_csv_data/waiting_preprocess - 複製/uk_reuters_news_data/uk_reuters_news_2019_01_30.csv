2019-01-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc told employees on Wednesday it will no longer carry widely used, throw-away plastic items like water bottles or silverware in its offices and cafeterias as the U.S. bank tries to cut the amount of trash it puts in landfills.  Starting last week, Goldman cafeterias and vending machines globally swapped out plastic soda and water bottles for aluminium cans, glass bottles and compostable cups to be used for fountain drinks, said Cindy Quan, the bank’s head of environment, social and governance for real estate.  Throw-away plastic items have been the subject of bans by a growing number of countries and corporations because they often end up littering oceans and waterways.  In December, the European Union agreed to ban by 2021 a list of 10 single-use plastic products, like plates, straws and drink stirrers. The operator of luxury hotel chain Peninsula Hotels, The Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels, Limited, said it will stop using plastic bottles, packaging and bathroom amenities by 2020. Quan said Goldman is banning single-use plastics because they often ended up in the company’s garbage instead of the recycling bin.  The bank has said it is trying to divert 100 percent of its business waste from landfills by 2020, and is 93 percent of the way there, Quan said.  This step will reduce the amount of single-use plastics bank employees throw away by 85 percent or to 6 tons, the bank said.  Goldman has worked with companies and groups with ties to the plastics industry.  Kevin Smith, vice president of the bank’s environmental markets group, said that the bank does not discuss matters related to specific clients. The move away from single-use plastics, Smith said, is part of the bank’s broader environmental strategy, which includes raising capital for green energy projects and underwriting climate-related risks.

2019-01-30,"(Recasts throughout; adds information on inventories) By Deisy Buitrago and Marianna Parraga Jan 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil inventories have started to build up at the country’s ports and terminals as PDVSA is finding it cannot export crude at its usual rate due to U.S. sanctions imposed earlier this week, according to sources and shipping data. Sanctions announced on Monday by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro out of power after his contested re-election last year, have barred PDVSA’s U.S. customers from transferring payments to the firm. That is effectively limiting state-owned PDVSA from shipping that oil because Maduro’s government cannot collect the proceeds. As of Wednesday, Venezuela had 25 tankers with nearly 18 million barrels of crude - representing about two weeks of the country’s production - either waiting to load or expecting authorization to set sail. Most of those were anchored near the port of Jose, the country’s largest, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. PDVSA responded to the U.S. sanctions by prohibiting tankers loading oil bound for the United States to leave Venezuelan ports if cargoes are not prepaid. In addition, PDVSA’s inability to pay for crucial imports means fuel imports are delayed, adding to the glut of tankers off Venezuela’s coast. “We are facing problems to continue storing Merey crude,” a PDVSA source said, referring to the most common crude grade it exports. Most cargoes were bound for U.S. customers - including PDVSA’s refining unit Citgo Petroleum, Chevron Corp, Valero Energy and PBF Energy. Other large vessels loaded with Venezuelan oil and fuel were waiting to depart for Singapore, India and China. PDVSA exported 1.25 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude last year, including 500,000 bpd to the United States. The company boosted sales in early January in anticipation of sanctions, according to the Refinitiv Eikon data. Wills Rangel, a PDVSA board member, on Wednesday told Reuters the state-owned company, which is currently producing 1.2 million bpd of crude, does not plan to cancel supply contracts with U.S. clients. That comes even though PDVSA President Manuel Quevedo on Tuesday said a declaration of force majeure that would free PDVSA from paying penalties for undelivered cargoes was under consideration. Meanwhile, PDVSA is eying exports to other destinations. “An instruction was given to define new export markets in 15 to 30 days,” Rangel said. The company is looking to India for more imports and is also considering imports of light crude if necessary to boost domestic production of gasoline. Washington’s measures against the socialist Maduro, who has overseen the country’s economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years, aim to back a new government formed by the opposition leader Juan Guaido. PDVSA is facing problems unloading fuel imports for domestic use because sanctions are making it difficult to complete payments for deliveries, according to Rangel, who also leads the firm’s labor union. Sanctions require PDVSA’s U.S.-based customers, including its refining arm Citgo Petroleum, to deposit proceeds from imports of Venezuelan oil in special accounts out of Maduro’s reach. They also limit U.S. dollar transactions with PDVSA, but do not specify if U.S. fuel can still be exported to Venezuela. “Even being here and having secured the money, shippers in some cases have intended to block tankers from discharging,” said Rangel. PDVSA will insist the fuel cargoes are discharged and try to find a way to pay for them, according to Rangel. He did not elaborate on how the state-run company would convince suppliers and shipping firms hired to transport the cargoes to accept payments and discharge shipments under PDVSA’s terms. Venezuela’s main fuel providers are Citgo and India’s Reliance Industries Ltd, which typically ships naphtha, alkylate for gasoline, diesel and components from the United States, according to internal PDVSA trade documents. PDVSA has fuel inventories at its terminals sufficient to cover a month of domestic Venezuelan consumption, according to Rangel’s numbers, as its main refining complex, the Paraguana Refining Center, is working at 40 percent of its 955,000-barrel-per-day capacity. But sources at PDVSA estimate stocks at closer to 15 days of consumption, with little finished gasoline or diesel. As of Wednesday, over 15 tankers were anchored near PDVSA’s ports waiting to discharge some 5.5 million barrels of imported diesel, gasoline, vacuum gasoil, liquefied petroleum gas and naphtha - enough for an estimated 13 days of consumption. That would give PDVSA more leeway to supply gas stations and power plants if tankers are finally discharged. Reporting by Deisy Buitrago in Caracas and Marianna Parraga in

2019-01-30,"CARACAS/CIUDAD GUAYANA, Venezuela (Reuters) - As oil companies and traders worldwide tried to decipher the impact of U.S. sanctions slapped on Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA earlier this week, residents of the South American country had a familiar response: Get in line.  Snaking, sometimes hours-long lines formed outside PDVSA gas stations amid concerns that the sanctions, intended to pressure socialist President Nicolas Maduro to step down and allow opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido to hold elections, would choke off fuel supply. “I am going to fill up on gasoline just in case, because of the United States sanctions and because this country’s refineries do not work,” said Alberto Avila, a 52-year-old elevator technician waiting in line for gas at a still-unopened station in eastern Ciudad Guayana. While the OPEC nation holds the world’s largest crude oil reserves, intermittent gasoline shortages and long lines for groceries and medicine have become the new normal under a hyperinflationary economic collapse. Crude output is collapsing due to underinvestment, refineries operate well below capacity, and the country must import gasoline, mostly from the United States, to meet domestic demand. PDVSA now buys about half the gasoline Venezuela needs, according to internal company figures. In the first eight months of 2018, imports from the United States rose 76 percent to 125,000 barrels per day, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration show. The sanctions, imposed on Monday, ban U.S. refineries from buying oil from PDVSA unless they pay the money to accounts not affiliated with the Maduro government, which Washington accuses of corruption and human rights violations. They also prevent U.S. companies from exporting goods or services to PDVSA.  PDVSA assured Venezuelans in a Twitter post that fuel supply would be guaranteed across the country, and many stations were operating normally, attendants said.  But some motorists like Carmen Lopez, a 51-year-old dentist, decided it was best not to try their luck. She left her house in the central city of Valencia at 6 a.m. and waited an hour to fill up. “I do not really understand how the new sanctions are going to affect us, but just in case I am keeping my tank full,” she said. PDVSA board member Wills Rangel told Reuters the company was already having problems unloading fuel imports from tankers for domestic use because the sanctions were making it difficult to complete payments. Rangel, also a union leader, said the company had inventories to cover about a month’s worth of consumption, but sources within PDVSA estimate stocks are closer to 15 days. While Venezuelans were wary of how the sanctions might affect their already shaky access to basic goods, some opponents of Maduro were willing to put up with it because they thought the restrictions would hasten his exit. “This cannot go on,” said Antonio Rodriguez, a 55-year-old merchant in the 12th spot in line to enter a Caracas PDVSA station where only two of five pumps were working. “But if it is for the good of the country, we have to make the sacrifice.” Additional reporting by Deisy Buitrago in Caracas and Tibisay Romero in Valencia; Writing by Luc Cohen; Editing by Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-pdvsa-gasoline/u-s-sanctions-send-venezuelans-scrambling-to-fill-gas-tanks-idUKL1N1ZU1QI,30 Jan 2019,"As oil

2019-01-30,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Wednesday it would pay $350 million to buy a refinery in Pasadena, Texas, from Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, confirming a Reuters report from Monday. In addition to the 110,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, Chevron will take ownership of a 466-acre (188.5 hectares)complex on the Houston Ship Channel that includes storage tanks with capacity for 5.1 million barrels of crude oil and refined products, as well as 143 acres of additional land, the company said. “This expansion of our Gulf Coast refining system enables Chevron to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron-produced products, and realize synergies through coordination with our refinery in Pascagoula,” said Pierre Breber, executive vice president of Chevron downstream & chemicals. Chevron, which reported a 150,000-bpd increase in shale production in the third quarter, has said it wants a second Gulf Coast facility to handle that crude and better supply its retail gasoline network. The Pasadena refinery produces mostly gasoline and distillates such as diesel.  The deal includes all of Petrobras subsidiary Pasadena Refining System Inc, which operates the refinery and tank farm and owns the adjoining property, and PRSI Trading LLC.

2019-01-30,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian opposition presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar said on Wednesday he would consider an amnesty for corruption suspects in order to help recover billions of dollars stashed abroad by the country’s politicians and government officials. Abubakar is the main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari in the Feb. 16 election, where corruption, security and the economy have been key issues. Buhari is hoping his anti-corruption agenda can win him a second term. Nigerian state coffers have in past years been ransacked by government officials and their associates, and corruption is prevalent throughout society. Buhari was elected in 2015 in part on a promise to rid the country of graft. The West African nation launched a whistleblower scheme two years ago entitling those who help find stolen assets to up to 5 percent of the recovered sums, part of a drive by Buhari to root out endemic corruption. Abubakar said the amnesty program would encourage looters to voluntarily return some of the stolen funds badly needed to fund infrastructure investment and recommended sanctions for election rigging. “Why can we not have an election fraud commission?” Abubakar said during a televised town hall meeting to woo voters. “So that we bring to book any individual, whether a member of a political party, INEC (electoral commission), or security services who infringes.” Abubakar and his vice presidential candidate Peter Obi were repeatedly challenged on their track records regarding corruption, and about investing government funds in private businesses, some of which they owned shares in, while in public office. Both candidates denied any allegations of graft. He also said he would be more than willing to investigate allegations of corruption in senior ranks of the military, as the military faces shortages of weapons and other resources in its war against Islamist insurgencies. Critics have often accused the Nigerian military’s senior officers of corruption, alleging that the graft drains resources and weapons from the northeast, where they are needed to fight advancing Islamist insurgencies. Earlier on Wednesday Abubakar said in a speech he would create a $25 billion fund to support private sector investment in infrastructure if elected next month, as part of plans to revive the economy. Nigeria’s oil-dependent economy, which vies with South Africa’s to be the largest in Africa, has performed below par since 2016, when it suffered its first recession in 25 years.

2019-01-30,"(Adds divisions caused among oil companies, analyst’s comment) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Alberta will ease oil curtailments in February and March, earlier than expected, saying on Wednesday that its rare step to limit production had eased a glut of crude. Alberta’s move to scale back its curtailments came at the end of a volatile month, in which Canadian prices improved dramatically but producers were affected disproportionately. U.S. refiners are also scrambling to find a replacement for Venezuelan heavy crude - similar to what Alberta produces - because of U.S. sanctions on that country’s state-owned oil company. Prices for Alberta oil fell in October to record lows compared with U.S. futures prices because of congested pipelines that backed up crude in storage tanks and prompted the curtailments. “We’re not out of the woods yet, but this temporary measure is working,” Premier Rachel Notley said in a statement. The province said it would set production for February and March at 3.63 million barrels per day (bpd), up by 75,000 bpd from January. Storage levels have fallen by 5 million barrels to a total of 30 million barrels since curtailments were announced in December, faster than expected, the provincial government said. They have decreased by about 1 million barrels a week this month, it said. The oil cuts averted disaster for many small producers that were selling crude in some cases below cost. But they have sharply divided larger producers, illustrating the messy task government faces. Producers that do not fully own refineries, such as Cenovus Energy Inc and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, pressured Alberta last year to impose the curtailments. Those with processing capacity - Suncor Energy Inc, Husky Energy Inc and Imperial Oil Ltd - benefited from running cheap oil through their refineries and opposed the measure. There have also been unintended negative consequences. Canadian Natural Resources said in a Jan. 22 letter to service providers that changes Alberta made in late December to how it calculated allowed production per company resulted in its shouldering a bigger share of production cuts than others. Curtailments do not apply to small companies producing less than 10,000 bpd. Easing the curtailments may encourage oil producers to sign contracts to ship more crude by rail, RBC Dominion Securities analyst Greg Pardy said in a note.

2019-01-30,"(Adds Shell, union comment, background) HOUSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers (USW) union on Wednesday rejected the first offer from Shell Oil Co in talks for a new national agreement covering 30,000 U.S. refinery, chemical plant and pipeline workers, according to three sources familiar with the negotiations. The current national agreement for refinery workers expires on Friday. The union and the U.S. arm of Royal Dutch Shell Plc , which is representing oil companies, have been meeting since Jan. 16 to hammer out a new pact. The offer was rejected in part because it lacked language requiring the successor to a current owner of a plant to accept the contract with the union in place at the time ownership is assumed, the sources said. The rejected offer also lacked no-retrogression language prohibiting plant owners from going back on terms agreed to in past contracts. Shell spokesman Ray Fisher said the company continues to work toward an agreement with the union for “our workers to continue to grow, develop and enjoy earnings that are among the most competitive in the manufacturing industry.” A union spokeswoman said talks were continuing. “The USW will continue to negotiate in good faith for a pattern agreement that is beneficial for our members, their families and their communities, and that allows them to work safely and productively for their employers,” union spokeswoman Lynne Hancock. The first offer made by the lead company, which since 1997 has been Shell, has always been rejected by Steelworkers negotiators. The union is seeking a three-year agreement to replace the expiring four-year pact that was agreed to after rolling strikes in 2015 in which more than 7,000 workers at 12 refineries and three chemical plants were off their jobs for at least two months at most sites and six months at a few others. The union is seeking an 8 percent annual raise for workers who make an average $40 an hour with four years experience. The union is also proposing its members begin replacing as much as 10 percent a year of the non-union workers who perform maintenance work at refineries and chemical plants. Shell has not disclosed its proposals. The national agreement between Shell and USW covers pay, benefits, safety and health issues and will be pared with agreements on local issues at each plant to form the contracts for individual sites.

2019-01-30,"(Corrects quote in paragraph 9 to add word ‘not’) By Lesley Wroughton WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, cautioned socialist President Nicolas Maduro that acting against self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido would be an “extremely foolish move.” Speaking on Wednesday, days after being named the U.S. point person for Venezuela by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Abrams said the United States would keep up pressure on Maduro to step down by applying further sanctions and searching for assets such as bank accounts and gold holdings. “The security of interim president Guaido is a concern,” Abrams told a group of reporters. “The regime has not acted against him in some time and I hope that is because they recognize that he has the support of the vast majority of Venezuelans, and that would be an extremely foolish move for the regime to make.” Washington has backed Guaido in his push to force Maduro from power. Maduro, who is supported by Russia and China, has barred Guaido from leaving Venezuela and frozen his assets. Many opposition leaders have been imprisoned in Venezuela in recent years. Abrams emphasized that unseating Maduro, who still has the backing of the military, could take time. Asked whether Washington may have underestimated the military’s support for Maduro, Abrams said: “This may well be, and the democratic forces believe it can be, a turning point. That doesn’t mean its going to happen this week and we’re not picking dates.” He said oil sanctions imposed by Washington earlier this week were aimed at safeguarding Venezuela’s assets. The United States and other countries were searching for other possible Venezuelan assets around the world, including bank accounts and gold holdings, he said. “Obviously if they have an account in Moscow we’re not going to get at it,” he added. Abrams said there were discussions about ramping up aid to Venezuelans, including through a “humanitarian corridor” into the country. He did not give logistical details as to how such a scheme would operate. “The humanitarian corridor is something we’re looking at, but of course it requires the cooperation of the regime,” he said. “I don’t know how practical that is. It hasn’t been possible to date.” (Reporting by Lesley Wroughton, Additional reporting by Makini Brice Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Rosalba O’Brien)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-usa-diplomacy/corrected-update-1-u-s-envoy-warns-maduro-that-actions-against-guaido-would-be-foolish-idUKL1N1ZU1N2,30 Jan 2019,"The U.S. envoy for Venezuela,

2019-01-30,"(Reuters) - U.S. homes and businesses will likely use record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday as an Arctic-like freeze blankets the eastern half of the country, according to energy analysts. Harsh winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest, unnerving even residents accustomed to brutal winters and keeping them huddled indoors as offices closed and  mail carriers halted their rounds. That brutal cold could also temporarily reduce gas production by causing freeze-offs in the Marcellus and Utica shale, the nation’s biggest gas producing region, in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, the analysts warned. Freeze-offs occur when water and other liquids in gathering lines freeze, blocking the flow of gas. Overnight lows on Wednesday through Friday will drop to -20 degrees Fahrenheit (-29 Celsius) in Chicago and the single-digits along the East Coast from New York to Boston, according to AccuWeather, a weather forecaster. The cold, however, will be short-lived with high temperatures this weekend in New York and Chicago expected to rise into the 40s F. The normal high at this time of year is 32 in Chicago and 39 in New York. Financial data provider Refinitiv predicted gas demand in the Lower 48 U.S. states would hit a daily record of 145.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Wednesday as consumers crank up their heaters to escape the bitter cold. That would top the current all-time high of 144.6 bcfd set on Jan. 1, 2018.     One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. In early estimates, gas production in the Lower 48 states will slip about 0.9 bcfd to 85.8 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. That is the lowest daily output since Enbridge Inc started to restore flows through some gas pipes in Ohio following a pipeline explosion there on Jan. 21. “Based on our analysis of historical freeze-offs, temperature conditions forecasted for Jan. 30-31 pose a risk of a freeze-off occurring in the Marcellus/Utica...in the ballpark of 1 bcfd,” said Rishi Iyengar, senior analyst natural gas markets at IHS Markit’s OPIS PointLogic. In early estimates, Marcellus/Utica production was down about 0.7 bcfd to 29.6 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. Iyengar said current forecasts were not cold enough to impact production in the Bakken shale in North Dakota because drillers there have invested in equipment needed to handle extremely low temperatures. Continental Resources Inc, an oil producer in the Bakken, said the cold weather had not impacted its crude production. Energy Transfer, which operates Bakken crude pipelines, said its operations had not been disrupted. Another energy market intelligence firm, Genscape, said it observed no weather-related impact to the region’s crude production, crude-by-rail shipments and pipeline flows.  In the spot market, next-day prices for Wednesday for power at PJM West in western Pennsylvania and gas in Chicago both rose to their highest in a year as demand for heating spiked. PJM, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, forecast power demand would reach about 142,000 megawatts (MW) on Thursday, approaching the region’s all-time winter peak of 143,295 MW on Feb. 20, 2015. PJM said it has “robust reserves and does not expect to have any capacity issues” in meeting demand.  One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid and equities surged on Wednesday, fuelled by Boeing and Apple’s results and extended after the Federal Reserve pledged to be patient with future interest rate hikes, a change in tone that stock investors interpreted as a buy signal. The Fed, in its policy statement at the end of a two-day meeting, struck the language from its December policy statement that indicated further rate hikes would be appropriate in 2019. That language had roiled markets amid signs of slower global growth. U.S. stocks extended gains and bond yields fell as markets got what they were hoping for, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in Newport Beach, California. “This marks a full 180 from what the Fed was signalling just a few months ago,” he said. Scott Minerd, global chief investment officer at Guggenheim Partners in Santa Monica, California, said the Fed’s pause will further extend the economic expansion, allowing excesses to continue to build and increasing risks of financial instability. “The Fed refilled the punch bowl and the party goes on. Buy risk assets,” Minerd said. The Fed’s policy statement indicates the U.S. central bank will remain on a dovish path, which is very supportive for risk assets, at least on the short term, said Putri Pascualy, managing director for PAAMCO in Irvine, California.  “The back-drop of slowing economic growth on a global basis is the 800 trillion gorilla in the room,” Pascualy said.  The MSCI world equity index, which tracks share performance in 47 countries, rose 1.2 percent following gains in Asia overnight. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares in Europe closed up 0.41 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 434.9 points, or 1.77 percent, to 25,014.86.

Upbeat results from Boeing and Apple late on Tuesday provided investors early relief. Boeing shares rose 6.25 percent after the world’s largest planemaker raised its profit and cash flow expectations for 2019 amid a boom in air travel.

2019-01-30,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Farmers from North Dakota to Iowa buckled down for some of the coldest weather in a generation on Wednesday, throwing extra rations to pigs or building igloos for chickens in the teeth of sub-zero temperatures and bone-chilling winds. Some, like Kurt Line in Indiana, joked about the forecast. Line said he was working on his tax returns, something he usually puts off, rather than braving the cold to load corn for a local processing plant. But temperatures expected to plunge in some areas as low as minus 40 degrees, the point at which Fahrenheit and Celsius converge, are no laughing matter for an industry dependent on the elements. Cargill Inc closed all its grain plants in the U.S. Midwest on Wednesday because of extreme cold - and will likely reopen them on Thursday after temperatures warm, company spokeswoman April Nelson said. Tyson Foods Inc canceled two shifts at a pork plant in Waterloo, Iowa, while Hormel Foods Corp halted the hog slaughter at its processor in Austin, Minnesota, according to three people familiar with the operations. The companies did not respond to requests for comment on the closures.  The brutal chill was caused by the polar vortex, a mass of freezing air that normally spins around the North Pole but has made its way south to the United States. Minnesota farmer Peter Bakken woke on Wednesday to three of his family’s cattle water fountains frozen. He spent the day spraying hot water to thaw the pipes and keeping a close eye on the weather forecast. The family grows alfalfa and snow cover on the plants is insulating them from the bitter cold. But the weather is expected to warm this weekend, and then get cold again. He said that could replace the snow cover with ice, which could kill the plants. Cattle ranchers Joey Myers and her fiancé, Scott Bailey, in Minot, North Dakota, were brewing even more coffee after staying up all night - for a second night in a row - to check on their animals. They feared the minus 18-degree F ( minus 28-C) temperatures with wind chills of minus 50 degrees F ( minus 45 C) could cause their pregnant cows to give birth early. Their heated barn is not big enough to house every animal, so they must keep watch for newborn calves to prevent fatalities. Ron Prestage, president of one of Iowa’s biggest hog producers, Prestage Farms, said his company had been stocking up on feed to last at least until Friday, and was making sure heaters and water lines were running at hog barns.  “As cold as it’s going to be, water lines are a critical factor,” he said. Most U.S. crops are planted in the spring, but the winter wheat crop sown in some areas could be at risk if the cold continues. The freeze was also a concern for the smallest of farmers.  Backyard chicken owners in the Midwest flocked online for advice on how to protect their birds, with some on the chat forum at BackyardChickens.com asking if they should add a heating pad for their poultry to stand on. Others suggested putting extra tarps around the coops to keep chickens dry and coating exposed chicken skin with petroleum jelly to ward off frostbite.  In Chicago, Lynn Ankney and her family have been double-checking their backyard coop, making sure there are no drafts around their Rhode Island Red and Black Australorp hens – and using snow that accumulated in recent days to build an igloo around their coop for extra insulation. On Wednesday morning, she checked on her birds. They were safe and sound. Reporting by P.J.

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Wednesday, as U.S. government data that showed signs of tightening supply and investors remained concerned about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry. U.S. crude futures rose 92 cents to settle at $54.23 a barrel, a 1.73 percent gain. Brent crude futures gained 33 cents, or 0.54 percent, to $61.65 a barrel. Prices extended gains after government data showed U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose less than expected last week due to a drop in imports, while gasoline inventories fell from record highs as refiners slowed production. Crude inventories rose by 919,000 barrels, the  Energy Information Administration said, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. After eight straight weeks of builds to a record high, gasoline stocks fell 2.2 million barrels last week, versus forecasts for a 1.9 million-barrel gain. “The report looked supportive on several fronts with the most obvious being a smaller-than-expected crude build of less than 1 million barrels,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “While the slight increase may not appear monumental, we will reiterate that the build compared with 5-year average increases of about 7.5 million barrels.” The market has been supported since Washington announced export sanctions against Venezuela on Monday, limiting transactions between U.S. companies and Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA. The fight to control Venezuela, which has the world’s largest oil reserves, has intensified with the new sanctions aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, the strongest U.S. measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years.  The sanctions aim to freeze sale proceeds from PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day of crude to the United States, the OPEC member’s largest crude importer. Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions, while U.S. companies that buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work-arounds, seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third-party intermediaries, such as commodity merchants, can continue. “The main risks for supply could come from a violent confrontation within the country, damaging the oil infrastructure,” analyst Carsten Menke at Julius Baer said. “Yet the risks of such an event seem very low,” he added. “This oil will find its way to the market.” GRAPHIC: Venezuela vs U.S. crude oil production - tmsnrt.rs/2HH4Otd Market participants remained worried about global economic growth, which has shown signs of slowing amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies. Officials from Washington and Beijing launched a new round of trade talks on Wednesday. The two sides have slapped hefty import tariffs on each other’s goods.  China reported its lowest annual economic growth in nearly 30 years last week, adding to a litany of worrying economic data from Europe and East Asia.

2019-01-30,"KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Security forces detained the daughter of Sudanese opposition leader Sadiq al-Mahdi on Wednesday, her family said, as anti-government protests spread to the capital’s main university. Two security vehicles arrived at Mariam Sadiq al-Mahdi’s home in Khartoum in the morning and took her away, her sister Rabah told Reuters, a day after Sudan’s security chief ordered the release of dozens of detained protesters. There was no immediate comment from the government. Mariam is deputy head of the opposition Umma Party headed by her father - who is Sudan’s last democratically elected prime minister and was overthrown by President Omar al-Bashir in a coup in 1989. She has supported a wave of protests that have shaken cities across Sudan since Dec. 19. Demonstrators, frustrated with bread and fuel shortages and other economic hardships, have called for the end of Bashir’s three-decade rule. Rights groups say at least 45 people have been killed. The government puts the death count at 30. Around 250 professors from the University of Khartoum protested on campus on Wednesday, demanding a new transitional administration to replace the current one.  About 510 of the university’s professors signed a memo calling for the creation of a “sovereign body” to form a new  government and oversee a four-year transitional period. The university educated many of Sudan’s leading politicians and has been the scene of protests and unrest throughout the country’s tempestuous history. “The University of Khartoum’s role as an academic institution is to find solutions for the peaceful transfer of power,” Montasser al-Tayeb, one of the professors, told reporters. Sadiq al-Mahdi returned to Sudan last month from nearly a year in self-imposed exile and called for a democratic transition before thousands of supporters. He was overthrown by an alliance of Islamists and military commanders, led by Bashir, that still forms the nucleus of the ruling National Congress Party.

2019-01-30,"Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. homes and businesses will likely use record amounts of natural gas for heating on Wednesday as an Arctic-like freeze blankets the eastern half of the country, according to energy analysts. Harsh winds brought record-low temperatures across much of the Midwest, unnerving even residents accustomed to brutal winters and keeping them huddled indoors as offices closed and mail carriers halted their rounds. That brutal cold could also temporarily reduce gas production by causing freeze-offs in the Marcellus and Utica shale, the nation’s biggest gas producing region, in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, the analysts warned. Freeze-offs occur when water and other liquids in gathering lines freeze, blocking the flow of gas. Overnight lows on Wednesday-Friday will drop to -20 Fahrenheit (-29 Celsius) in Chicago and the single digits along the East Coast from New York to Boston, according to AccuWeather, a weather forecaster. The cold, however, will be short lived with high temperatures in New York and Chicago expected to rise into the 40s F this weekend. The normal high at this time of year is 32 in Chicago and 39 in New York. Financial data provider Refinitiv predicted gas demand in the Lower 48 U.S. states would hit a daily record of 145.2 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Wednesday as consumers crank up their heaters to escape the bitter cold. That would top the current all-time high of 144.6 bcfd set on Jan. 1, 2018. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. In early estimates, gas production in the Lower 48 states will slip about 0.9 bcfd to 85.8 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. That is the lowest daily output since Enbridge Inc started to restore flows through some gas pipes in Ohio following a pipeline explosion there on Jan. 21. “Based on our analysis of historical freeze-offs, temperature conditions forecasted for Jan. 30-31 pose a risk of a freeze-off occurring in the Marcellus/Utica...in the ballpark of 1 bcfd,” said Rishi Iyengar, senior analyst natural gas markets at IHS Markit’s OPIS PointLogic. In early estimates, Marcellus/Utica production was down about 0.7 bcfd to 29.6 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv. Iyengar said current forecasts were not cold enough to impact production in the Bakken shale in North Dakota because drillers there have invested in equipment needed to handle extremely low temperatures. In the spot market, next-day prices for Wednesday for power at PJM West EL-PK-PJMW-SNL in western Pennsylvania and gas in Chicago NG-CG-CH-SNL both rose to their highest in a year as demand for heating spiked. PJM, the electric grid operator for all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois, forecast power demand would reach about 142,000 megawatts (MW) on Thursday, approaching the region’s all-time winter peak of 143,295 MW on Feb. 20, 2015. PJM said it has “robust reserves and does not expect to have any capacity issues” in meeting demand. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes.

2019-01-30,"(Adds more companies that partner with Venezuela’s PDVSA) Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry on Monday, looking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of revenue. The sanctions limit transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. However, there are currently numerous unanswered questions about the sanctions. The United States is aiming to freeze sale proceeds from Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. There is also a prohibition on U.S firms exporting diluents - unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude - to Venezuela. Venezuela exports oil primarily to the United States, India, and China, as well as some other nations. Only the United States and India are notable sources of cash, as Russian and Chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated oil-for-loan agreements due to Venezuela’s heavy liabilities with those countries. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refineries. However, they stipulate that refiners cannot make payments directly to PDVSA, but into escrow accounts that PDVSA will not be able to access until the company is controlled by a new government. Maduro and Manuel Quevedo, who is both oil minister and head of PDVSA, have said that they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the United States to leave the country’s ports without being prepaid. PDVSA on Tuesday said it was considering declaring force majeure on cargoes bound for the United States. For now, companies can do business but with restrictions. Refineries that import from Venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to shift their supply sources elsewhere. However, since payments cannot be made to PDVSA, this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States. The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Chevron Corp, Halliburton, Schlumberger , Baker Hughes and Weatherford International all have operations in Venezuela, and are allowed to continue to engage in transactions and activities with PDVSA and its joint ventures through July 27. Venezuela’s production could fall further later this year if the service companies, which have already reduced operations, finally leave the country. Chevron has four joint-venture operations in the country, and said it would not comment on the current situation in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil both left Venezuela years ago after late President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil industry. NON-U.S. PDVSA PARTNERS IN VENEZUELA Norway’s Equinor has a 9.7 percent stake in a heavy oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt area, which is majority owned by PDVSA. The company also has a 51 percent stake in a Plataforma Deltana block off eastern Venezuela, and it has 25 employees in Venezuela. “We are just following the situation and making sure that we safeguard our employees,” Equinor’s spokesman said about the political developments and impact on the company’s operations. Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft and China’s CNPC each hold substantial interests in several oilfields in Venezuela, which dwarf those of any other country. Spain’s Repsol, France’s Total, Italy’s Eni, Japan’s Inpex and India’s ONGC Videsh also own minority oilfield stakes. Russia’s Lukoil was part of a Russian consortium to develop production in Venezuela but quit several years ago and has since then sharply reduced its presence in the country. Citgo Petroleum is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA and operates refining capacity to process about 750,000 bpd. It also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation’s retail fuel market. The United States has exempted Citgo from its sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. As of September, the company had about $500 million in cash and a credit line of approximately $900 million, according to a creditor familiar with the company’s financial statements. Citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from PDVSA for three more months, according to the sanctions. The sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents (heavy naphtha) to PDVSA, which are used for making the country’s extra heavy crude oil ready for export. The OPEC member’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela and PDVSA are estimated to owe more than $100 billion to bondholders, suppliers, allied governments, lenders and creditors holding judgments. Some creditors have gone to U.S. courts to try to seize Citgo to satisfy their legal claims. Reporting By David Gaffen, Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga,

Their birthplace, Kamfers Dam in the Northern Cape, is one of only three breeding grounds for the famously pink birds in Southern Africa, the other two being in Namibia and Botswana, according to researcher Katta Ludynia. The rescued chicks take three to four months to fledge, and it is not yet clear whether they will eventually be released back into the wild in Cape Town or transported back hundreds of km (miles) to their home in Kimberley, she said.   “There are still several thousand birds breeding in the dam in areas that still have water,” said Katta Ludynia, research manager at the Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds (SANCCOB). “It now depends on the water levels whether these birds will pull through.” Ludynia said the sanctuary was caring for around 550 chicks, most of them dehydrated when they first arrived on Monday after being abandoned by parents who went off in search of food.  The chicks are being moved to the sanctuary by plane and road. SANCCOB is one of several centres across South Africa caring for around 2,000 chicks that were rescued from the dam. Although it hosts the biggest population of lesser flamingoes in southern Africa, Kamfers Dam, situated to the north of Kimberley, is often dry and depends mainly on rain water. It also gets some water from a sewerage works that releases water into its wetlands. “The dam in Kimberley is so important because it is manageable, so we can secure the water level there and that might be the only site the flamingoes can breed in Southern Africa, if the drought continues in other areas,” Ludynia said.

2019-01-30,"DUBAI/GENEVA (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia released seven prisoners it was holding from Yemen’s Houthi movement, who were flown to the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa on Wednesday by the Red Cross, the day after a Saudi prisoner freed by the Houthis arrived in Riyadh. The apparent swap comes as Yemen’s warring parties are still hammering out details of a larger prisoner exchange that they agreed last month as a confidence-building gesture at the first major peace talks of the nearly four-year-old war. The U.N. special envoy to Yemen, Martin Griffiths, welcomed the release and said he hoped it would encourage the rapid implementation of the larger prisoner swap.  “The [special envoy] is very encouraged by this positive spirit from the two parties,” his office said on Twitter. The war pits the Iran-aligned Houthis who control the capital Sanaa and most population centres against a government now based in the southern port of Aden, backed by forces from Arab states. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which provided the planes for both the freed Saudi and the seven freed Yemenis, said in a statement it had acted as a neutral intermediary and was not involved in negotiations over the releases. “We are delighted these persons will soon be home,” Yahia Alibi, head of the ICRC Regional delegation in Kuwait, said in a statement. “We stand ready to act as a neutral intermediary so that thousands more affected by this conflict can return to their families.” The United Nations is pushing for the warring parties to carry out the agreed prisoner exchange and implement a ceasefire in the main port city of Hodeidah to pave the way for a second round of discussions to end a war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.

2019-01-30,"VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog policing Iran’s deal with major powers said on Wednesday that attempts to pressure it on inspections were “counter-productive and extremely harmful”, though it stopped short of naming those responsible. Israel, which vehemently opposes the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, has called on the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit what it says is a “secret atomic warehouse” and other locations in Iran. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has pulled his country out of the deal, has made similar calls. The IAEA has bristled at such calls but used only guarded language in public, saying it does not take information at face value and assesses it independently, and then only sends inspectors to a specific location when necessary. In a speech to staff on Wednesday, however, IAEA chief Yukiya Amano was blunt. “If our credibility is thrown into question and, in particular, if attempts are made to micro-manage or put pressure on the agency in nuclear verification, that is counter-productive and extremely harmful,” he said, according to a text of the speech posted online by the IAEA. He did not elaborate on the attempts or those behind them. The IAEA is policing the restrictions placed on Iran’s nuclear activities under the deal, which also lifted international sanctions against Tehran. Amano reiterated that Iran was continuing to keep its end of the bargain. Trump on Wednesday called top U.S. intelligence chiefs “extremely passive and naive” on Iran, a day after they contradicted his views in congressional testimony. Amano was also more direct in making the case for his agency to be in charge of inspections in North Korea in the event of any political agreement being reached on that country’s nuclear activities. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are due to hold their second summit in late February.  “The IAEA is the only international organisation that can verify the nuclear programme of the DPRK,” said Amano, using the acronym of the country’s official name — the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Amano, a Japanese diplomat, has previously said his agency is best placed to do that job. It has not been granted access to North Korea since 2009, when Pyongyang threw out its inspectors. “As far as the nuclear programme of the DPRK is concerned, we remain ready to play an essential verification role if a political agreement is reached among countries concerned,” he said.

About 36,420 pounds of Tyson’s ‘White Meat Panko’ chicken nuggets will be recalled after several consumers complained of extraneous material in the purchased product, the FSIS said.  There have been no confirmed reports of bad reactions after consuming the recalled panko chicken nuggets, the FSIS said. The latest news comes on the heels of Tyson’s recall in June last year of 3,120 pounds of breaded chicken tenderloins, after a supplier notified that an ingredient may contain pieces of blue and clear soft plastic.

2019-01-30,"Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States imposed heavy sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry on Monday, looking to cut off President Nicolas Maduro’s primary source of revenue. The sanctions limit transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. However, there are currently numerous unanswered questions about the sanctions. The United States is aiming to freeze sale proceeds from Venezuelan state-run oil firm PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude to the United States. There is also a prohibition on U.S firms exporting diluents - unfinished oils used for blending extra heavy crude - to Venezuela. Venezuela exports oil primarily to the United States, India, and China, as well as some other nations. Only the United States and India are notable sources of cash, as Russian and Chinese firms currently get shipments of crude through complicated oil-for-loan agreements due to Venezuela’s heavy liabilities with those countries. The U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions do not entirely cut off purchases of Venezuelan oil by U.S. refineries. However, they stipulate that refiners cannot make payments directly to PDVSA, but into escrow accounts that PDVSA will not be able to access until the company is controlled by a new government. Maduro and Manuel Quevedo, who is both oil minister and head of PDVSA, have said that they will not allow vessels loaded with crude oil for the United States to leave the country’s ports without being prepaid. PDVSA on Tuesday said it was considering declaring force majeure on cargoes bound for the United States. For now, companies can do business but with restrictions. Refineries that import from Venezuela can continue to receive shipments for the next few months before they are forced to shift their supply sources elsewhere. However, since payments cannot be made to PDVSA, this is expected to restrict the flow of crude oil from Venezuela to the United States. The sanctions did not directly mention swaps and indirect trade with PDVSA that began in recent years with customers including PDVSA’s U.S. unit Citgo Petroleum, India’s Reliance and Russia’s Rosneft. Chevron Corp, Halliburton, Schlumberger , Baker Hughes and Weatherford International all have operations in Venezuela, and are allowed to continue to engage in transactions and activities with PDVSA and its joint ventures through July 27. This could cause Venezuela’s production to fall further later this year if service companies, which have already reduced operations, finally leave the country. Chevron has four joint-venture operations in the country, and said it would not comment on the current situation in Venezuela. ConocoPhillips and Exxon Mobil both left Venezuela years ago after late President Hugo Chavez nationalized the oil industry there. NON-U.S. OPERATORS IN VENEZUELA Norway’s Equinor has a 9.7 percent stake in a heavy oil project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt area, which is majority owned by PDVSA. The company also has a 51 percent stake in a Plataforma Deltana block off eastern Venezuela, and it has 25 employees in Venezuela. “We are just following the situation and making sure that we safeguard our employees,” Equinor’s spokesman said about the political developments and impact on the company’s operations. Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft holds substantial interest in several oilfields in Venezuela, part of the nation’s reserves, which dwarf those of any other country. Russia’s Lukoil was part of a Russian consortium to develop production in Venezuela but quit several years ago and has since then sharply reduced its presence in the country. Citgo Petroleum is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA and operates refining capacity to process about 750,000 bpd. It also distributes fuel to gasoline stations throughout the United States, accounting for about 4 percent of the nation’s retail fuel market. The United States has exempted Citgo from its sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. As of September, the company had about $500 million in cash and a credit line of approximately $900 million, according to a creditor familiar with the company’s financial statements. Citgo is able to keep importing crude oil from PDVSA for three more months, according to the sanctions. The sanctions expressly prohibit sales of diluents (heavy naphtha) to PDVSA, which are used for making the country’s extra heavy crude oil ready for export. The OPEC member’s oil production has dwindled in the last two decades, from more than 3 million bpd at the beginning of the century to between 1.2 million and 1.4 million bpd by late 2018. Most of the crude it produces now is heavy or extra heavy. Venezuela and PDVSA are estimated to owe more than $100 billion to bondholders, suppliers, allied governments, lenders and creditors holding judgments. Some creditors have gone to U.S. courts to try to seize Citgo to satisfy their legal claims. Reporting By David Gaffen, Luc Cohen, Marianna Parraga,

2019-01-30,"OSLO (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc (NDAQ.O) on Wednesday made a rival bid for Oslo Bors VPS OSLO.NFF, setting up a takeover battle with Euronext (ENX.PA) for the 200-year-old Norwegian stock market operator.     Nasdaq’s bid of 152 Norwegian crowns per share, valuing Oslo Bors at 6.54 billion crowns ($771 million), topped Euronext’s bid of 145 crowns per share. Nasdaq’s bid plan has the unanimous backing of the Oslo exchange’s board as well as 30 percent of shareholders. Euronext has said shareholders representing just over 50 percent of Oslo Bors’ shares had committed to sell at its offer price of 145 Norwegian crowns and that those investors could not sell to anyone else. Nasdaq’s offer is the latest sign of moves to consolidate among stock market groups. The London Stock Exchange (LSE.L) also announced plans on Wednesday to buy a minority stake in Euroclear, Europe’s biggest settlement house for securities, giving it a role in trading, clearing and settlement. Nasdaq, which already operates seven exchanges across the Nordic and Baltic countries, said it wanted to create a true Nordic capital market. “It is a long way from Paris to Oslo. Being near companies is important,” Oslo Bors VPS CEO Bente Landsnes told a news conference. “We feel that being part of Nasdaq would make it easier to influence future developments.” Any deal will need approval from Norway’s finance ministry and its financial supervisory authority, Finanstilsynet (FSA). They have up to five months to make their views clear, Landsnes said.  “Shareholders who committed to sell to Euronext ... would be able to sell to Nasdaq only if conditions to the offer, such as regulatory approvals and due diligence, are not met,” a source close to the matter said. “There will be two applications for regulatory approval in parallel. That is messy. To seal the deal, they (Euronext) could up the offer and chase off Nasdaq,” the source said. “Finanstilsynet will base its processing of the application concerning the acquisition of a significant portion of Oslo Bors’ shares on current regulations and cannot make any further comment regarding this process at the present time,” an FSA spokesman said.  According to Norwegian legislation, approval can only be given  if the buyer is considered to be suitable to ensure “the sound and prudent management” of Oslo Bors, said a finance ministry spokeswoman, declining to give specific comments about the Nasdaq or Euronext offers. A Euronext spokeswoman reiterated that Oslo Bors shareholders representing more than 45 percent of the shares had committed irrevocably to sell their shares to Euronext even if a higher bid was presented by another company. Euronext also owns a 5.3 percent stake in Oslo Bors it bought in December. Nasdaq said it could merge Oslo Bors with Nasdaq Commodities, the Nordic power market, based in Norway.  “You can safely say that for Nasdaq, if the deal goes through, we would have a very strong center of excellence for commodities in Oslo,” Nasdaq Nordic President Lauri Rosendahl told Reuters. He did not give a specific timeline. For its part, Euronext has said it wants to use Oslo Bors as a launchpad for Nordic expansion and a center for its commodities activities. Norwegian bank DNB (DNB.OL), Oslo Bors’ biggest shareholder with close to 20 percent, said it would sell to Nasdaq, as did pension provider KLP, which holds 10 percent and Sparebanken Vest (SVEG.OL) with 1.6 percent stake. All three had previously suggested they would not accept Euronext’s bid. “With the options that are now available, we believe that Nasdaq will offer the strategically best solution for the Norwegian capital market and for the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS),” DNB said. Nasdaq will formally launch its offer on Feb. 4, and its application for regulatory approval would follow right after that, Rosendahl told Reuters, without specifying an exact date. Founded in 1819, the Oslo Bors until recently said it could best serve Norwegian investors and companies by remaining independent, but following Euronext’s bid last month the exchange quickly looked for an alternative buyer. Nasdaq called on Euronext to withdraw its offer and told shareholders to let their promises to Euronext expire.  “Two hints: Euronext can change their minds,” Rosendahl told Reuters. “And the (shareholder) undertakings have an expiry date, in August this year, if they are not executed on.”  ($1 = 8.4877 Norwegian crowns) Additional reporting by Inti Landauro in Paris, editing by Louise Heavens/Alexander Smith/Jane Merriman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/oslo-bors-vps-ma-nasdaq/update-4-nasdaq-bids-771-mln-for-oslo-bors-in-euronext-challenge-idUKL5N1ZU6Y4,30 Jan 2019,"* Latest consolidation move among European exchanges

2019-01-30,"(Updates with tender for Sabine Pass cargoes, adds background) LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - India’s state-owned gas distribution company Gail has flooded the liquefied natural gas (LNG) market this month with offers to sell cargoes from the U.S. Gulf due to a shortage of tankers available to ferry to fuel to India. The Indian importer has 20-year deals to buy 5.8 million tonnes a year of U.S. LNG, split between Dominion Energy’s Cove Point plant and Cheniere Energy’s Sabine Pass site. On Wednesday, Gail issued two tenders to sell U.S. volumes, trade sources said. In one tender, Gail has offered to sell a cargo from the Cove Point plant on Apr. 27-29 and buy a cargo for delivery in India on Feb. 20-22 or March 1-7. In another tender, it has offered two cargoes for loading from Sabine Pass, one cargo for lifting in July and another in November. The tender closes on Feb. 1. “(Gail is) inherently short (on shipping)... They are certainly not able to lift all the cargoes they have from the U.S. on the tonnage they have,” a shipbroker said. The two tenders came less than two weeks after Gail offered cargoes from Cove Point and three from Sabine Pass for loading in 2020. There was strong demand for these cargoes, with winners including Glencore, sources said. UK-based BP could also be one of the winners as it is long on shipping and may use the volumes to optimise the use of its fleet, sources said. Last year, Gail also made several swap deals with U.S. volumes.

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 24 hours after the United States announced large-scale sanctions on Venezuela’s nationally owned oil company, merchant trading firms and refiners were still deciphering what the measures prohibited. The sanctions, announced on Monday, are aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, the strongest U.S. measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years. Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions, while U.S. companies that buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work-arounds, seeking counsel for instance on whether they can continue to use third party intermediaries, such as commodity merchants.  The sanctions here froze assets of state-run PDVSA and require U.S. firms to pay for oil using accounts controlled by the country's opposition party head and self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido. PDVSA is seeking to sidestep the restrictions by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, sources said. Oil sanctions in the past have been evaded by using intermediaries, said Scott Maberry, who specializes in international trade at Sheppard Mullin law firm, but he doubted that would happen with PDVSA. “I would not be surprised if this administration is vigilant and does not feel bound by past practices,” said Maberry. A U.S. Department of Treasury spokesman called the sanctions against PDVSA “extremely sophisticated,” adding that the department would “take questions from industry and stakeholders and issue FAQs as appropriate.”  No FAQ (frequently asked questions) had been issued by Wednesday morning. “It is unlike (Treasury) to roll out an action like this without some clear guidance,” said a former Treasury official familiar with the sanctions.  “If you want to help refiners, third-party processors, and other companies understand and comply with these sanctions, especially if they are non-U.S. persons, this type of guidance is essential.”  Via PDVSA, Venezuela exports about 500,000 barrels of oil daily to the United States, mostly to PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum and U.S. companies Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp. It also imports products from the United States.  The sanctions not only limit U.S. companies from paying PDVSA for crude, but also oil sales moved through multiple third parties, such as potential arrangements involving sending oil to Russia or China, which would later sell to an intermediary that would pass the oil on to U.S. buyers.  Intermediaries that comply with U.S. sanctions in general and transact in U.S. dollars would still be subject to the Venezuela sanctions. Transactions sent through a multitude of parties would only be allowed if the revenues were sent to accounts inaccessible by Maduro’s government, several sources said. “Treasury will be tracking this closely. The idea that this can get laundered and not tracked is far-fetched,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and a former Energy Department official under President George W. Bush.       The Trump administration has said the restrictions should have a minimal impact on U.S. consumers, but some experts said they were concerned there could be unanticipated effects.  “PDVSA has so many intertwined dealings and transactions with the U.S., including through Citgo, that the immediate impact of these sanctions is far more comprehensive on the U.S. economy than you would typically see,” said Scott Flicker, chair of the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings and head of the firm’s global trade controls practice.  The United States exempted Citgo from sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends.  Analysts at Tudor, Pickering & Holt said that if Citgo was unable to import Venezuelan barrels, “some sort of impact on operations seems like a distinct possibility.”  Several refining sources said they assumed the administration was trying to introduce sanctions slowly to avoid an immediate shock, but the lack of clarity has caused them to quickly look for cargoes elsewhere as they cut off Venezuelan shipments.  U.S. refiners last week asked the administration not to issue sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday.  “Such a ban would further tighten the heavy sour crude market in the United States, resulting in higher crude prices for U.S. refineries and higher fuel costs for U.S. consumers,” the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association, said in a Jan. 23 letter to President Donald Trump.

2019-01-30,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Surging production of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) and slower growth of demand in Asia this year could leave companies that have committed to long-term purchase contracts struggling to find markets. Several European and Asian utilities have signed up to  long-term deals for U.S. LNG that last 10 to 15 years.  When they signed up five years or so ago, buyers were confident Asia could soak up any extra supplies produced by the U.S. LNG industry, which at the time had barely got going. But forecasts for Asian LNG demand have been reined in, despite strong growth in China last year, while U.S. output has been shooting up. U.S. capacity is expected to hit 65.2 million tonnes a year (mtpa) by the end of 2019 from 36.8 mtpa in 2018. “You’ve seen some European utilities getting into the U.S. and I’m not sure it’s going well. There are some contracts where they probably wish they hadn’t,” said David Cox, who runs London Energy Consulting. Asian demand is still expanding. China’s LNG imports in December climbed 25 percent from the same period a year earlier to a monthly record of 6.29 million tonnes. But the 2018 surge was exceptional. The spurt at the end of the year was in part due to Chinese firms stockpiling supplies to avoid a repeat of last winter’s gas shortages. Analysts at IHS Markit and Wood Mackenzie expect growth to slow to 15-20 percent this year, as China eases up on its push to switch to gas from coal for heating. As a result, some U.S. companies are pinning their hopes on Europe. When U.S. Cheniere Energy started two new LNG facilities at the end of last year, it led to record amounts of U.S. cargoes heading to Europe. “The equation is very, very simple at the moment. Supply is coming on, Asia is growing. The extent to which supply beats Asia, we’ll see supply coming into Europe,” said Andrew Walker, vice president of strategy at Cheniere Marketing. Europe consumes half a trillion cubic meters of natural gas a year, far more than the total global LNG market, which stood at 300 mtpa at the end of 2018. But most European supplies come via pipeline, much of it from Russia. Despite Washington’s push to wean European states off those supplies, there is little sign of major shift yet. European utilities such as Centrica, RWE, Iberdrola and EDF do not face an immediate crunch. Some long-term U.S. contracts only kick in later this year. But some buyers in the Asian market have already been offloading commitments to buy U.S. LNG, including Australia’s Woodside Petroleum, GAIL (India) and Indonesia’s Pertamina. Japan’s Toshiba paid $800 million to transfer its obligation to buy 2.2 mtpa from a U.S. terminal. Europe also made an attractive market for U.S. LNG when shipping rates spiked last year because it is closer than Asian markets to U.S. terminals, which lie on the eastern side of the United States. Elena Sidorochkina, head of LNG at the trading arm of Austria’s energy company OMV, said high shipping rates could force more cooperation and partnerships between buyers.   “If there is a lack of shipping, the offtakers will have to find a different way of placing them (cargoes),” she said. Tokyo Gas and RWE and Centrica have already reached deals to combine some shipping and delivery arrangements. “There will be a day when shipping capacity will be traded in the same way you trade LNG — you will have shipping futures contracts,” said Patrick Dugas, head of LNG trading at Total. “It will be part of the trading tools.” Reporting by Sabina Zawadzki; Editing by Edmund Blair",https://uk.reuters.com/article/lng-trade/offtakers-face-challenge-as-asia-demand-lags-surging-u-s-lng-output-idUKL1N1ZT0HX,30 Jan 2019,"Surging production of U.S.

Oil prices rose more than 1 percent, lifted by the potential for supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry and gold retreated from an eight-month high as the jobs data boosted the dollar. Britain’s blue-chip stock index jumped more than 1 percent after British lawmakers late Tuesday rejected a proposal in Parliament that aimed to prevent a potentially chaotic “no-deal” Brexit, a vote that initially pushed sterling sharply lower. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks share performance in 47 countries, rose 0.32 percent following gains in Asia overnight. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading shares in Europe rose 0.21 percent. Upbeat results from Boeing and Apple late Tuesday provided investors relief as they awaited a Fed policy statement later in the session and U.S.-China trade talks started in Washington. Boeing Co shares jumped after the world’s largest planemaker raised its profit and cash flow expectations for 2019 amid a boom in air travel. Boeing also indicated it had overcome supplier delays that snarled 737 production last year. Apple results provided some reassurance as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business. Boeing shares rose 6.75 percent and Apple gained 4.95 percent. Investors had been pricing in a U.S. recession and company results show such a slowdown is not on the horizon, Steven Chiavarone, portfolio manager with Federated Investors in New York. “The market should be higher and it’s going to continue to be higher,” Chiavarone said. “To put it bluntly, a recession ain’t going to happen, and the earnings numbers are confirming that it isn’t going to happen.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.23 points, or 1.12 percent, to 24,856.19. The S&P 500 gained 13.71 points, or 0.52 percent, to 2,653.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 59.28 points, or 0.84 percent, to 7,087.57. Payrolls processor ADP reported that the U.S. private sector added 213,000 jobs in January, which beat forecasts for gains of 178,000. But the monthly total was lower than the 271,000 jobs added in December. The exporter-heavy FTSE 100 in London rose 1.45 percent as its components often are boosted by a weaker pound because its multinational companies earn a large portion of their revenue abroad in foreign currency. Sterling rose 0.04 percent to $1.3071 after sliding about 0.7 percent against the dollar and the euro following parliamentary votes on Brexit. “The vote is not fundamentally changing the way the market’s talking about Brexit,” said Hetal Mehta, Legal & General Investment Management senior European economist. The dollar index rose 0.06 percent to 95.878. Against the yen, the dollar rose 0.17 percent to 109.57. The euro fell 0.07 percent to $1.1422. Investors expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell during a scheduled press conference to reiterate the U.S. central bank’s willingness to pause the hiking of interest rates when needed. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes fell 5/32 in price to push yields up 2.7276 percent.

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose less than expected last week due to a drop in imports, while gasoline and distillate inventories fell as refiners slowed down production, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 919,000 barrels in the week to Jan. 25, compared with analysts’ expectations for an increase of 3.2 million barrels. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub for U.S. crude futures USOICC=ECI fell by 145,000 barrels, EIA said. “The report was supportive due to the much smaller-than-expected decline in crude oil inventories,” said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital Management.  Crude oil futures extended gains after the data was released, with U.S. crude CLc1 up 95 cents a barrel at $54.26 by 10:51 a.m. EST (1551 GMT).  Net U.S. crude imports USOICI=ECI fell last week by 1 million barrels per day.  “A precipitous drop in imports has helped stave off another big build to crude stocks,” said Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData.  The decline in imports helped offset the impact of a substantial drop in refining activity, he said. Refinery crude runs USOICR=ECI fell by 586,000 barrels per day, EIA data showed. Refinery utilization rates USOIRU=ECI fell by 2.8 percentage points to 90.1 percent of total capacity, the slowest rate of production since early November. After eight straight weeks of builds, gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI fell 2.2 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 1.9 million-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles USOILD=ECI, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 1.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.4 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed.

2019-01-30," (This Jan 29 story has been corrected in paragraph 10 to remove reference to top creditors, which erroneously included banks that act as trustees on bond indentures with no direct credit exposure) By Subrat Patnaik (Reuters) - Utility owner PG&E Corp filed for bankruptcy protection on Tuesday in anticipation of liabilities from California wildfires, including a catastrophic 2018 blaze that killed 86 people.  PG&E, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California and employs 24,000 people, vowed to keep the lights on as it grapples with fire-related costs it estimates at more than $30 billion.  “The power and gas will stay on ... We are not ‘going out of business,’ and there will be no disruption in the services you expect from us,” interim Chief Executive John Simon said in a letter to customers.  The San Francisco-based owner of the biggest U.S. power utility warned in November it could face significant liability in excess of its insurance coverage if its equipment was found to have caused the Camp Fire that destroyed Paradise, California, last year.  The blaze broke out on Nov. 8, killing at least 86 people in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history.  State investigators had earlier cleared PG&E of liability in a 2017 wildfire in California’s wine country, but the company still faces dozens of lawsuits from owners of homes and businesses that burned during that and other 2017 fires. Reinsurance company Munich Re called November’s Camp Fire the world’s most expensive natural disaster of 2018 and pegged overall losses at $16.5 billion. Filing for bankruptcy would shield PG&E from claims, giving it time to figure out next steps. PG&E is seeking court approval for $5.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing from J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Barclays, Citi, and other banks, it said. The sum is roughly equal to PG&E’s annual spending. PG&E listed assets of $71.39 billion and liabilities of $51.69 billion as of Sept. 30 in the voluntary Chapter 11 document filed in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.  It carries a debt load of more than $18 billion. Company advisers expect that it may take up to two years to emerge from bankruptcy. PG&E shares, which lost three-quarters of its value from its 52-week high before the Camp Fire, were up 6 percent at $12.74 in morning trading. PG&E subsidiary Pacific Gas and Electric Company filed for bankruptcy in 2001. BlueMountain Capital Management LLC said it would propose a slate of board directors by Feb. 21, and urged stakeholders to support change at the company. The hedge fund could potentially be in line to sit on an equity committee that a bankruptcy judge appoints. PG&E must also contend with worried suppliers. Federal energy regulators said on Friday they had joint jurisdiction with a bankruptcy court over requests to cancel or renegotiate power contracts by PG&E. The was a win for power producers that supply PG&E with solar and wind power, including NextEra Energy Inc. Last year, lawmakers gave PG&E permission to raise rates to cover wildfire losses from 2017. But elected officials have shown little appetite for new rate hikes or other maneuvers to prevent a bankruptcy filing.

2019-01-30,"* Proposed increase would be the highest in years * Comes as France grapples with protests over cost of living * Government has three months to respond to CRE’s proposal * EDF shares up 3.4 pct, one of top performers in index (Adds CRE document, ministry comment, share price) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - France’s energy regulator is proposing a 5.9 percent increase in regulated power prices but faces opposition from the government which had promised not to increase the cost after the “yellow vest” protests. Following the first wave of protests in November over the cost of living, the government scrapped fuel tax hikes planned for 2019. It also said last month that it would prevent utility EDF from raising power prices this winter. But capping regulated power prices is more complicated as these are set by the independent CRE energy regulator via a formula which includes the cost of generation, transport and distribution. A third of retail power bills is made up of taxes. The government has three months to respond to the CRE proposal, but said on Wednesday it would keep its promise. “We will use legal delays in order to protect households from too big an increase in their power bill at a time of high consumption,” an environment ministry official said. Thousands of “yellow vest” demonstrators again marched in Paris and other French cities last Saturday in protests that brought sporadic clashes with police and suggested that President Emmanuel Macron has yet to defuse public discontent after 11 weeks of demonstrations. Confirming a report in financial daily Les Echos, a CRE official said the regulator proposes a 7.7 percent increase excluding taxes from March 1, or 5.9 percent tax included. The proposed increase would be the highest in years and would be applicable to the 25.6 million consumers who still subscribe to EDF’s regulated tariffs. EDF shares were up 3.4 percent and were the sixth-best performer in the SBF 120 index. The proposed rise mainly reflects the increase of wholesale power market prices. A doubling of back-up power capacity prices also contributed. Year-ahead wholesale power prices have risen from 35 euros per megawatt hour early 2017 to 41 euros early 2018 and 59 euros in December 2018. EDF has been losing some 100,000 customers a month to competitors, but end September the former monopolist still had a 79.3 percent market share. Power price freezes by previous governments have been overruled by the courts as smaller power vendors challenged them in court, saying they distort competition. CRE said one way for the state to limit power bills would be to reduce the CSPE tax, which helps finance renewable energy subsidies and social tariffs for low-income families. It accounts for 15 percent of a consumer bills, and raised 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion) last year. CRE said Spain and Italy were also increasing power tariffs by up to eight percent. At 171 euros/MW, regulated French pre-tax power prices are below the 200 euro EU average and just two thirds of the 300-290 euros paid in Germany and Belgium.

2019-01-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swedish oil firm Lundin Petroleum, a partner in Norway’s giant Johan Sverdrup oilfield, raised its output expectations and dividend payment plans on Wednesday after beating fourth-quarter core profit forecasts. The company plans to drill 15 exploration wells this year, a record, with a goal of discovering more than 750 million barrels of oil equivalent in potential new resources, it told an investor presentation in London. Lundin now expects output of over 150,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, up from a previous forecast of more than 130,000 boepd and compared with 81,100 boepd in 2018. In 2023, output is expected to exceed 170,000 boepd, up from an earlier target of more than 160,000 boepd. The increase will come primarily from the startup of the Johan Sverdrup oilfield, the largest North Sea discovery in more than 30 years, but also from existing fields and other soon-to-be-developed assets, it said. “Growing production and low cost is our main message,” Lundin Chief Operating Officer Nick Walker said. Lundin, 20 percent owned by Norway’s Equinor, said it would pay a 2018 dividend of $500 million (382 million pounds), or $1.48 per share, higher than the $1.10 per share expected by analysts. Lundin will switch to quarterly dividend payments, with a plan of maintaining or increasing the dividend over time in line with its financial performance. “Our dividends are sustainable at below $50 a barrel, and not many companies can say that,” Chief Executive Alex Schneiter told Reuters. North Sea oil  currently sells at around $62 per barrel. Lundin’s fourth-quarter earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose to $448.5 million from $429.8 million a year earlier, topping the $440 million expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. The company’s 2019 production is seen between 75,000 and 95,000 barrels per day, depending on when Sverdrup’s first phase begins operations. Start-up is scheduled for November, the company reiterated. Lundin shares had gained 4.2 percent by 1513 GMT, making them the best performer on the European Oil and Gas Index, which rose 0.4 percent.

2019-01-30,"DUESSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) - Municipal shareholders in RWE have called on Germany’s biggest power producer to drive a hard bargain in talks with the government over compensation for a planned phase-out of coal-fired power plants. A government-appointed commission has proposed Germany shut down all of its coal power stations by 2038 at the latest, recommending at least 40 billion euros (35 billion pounds) in aid to the regions affected. The move deals a particular blow to RWE, which operates 13.3 gigawatt (GW) of lignite and hard coal-fired power plants in Germany, significantly more than smaller peers LEAG, EnBW, Uniper, Steag and Vattenfall “From the municipalities’ point of view, the decisions can only be absorbed financially if there is adequate compensation,” said Ernst Gerlach, head of VkA, which represents RWE’s municipal shareholders. “RWE should take a tough stance in the pending negotiations over power plant shutdowns,” he said on Wednesday. In a sign that the commission’s proposals could be watered down by the coalition parties, a key lawmaker from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives also criticised the recommended steps. Gerlach said the municipalities hold about 18 percent in RWE after some cities and regional authorities sold shares in the group following years of poor performance. Shares are down 78 percent from their all-time high in 2008. RWE has said that the commission proposals, which foresee 12.7 GW of plant closures by 2022, would cause severe job cuts at the group, which employs about 10,000 staff in the Rhenish coal mining area alone. “We are very concerned by the looming staff reduction. An RWE worker driving an excavator cannot simply find a new adequate job,” Gerlach said. Joachim Pfeiffer, spokesman for economic affairs in Merkel’s conservative bloc, said the proposed measures would push up energy prices and not reduce emissions effectively. “It’s not only me, there are also other party colleagues in our parliamentary group who see the decisions of the coal commission extremely critically,” Pfeiffer said. “It leaves the impression of implementing a climate policy only for symbolic purposes - regardless of the economic costs and damage,” Pfeiffer added.

2019-01-30,"(Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Wednesday it would fold its battery storage and electrical grid units into its wind turbine and hydropower business to cut costs, speed decision-making and cater to surging demand for renewable power. The announcement, a day before GE was due to report fourth-quarter results, will eliminate a layer of management mostly based in Chicago, with minimal reduction in staff. The combined unit will have about 40,000 employees and annual revenue of about $16 billion (12 billion pounds), GE spokesman Jim Healy said in an interview, compared with $10.2 billion for renewable energy last year. GE’s renewables business currently comprises on- and offshore wind turbines, plus hydropower. GE’s units handling electrical transmission and distribution grids, battery storage and solar inverters and controls had been in GE’s Power business, which is focused on fossil fuel generation. Regional leaders for renewables will now deal directly with the company’s renewables headquarters in Paris. GE does not make solar panels. The move is GE’s first big structural shift since October, when it said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice had expanded accounting probes to include a $22 billion writedown of goodwill at GE Power in the third quarter. To help its ailing power business, GE said in October it would separate natural gas power from coal, nuclear and grid, and named new leaders for the units. Some analysts interpreted the moves as GE preparing its non-gas businesses for sale. GE’s newest gas turbines are under scrutiny after a broken blade severely damaged a unit in Texas last year, causing a two-month plant outage. The break has forced some utilities to curtail use of their new GE turbines while they await blade replacements, and GE has since said it knew about the problem after a similar blade broke in 2015.  GE’s power division took on added importance to GE’s future earnings after the company announced last year it would focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy and dispose of its healthcare unit and majority stake in Baker Hughes, along with other restructuring. GE’s renewable energy unit contributed about 9 percent of the company’s industrial revenues in 2017, before the integration. Power contributed about 28 percent. “This strategic realignment positions GE to lead in the fast-growing renewable energy market,” GE Chief Executive Officer Lawrence Culp said in a statement.

2019-01-30,"(Repeating Jan 29 story without changes for wider distribution) By Jessica Resnick-Ault NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - More than 24 hours after the United States announced large-scale sanctions on Venezuela’s nationally owned oil company, merchant trading firms and refiners were still deciphering what the measures prohibited. The sanctions, announced on Monday, are aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, the strongest U.S. measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years. Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions, while U.S. companies who buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work-arounds, seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third party intermediaries, such as commodity merchants, can continue. The sanctions here froze assets of state-run PDVSA and require U.S. firms to pay for oil using accounts controlled by the country's opposition party head and self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido. PDVSA is seeking to sidestep the restrictions by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, sources said. Oil sanctions in the past have been evaded by using intermediaries, said Scott Maberry, who specializes in international trade at Sheppard Mullin law firm, but he doubted that would happen with PDVSA. “I would not be surprised if this administration is vigilant and does not feel bound by past practices,” said Maberry. A U.S. Department of Treasury spokesman called the sanctions against PDVSA “extremely sophisticated,” adding that the department would “take questions from industry and stakeholders and issue FAQs as appropriate.” No FAQ (frequently asked questions) had been issued by Tuesday evening. Via PDVSA, Venezuela exports about 500,000 barrels of oil daily to the United States, mostly to PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum and U.S. companies Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp. It also imports products from the United States. The sanctions not only limit U.S. companies from paying PDVSA for crude, but also oil sales moved through multiple third parties, such as potential arrangements involving sending oil to Russia or China, which would later sell to an intermediary that would pass the oil on to U.S. buyers. Intermediaries that comply with U.S. sanctions in general and transact in U.S. dollars would still be subject to the Venezuela sanctions. Transactions sent through a multitude of parties would only be allowed if the revenues were sent to accounts inaccessible by Maduro’s government, according to a source familiar with the sanctions. “Treasury will be tracking this closely. The idea that this can get laundered and not tracked is far-fetched,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and a former Energy Department official under President George W. Bush. The Trump administration has said the restrictions should have a minimal impact on the U.S. consumer, but some experts said they were concerned there could be unanticipated effects. “PDVSA has so many intertwined dealings and transactions with the U.S., including through Citgo, that the immediate impact of these sanctions is far more comprehensive on the U.S. economy than you would typically see,” said Scott Flicker, chair of the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings and head of the firm’s global trade controls practice. The United States exempted Citgo from sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. Analysts at Tudor, Pickering & Holt said that if Citgo was unable to import Venezuelan barrels, “some sort of impact on operations seems like a distinct possibility.” U.S. refiners last week asked the administration not to issue sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday. “Such a ban would further tighten the heavy sour crude market in the United States, resulting in higher crude prices for U.S. refineries and higher fuel costs for U.S. consumers,” the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association, said in a Jan. 23 letter to President Donald Trump.

2019-01-30,"ABUJA (Reuters) - A court cleared the way on Wednesday for the trial of Nigeria’s top judge, whose suspension by President Muhammadu Buhari, just weeks before an election in which he would have helped resolve any disputes, has led to accusations of electoral interference. The appeals court in Abuja ruled that chief judge Walter Onnoghen can be tried by a code of conduct tribunal over allegations that he broke the law by failing to disclose the full extent of his financial assets.  Onnoghen was suspended by Buhari last week pending the tribunal’s verdict on his alleged violation of wealth declaration rules, weeks before a Feb. 16 presidential election in which Buhari is seeking a new mandate. Onnoghen has not responded publicly to the allegations. The appeals court had originally put the tribunal proceedings on hold indefinitely.  Because Nigeria’s chief judge has a key say in resolving electoral disputes, Onnoghen’s suspension has led opponents of Buhari to accuse him of interfering in the electoral process and of showing regional and religious favouritism. The European Union and the United States have also voiced concerns.  The judge’s roots are in Nigeria’s largely Christian south, where the opposition People’s Democratic Party has its base. His temporary replacement is from the predominantly Muslim north, where Buhari’s ruling All Progressives Congress is strong. The Code of Conduct Tribunal said on Jan. 12 that Onnoghen would face six counts of alleged non-declaration of assets. The allegations were initially made by Dennis Aghanya, who served as Buhari’s media aide between 2009 and 2011.

2019-01-30,"(Corrects to show Nasdaq Commodities is based in Norway, not Sweden, paragraph 13) * Euronext, Nasdaq vie for Oslo Bors * Both want to develop commodities trading in Norway * Latest consolidation move among European exchanges By Terje Solsvik and Gwladys Fouche OSLO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Nasdaq Inc on Wednesday made a rival bid for Oslo Bors VPS, setting up a takeover battle with Euronext for the 200-year-old Norwegian stock market operator. Nasdaq’s bid of 152 Norwegian crowns per share, valuing Oslo Bors at 6.54 billion crowns ($771 million), topped Euronext’s bid of 145 crowns per share. Nasdaq’s bid plan has the unanimous backing of the Oslo exchange’s board as well as 30 percent of shareholders. Euronext has said shareholders representing just over 50 percent of Oslo Bors’ shares had committed to sell at its offer price of 145 Norwegian crowns and that those investors could not sell to anyone else. Nasdaq’s offer is the latest sign of moves to consolidate among stock market groups. The London Stock Exchange also announced plans on Wednesday to buy a minority stake in Euroclear, Europe’s biggest settlement house for securities, giving it a role in trading, clearing and settlement. Nasdaq, which already operates seven exchanges across the Nordic and Baltic countries, said it wanted to create a true Nordic capital market. “It is a long way from Paris to Oslo. Being near companies is important,” Oslo Bors VPS CEO Bente Landsnes told a news conference. “We feel that being part of Nasdaq would make it easier to influence future developments.” Any deal will need approval from Norway’s finance ministry and its financial supervisory authority, Finanstilsynet. They have up to five months to make their views clear, Landsnes said. “Shareholders who committed to sell to Euronext ... would be able to sell to Nasdaq only if conditions to the offer, such as regulatory approvals and due diligence, are not met,” a source close to the matter said. “There will be two applications for regulatory approval in parallel. That is messy. To seal the deal, they (Euronext) could up the offer and chase off Nasdaq,” the source said. “Finanstilsynet will base its processing of the application concerning the acquisition of a significant portion of Oslo Bors’ shares on current regulations and cannot make any further comment regarding this process at the present time,” an FSA spokesman said. The finance ministry was not immediately available for comment. A Euronext spokeswoman reiterated that Oslo Bors shareholders representing more than 45 percent of the shares had committed irrevocably to sell their shares to Euronext even if a higher bid was presented by another company. Nasdaq said it could merge Oslo Bors with Nasdaq Commodities, the Nordic power market, based in Norway. “You can safely say that for Nasdaq, if the deal goes through, we would have a very strong centre of excellence for commodities in Oslo,” Nasdaq Nordic President Lauri Rosendahl told Reuters. He did not give a specific timeline. For its part, Euronext has said it wants to use Oslo Bors as a launchpad for Nordic expansion and a centre for its commodities activities. Norwegian bank DNB, Oslo Bors’ biggest shareholder with close to 20 percent, said it would sell to Nasdaq, as did pension provider KLP, which holds 10 percent and Sparebanken Vest with 1.6 percent stake. All three had previously suggested they would not accept Euronext’s bid. “With the options that are now available, we believe that Nasdaq will offer the strategically best solution for the Norwegian capital market and for the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (VPS),” DNB said. Nasdaq will formally launch its offer on Feb. 4, and its application for regulatory approval would follow right after that, Rosendahl told Reuters, without specifying an exact date. Founded in 1819, the Oslo Bors until recently said it could best serve Norwegian investors and companies by remaining independent, but following Euronext’s bid last month the exchange quickly looked for an alternative buyer. Euronext directly bought a 5.3 percent stake in Oslo Bors in late December before filing its offer. Nasdaq called on Euronext to withdraw its offer and told shareholders to let their promises to Euronext expire. “Two hints: Euronext can change their minds,” Rosendahl told Reuters. “And the (shareholder) undertakings have an expiry date, in August this year, if they are not executed on.” ($1 = 8.4877 Norwegian crowns) Additional reporting by Inti Landauro in Paris, editing by

The series of strikes, which has affected French coal power plants since last year, was called for by unions to protest against the government’s plan to phase out coal power generation by 2022. A separate strike at the same capacity Cordemais 4 generator cut output by over 32 percent on Wednesday, according to the RTE.  EDF has warned that the strikes could affect power production at its coal power plants throughout the first half of the year, as workers continue their protests. RTE said the current outage at Cordemais could be extended. The grid operator has urged workers on strike at the plant several times this winter to restart the generators during a prolonged cold snap, in order to meet electricity demand.  The French government has said it will make a decision in autumn on whether to allow the conversion of EDF’s Cordemais and Havre coal power plants to burn biomass as fuel for power generation.

2019-01-30,"(Adds detail) ZAGREB, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Croatia will co-finance a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in the northern Adriatic with 100 million euros  ($114 million), Energy and Environment Minister Tomislav Coric said on Wednesday. The government has identified the planned terminal on the island of Krk as a strategic project aimed at diversifying gas imports which it currently receives from Russia. “The terminal is worth 234 million euros. The European Union (EU) is providing 101.4 million euros and 32.4 million euros will be financed by our energy firms that lead the project. The remaining 100 million euros will be provided by the state,” Coric told a cabinet session. State power board HEP and gas pipeline operator Plinacro are in charge of implementing the project. The EU has pledged support as part of its efforts to help EU member states diversify away from Russian energy imports in the wake of Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and its clash with Ukraine over gas. The targeted markets for gas from the planned terminal are countries in central and southeastern Europe. The project has struggled to secure buyers, however, with binding bids for just 0.52 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas per year while the terminal’s planned capacity is 2.5 bcm. According to the energy and environment ministry, some Hungarian companies have also sent letters of intent for use of the terminal. This week Coric said he believed that the terminal would become commercially viable in the coming years. The government wants it to begin operations in early 2021. “A terminal of that size almost completely satisfies Croatia’s gas needs,” Coric said. Croatia currently consumes some 2.7 bcm of gas annually, some 40 percent of which it produces domestically. $1 = 0.8750 euros

2019-01-30,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By David Alire Garcia TLAHUELILPAN, Mexico Jan 30 (Reuters) - Days after a fireball erupted near the Mexican town of Tlahuelilpan, killing at least 117 people pilfering gasoline from a pipeline, the area’s fuel bandits were back in business. Illegal taps, some of them newly opened, were the giveaway that fuel was flowing again. Soldiers patrolling this area in central Mexico after the Jan. 18 tragedy told Reuters they found 15 illicit spigots just a few kilometers away on the same pipeline operated by the nation’s state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex. In one spot, Reuters saw a freshly dug hole leading to a shiny valve attached to the pipeline lying about a meter underground. Nearby were discarded plastic hoses, snack wrappers, an empty pack of cigarettes and a blanket still wet with gasoline. Such is the mammoth task confronting President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to end Mexico’s rampant fuel theft. The practice is depriving the government of badly needed tax revenue; it cost Pemex an estimated $3 billion last year alone. Security experts say small-time thieves, organized crime gangs and corrupt Pemex employees all have a hand in the trade. The crudest operators hack into pipelines to siphon gasoline and diesel, often at night in rural outposts. They then resell it to gas station owners, at roadside stands and in open-air markets. A Pemex spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In December, Lopez Obrador announced a crackdown on the banditry. To thwart pipeline taps, he ordered Pemex to transport some fuel overland in tanker trucks. The result: widespread shortages and long lines at gas stations. The bottlenecks have eased. But fuel theft is so endemic that the culture will be hard to break, even in Tlahuelilpan. An estimated 800 of the town’s residents, many carrying buckets, had flocked to a nearby pipeline when word spread on social media that a large pool of gasoline had sprung from a bootleg tap. Dozens were killed when the gas ignited; scores more were badly burned. Marcelino Valdez, a Catholic priest in Tlahuelilpan, said in between funerals that many here support Lopez Obrador. But he doubted the president’s strategy would yield quick results in an area where nearly two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, according to government data. “The people don’t like to steal, it’s not something they enjoy,” Valdez said. “But they look up and see so much corruption, so much injustice, and they see that their hands are empty.” (For a graphic on Mexico's fuel theft problem, see tmsnrt.rs/2Tms3tZ) Hidalgo state, where Tlahuelilpan is located, is the nation’s leader in illicit breaches of Pemex pipelines. Fuel thieves known as huachicoleros last year drilled a record 2,121 illegal taps in the state, or nearly six each day, according to Pemex data. That is more than a six-fold increase in just two years. Oil industry experts say Hidalgo’s location is a big reason. Situated to the north of the Mexican capital, the state is home to Pemex’s second-biggest oil refinery and critical pipelines supplying the giant Mexico City metro area. Fuel prices are a factor too. At the start of 2017, the government of then-President Enrique Pena Nieto hiked prices by as much as 20 percent in a bid to end costly subsidies, a move many in Tlahuelilpan say is driving theft. Since Lopez Obrador’s term began on Dec. 1, the government says it has arrested 558 people accused of stealing fuel. It has frozen bank accounts and deployed soldiers to guard key Pemex installations, including the Tula refinery about 9 miles (15 km) southwest of Tlahuelilpan. While organized crime is a big player, the president has reserved particular disdain for Pemex, blaming crooked company insiders for much of the illicit trade. “We’re talking about a plan that has ties inside the government,” he said during a Dec. 27 press conference. Juan Pedro Cruz, mayor of Tlahuelilpan, likewise is suspicious of Pemex employees. He told Reuters he visited the site of an illegal pipeline tap shortly after he was elected in 2016. Cruz said he watched as Pemex workers carefully covered up the tap without disabling it. “What message did that send to me?” Cruz said. “They were going to use it again.” Cruz has faced questions too. Following the January accident, news reports linked him to a local warehouse that once was used to store stolen fuel. Cruz denied wrongdoing. He said Pemex solicited his help in finding temporary storage for gasoline recovered from crooks. In addition to arresting fuel thieves, Lopez Obrador has launched a new 3,600 peso ($189) monthly scholarship for unemployed Mexican youth, a program he has pitched as a way to address the root causes of crime. But some townspeople in Tlahuelilpan doubt it will dissuade many young people from seizing what some see as their only opportunity to get ahead. Mariano Hernandez, a local math teacher, said some fuel thieves can clear as much as 10,000 pesos ($525) daily. “They say, ‘I’d rather make a lot of money for one or two years than live many years in poverty,’” Hernandez said. The president’s steepest challenge may be persuading people such as Magali Ortiz that fuel theft is worthy of such high-profile scrutiny. Her husband Omar Vasquez died in the conflagration. Two other relatives are missing. Stealing fuel is “not a crime,” Ortiz said. “It’s a job.” ($1 = 19.0305 Mexican pesos) Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Dan Flynn and

2019-01-30,"MUNICH (Reuters) - Siemens will accept defeat if the European Union rejects its pleas to allow it to combine with Alstom to create a powerful Franco-German rail business. Having offered a series of concessions to answer competition concerns, Siemens will not pursue the deal at any costs and instead make new plans for its trains business, Chief Executive Joe Kaeser said before the German company’s annual meeting in Munich on Wednesday. The engineering company wants to create a European rail champion to compete with China’s state-owned CRRC Corp but its ambitions have run into opposition from EU  regulators concerned about the impact on train operators. “We are not bitter, we are not angry at all. We have different options. If it works it will be good for Europe, Siemens, Alstom, and for customers,” Kaeser said.  “If not, we will continue to lead in mobility as we have before,” said Kaeser who nevertheless appeared to be resigned to the merger being rejected. The EU Commission is due to announce its decision by Feb. 18, with indications the merger will be rejected. Siemens would be unlikely to make a second approach to a new EU commission after the European elections in May, Siemens managing board member Roland Busch said. A new commission would be bound by the same laws as its predecessor, and changing these laws would take years, Busch said. Appealing to the EU, Kaeser said Europe needed to stand together to compete with the United States, China and India. He said EU competition rules from the 1990s were from a different era that were now outdated.  “It will be interesting to see if the future of  mobility in Europe will be determined by backward-looking technocrats or future-oriented Europeans,” he said. The merger aims to create the world’s second largest rail company with combined revenues of around 15 billion euros (13.08 billion pounds), still half the size of CRRC but twice that of Canada’s Bombardier. The plan has been backed by Siemens shareholders who have said it would help create a focussed technology group. “Although countries such as China and the United States are increasingly ruthlessly pursuing their own industrial policy, the focus of the Competition Commission is on the task of protecting consumers and ensuring fair competition within the EU,” said Marcus Poppe, fund manager at German asset manager DWS, which owns 2.2 percent of Siemens. “This position may be correct under current European law, but fails to recognise the threats to the European industrial sector in global competition over the next 20 years,”  EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has described Siemens and Alstom as world champions which can compete without a merger. People familiar with the matter have told Reuters regulators were minded to reject it. The German firm’s main customers include Deutsche Bahn and Channel Tunnel operator Eurostar. Siemens recently signed a 1.54 billion euro deal to supply London Underground with 94 new trains. Reporting its first quarter results on Wednesday, Siemens posted weaker-than-expected industrial profit, as problems persisted at its power and gas business which has hit by collapsing demand for large turbines. Siemens reported a 6 percent fall in adjusted operating profit for its industrial business during the three months ended Dec. 31 to 2.07 billion euros (1.80 billion pounds), missing the forecast for 2.15 billion euros in a Reuters poll. The company’s stock was down nearly 2 percent by midday. Profit halved at its Power and Gas business, although the downturn was partly balanced by an improvement in profit at Digital Factory, the company’s automation unit. The company maintained its guidance, expecting moderate revenue growth in 2019 when currency swings and acquisitions were removed. It said it also expected a profit margin of 11 to 12 percent from its industrial business.

2019-01-30,"CHICAGO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Farmers from North Dakota to Iowa buckled down for some of the coldest weather in a generation on Wednesday, throwing extra rations to pigs or building igloos for chickens before hunkering down for a day of sub-zero temperatures and bone-chilling winds. Some, like Kurt Line in Indiana, joked about the forecast. Line said he looked forward to working on his tax returns, something he usually puts off, rather than braving the cold to load corn for a local processing plant. But temperatures expected to plunge in some areas as low as minus 40 degrees, the point at which Fahrenheit and Celsius converge, are no laughing matter for an industry dependent on the elements. The brutal chill was caused by the polar vortex, a mass of freezing air that normally spins around the North Pole but has made its way south to the United States. Cattle ranchers Joey Myers and her fiancé, Scott Bailey, in Minot, North Dakota, were brewing coffee with plans to stay up all night as long as the cold lasted to check on their animals. “We’ll be doing the same tonight, tomorrow night and the night after that,” said Myers, who added the couple were breaking out their ski masks and ski goggles to protect their faces from the cold. They feared the minus 18-degree F ( minus 28-C) temperatures with wind chills of minus 50 degrees F ( minus 45 C) could cause their pregnant cows to give birth early. Their heated barn is not big enough to house every animal, so they must keep watch for newborn calves to prevent fatalities. Ron Prestage, president of one of Iowa’s biggest hog producers, Prestage Farms, said his company had been stocking up on feed to last at least until Friday, and was making sure heaters and water lines were running at hog barns. “When it gets cold, they eat more,” he said in a phone interview. So we just have to make sure we plan ahead.” “As cold as it’s going to be, water lines are a critical factor,” he added. Also in Iowa, Deanna Brennecke said she knew the cold was coming days before the local TV weather reports: Her cattle had been eating far more feed and putting on weight to help keep themselves warm as the temperatures plummeted. “They were meeting us at the gate, and filling themselves full, and we just knew,” said Brennecke, who runs her family’s cow-calf farm and raises goats with her husband in Decatur County. The cold weather was also a concern for small-scale farmers. In Wisconsin, where temperatures were heading toward minus 30 degrees F ( minus 34 C), dairy farmer Amber McComish and her family stocked up on extra fuel for the generator for their milking barn, tucked the baby calves into a heated room and made sure all the animals had food and water. Backyard chicken owners in the Midwest flocked online for advice on how to protect their birds, with some on the chat forum at BackyardChickens.com asking if they should add a heating pad for their poultry to stand on. Others suggested putting extra tarps around the coops to keep chickens dry and coating exposed chicken skin with petroleum jelly to ward off frostbite. In Chicago, Lynn Ankney and her family have been double-checking their backyard coop, making sure there are no drafts around their Rhode Island Red and Black Australorp hens – and using snow that accumulated in recent days to build an igloo around their coop for extra insulation. “We’re keeping a close eye on them,” said Ankney.

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.1 percent higher by 1140 GMT following gains in Asia overnight and a muted start to trading in Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index was also up by 0.1 percent. Investors pondered the possibility of a “no-deal” British departure from the European Union after UK lawmakers instructed Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday to reopen the treaty she had negotiated with Brussels to replace a divisive Irish border arrangement. “While a no deal scenario is still unlikely, these developments increase the risk of accidentally leaving the EU without a deal and plans may intensify from both sides to manage that outcome,” said Bethany Payne, Global Bonds Portfolio Manager at Janus Henderson. Goldman Sachs upped its “no-deal” Brexit probability to 15 percent from 10 percent, and cut the chance of Brexit not happening at all to 35 percent from 40 percent. Worries over a disorderly exit of Britain from the club it joined in 1973 hammered the pound overnight and that in turn helped lift the internationally exposed UK top share index by 1.3 percent in late morning deals. Sterling recovered to be up 0.25 percent at $1.3101, suggesting investors remained hopeful that a chaotic Brexit could still be avoided even though Brussels has indicated that the divorce deal was not up for renegotiation. Talks between the sides continued. European Council President Donald Tusk and British Prime Minister Theresa May will have a phone call about Brexit later on Wednesday, an EU source said. Earlier, Apple results provided some reassurance as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business. Investors were relieved that there was no more bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month with a revenue warning that triggered fears that U.S.-China trade tensions were taking a toll on the tech sector. “Apple earnings delivered enough for investors to come back on board,” said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson. “Although Apple still faces big questions like pricing structure, upgrade cycles, FX headwinds and weaker Chinese demand, we did get a positive answer to the key question on whether services margins can help rerate the stock higher.” U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures added 0.25 percent, while European tech shares were among the best performers in European trading. Luxury stocks, heavily exposed to the Chinese markets, also rose. Apple CEO Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, lifting the mood before another round of official talks on Wednesday in Washington. The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December. “I expect that the Washington summit will help pave the way for an extension of the trade truce. This is also what markets expect and a failure of the talks is not priced in at all,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital. Expectations from Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rates review are that policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance, given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. “We believe the Fed is likely to show the flexibility markets are seeking at its upcoming meeting, as it balances still solid domestic economic growth against slower global growth and less significant, but persistent, domestic risks,” said John Lynch, Chief Investment Strategist at LPL Financial. U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in virtually no change in official rates this year. Investors are looking for hints from Chairman Jerome Powell on whether he has any inclination to slow the drawdown of the Fed’s balance sheet by up to $50 billion a month. The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.816. The Australian dollar surged 0.6 percent as inflation topped forecasts, while the Chinese yuan reached a six-month high in the offshore market before the trade talks. In commodities, gold rose to fresh 8-1/2-month highs, supported by uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations and expectations the Fed will keep policy on hold. It was up 0.09 percent of $1,313.26 per ounce. Oil prices inched up, supported by concerns about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry but pegged back by a darkening outlook for the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.69 percent at $53.71 per barrel, while Brent crude oil futures added 0.70 percent at $61.75 per barrel.

2019-01-30,"SAO PAULO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Retiro Baixo hydroelectric plant has suspended operations to preserve its equipment but the dam is safe, state-owned Eletrobras said, after last week’s deadly disaster at a mining dam owned by Vale. Vale’s Brumadinho tailings dam, used to store the muddy detritus from mining, collapsed on Friday, killing at least 84 in one of Brazil’s largest industrial accidents on record. The Retiro Baixo plant in Minas Gerais, which has 82 megawatts (MW) capacity, is owned Eletrobras subsidiary Furnas and by state mining company Cemig. “The operation of the plant has been interrupted, spillway tests have been carried out and the water intakes have been closed to preserve the equipment,” Furnas said in s statement issued late on Tuesday. “It is in contact with the competent authorities to evaluate the effects of mud displacement and to take new measures,” it said, adding that Retiro Baixo dam was safe and had been inspected by the National Electric Energy Agency (Aneel) in 2018. Vale’s Brumadinho disaster, coming just over three years after a similar incident at another mine partially controlled by Vale, has fueled calls for a management overhaul and erased more than 70 billion reais ($19 billion) in Vale’s market value.

2019-01-30,"* Power firm Eskom facing financial crisis * Government debating whether to split firm * Miners say Eskom’s tariffs erode competitiveness By Alexander Winning JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - South African miners support a restructuring of struggling state power firm Eskom to boost competition in the electricity supply industry, an industry body said on Wednesday, warning that tariff hikes alone would not solve Eskom’s problems. Top government officials will discuss whether to split Eskom into generation, transmission and distribution units at a cabinet meeting starting on Wednesday as part of efforts to rescue the company from financial crisis. The mining and smelting industry is one of Eskom’s top customers, accounting for around 30 percent of electricity demand in Africa’s most industrialised economy. “Most countries we compete against have electricity supply industries where generation is competitive, there is a state transmission company and some competition in distribution,” Roger Baxter, chief executive of South Africa’s Minerals Council, an industry lobby group, said. “We need Eskom to be made into a much more efficient, cost-effective organisation.” The Minerals Council, which represents firms including Sibanye-Stillwater and Exxaro, says average annual power price increases of 15.5 percent between 2006 and 2017 reduced investment in the mining sector by a cumulative 103 billion rand ($8 billion). It says Eskom’s request for a further 15 percent increase in electricity tariffs in each of the next three years - if granted by the country’s energy regulator Nersa - would cripple an industry already in decline. More than 80 percent of gold production would become marginal or loss-making, with around 75 percent of platinum group metals production marginal or unprofitable by the end of the three-year period, Baxter said. Thousands of mining jobs could be lost, he added. Eskom has argued that its tariff hike request to Nersa could help shore up its finances. Deon Joubert, Eskom’s corporate specialist for finance, told consumers at a public hearing on the proposed hikes on Monday that the utility’s debt had increased as its tariffs had failed to keep pace with its spending on new power stations. “Eskom is cognisant of the potential impact of the increase in various sectors, but it finds itself in a very difficult financial position,” Joubert said.

2019-01-30,"* Project developer to design and build 7.5 mtpa onshore terminal * To operate terminal on build-own-operate-transfer basis * Country turns focus to land-based terminal from FSRUs (Adds details, analyst quote) By Ruma Paul and Jessica Jaganathan DHAKA/SINGAPORE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Bangladesh is seeking expressions of interest to build the country’s first onshore liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal, according to a company official and a document posted on the company’s website. The South Asian country, which has a population of more than 160 million is turning to land-based LNG terminals as its first imports of the super-chilled fuel through a floating platform were delayed due to the weather and technical issues. Rupantarita Prakritik Gas Co, part of state-owned Petrobangla, which oversees LNG supplies, has requested interest from potential terminal developers for a land-based LNG regasification terminal at Matarbari in the Cox’s Bazar district of southern Bangladesh. The expression of interest is for the design, engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of a land-based terminal that can handle 7.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG, including receiving, unloading, storage and re-gasification facilities. The project is on a build-own-operate basis for 20 years, with ownership then transferred to the Bangladeshi government or a company nominated by the government at no cost. “A land-based LNG terminal is now our top priority,” said Mohammad Quamruzzaman, managing director of Rupantarita Prakritik Gas. The onshore terminal, which can be expanded to 15 million mtpa in the future, is part of Bangladesh’s strategy to develop its gas sector with private companies, according to the document. The project developer will be required to arrange the necessary financing, the document stated. The developer will receive the LNG from the LNG ship as part of an agreement between Bangladesh and the LNG supplier, unload and store it, re-gasify it and supply the gas to the transmission pipeline. The terminal is set to be completed by June 2023. Companies should submit their expressions of interest by March 20, with the official documents expected to be issued to shortlisted applicants by Aug. 29. Bangladesh began importing LNG from Qatar on a regular basis in last year through the country’s first floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). It has scrapped plans to build additional floating LNG import terminals after its second FSRU comes on line. Bangladesh’s LNG demand potential could support a terminal with that capacity, said senior analyst at consultancy FGE Poorna Rajendran. “Declining domestic output amidst growing energy demand would leave LNG as a mainstay in its energy mix,” he said. “Coal’s share will rise in the nation’s energy mix but existing gas infrastructure and growing environmental and land acquisition concerns surrounding large coal plants would mean that coal’s share will not grow substantially.” In such a scenario with LNG expected to be a long term solution, a land-based terminal with larger capacity would be more economical than a smaller FSRU which is typically best suited to meet short-term and mid-term demand, he added.

The Trump administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, aimed at curbing the OPEC member’s crude exports to the United States and pressuring Nicolas Maduro to step down as president. Traders have already started looking for ways to work around the sanctions, which will hit 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of heavy crude that the United States imports from Venezuela. India and China are the other top importers of Venezuelan crude. For a Factbox see: When asked if the IEA sees oil markets tightening this year, Birol said:  “The market is currently very well supplied and there (is) lots of U.S. shale oil coming into the market.” “There are lots of uncertainties in the oil markets now for different reasons.

2019-01-30,"ISLAMABAD, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Pakistan expects debt being built up within its troubled power sector to level off this year and start falling, its power minister told Reuters, outlining measures to shore up confidence and attract foreign investors. Pakistan has long been bedevilled by electricity shortages, with power outages crippling industries and economic growth, as well as stoking voter anger in the mainly Muslim nation of 208 million people. Vast Chinese investment has helped drastically reduce power outages, lifting economic growth, but years of mismanagement has led to accumulated power sector payment arrears, or “circular debt”, rising to 1.4 trillion rupees ($10.1 billion). Independent power producers angry with late government payments have warned of a crisis, while economists fear rising circular debt will further widen Pakistan’s yawning fiscal deficit, a key part of ongoing bailout talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Power Minister Omar Ayub Khan, appointed soon after premier Imran Khan took office in August, said the decision to hike electricity tariffs, which kicked in at the start of January, will stop the sharp rise in power debt. “All of a sudden, after January 1, you have a levelling off of circular debt, because the new tariff has kicked in,” Khan, who is the grandson of Pakistan’s first military ruler, Ayub Khan, told Reuters in Islamabad on Tuesday. Built into the tariff is an extra cost that will allow the government to pay off arrears from the previous year, which in 2019 should result in a 226 billion rupees reduction of circular debt, Khan added. Within three to four years, the government expects to claw back 470-500 billion rupees. The government will also recover an extra 43 billion rupees annually in circular debt parked in state-owned Power Holding Private Limited (PHPL), which holds about 600 billion of the 1.4 trillion debt. “That will take longer,” Khan said. He said cash from a planned 200 billion rupee Islamic bond will be used to retire old expensive debt, and pay independent producers to ease their financial crunch. To prevent circular debt rising again, the government plans to crack down on endemic power theft and modernise distribution companies and a creaking transmission network struggling to cope. A new energy policy is also due to be announced soon, with plans to re-orient Pakistan’s energy mix. The current split in the mix is 60 percent fossil fuels, 30 percent hydel, 6 percent nuclear, and 4 percent renewables. Pakistan wants to use more indigenous resources such as hydel and hike the renewables portion of the mix to 20 percent by 2025, and to 30 percent by 2030. Khan estimates Pakistan will need to double generation capacity to 55,000 megawatts by 2030, and is seeking investors to a nation where electricity demand is fast rising but about 25 percent of the population is yet to be connected to the grid. “People were content with using one fan or light bulb, but that’s not the case any more,” Khan said. “You go into the most remote areas and you’ll find washing machines in people’s houses and electronic items, and that all requires electricity.” (Reporting by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/pakistan-power-minister/pakistan-says-curbing-power-sector-debt-seeks-energy-investors-idUKL5N1ZU0IK,30 Jan 2019,"Pakistan expects debt being

2019-01-30,"HONG KONG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Sinochem Energy, a unit of China’s state-owned Sinochem Group, has allowed its application for a Hong Kong initial public offering (IPO) to lapse, the exchange website showed on Wednesday. Sinochem Energy had sought to raise up to $2 billion from the listing, banking on a new technology platform to boost its valuation. The company put the IPO on hold late last year because it was likely to only raise around $1.2-$1.3 billion based on early investor feedback, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The plan would be shelved for the next one to two years, the source added. Sinochem Energy operates the group’s oil and petroleum products trading, refining, storage and logistics, as well as distribution and retail businesses, but not its struggling upstream business that includes overseas oil and gas production. Sinochem Energy’s application expired on Wednesday six months after it was filed, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange website. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Another source told Reuters earlier in January that the IPO had been put on hold partly because of a change in leadership. Zhang Wei, the company’s general manager, moved to China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) in December. Sinochem Energy operates one of China’s largest commercial oil tank farms, with 32 million barrels of storage capacity, and has some 800 petrol stations under its brand. It launched a technology platform last year to help create value for the IPO, but has since reduced its 1,000-strong workforce by 300 jobs and plans to cut another 200 positions, sources said. Sinochem Energy is not the first company to have to scale back or abandon plans to list in Hong Kong. Canaan Inc, one of the world’s leading cryptocurrency mining equipment makers, let its application lapse in November while biotech company CanSino Biologics let its application expire earlier this month, the exchange website showed. Hong Kong took the global crown for volumes raised through IPOs last year, with $36.3 billion sold in the financial centre, according to Refinitiv data. The performance of IPOs has been a different story, with many companies falling below their offer prices, including smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp and online food delivery-to-ticketing services provider Meituan Dianping . Other firms have raised a fraction of their original targets, including online ticketing firm Maoyan Entertainment and parenting website Babytree Group. Market volatility driven by China-U.S. trade tensions and slowing growth in China have cast a shadow on the IPO ambitions of many companies, with bankers expecting 2019 to continue to be challenging. BOC International, CLSA and Morgan Stanley had been working on Sinochem Energy’s float.

2019-01-30,"(Adds dropped letter in paragraph 19) By Geoffrey Kamadi KIGALI/NAIROBI, Jan 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - In sub-Saharan Africa, where more than 600 million people still lack access to electricity, off-grid renewable power is seen as one of the fastest ways to get energy where it’s needed, particularly to remote and rural areas where many Africans live. But one big challenge stands in the way, experts say: Too few trained workers able to plan, install and maintain solar, wind and other clean energy systems. In power-hungry Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, “we’ve had very significant challenges finding very capable talent, particularly at the senior management level,” said Kweku Yankson, head of human resources in Africa for BBOXX, a clean energy company working to expand off-grid systems in 12 countries from Rwanda to Pakistan. Rwanda, in turn, has what Yankson described as a big pool of job-ready young talent – but still relatively few people trained in clean energy technology, Yankson said. Overall, only 16,000 people are recorded as working in renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, outside South Africa, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA). That is just 0.1 percent of the global renewable energy workforce, and fewer than the number of people who work on wind power in the U.S. state of Illinois alone, IRENA noted. But with demand growing for renewable energy entrepreneurs and for workers in product assembly, sales, marketing, finance and intellectual property, efforts are now underway to provide the talent needed. A Powering Jobs campaign, launched in October at an international off-grid renewable energy conference in Singapore, aims to train up to a million people globally by 2025 to meet demand for renewable energy workers. The effort, led by Power for All – an organisation that promotes more use of decentralised power – and backed by the Schneider Electric Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation, will focus on building skills in countries where electricity access is very low, said Gilles Vermot Desroches, director of sustainable development at Schneider. The push is part of a broader global campaign to fill an expected 4.5 million jobs related to expansion of off-grid renewable energy by 2030, according to IRENA estimates. That expansion is focused in part on achieving a global sustainable-development goal of providing universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy by 2030. In Africa, lessons are being drawn from India, which has trained more than 30,000 solar electric installers in the past two years as part of a government-backed effort. The country aims to train a total of 50,000 installers by 2022, according to India’s government. One of the biggest problems facing expansion of renewable off-grid power in Africa is that systems need to be built and operated in remote locations, where it can be harder to attract and retain staff, said Yankson of BBOXX. Also, even in countries such as Rwanda, where a growing number of multinational companies have trained large numbers of young workers, “the most pressing challenge has been around finding very capable and experienced managing directors and finding senior finance managers,” he said. In Kenya, Yankson said, the difficulty is cost: Skilled talent comes at high salaries, thanks to competition for the best people in Nairobi among companies and non-profit groups. “The main limitation we’ve faced in Kenya has been the cost of talent,” he said. To provide a broader pool of potential hires, BBOXX has created the BBOXX Academy, an online learning platform that offers professional courses, said Emery Nzirabatinya, a former learning and development manager at the firm who now works in Nairobi for a U.S. hearing aid company BBOXX also has started a future leaders programme in Kigali, he said. “The program seeks strong university graduates that are put through a rigorous, year-long development and exposure program at BBOXX,” Nzirabatinya said. Julienne Ayinkamiye, a recent civil engineering graduate from the University of Rwanda College of Science and Technology, is one of two inaugural participants in the leadership project in Kigali. As part of the programme, she is responsible for running a BBOXX pilot solar lighting project being launched this year in Rwanda and then across Africa, and has worked in a range of different departments of the company. The work has included customer satisfaction research and analysis of competitors, she said. She said she believes the training, “will help me increase my analytical, project management and general management skills” – and give BBOXX a larger potential pool of talent to hire. “I am now working on real projects impacting the lives of thousands of rural households across Africa,” she said. The push for more trained renewable energy workers comes as an increasing number of countries around Africa try to ramp up use of off-grid renewable energy. Kenya in December launched a new national electrification strategy that includes stand-alone, off-grid renewable energy systems as a key part of the country’s goal of achieving 100 percent access to electricity by 2022. About three-quarters of Kenyans currently have access to electricity, according to the new plan. Part of Kenya’s push is an off-grid solar access project that aims to connect 1.3 million people in 14 particularly under-served counties, said Isaac Kiva, secretary of renewable energy in Kenya’s Ministry of Energy. “We are also now working with our education system to develop solar-specific curricula in order to build the necessary capacity,” he said. In Rwanda, the government is collaborating with U.S.-based universities, including Carnegie Mellon, and partnering with online learning efforts to provide better access to training for clean energy jobs, Nzirabatinya said. “This will have a positive impact on the job readiness of the talent pool in Rwanda,” he predicted.

2019-01-30,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro accused Donald Trump of ordering neighbouring Colombia’s government to kill him, but said he was open to the possibility of talks with the U.S. leader and his own domestic foes.  In an interview with Russia’s RIA agency, Maduro rejected calls for an early election, said an order to arrest his rival Juan Guaido had not yet been given, and promised Caracas would honour debts to Russia and China.  Facing the biggest challenge of his six-year rule, the 56-year-old socialist leader also said his armed forces remained loyal and President Vladimir Putin was firmly behind him. Maduro’s comments were published on Wednesday as the fight for control of Venezuela escalated with the government preparing an investigation into self-declared interim president Guaido, and new street protests planned.   Venezuela plunged further into turmoil last week after the United States recognised Guaido, 35, as acting president, while Russia, which has lent Caracas an estimated $17 billion since 2006, continued to back Maduro.  “Donald Trump has without doubt given an order to kill me and has told the government of Colombia and the Colombian mafia to kill me,” Maduro told RIA. Though the Venezuelan was reprising an old allegation that critics scoff at as a smokescreen, there was speculation of military plans after Trump adviser John Bolton appeared on Monday with a pad showing the words “5,000 troops to Colombia.”   “If something happens to me one day, Donald Trump and Colombian President Ivan Duque will bear responsibility,” Maduro said of his right-wing foes. Despite their increasingly militant opposition to Maduro, whom they regard as a dictator, both Washington and Bogota have repeatedly denied accusations of plots to kill him. Maduro, who survived what he called an assassination attempt in August last year, said he was well protected, guaranteeing him a long life. He declined to comment on reports Russia sent private military contractors to help guard him. He also dismissed calls for a snap presidential vote, saying his re-election last year was fair despite widespread allegations of fraud and the barring of two opposition rivals. “I won 68 percent of the vote,” he told RIA. “I won legitimately... If the imperialists want a new election, let them wait until 2025.” Despite alleging Trump wanted him dead, Maduro said he was ready to meet him “wherever he wants”, but thought the prospect unlikely given what he described as attempts by Trump’s advisers to prevent it. He said Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, Russia, the Vatican and several unnamed European countries wanted talks between him and the opposition. “I am ready to sit at the negotiation table with the opposition for us to talk for the benefit of Venezuela,” Maduro was quoted as saying. Regarding the investigation and possible arrest of Guaido, he said: “As far as I know, this measure has not yet been taken. Let’s wait for the internal constitutional and legal processes to see what the results will be. We won’t rush, we’ll wait.”    Writing by Andrew Osborn; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne",https://uk.reuters.com/article/venezuela-politics-maduro/update-2-venezuelas-maduro-accuses-trump-of-ordering-his-murder-ria-idUKL5N1ZU0RY,30 Jan 2019,"* Defies calls for early presidential election

The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was up 0.08 percent by 0909 GMT following gains in Asia overnight and a muted start to trading in Europe. The pan-European STOXX 600 benchmark index was flat. Investors fretted about the possibility of a “no-deal” British departure from the European Union after UK lawmakers instructed Prime Minister Theresa May on Tuesday to reopen the treaty she had negotiated with Brussels to replace a controversial Irish border arrangement. Goldman Sachs upped its “no-deal” Brexit probability to 15 percent from 10 percent, and cut the chance of Brexit not happening at all to 35 percent from 40 percent. “Tuesday’s Brexit amendments offered little additional clarity to anyone,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. Worries over a disorderly exit of Britain from the club it joined in 1973 hammered the pound overnight and that in turn helped lift the internationally exposed UK top share index by 0.8 percent in morning deals. Sterling recovered in morning trade to be up 0.3 percent at $1.3113. Earlier, Apple results provided some reassurance as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business. Investors were relieved that there was no more bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month with a revenue warning that sparked fears that U.S.-China trade tensions were taking a toll on the tech sector. “Apple earnings delivered enough for investors to come back on board,” said Markets.com analyst Neil Wilson. “Although Apple still faces big questions like pricing structure, upgrade cycles, FX headwinds and weaker Chinese demand, we did get a positive answer to the key question on whether services margins can help rerate the stock higher.” U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures added 0.2 percent, while European tech shares were among the best performers in European trading. Luxury stocks, heavily exposed to the Chinese markets, also rose. Apple CEO Tim Cook said trade tensions between the United States and China were easing, lifting the mood before another round of official talks on Wednesday in Washington. The two sides will meet next door to the White House in the highest-level talks since U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed a 90-day truce in their trade war in December. “I expect that the Washington summit will help pave the way for an extension of the trade truce. This is also what markets expect and a failure of the talks is not priced in at all,” said Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia Capital. Expectations from Wednesday’s Federal Reserve rates review are that policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance, given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. “We believe the Fed is likely to show the flexibility markets are seeking at its upcoming meeting, as it balances still solid domestic economic growth against slower global growth and less significant, but persistent, domestic risks,” said John Lynch, Chief Investment Strategist at LPL Financial. U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in virtually no change in official rates this year. Investors are looking for hints from Chairman Jerome Powell on whether he has any inclination to slow the drawdown of the Fed’s balance sheet by up to $50 billion a month. The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.797. The Australian dollar surged 0.5 percent as inflation topped forecasts, while the Chinese yuan reached a six-month high in the offshore market before the trade talks. In commodities, gold rose 0.2 percent to 8-1/2-month highs of $1,315.3 per ounce, supported by uncertainty over U.S.-China trade relations and expectations the Fed will keep policy on hold. Oil prices inched up, supported by concerns about supply disruptions following U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry but pegged back by a darkening outlook for the global economy. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures added 0.19 percent at $53.41 per barrel, while Brent crude oil futures added 0.10 percent at $61.38 per barrel.

2019-01-30,"* Guaido hit with travel ban, bank freeze * Opposition plans more street protests * Maduro thanks Russia for support, suggests talks (Adds Maduro interview) By Vivian Sequera CARACAS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The fight for control of Venezuela intensified on Wednesday as the government pushed a probe that may lead to the arrest of opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido who called for new street protests. Venezuela’s Supreme Court imposed a travel ban on Guaido and froze his bank accounts in apparent retaliation for oil sanctions imposed by the United States that are expected to severely hit the OPEC member’s already collapsing economy. Guaido is recognized as president by the United States and most Western Hemisphere nations, presenting the biggest challenge to President Nicolas Maduro’s six-year rule. The 35-year-old opposition lawmaker, who is president of the National Assembly, wants new elections, arguing that Maduro fraudulently won a second term last year. Guaido is offering an amnesty to tempt military officials to join him. Maduro, who accuses Guaido of staging a U.S.-directed coup against him, still has the support of the top military brass, and is unlikely to back down unless that changes. Russia and China are also key benefactors, giving him backing at the U.N. Security Council. On Wednesday, Maduro rejected calls for a snap presidential election as blackmail, and reiterated he was ready for talks with the opposition and possible third country mediation, Russia’s RIA news agency reported. “There are several governments, organizations globally, which are demonstrating their sincere concern about what is happening in Venezuela, they have called for a dialogue,” RIA quoted Maduro as saying. Given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time. With the Venezuela crisis deepening a geopolitical showdown between Washington and Moscow across various global flashpoints, Maduro also expressed “pleasure and gratitude” for Putin’s help. Russia has loaned and invested billions of dollars in Venezuela, and sources told Reuters private military contractors who do secret missions for Moscow were in Venezuela. A former union leader who succeeded his charismatic mentor, the late President Hugo Chavez, Maduro, 56, has overseen a shrinking economy and the migration of more than 3 million Venezuelans fleeing food and drug shortages and hyperinflation. Guaido called for more protests on Wednesday and a mass march at the weekend, to keep up pressure on Maduro in the streets. Wednesday’s action would not be a major march, but a series of small concentrations, he said. More than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the U.N. human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children. Government supporters have also attended large rallies led by Maduro allies, while the president visited military bases including overseeing live-fire exercises in recent days. He ordered the creation of 50,000 popular defense units, community groups he said would be charged with the “integral defense of the fatherland.” While it was not clear if they would be armed, the strategy reflects government concern the United States could try to defeat Maduro militarily. The Pentagon has refused to rule out military action, although is it not considered likely by most experts. Trump’s top advisers include Cold War-era hawks. White House national security adviser John Bolton fueled speculation this week when reporters saw a notepad he was carrying had the words “5,000 troops to Colombia” written on it. Colombia neighbors Venezuela. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met Guaido’s designated envoy to the United States on Tuesday. Pence said they discussed recent sanctions actions, “highlighting that these deprive Maduro and his cronies access to corrupt income and ... preserve the country’s wealth for the people of Venezuela.” The sanctions are also likely to hit daily life hard in Venezuela, where public spending is almost entirely funded by oil revenues. The government is eager to blame Guaido for the measures, which, once they begin to bite, could diminish his popularity. Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek Saab sought the preliminary investigation of Guaido on the basis that he had helped foreign countries interfere in internal matters. Announcing the investigation, the travel ban and the financial restrictions, Supreme Court President Maikel Moreno, a major Maduro ally, said the decision was taken expressly to “protect the integrity of the country.” In a tweet, Bolton warned of “serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido.” Reporting by Vivian Sequera; Additional reporting by Gabrielle

The world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker released 2018 earnings in a filing on Wednesday without disclosing fourth-quarter figures. But Reuters’ calculations showed consolidated operating profit for October-December was 1.3 trillion won ($1.16 billion), up from 1.2 trillion won a year ago. Analysts had forecast an average estimate of 1.3 trillion won according to a I/B/E/S Refinitiv poll. Revenue for the quarter climbed 6.4 percent to 16.6 trillion won, according to the calculations. For 2019, POSCO said revenue is expected to rise 2 percent to 66.3 trillion won, from 65.0 trillion won in 2018. POSCO said it expected steady global steel demand growth in 2019. While India and Southeast Asia demand should grow, Chinese demand may remain flat as economic growth cools. Steel prices in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer of the construction material, have fallen about 27 percent since October, dragged down by concerns over oversupply and the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. Meanwhile POSCO said it expected to increase capital expenditure and other investments to 6.1 trillion won this year from 2.7 trillion won in 2018. POSCO shares ended up 6.2 percent before the earnings announcement, lifted by investor expectations that steel prices will rise following the deadly collapse of a dam operated by Brazilian iron ore miner Vale.

Spread-betters expect London’s FTSE and Paris’s CAC to respectively rise 0.4 percent and 0.1 percent when they open, while forecasting a small loss for Frankfurt’s DAX . Sterling recovered just a little groud after the previous day’s sharp fall as British lawmakers rejected most amendments that sought to avoid Britain exiting the European Union without a deal, reviving worries of a chaotic withdrawal from the European Union. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan tacked on 0.3 percent, booking its first gain of the week. South Korea’s KOSPI added nearly 1.1 percent. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend, each slipping about half a percent. U.S. S&P 500 e-mini futures were little changed. They had traded much of the session slightly in positive territory after Apple shares rose 5.7 percent after the bell as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business. Investors were relieved that there was no fresh bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month when its rare revenue warning sparked fears the U.S.-China trade tensions were taking a toll on the tech sector. CEO Tim Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, also said trade tension between the United States and China is easing in January. That helped boost optimism around current high-level trade talks between the two countries, even though many investors remain sceptical about whether the economic giants can bridge differences over a number of issues, such as intellectual property rights and technology transfers. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is in Washington this week to meet U.S. officials, including Trump. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday he expected to see significant progress in talks with Chinese officials and that U.S. charges against telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd were a separate issue. “It seems December was the worst month and since then things might be starting to recover a bit. If we can see more such evidence, market sentiment will be bolstered,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “Yet, it’s still not clear how strong any such recovery would be. I would bet markets will be range-bound from here,” he said. Investors are also looking to the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s rates review later in the day, with expectations policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. U.S. interest rate futures  are pricing in virtually no change in official rates this year. Investors are looking for hints from Chairman Jerome Powell on whether he has any inclination to slow the drawdown of the Fed’s balance sheet by up to $50 billion a month. In the currency market, the British pound was on a slippery slope on renewed concerns over a no-deal Brexit. British lawmakers on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a controversial Irish border arrangement - and promptly received a flat rejection from Brussels. “The possibilities of no Brexit and of an extension of the Article 50 deadline have fallen. Markets may be under-estimating the chances that we could have a hard Brexit,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan FX and rates research at JPMorgan Securities. The pound, which fell nearly 0.7 percent on Tuesday, was last up 0.2 percent at $1.3093, off three-month highs of $1.3218 touched on Friday. Other major currencies were little moved. The euro changed hands about 0.1 percent higher at $1.1445, having risen to a two-week high of $1.14505 on Tuesday. The dollar was down a tenth of a percent against the yen at 109.28 yen. The Australian dollar gained 0.5 percent to $0.7195 after a reading on domestic inflation proved not to be as weak as bears had bet. In the commodity market, gold rose 0.2 percent, hovering near 8-1/2-month highs of $1,315.3 per ounce, helped by flight-to-quality bids amid various tensions around the world. In addition to U.S.-China trade worries, demand for gold has also been driven by concerns about a disruptive Brexit and political turmoil in Venezuela, which could increase Washington’s diplomatic hostilities towards Russia and China. Oil prices held firm after the United States imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, a move likely to reduce the OPEC member’s crude exports and relieve some global oversupply worries. U.S. crude futures rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday and last stood 18 cents higher at $53.49 per barrel, up 0.3 percent. Brent crude futures added 30 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $61.62.

2019-01-30,"TLAHUELILPAN, Mexico Jan 30 (Reuters) - Days after a fireball erupted near the Mexican town of Tlahuelilpan, killing at least 117 people pilfering gasoline from a pipeline, the area’s fuel bandits were back in business. Illegal taps, some of them newly opened, were the giveaway that fuel was flowing again. Soldiers patrolling this area in central Mexico after the Jan. 18 tragedy told Reuters they found 15 illicit spigots just a few kilometers away on the same pipeline operated by the nation’s state-owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos or Pemex. In one spot, Reuters saw a freshly dug hole leading to a shiny valve attached to the pipeline lying about a meter underground. Nearby were discarded plastic hoses, snack wrappers, an empty pack of cigarettes and a blanket still wet with gasoline. Such is the mammoth task confronting President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to end Mexico’s rampant fuel theft. The practice is depriving the government of badly needed tax revenue; it cost Pemex an estimated $3 billion last year alone. Security experts say small-time thieves, organized crime gangs and corrupt Pemex employees all have a hand in the trade. The crudest operators hack into pipelines to siphon gasoline and diesel, often at night in rural outposts. They then resell it to gas station owners, at roadside stands and in open-air markets. A Pemex spokesperson did not respond to multiple requests for comment. In December, Lopez Obrador announced a crackdown on the banditry. To thwart pipeline taps, he ordered Pemex to transport some fuel overland in tanker trucks. The result: widespread shortages and long lines at gas stations. The bottlenecks have eased. But fuel theft is so endemic that the culture will be hard to break, even in Tlahuelilpan. An estimated 800 of the town’s residents, many carrying buckets, had flocked to a nearby pipeline when word spread on social media that a large pool of gasoline had sprung from a bootleg tap. Dozens were killed when the gas ignited; scores more were badly burned. Marcelino Valdez, a Catholic priest in Tlahuelilpan, said in between funerals that many here support Lopez Obrador. But he doubted the president’s strategy would yield quick results in an area where nearly two-thirds of the population lives in poverty, according to government data. “The people don’t like to steal, it’s not something they enjoy,” Valdez said. “But they look up and see so much corruption, so much injustice, and they see that their hands are empty.” (For a graphic on Mexico's fuel theft problem, see tmsnrt.rs/2Tms3tZ) Hidalgo state, where Tlahuelilpan is located, is the nation’s leader in illicit breaches of Pemex pipelines. Fuel thieves known as huachicoleros last year drilled a record 2,121 illegal taps in the state, or nearly six each day, according to Pemex data. That is more than a six-fold increase in just two years. Oil industry experts say Hidalgo’s location is a big reason. Situated to the north of the Mexican capital, the state is home to Pemex’s second-biggest oil refinery and critical pipelines supplying the giant Mexico City metro area. Fuel prices are a factor too. At the start of 2017, the government of then-President Enrique Pena Nieto hiked prices by as much as 20 percent in a bid to end costly subsidies, a move many in Tlahuelilpan say is driving theft. Since Lopez Obrador’s term began on Dec. 1, the government says it has arrested 558 people accused of stealing fuel. It has frozen bank accounts and deployed soldiers to guard key Pemex installations, including the Tula refinery about 9 miles (15 km) southwest of Tlahuelilpan. While organized crime is a big player, the president has reserved particular disdain for Pemex, blaming crooked company insiders for much of the illicit trade. “We’re talking about a plan that has ties inside the government,” he said during a Dec. 27 press conference. Juan Pedro Cruz, mayor of Tlahuelilpan, likewise is suspicious of Pemex employees. He told Reuters he visited the site of an illegal pipeline tap shortly after he was elected in 2016. Cruz said he watched as Pemex workers carefully covered up the tap without disabling it. “What message did that send to me?” Cruz said. “They were going to use it again.” Cruz has faced questions too. Following the January accident, news reports linked him to a local warehouse that once was used to store stolen fuel. Cruz denied wrongdoing. He said Pemex solicited his help in finding temporary storage for gasoline recovered from crooks. In addition to arresting fuel thieves, Lopez Obrador has launched a new 3,600 peso ($189) monthly scholarship for unemployed Mexican youth, a program he has pitched as a way to address the root causes of crime. But some townspeople in Tlahuelilpan doubt it will dissuade many young people from seizing what some see as their only opportunity to get ahead. Mariano Hernandez, a local math teacher, said some fuel thieves can clear as much as 10,000 pesos ($525) daily. “They say, ‘I’d rather make a lot of money for one or two years than live many years in poverty,’” Hernandez said. The president’s steepest challenge may be persuading people such as Magali Ortiz that fuel theft is worthy of such high-profile scrutiny. Her husband Omar Vasquez died in the conflagration. Two other relatives are missing. Stealing fuel is “not a crime,” Ortiz said. “It’s a job.” ($1 = 19.0305 Mexican pesos) Reporting by David Alire Garcia; Editing by Dan Flynn and

2019-01-30,"WELLINGTON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Air New Zealand Ltd lowered its profit outlook by as much as 30 percent on Wednesday as it forecast revenue growth would ease due to weaker tourism, raising broader concerns about slowing arrivals to New Zealand and nearby Australia. Air New Zealand shares dropped more than 13 percent and were poised for their steepest daily loss in 17 years after the airline said it would lower capacity and review business plans. Shares in Australian rival Qantas Airways Ltd fell by as much as 5.8 percent. Both countries have been beneficiaries of a boom in tourism arrivals in recent years, led by the fast-growing Chinese market. But the latest statistics show signs of easing growth, with Chinese arrivals in New Zealand down 4.4 percent in November from the same period the previous year and up just 1.6 percent in Australia.  Air New Zealand said there was a trend of “softening inbound tourism traffic” as well as a weaker domestic leisure travel market that had led it to downgrade its pretax profit forecast to a new range of NZ$340 million (£177.85 million) to NZ$400 million for the financial year ending June 30.  That is as much as 30 percent lower than its previous guidance, taking into account the $NZ30 million to $NZ40 million impact from issues with Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC engines included in the latest forecast, Reuters calculations showed. The new estimate also includes a lower fuel-price forecast. “We are concerned with our latest outlook, which reflects the softer revenue growth we are seeing in the second half,” Chief Executive Christopher Luxon said in a statement. “We have commenced a review of our network, fleet and cost base to ensure the business is on a strong footing going forward.” Westpac Bank economist Paul Clark said New Zealand’s total annualised tourism growth was still around 3 percent in the 12 months ended October, but that was much slower than the roughly 11 percent growth hit in 2016 when the tourism boom was at its height.  Judy Chen, the chief executive of New Zealand’s Tourism Export Council, said some of the members it represents were reporting a softer summer compared with the previous year.  “There’s a variety of reasons,” she said. “Going forward, the outlook for Brexit, the potential slow down in the Chinese economy and the trade war will all probably play a role.” A UBS survey of Chinese traveller intentions released last month found a sharp pull-back in plans for trips to long-distance destinations such as Australia, New Zealand and the United States and a preference for trips closer to home in Asia. Tourism Australia Chief Executive John O’Sullivan said growth rates in Chinese arrivals had slowed from the 2015 peak as the market matured. “That’s why we are putting more focus upon repeat visitation, encouraging travel out of peak travel periods and encouraging our Chinese visitors to venture out of the cities and explore further afield,” he said. Air New Zealand and Qantas, which are due to release half-year financial results next month, declined to comment on Chinese booking trends. Air New Zealand cut its full-year capacity growth forecast to 4 percent, the bottom end of its prior range of 4 to 6 percent.

2019-01-30,"CARACAS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The struggle for control of Venezuela intensified on Wednesday, as the government prepared an investigation that could lead to the arrest of opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaido, who has called for new street protests. Venezuela’s Supreme Court imposed a travel ban on Guaido and froze his bank accounts in apparent retaliation for oil sanctions imposed by the United States that are expected to severely damage the OPEC member’s already collapsing economy. Guaido is recognized as president by the United States and most countries in the Western Hemisphere, presenting the biggest challenge to President Nicolas Maduro since he took office six years ago. The 35-year-old opposition lawmaker, who is president of the National Assembly, has called for clean elections, arguing that Maduro fraudulently won a second term last year. Guaido is offering an amnesty to tempt military officials to join him. Maduro, who accuses Guaido of staging a U.S.-directed coup against him, counts on the support of the military, and is unlikely to back down unless that changes. Russia and China are also key benefactors, giving him diplomatic backing at the U.N. Security Council. A former union leader who succeeded his charismatic mentor, the late President Hugo Chavez, Maduro has overseen a shrinking economy and the migration of more than 3 million Venezuelans fleeing food and drug shortages and hyperinflation. Guaido called for more protests on Wednesday and a mass march on the weekend, in a bid to keep up pressure on Maduro in the streets. Wednesday’s action would not be a major march, but a series of small concentrations, Guaido said. The U.N. human rights office said the protests had so far led to the deaths of more than 40 people. Government supporters have also attended large rallies led by Maduro’s political allies, while the president visited military bases including overseeing live-fire exercises in recent days. He ordered the creation of 50,000 popular defense units, community groups he said would be charged with the “integral defense of the fatherland.” While it was not clear if they would be armed, the strategy reflects the government’s concern the United States could try to defeat Maduro militarily. The Pentagon has refused to rule out military action, although is it not considered likely by most experts. Trump’s top advisers include Cold War-era hawks. White House national security adviser John Bolton fueled such speculation this week when reporters saw a notepad he was carrying had the words “5,000 troops to Colombia” written on it. Colombia neighbors Venezuela. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence met Guaido’s designated envoy to the United States on Tuesday. Pence said they discussed recent sanctions actions, “highlighting that these deprive Maduro and his cronies access to corrupt income and ... preserve the country’s wealth for the people of Venezuela.” The sanctions are also expected to hit daily life hard in Venezuela, where public spending is almost entirely funded by oil revenues. The government is eager to blame Guaido for the measures, which, once they begin to bite, could diminish his popularity. Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek Saab sought the preliminary investigation of Guaido on the basis that he had helped foreign countries interfere in internal matters.

2019-01-30,"(Corrects day to Wednesday in paragraph 1) By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Wednesday, pressured by a cloudy outlook for the global economy but supported by worries over disruptions to supply from U.S. sanctions on Venezuelan exports. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $53.28 per barrel at 0111 GMT, 3 cents below their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were 1 cent above their last close, at $61.33 per barrel. This followed a 2-percent price jump the previous session, when markets first digested the U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil exports. Washington on Monday announced export sanctions against Venezuela’s state-owned oil firm PDVSA, limiting transactions between U.S. companies that do business with Venezuela through purchases of crude oil and sales of refined products. The sanctions, aim to freeze sale proceeds from PDVSA’s exports of roughly 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil to the United States. They are the toughest U.S. financial challenge yet to Venezuela’s embattled socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. The step pushed up oil prices on Monday, but markets appeared more relaxed on Tuesday as the sanctions only impact Venezuelan supply to the United States. “The (Venezuelan) export volumes will not be eliminated from the market, but rather rerouted to other countries,” said Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, an analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy. With the United States dropping out as a customer for Venezuelan oil, she added that “China and India ... will be able to pick up these oil volumes at great discounts”. Other analysts also pointed to global economic weakness as countering supply-side concerns such as the voluntary supply restraint by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), which started late last year in a bid to tighten the market and prop up prices. “The Venezuelan political crisis as well as a Saudi pledge to lower output further should have boosted crude oil, but pulling in the opposite direction are heightened concerns about global growth, particularly that of China,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Denmark’s Saxo Bank. Global economic growth and fuel consumption are expected to slow this year amid a trade dispute between the United States and China, the world’s two biggest economies.

2019-01-30,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia needs to cut carbon emissions more sharply to meet its 2030 Paris Climate accord target, the OECD warned on Wednesday, contradicting claims by the country’s conservative government that the goal will be easily met. Despite rapidly growing use of wind and solar power, Australia remains heavily dependent on coal and natural gas for energy, while emissions from the transport sector are growing. That will make it tough for Australia, one of the 10 worst greenhouse gas emitters in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, to cut total greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030, as promised under the Paris agreement. “Australia needs to intensify mitigation efforts to reach its Paris Agreement goal: emissions are projected to increase by 2030,” the OECD said in a review of Australia’s environmental performance.  The report shows Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions are set to rise slightly from current levels to 570 million tonnes (Mt) of carbon dioxide equivalent, well above its commitment to cut emissions to between 430 Mt and 442 Mt. (GRAPHIC: Australia's greenhouse gas emissions projections to 2030 - tmsnrt.rs/2HzCfhg) “Adopting an integrated energy and climate policy framework for 2030 with an emission reduction goal for the power sector would avoid the projected rise in GHG emissions,” OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said in the report. The power sector is the country’s biggest single polluter, accounting for a third of greenhouse gas emissions. The report comes five months after the right wing of the Liberal-National coalition government forced the ditching of a long-awaited comprehensive energy policy and ousted former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull. His successor, Scott Morrison, scrapped the effort to craft an integrated energy and climate policy to focus only on driving down power and gas prices. Under pressure to do more from opposition Labor, the Greens and the country’s Pacific island neighbors, which face the threat of rising sea levels from global warming, Morrison has repeatedly said Australia will easily meet its climate accord target, as it has with the previous Kyoto accords. “This is an ambitious target but ... as indeed I have said on many occasions, we will meet our 2030 targets at a canter,”  Morrison said on a visit to Fiji earlier in January. The OECD urged Canberra to set an emission reduction goal for the power sector, use energy taxes and road pricing to better reflect the climate costs of fuel use, and increase investment in rail and public transport.

2019-01-30,"* Apple CEO Cook says U.S.-China tensions easing this month * Investors look to U.S-China talks, Fed meeting * Pound falls after UK parliament vote * Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 By Hideyuki Sano TOKYO, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures and Asian equities eked out modest gains on Wednesday as investors seized on Apple Inc’s earnings  and comments from its chief that U.S.-China trade tensions were easing, sending the iPhone maker’s shares soaring in after-hours trade. Sterling smarted from a 0.7 percent fall the previous day after British lawmakers rejected most amendments that sought to avoid Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, reviving worries of a chaotic withdrawal from the European Union. S&P 500 e-mini futures tacked on 0.1 percent in early trade while MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.05 percent Japan’s Nikkei rose 0.2 percent before erasing gains. On Tuesday Wall Street shares dipped, with S&P 500 losing 0.15 percent as technology-related shares were dogged by a string of weak earning results while a rebound in 3M and other industrials helped the Dow Jones Industrial Average squeeze out small gains. Apple shares rose 5.7 percent after the bell as the iPhone maker reported sharp growth in its services business. Investors were relieved that there was no fresh bad news after the company shocked financial markets at the start of this month when its rare revenue warning sparked fears the U.S.-China trade tensions are taking a toll on the once high-flying tech sector. CEO Tim Cook, who is in regular contact with U.S. President Donald Trump, also said trade tension between the United States and China is easing in January. That helped to boost optimism around current high-level trade talks between the two countries, even though many investors remain sceptical whether the economic giants can bridge their differences over a number of issues, including intellectual property rights and technology transfers. China’s Vice Premier Liu He is in Washington this week to meet U.S. officials, including Trump. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday he expected to see significant progress in talks with Chinese officials and that U.S. charges against telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd were a separate issue. “It seems December was the worst month and since then things might be starting to recover a bit. If we can see more such evidence, market sentiment will be bolstered,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. “Yet, it’s still not clear how strong any such recovery would be. I would bet markets will be range-bound from here,” he said. Investors are also looking to the outcome of the Federal Reserve’s rates review later in the day, with expectations policymakers will reinforce their recent dovish stance given signs of a slowdown in the U.S. economy. In the currency market, the British pound fell 0.67 percent on Tuesday and was last up 0.1 percent at $1.3078, off three-month highs of $1.3218 touched on Friday. British lawmakers on Tuesday instructed Prime Minister Theresa May to reopen a Brexit treaty with the European Union to replace a controversial Irish border arrangement - and promptly received a flat rejection from Brussels. “The possibilities of no Brexit and of an extension of the Article 50 deadline have fallen. Markets may be under-estimating the chances that we could have a hard Brexit,” said Takafumi Yamawaki, head of Japan FX and rates research at JPMorgan Securities. Other currencies were little moved. The euro changed hands at $1.1438, having risen to a two-week high of $1.14505 on Tuesday. The dollar was steady against the yen at 109.37 yen. In contrast, gold rose to 8-1/2-month highs of $1,312 per ounce, helped by flight-to-quality bids. Oil prices held firm after the United States imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan oil company PDVSA, a move likely to reduce the OPEC member’s crude exports and relieve some global oversupply worries. U.S. crude futures rose more than 2 percent on Tuesday and last stood at $53.21 per barrel.

2019-01-30,"(Repeats Jan. 29 column with no changes. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2S6klHd By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline consumption was flat in the first 10 months of 2018 as escalating motor fuel prices offset the impact of a strong economy and big employment gains. Flat-lining U.S. gasoline consumption combined with surging U.S. shale production and a slowing global economy to push the oil market towards surplus and explains the plunge in prices late last year. Gasoline consumption averaged 9.34 million barrels per day (bpd) between January and October 2018, which was slightly down from 9.36 million bpd in the same period in 2017. Full-year consumption is forecast to have declined by around 40,000 bpd, according to estimates from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Short-Term Energy Outlook”, EIA, December 2018). Consumption has shown little or no growth since 2017 after four years of variable but strong gains between 2013 and 2016 (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, Energy Information Administration, December 2018). Fuel use has flattened off even as the rate of economic growth has accelerated to an annual rate of more than 3 percent and almost 5 million non-farm jobs have been created since the end of 2016. But stagnating gasoline consumption has been consistent with a sharp slowdown in the growth of traffic on the nation's roads in the last two years (tmsnrt.rs/2S6klHd). Traffic volumes surged between 2014 and 2016, with vehicle-miles travelled often rising at year-on-year rates of 2-3 percent or more, but slowed sharply in 2017 and 2018, with gains slowing to 1 percent or less. Traffic volume in the three months from September to November 2018 was just 0.3 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier (“Traffic Volume Trends” Federal Highway Administration, December 2018). In the last quarter of a century, traffic growth has been closely correlated with both the state of the economy and changes in the cost of fuel. While the economy has remained supportive, higher oil prices have been strongly negative for gasoline consumption. Falling prices between 2014 and 2016 provided a stimulus to consumption but subsequent rises have caused that effect to unwind. The deceleration in U.S. gasoline consumption is one reason climbing oil prices helped push the global oil market towards a surplus in 2018 and why prices needed to fall to rebalance production and consumption. The impact of rising prices on U.S. motorists also explains why they are so sensitive for U.S. politicians and why President Donald Trump aggressively pressed OPEC to bring prices down last year. Finally, stagnating U.S. gasoline consumption explains why the oil market has become ever-more reliant on emerging markets and freight transport to absorb output growth from U.S. shale and other sources. Global oil consumption growth and prices have become increasingly sensitive to changes in economic growth outside the United States and the other advanced economies. As signs of a global slowdown in trade became evident in the second and third quarters of 2018, it became increasingly clear consumption growth would decelerate and prices would have to decline. Once the United States decided to grant generous sanctions waivers to Iran’s most important customers, allowing them to continue buying the country’s crude, the last remaining support was removed and prices fell. Lower prices are a necessary part of the market’s rebalancing process and, over time, should help restore some consumption growth in the United States and more importantly in emerging markets. But with so much consumption growth now geared towards China and other emerging markets, the outlook for market balance and prices in 2019/2020 will remain dominated by concerns about a possible global slowdown. Until the threat of a global slowdown is lifted, oil prices will struggle to recover, despite the efforts of OPEC and its allies to reduce production. Related columns: - Oil prices in 2019?

2019-01-30,"NEW YORK, Jan 29 (Reuters) - More than 24 hours after the United States announced large-scale sanctions on Venezuela’s nationally owned oil company, merchant trading firms and refiners were still deciphering what the measures prohibited. The sanctions, announced on Monday, are aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro from power, the strongest U.S. measures yet against the socialist president who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years. Traders who sell Venezuelan crude to the United States are looking for avenues to keep crude flowing during the sanctions, according to people familiar with the discussions, while U.S. companies who buy Venezuelan oil have also been looking for work-arounds, seeking counsel for instance on whether the use of third party intermediaries, such as commodity merchants, can continue. The sanctions here froze assets of state-run PDVSA and require U.S. firms to pay for oil using accounts controlled by the country's opposition party head and self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido. PDVSA is seeking to sidestep the restrictions by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, sources said. Oil sanctions in the past have been evaded by using intermediaries, said Scott Maberry, who specializes in international trade at Sheppard Mullin law firm, but he doubted that would happen with PDVSA. “I would not be surprised if this administration is vigilant and does not feel bound by past practices,” said Maberry. A U.S. Department of Treasury spokesman called the sanctions against PDVSA “extremely sophisticated,” adding that the department would “take questions from industry and stakeholders and issue FAQs as appropriate.” No FAQ (frequently asked questions) had been issued by Tuesday evening. Via PDVSA, Venezuela exports about 500,000 barrels of oil daily to the United States, mostly to PDVSA subsidiary Citgo Petroleum and U.S. companies Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp. It also imports products from the United States. The sanctions not only limit U.S. companies from paying PDVSA for crude, but also oil sales moved through multiple third parties, such as potential arrangements involving sending oil to Russia or China, which would later sell to an intermediary that would pass the oil on to U.S. buyers. Intermediaries that comply with U.S. sanctions in general and transact in U.S. dollars would still be subject to the Venezuela sanctions. Transactions sent through a multitude of parties would only be allowed if the revenues were sent to accounts inaccessible by Maduro’s government, according to a source familiar with the sanctions. “Treasury will be tracking this closely. The idea that this can get laundered and not tracked is far-fetched,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye in Washington and a former Energy Department official under President George W. Bush. The Trump administration has said the restrictions should have a minimal impact on the U.S. consumer, but some experts said they were concerned there could be unanticipated effects. “PDVSA has so many intertwined dealings and transactions with the U.S., including through Citgo, that the immediate impact of these sanctions is far more comprehensive on the U.S. economy than you would typically see,” said Scott Flicker, chair of the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings and head of the firm’s global trade controls practice. The United States exempted Citgo from sanctions until July 27. However, previous sanctions have already prevented Citgo from sending PDVSA its profits, which had been paid to the parent in the form of dividends. Analysts at Tudor, Pickering & Holt said that if Citgo was unable to import Venezuelan barrels, “some sort of impact on operations seems like a distinct possibility.” U.S. refiners last week asked the administration not to issue sanctions, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Tuesday. “Such a ban would further tighten the heavy sour crude market in the United States, resulting in higher crude prices for U.S. refineries and higher fuel costs for U.S. consumers,” the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, a trade association, said in a Jan. 23 letter to President Donald Trump.

2019-01-30,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela’s government struck back at self-declared interim president Juan Guaido on Tuesday, with the Supreme Court imposing a travel ban and freeze on his bank accounts despite a warning from Washington of “serious consequences” if it did so.  The court also said prosecutors could investigate Guaido, in apparent retaliation for sweeping U.S. sanctions on oil firm PDVSA, announced on Monday. The sanctions mean the state-run company may not be able to fulfil contracts with North American buyers, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said.  Aimed at driving Maduro from power, the sanctions were the strongest measures yet against the 56-year-old former union leader, who has overseen economic collapse and an exodus of millions of Venezuelans in recent years. The measures triggered higher global oil prices, angry responses from China and Russia and the first serious moves against Guaido since he challenged Maduro’s claim on the presidency last week. The Supreme Court approved a request from Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek Saab to open a preliminary investigation into Guaido based on accusations he helped foreign countries to interfere in internal matters. The court also imposed a travel ban on the 35-year-old leader and froze his bank accounts. As a lawmaker who heads the National Assembly, Guaido has immunity from prosecution unless ordered by a top court. But the 32-member Supreme Court is loyal to Maduro and moved quickly to open the investigation.  In response to news earlier of the attorney general’s plan, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton warned of “serious consequences for those who attempt to subvert democracy and harm Guaido,” in a tweet that described Saab as the “illegitimate former Venezuelan Attorney General.”  The United States and several other countries have recognised Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state and denounced Maduro as a usurper. Maduro, sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term after disputed elections last year, accuses Guaido of staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. Maduro is backed by a number of countries, including Russia. Maduro’s inauguration sparked protests throughout Venezuela. Over 40 people are believed to have been killed in political violence last week, including 26 shot by pro-government forces, five killed in house raids and 11 during looting, U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said on Tuesday. He said more than 850 people were detained between Jan. 21 and Jan. 26, including 77 children, some as young as 12.  Guaido said on Tuesday he did not underestimate the threat of imprisonment but did not believe it was “anything new.” Many opposition leaders have been imprisoned in the South American nation.  “We are here. We will keep acting and working to confront the humanitarian crisis,” Guaido told a news conference. Most experts believe the sanctions and other measures against Maduro will encourage him to step down only if he loses the support of the powerful military, which until now has been mostly loyal to the leftist ruling party founded by late President Hugo Chavez. Maduro appeared on a television broadcast from a military base on Tuesday, praising the soldiers’ loyalty. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday it had certified Guaido’s authority to control certain assets held by U.S.-insured banks, including government and central bank accounts. U.S. military invention is seen in Washington as highly unlikely, but President Donald Trump has repeatedly said “all options are on the table” and notes Bolton held at a Monday briefing containing the words “5,000 troops to Colombia” have raised questions. Oil minister and PDVSA head Manuel Quevedo said on Tuesday that PDVSA was considering declaring partial force majeure on its contractual obligations in the United States. The company would not allow the opposition to take control of its U.S. refinery unit Citgo, Venezuela’s key foreign asset, he said. All oil tankers leaving Venezuelan ports would have to pay for crude before departing, he said. “We can’t allow Venezuelan oil to be stolen,” he said in a speech on state television. PDVSA is also seeking to sidestep the sanctions by asking major buyers, including U.S. refiners, to renegotiate contracts, sources said. International Brent crude oil futures rose over 2 percent on Tuesday in reaction. Venezuela is among the world’s largest heavy crude oil producers.  The Kremlin condemned the sanctions as illegal interference, while China said they would lead to suffering for which Washington would bear responsibility. The sanctions could cause problems for Venezuela when it comes to servicing its sovereign debt to Russia, which stands at $3.15 billion, Russian Deputy Finance Minister Sergei Storchak told reporters on Tuesday. In Geneva, senior U.S. and Venezuelan diplomats traded jibes at a disarmament conference. Venezuela’s ambassador, Jorge Valero, said the Trump administration was preparing a “military invasion” and questioned whether Washington had the moral authority to “impose a diktat” on Caracas. Venezuela has sunk into economic and political turmoil under Maduro’s socialist government, with inflation seen rising to 10 million percent this year. The loss of revenue from the United States, the No. 1 buyer of Venezuelan crude, is sure to further hamper the government’s ability to import basic goods like food and medicine, exacerbating a humanitarian crisis that has prompted more than 3 million people to leave the country in recent years.
