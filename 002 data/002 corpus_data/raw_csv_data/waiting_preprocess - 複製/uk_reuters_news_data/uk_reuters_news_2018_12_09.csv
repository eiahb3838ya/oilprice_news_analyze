2018-12-09,"TOKYO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Stocks extended their slump in early Asian trade on Monday, with U.S. equity futures off to a softer start for the week as worries over U.S.-China trade tensions battered investor sentiment. S&P futures were down 0.6 percent and the Dow futures lost 0.7 percent, while Australian stocks declined 0.9 percent. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro’s comments that U.S. officials would raise tariff rates on Chinese imports if the two countries could not come to an agreement during a 90-day negotiating period fanned fresh concerns over U.S.-China trade relations. Markets were already reeling on news last week that Canadian officials had arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for extradition to the United States. The arrest was seen as an added threat to the resolution of a trade war between the world’s top two economies. Wall Street’s main indexes fell more than 2 percent on Friday in a broad sell-off, posting their largest weekly percentage drops since March. The dollar was on the backfoot after Friday’s soft U.S. jobs report raised worries that economic growth is moderating and the Federal Reserve may pause its tightening cycle sooner than previously thought. The dollar was down 0.25 percent at 112.45 yen and the euro added 0.2 percent to $1.1404. Other data straddling the weekend showed China reporting far weaker than expected November exports and imports, underscoring slower global and domestic demand and raising the possibility authorities will take more measures to keep the country’s growth rate from slipping too much.

2018-12-09,"(Adds details, background) By Ahmed Elumami and Ayman Al-Warfalli TRIPOLI/BENGHAZI, Libya, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Libya is shutting down production at its biggest oilfield after tribesmen and state security guards seized the El Sharara facility, field engineers and protesters said on Sunday, but there was no confirmation from state oil firm NOC. If true, the shutdown at the 315,000 barrel-per-day field would also force the closure of the El-Feel oilfield, located in the same remote and lawless southern desert. El-Feel usually pumps around 70,000 bpd. One field engineer said production was being shut, without giving a time frame or figures. A spokesman for the tribesmen which call themselves the Fezzan Anger Movement, Mohamed Maighal, also said the field was closed. But, adding to the confusion amid two days of contradicting comments, an oil source said late on Sunday that the field was still operational as NOC was trying to negotiate to avoid a full shutdown. He gave no output figure. El Sharara lies in Libya’s remote southwestern desert where state authority is weak, chaos rampant and phone connections patchy, making it difficult to get reliable information. NOC confirmed at noon only that guards had forced the closure of some pumps at El Bharara “which will result in on-site tanks filling within the next few hours and thus force a production shutdown,” a statement said. NOC could not be reached for further comment and did not issue a new statement after the hours had passed which it had said would take to fill the tanks. It warned of “catastrophic consequences”. “Shutting down production at the El Sharara field will have catastrophic, long-term consequences, it would take a long time to resume production because of the sabotage and theft that are likely to happen,” NOC said in a statement. The tribesmen stormed into the field premises on Saturday after NOC said some guards, supported by locals, had opened the gates, driving around in jeeps and filming themselves in video they sent to journalists. They stayed overnight in the vast, partly unsecured area, making good on a threat to stop production issued first in October should authorities not provide more development funds for their impoverished region. “We will not allow the El Sharara field to reopen unless the U.N. mediates,” Maighal said late Sunday afternoon. He said their southern Fezzan region had suffered decades of neglect and demanded that the revenue of the oil produced from local fields be used to fund development projects. NOC was scrambling to keep the field operating, working the phones from Tripoli, some 700 km (430 miles) to the north, and issuing a statement late on Saturday after a long silence saying the field had been occupied but remained “at present” open. Officials were at the same time trying to exploit the time it takes to gradually turn off wells to negotiate a last-minute solution while accusing some guards of being criminals. Field engineers say talks were complicated because the protesters were divided — the tribesmen wanted development which would time to get under way. Members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard (PFG) were ready to end the blockage if they get quick cash, saying they had not been paid recently. The guard has repeatedly asked the state to add more men to the public payroll. With Libya divided into two weak governments, armed groups, tribesmen and normal Libyans tend to take their anger out over high inflation and a lack of infrastructure on the NOC, which they see as a cash cow booking billions of dollars in oil and gas revenues annually. Libya recently brought oil output to up to 1.3 million bpd, the highest level since 2013 when a wave of oilfield blockages started, part of turmoil since Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.

2018-12-09,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria’s main opposition party said authorities had frozen the bank accounts of its vice presidential candidate in the run-up to elections next February. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) said late on Saturday accounts belonging to Peter Obi, its vice presidential candidate, his wife, family members and their businesses had been blocked by government agencies. The PDP did not identify them. The presidency could not be reached for comment and Obi did not respond to a call, text message or email seeking comment.  “Why is the presidency on a wild goose chase in investigating Peter Obi, who left office as Governor of Anambra state five years ago with a nationally acclaimed clean record,” the PDP said in a statement. President Muhammadu Buhari last month launched his campaign for re-election for a second term, running on his track record on corruption. Buhari’s handling of a struggling economy will also be a central campaign issue. PDP presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar, a former ally to Buhari, chose as running mate Obi, 57, to generate support in the southeast region, which includes Anambra, where the president has polled badly in past elections. Geographical affiliations in Nigeria are crucial in a sprawling nation of 190 million people from 250 ethnic groups. With a tight race in prospect, a strong showing in the southeast could give the PDP enough votes to deny Buhari, a former military ruler, a second four-year term.

In a presentation in Tabasco state, where the refinery is due to be built, the government said the new oil refinery would process 340,000 barrels per day (bpd). The refinery, which will cost about $8 billion, should produce 170,000 bpd of fuel, including 120,000 bpd of diesel. Afterward, Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said the government had not decided on the format for the contract for building the refinery. She added that the reduction in crude exports in order to refine in Mexico would be gradual.

2018-12-09,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s President-elect Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday tapped lawyer Ricardo de Aquino Salles to be his minister of environment, according to messages from the incoming president posted on social media. Salles served as secretary of environment in Sao Paulo state government in 2016 and 2017, when centrist Geraldo Alckmin was governor. Brazilian industry and agriculture groups in recent days had announced their support for Salles, who leads a business-friendly organisation in Brazil called Movimento Endireita Brasil that backs less bureaucracy and lower taxes. However, the Climate Observatory, a network of environmental organizations in Brazil, issued a statement critical of the nomination, saying Salles is a former member of Brazil’s Rural Society (SRB) and will give preference to farmers’ interests over environment protection. The 42-year-old lawyer, who unsuccessfully ran for a Congress seat in the October elections, is a member of the Partido Novo, a recently-created party in Brazil that pledges to  fight corruption and improve conditions for businesses. Brazil is home to the world’s largest rainforest in the Amazon, whose preservation is seen by climate experts as critical to avoiding higher concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that have been blamed for global warming.  Deforestation last year reached the highest level in a decade in Brazil as authorities have been unable to stop  illegal logging and irregular forest clearances for activities such as raising livestock and agriculture.  But Bolsonaro and some of his advisors have been critical of fines issued to rural producers for environmental crimes, which has led to concern by environment groups of a possible increase in deforestation. The President-elect had planned to merge the environment and agriculture ministries, but later changed his mind.  Bolsonaro has said he also favours a relaxation of environmental licensing processes for infrastructure projects and other businesses that have an impact on the environment, as he plans an aggressive agenda of investments to boost the economy.

2018-12-09,"RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister on Sunday ruled out the extradition of suspects in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Istanbul’s chief prosecutor filed warrants for the arrest of two former senior Saudi officials. Turkish officials said last week that the prosecutor’s office had concluded there was “strong suspicion” that Saud al-Qahtani, a top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and General Ahmed al-Asiri, who served as deputy head of foreign intelligence, were among the planners of Khashoggi’s Oct. 2 killing at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. “We don’t extradite our citizens,” Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said when asked about the arrest warrants. He was speaking at a news conference at a Gulf Arab summit in Riyadh. Last month, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned 17 Saudis, including Qahtani but not Asiri, for their role in Khashoggi’s murder. The Saudi public prosecutor has said the order to repatriate Khashoggi came from Asiri and that a travel ban has been imposed on Qahtani. Jubeir declined to confirm or deny whether the men were currently detained, referring the question to the Saudi public prosecutor.

2018-12-09,"By Natalia A. Ramos Miranda SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A massive cargo ship docked in the Chilean port of San Antonio at the end of November, carrying it its belly the first 100 electric buses from China that Chileans hope will revolutionize their public transport system.  Chile’s ambitious plan to face down its capital Santiago’s notorious smog problem includes the rollout of electric scooters, cars and taxis, as well as lorries for use in the mining industry.  Mineral-rich Chile - which is not only the world’s largest copper producer but also the second-largest producer of lithium, a key component in electric vehicle batteries - aims to increase the number of electric vehicles tenfold by 2022. Energy minister Susana Jiménez told Reuters the government wanted electric vehicles to account for 40 percent of Chile’s private fleet and 100 percent of public transportation on the roads by 2050.   The initiative puts Chile at the forefront of clean mobility in Latin America as well as among developing countries worldwide.   But it represents a significant challenge given the persistently high price of electric vehicles and the paucity of charging points in the country. Chile has just 40 public charging stations - half of them in Santiago, according to the energy ministry.     Enthusiasts of the new technology prefer to focus on the pluses of clean motoring, such as the reduction in noise and air pollution as well as lower fuel costs.  The operation and maintenance costs of an electric bus are also around 70 percent less than those of a diesel engine, according to Chile’s Ministry of Transport. “Chile will be second only to China as a nation with the greatest quantity of electric buses in the world,” Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said at the start of November, when the government took delivery of six BMW i3 electric cars destined for ministerial use.  Studies by McKinsey and Bloomberg bear his claims out - of the 385,000 electric buses on the road worldwide last year, 99 percent are in China.  The Netherlands and Britain have more than 300 electric buses each but they are spread among several cities rather than concentrated in one, as will be the case in Santiago.   The Chilean capital will have 200 in total, the government said. The 100 that recently arrived were manufactured by Chinese firm BYD Electronic International Co Ltd (0285.HK), financed by the local subsidiary of the Italian power utility Enel Generacion Chile SA ENGX.SN and will be operated by Metbus, a private Chilean company.  Another 100 due to be added to the Santiago fleet are being financed by French energy generation firm Engie Energia Chile SA ECL.SN and manufactured by China’s Zhengzhou Yutong Bus Co Ltd (600066.SS).    Other Latin American countries are catching on.  Mexico City has a booming market in electric scooters and bicycles. It also plans to introduce between 300 and 500 electric buses.  Peru has slashed the import tax on electric vehicles to zero while Colombia is converting public diesel buses to unspecified, cleaner engines.  If the present fleets of buses and taxis spread across 22 Latin American cities were replaced by electric vehicles today, by 2030 almost $64 billion in fuel would have been saved, and 300 million tons less of carbon dioxide equivalent would have been pumped into the air, according to a UN study. Chile offers electric vehicles exemptions from environmental tax and traffic restrictions, as well as subsidies and fast-track licensing to taxi drivers who switch to more energy efficient cars, the Ministry of Energy said. The government is also encouraging its mining industry to look at using electric lorries, with state copper miner Codelco recently announcing a pilot scheme to introduce them.  But the electric vehicle industry remains nascent across Latin America, partly due to the high costs.   A BMW i3 equivalent to those being tested by ministers would cost around $60,000 in Chile, prohibitively expensive for most motorists in a country where the average monthly wage is $410. Matías Asun, Greenpeace’s national director, said at the present rate of electric vehicles penetration, the government would have to take dramatic action to meet its 2050 goal.  “Our question to the government is this: From what year will it no longer allow combustion engines to be sold in Chile?” he said.

2018-12-09,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) has denied allegations that Chairman Hans Dieter Poetsch knew about the carmaker’s emissions test cheating almost three months before U.S. authorities made it public in September 2015.  Citing internal documents from investigators, German weekly Bild am Sonntag reported that Poetsch, VW’s finance head at the time, learned about the carmaker’s violations of the rules in late June 2015. The paper cites a confidential presentation from the VW legal department, available to investigators in proceedings about the carmaker’s alleged market manipulation. According to the report, a presentation dubbed “Sacramento” and dated June 24, 2015, stated that U.S. emissions rules were being violated and that the company may also have breached its supervisory obligations.  The paper also reported that, according to testimony from a leading VW lawyer, referred to as “witness P.”, Poetsch received the presentation on June 29, 2015. He was also informed then that 600,000 vehicles in the U.S. were affected and that the financial risk for VW stood at 35 billion euros ($39.8 billion). Volkswagen said in a statement on Sunday that it had been aware of the allegations for some time. “The presentation by the witness P. is emphatically rejected as inaccurate.” The diesel issue was the subject of a number of discussions with Poetsch in the summer of 2015, Volkswagen said.  “However, none of these discussions had the content and quality which could have made capital markets law relevant for Mr. Poetsch.” Volkswagen added that until the publication of the Notice of Violation by the U.S. authorities on September 18, 2015 it did not have sufficiently concrete indication of a situation that could be share price sensitive. Poetsch became VW chairman shortly after the “Dieselgate” scandal broke in 2015. Plaintiffs in a market manipulation lawsuit in Germany say Volkswagen failed in its duty to inform investors about the potential financial implications of the emissions test cheating, which has so far cost the company 27.4 billion euros in penalties and fines. The company has argued it did not inform investors of the issue because it did not want to endanger the chance of reaching a settlement with the U.S. authorities.

2018-12-09,"(Adds context, industry details) MEXICO CITY, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Mexico’s energy secretary Rocio Nahle said on Saturday that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s newly installed administration would cancel two February bidding rounds for oil and gas blocks, including Mexico’s first shale areas on offer. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has sharply criticized the landmark energy opening enacted by his predecessor, President Enrique Pena Nieto, whose government planned the February auctions. The new president previously said he would suspend future oil auctions pending a review of the more than 100 contracts already awarded, but has not detailed what would become of the auctions slated for February. Mexico’s oil industry is struggling to stem a long-running crude output decline, posing one of the biggest challenges for Lopez Obrador’s six-year term. He has yet to disclose a full plan for the sector. Nahle told reporters at an event in the state of Chiapas on Saturday that two bidding rounds would be canceled. Together they would have auctioned off 46 oil and gas blocks, including the first shale areas in Mexico to be offered to private and foreign oil companies. The dense rock has been successfully tapped over the past decade in the United States, including the lucrative Eagle Rock formation in Texas just across Mexico’s northern border. Nahle did not address auctions for partnership rights for seven onshore joint venture contracts with national oil company Pemex, which are also scheduled for February. Under Mexican law, the independent oil regulator known as the National Hydrocarbons Commission (CNH) runs the auctions and supervises contracts. The commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lopez Obrador’s energy initiatives have so far focused on reducing fuel prices by building a new refinery in his home state of Tabasco, where he is expected to announce details of the project on Sunday. He has also encouraged private oil producers already awarded contracts in Mexico to deliver barrels quickly.
