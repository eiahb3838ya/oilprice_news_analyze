2018-12-24,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices plunged more than 6 percent to the lowest level in more than a year on Monday, pulling back sharply late in the session as fears of an economic slowdown rattled the market.  U.S. crude futures CLc1 and global benchmark Brent LCOc1 hit their lowest levels since 2017 during the session, putting both benchmarks on track for losses of about 40 percent in the fourth quarter.   “What’s happening in the stock market is raising fears that the economy is grinding to a halt and thereby will basically kill any future oil demand,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “They’re pricing in a slowdown in the economy if not a recession with this drop.”  The fourth-quarter price decline is likely to cause producers to throttle back on their output, he said.  U.S. crude futures have hit the lowest level since June 22, 2017, as jitters have grown about the impact of the escalating U.S.-China trade dispute on global growth and crude demand. Brent crude is at its lowest level since Aug. 17, 2017.  Markets across asset classes have come under pressure as the U.S. government shutdown that began just after midnight on Saturday intensified growth concerns. Investors have flocked to safe-haven assets such as gold and government debt at the expense of crude oil and stocks. A gauge of stocks worldwide hurtled toward an eighth straight decline on Monday as investors ignored the U.S. Treasury secretary’s actions to reinforce confidence in the economy and U.S. President Donald Trump criticized the Federal Reserve as “the only problem our economy has.” The U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over Trump’s demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the shutdown could continue until Jan. 3. U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled at $42.53 a barrel, down $3.06, or 6.7 percent. Brent crude futures settled down $3.35, or 6.2 percent, at $50.47 a barrel. The market settled early ahead of the Christmas holiday. Prices extended losses in post-settlement trade. Brent fell 11 percent last week and hit its lowest level since September 2017, while U.S. futures slid to their lowest level since July 2017, bringing the decline in the two contracts to more than 35 percent for the quarter. The macroeconomic picture and its impact on oil demand continue to pressure prices. Global equities .MIWD00000PUS have fallen nearly 9.5 percent so far in December, their biggest one-month slide since September 2011, when the euro-zone debt crisis was unfolding. The U.S.-China trade dispute and the prospect of a rapid rise in U.S. interest rates have brought global stocks down from this year’s record highs and ignited concern that oil demand will be insufficient to soak up any excess supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia agreed this month to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day from January. Should that fail to balance the market, OPEC and its allies will hold an extraordinary meeting, United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Sunday. “Oil ministers are already taking to the airwaves with a ‘price stability at all cost’ mantra,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore.

2018-12-24,"(Reuters) - A gauge of stocks worldwide posted an eighth straight decline on Monday as investors ignored Trump administration attempts to reinforce confidence and the U.S. president called the Federal Reserve the “only problem our economy has.” Investors, also facing the likelihood of a prolonged U.S. government shutdown, fled to the relative safety of bonds and gold during the first day of a week of trading shortened by the Christmas holiday.  Oil prices, meanwhile, tumbled more than 6 percent on Monday to the lowest in over a year.  On Sunday, President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary responded to the ongoing selloff by calling top U.S. bankers and said he would convene a group of officials known as the “Plunge Protection Team.” “There are a whole number of factors that have triggered this latest risk-off climate, including the Fed’s very modest deviation from its (rate increase) plan and the government shutdown in the United States,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. “We may get some clarity on several factors in early 2019, starting with a clearer line of sight on the prospect for a resolution in U.S.-China trade dispute, but until then, there are some nerves.” MSCI’s world equity index .MIWD00000PUS, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 1.57 percent lower and down 8 percent over the past eight sessions. The index touched its lowest since early 2017. U.S. stocks have fallen sharply in recent weeks on concerns over slowing economic growth and efforts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy, with the S&P 500 index .SPX on pace for its biggest percentage decline in December since the Great Depression and on the cusp of confirming it is now in a bear market. The Nasdaq .IXIC has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high. Trump on Monday blasted the independent U.S. central bank, saying on Twitter that the “only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the market.” Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over Trump’s demand for funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the resulting government shutdown could continue into January. U.S. stocks followed broad indexes in Europe and Asia lower on Monday, with markets in Germany and Italy closed. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI fell 653.17 points, or 2.91 percent, to 21,792.2, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 65.52 points, or 2.71 percent, to 2,351.1 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 140.08 points, or 2.21 percent, to 6,192.92. [.N] “Markets (are) still under pressure from last week’s more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, with benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR rising 14/32 in price to yield 2.7418 percent. The gap between two and 10-year yields has shrunk to fewer than 0.15 percentage point, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded coming recessions in the past. “Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,” said Simon MacAdam, global economist at Capital Economics. “This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.” The flight to safe havens again boosted the yen, with the dollar hitting its lowest level against the Japanese currency since August. The yen JPY= strengthened 0.81 percent versus the greenback at 110.33 per dollar. Gold also has regained its appeal, holding near six-month highs XAU= over $1,268 per ounce.  Brent crude futures LCOc1 were down $3.02 a barrel at $50.80. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell $2.94 to trade at $42.65.

2018-12-24,"CARACAS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil and a seismic research company it hired to search for oil off the coast of Guyana declined on Monday to say when they might resume exploration work halted after a weekend confrontation with Venezuela’s navy. The foreign ministries of both neighboring South American countries said the incident had occurred within their territorial waters. A century-long border dispute has heated up in recent years as Irving, Texas-based Exxon has discovered more than 5 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana’s shores. Two ships owned by Norway’s Petroleum Geo-Services halted seismic survey activities after a confrontation Saturday with a Venezuelan navy vessel. The navy did not board the ships and none of the 70 crew members were injured, officials said. Exxon declined on Monday to say when the survey would restart, referring questions to PGS. Bard Stenberg, a PGS senior vice president, declined to comment on any resumption of the work or if the company has sought to have Guyana provide protection for its vessels in the future. There were two PGS ships involved in the confrontation, the Ramform Tethys and Delta Monarch, Stenberg said on Monday. “A couple hours later we learned that the Venezuelan navy had withdrawn from the area,” he added. Guyana’s Foreign Minister Carl Greenidge did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Critics of Venezuela’s socialist President Nicolas Maduro say he has rekindled tensions with its eastern neighbor over the Essequibo region, a sparsely populated area making up two-thirds of Guyana’s territory that is also claimed by Venezuela, to distract from a severe economic crisis in the OPEC-member nation. Venezuela is home to the world’s largest crude reserves, but production is hovering near its lowest levels in 70 years due to underinvestment, hyperinflation, and mismanagement under military control of the company. Saturday’s confrontation recalled an October 2013 incident when Venezuela’s navy seized a ship carrying out a seabed survey for Texas-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp in Guyana, accusing it of violating its maritime territory. Venezuela freed the vessel a week later.

2018-12-24,"* Pays $53 million to settle dispute * Nigeria is MTN biggest, most lucrative market * MTN says its tax affairs in Nigeria are up to date (Adds MTN statement, details) By Alexis Akwagyiram and Tiisetso Motsoeneng LAGOS/JOHANNESBURG, Dec 24 (Reuters) - South African telecoms operator MTN Group has agreed to make a $53 million payment to resolve a dispute in Nigeria, it said on Monday, ending a four-month multi-billion dollar dividend repatriation row that has hammered its share price. Nigeria is MTN’s biggest market, accounting for a third of the African telecoms heavyweight’s annual core profit, but it has proven problematic for the company in recent years. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had ordered MTN and its lenders to bring back a total of $8.1 billion it alleged the company had illegally repatriated using improperly issued paperwork between 2007 and 2008. “The CBN upon review of the additional documentation concluded that MTN Nigeria is no longer required to reverse the historical dividend payments made to MTN Nigeria shareholders,” MTN said in a statement. However, the central bank has found that a 2008 private placement remittance worth around $1 billion was based on certificates that did not have final approval. As such, MTN said it had been instructed by CBN to implement “a notional” reversal of that transaction by making a $52.6 million payment. “MTN Nigeria and the CBN have agreed that they will resolve the matter on the basis that MTN Nigeria will pay the notional reversal amount without admission of liability,” MTN said in a statement. The CBN confirmed the outline of the agreement with MTN, without mentioning the $53 million payment. The agreement would lead to an “amicable disposal of the pending legal suit between the parties and final resolution of the matter,” it said in a statement. MTN and the CBN had filed a claim and counter-claim in a Nigerian court over the dispute. The legal case has been adjourned several times as lawyers said talks were under way on a settlement. The settlement comes around two years after MTN agreed to pay a more than $1 billion fine for missing the deadline to cut off unregistered SIM cards. Shares in MTN have fallen by around 20 percent since the end of August when the CBN asked the company to return the money. The stock, which closed 2 percent higher on Monday, is also under pressure from a separate dispute with the attorney general of Nigeria (AGF), who has slapped the company with a $2 billion tax bill. MTN has gone to court seeking to block the attorney general from taking further action regarding the order for back taxes. The matter was adjourned last month until next February. “MTN Nigeria continues to maintain that its tax matters are up to date and no additional payment, as claimed by the AGF, is due, and consequently no provisions or contingent liabilities are being raised in the accounts of MTN Nigeria for the AGF back taxes claim,” the company said.

2018-12-24,"(Adds details, background) PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Engie Electrabel, the Belgian subsidiary of French energy group Engie, will restart its Tihange 3 nuclear reactor after completing repair works, easing fears of winter power shortages in Belgium. The company said it received clearance from Belgium’s AFCN regulator on Dec. 24 and the Belgian reactor was now expected back on the electricity grid by January 7, nearly two months ahead of the initial start date of March 2. The restart of Tihange 3 could ease Belgium’s power supply worries after six of the country’s seven nuclear reactors were forced offline for prolonged repairs due to concrete degradation and maintenance outages in September. Fears of winter power shortages and blackouts sent wholesale Belgian power prices to record highs. Nuclear power from the seven reactors operated by Engie accounts for around 50 percent of Belgian power needs. Engie said in a statement that with the restart of Tihange 3, in addition to three other reactors, around 4,000 megawatts of nuclear capacity would be available in Belgium during winter. It also said that it had arranged around 1,270 MW of additional capacity through a gas-fired plant, mobile diesel generators, curbs on industrial power use and imports from neighbouring countries, which will see it through winter.

2018-12-24,"ATHENS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Sixteen oil and gas firms have submitted applications for one or more of five Ghanaian offshore blocks in the West African country’s first exploration licensing round, its energy ministry said. The interest is a major vote of confidence in Ghana, which is keen to unlock more resources after it began pumping from its flagship offshore Jubilee field in 2010. The companies that have submitted applications are Tullow Oil, Total, ENI, Cairn, Harmony Oil and Gas Corporation, ExxonMobil, CNOOC , Qatar Petroleum, BP, Vitol , Global Petroleum Group, Aker Energy, First E&P, Kosmos, Sasol and Equinor. The applications include expressions of interest in competitive bidding for three blocks in the Western Basin and for direct negotiations regarding another two blocks offshore Ghana, the energy ministry said in a statement. “Τhe high level of interest shown by major International Oil Companies in our first licensing round is a vote of confidence in the Ghanaian economy,” Deputy Minister for energy in charge of petroleum, Mohammed Amin Adam, was quoted as saying. A total of 60 applications were received, but two were invalidated as they were for a block reserved for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation. Ghana currently produces 200,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), with the Jubilee field producing about 100,000 bpd. Some of the interested firms have already started boosting their presence in the country. ExxonMobil, for example, recently signed a deal with Ghana to explore for oil in the Deepwater Cape Three Point offshore (DWCTP) oilfield. Aker Energy AS, controlled by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, agreed in February to buy Hess Corporation’s Ghana unit in a $100 million deal, gaining access to a 50 percent stake in the deepwater Tano Cape Three Points block. The block holds an estimated 550 million barrels of oil equivalent in contingent resources and potential for a further 400 million barrels. Ghana wants to be a petroleum hub for West Africa. It has drawn up plans to build four refineries of about 150,000 bpd each in the next 12 years. Ghana’s only oil refinery, the Tema Oil Refinery, processes about 25,000 bpd of oil, far below its capacity.

2018-12-24,"PARIS (Reuters) - Central European energy group EPH, majority owned by Czech billionaire investor Daniel Kretinsky, has entered exclusive negotiations to acquire all the French assets of German energy group Uniper (UN01.DE), both companies said on Monday. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal. Uniper said it had received a unilateral binding offer from Energetický a průmyslový holding, a. s. (EPH), and had agreed to exclusive talks on the sale of its activities in France. Its assets in France include two gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 828 megawatts (MW), two coal power generation units with an installed capacity of 1,200 MW, a 150 MW biomass power plant and 100 MW of wind and solar resources. Jan Špringl, vice-chairman of EPH’s board, said in a statement that the group has entered a partnership with energy major Total (TOTF.PA) to transfer Uniper’s two gas-fired plants to Total once the transaction closes. A Total spokeswoman confirmed that the company had signed an agreement with EPH to acquire, from Jan. 1, 2020, the two Uniper gas power plants as part of its low-carbon electricity strategy. Total, which is expanding its foothold in the French electricity market, has said it plans to increase its power  generation capacity to 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2023 from around 5 GW now. Uniper, which also supplies gas and power to French residential and industrial clients, said its French business contributed low single-digit millions of euros to its 2017 income. The French government plans to phase out coal power generation by 2022 as part of its plan to curb carbon emissions. Uniper said in August it would have to review its business in France, which employs around 490 people, if the coal shutdown went ahead. A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters in September that Uniper had mandated investment bank Rothschild to explore a sale. EPH and Czech peer Seven Energy have pursued a contrarian strategy of snapping up older, polluting power generation assets while major European utilities are focusing on renewable sources. “Uniper France faces a special situation where the two coal-fired power plants, which are essential assets of the company both in terms of installed capacity and number of employees, have a limited life time based on the decision of the French government,” Špringl said in the statement. Špringl said the closure of the coal-power plants would require a reorganization and a new strategy, and privately-held EPH was ideally positioned for it. EPH gave no further details of its plans for the coal-fired power plants. If concluded, the Uniper deal would be Kretinsky’s second major acquisition in France this year after his Czech Media Invest acquired a 49 percent stake in Le Nouveau Monde, the main shareholder of France’s daily Le Monde in October. Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE) became Uniper’s largest investor in June after buying a 47 percent stake from E.ON (EONGn.DE) for 3.8 billion euros.

2018-12-24,"(Repeats with no changes to headline or text) * Canada nationalizes pipeline, Alberta intervenes to move crude * Environmental activism stymies pipeline projects * ‘Made-in-Canada crisis’ for world’s fourth largest oil producer * Ottawa pursues tighter regulation for pipelines By Rod Nickel and Julie Gordon WINNIPEG, Manitoba/VANCOUVER, Dec 21 (Reuters) - A decade ago, Canada’s oil sector was growing so fast it was predicted to become a global energy superpower, but a series of political missteps and formidable environmental activism has created a dysfunctional system requiring OPEC-style government intervention to move its oil to market. Canada produces 4.9 million barrels per day (bpd), more than any country other than the United States, Saudi Arabia and Russia, but the world’s fourth largest producer has had to nationalize a pipeline and the province of Alberta is exploring buying trains to handle a glut of oil sitting in storage. Canada’s crisis coincides with big producers taking market share away from OPEC members, mostly clustered in the Middle East. Global oil demand is expected to surpass 100 million bpd in 2019. The United States has driven exports to record highs on growing demand from China, India and other developing countries. But Ottawa has failed under two governments to effectively counter the strategy of environmental activists to attack the oil sector’s heart by choking its arteries - pipelines. Roughly 35 million barrels, twice the normal amount, of Western Canadian crude used to produce diesel, gasoline and jet fuel is stuck in storage. The energy sector accounts for nearly 11 percent of Canada’s gross domestic product. However, Canadian oil trades at a fraction of global prices, costing the economy C$80 million per day, the Alberta provincial government said. Alberta took the unusual step this month of temporarily curtailing 325,000 bpd starting in January - in the aftermath of a retreat from the oil sands by global companies including ConocoPhillips and Statoil ASA. “It’s become dire now because the writing is clearly on the wall. The issue is market access,” said Jihad Traya, manager of energy advisory service HSB Solomon. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, facing an election next year, offered the oilpatch this week C$1.6 billion in aid. In May, Ottawa agreed to buy the Trans Mountain pipeline in hopes of pushing through an expansion to nearly triple capacity as other proposed lines languished. In 2006, then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper boasted Canada would soon become an “energy superpower.” Canada was producing 2.6 million bpd, which moved smoothly to U.S. refineries through pipelines. Since then, production has nearly doubled, but pipeline growth has stalled. Both Conservative Harper and Liberal Trudeau squelched opportunities to complete pipelines just as opposition to more lines multiplied. Two projects were killed, and legal setbacks have stymied the development of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL and the government-owned Trans Mountain expansion. A year after taking office in 2015 Trudeau proposed a bargain aimed at satisfying both environmentalists and the oil industry - a national carbon-pricing plan to reduce Canada’s emissions while approving pipeline expansions. The strategy has inflamed both sides. When a court overturned Ottawa’s approval of the expansion of Trans Mountain in August, the deal was off and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley yanked support for Trudeau’s carbon plan just hours later. Indigenous and environmental opposition to pipelines has forced Trudeau to push for tighter regulations on future pipelines. The changes are necessary to “depoliticize” the system, Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said. “We need to fix the broken system that we have now so we are able to build the pipeline capacity that is so necessary.” But Trudeau has already shelved Enbridge’s Northern Gateway proposal, which would have run through northern Alberta to the Pacific coast, and the National Energy Board in 2017 toughened its review of TransCanada’s Energy East pipeline while it was underway. Both projects are now dead. Alberta is seeking to buy rail cars to reduce the glut, and earlier this month, the province ordered producers to cut output after its oil fell to a discount of $52 per barrel from U.S. oil in October. Notley told reporters on Tuesday that people in Alberta can make profits from oil and gas, “but they need Ottawa to take the handcuffs off. We need rail. We need long-term support for getting that pipeline built.” Alberta’s oil sands, a mixture of sand, water, clay and thick, heavy oil, became a compelling target for environmentalists as production expanded dramatically in the early 2000s. The mining process scrapes away trees and vegetation across huge tracts of land, leaving a path of destruction captured in aerial images, while a different production method using steam consumes huge amounts of natural gas. Clayton Thomas-Muller, an indigenous activist, said environmentalists grew frustrated trying to stop the industry’s expansion through the Alberta Energy Regulator, but found a new strategy of opposing the pipelines. They built wider coalitions, tapping into anger of Nebraska ranchers and drawing the attention of Hollywood celebrities such as director James Cameron. Opponents of TransCanada’s Keystone XL began protests at the White House in 2011, seeking arrest and attention. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama finally rejected the project in 2015. “Full credit to climate-change advocates, they kicked the snot out of Corporate Canada,” said Tim Powers, a Conservative political strategist. He said Canadian resource companies have been too focused on the regulatory process, while climate-change advocates “laid out a better, more compelling narrative” to win public opinion. U.S. President Donald Trump resurrected Keystone XL in 2017. But both KXL and Trans Mountain remain in regulatory limbo after courts ruled in recent months that the U.S. and Canadian governments failed to properly do their jobs. The cases that overturned approvals for Northern Gateway and Trans Mountain led companies to question investment in Canada. The end result is a Canadian oil patch in retreat. “My main fear is that other nations will continue to produce at market price and Canada will be left behind,” said Duncan Au, chief executive of CWC Energy Services Corp. The well drilling company has cut about 70 employees, or nearly 10 percent, since the beginning of 2018. “This is a made-in-Canada crisis,” Au said.

2018-12-24," (This December 23 story corrects ninth paragraph to show that Kuwait’s OPEC governor, not the Saudi OPEC governor, was addressing joint news conference.) By Ahmed Hagagy KUWAIT (Reuters) - OPEC and allied oil producers are ready to hold an extraordinary meeting and will do what is needed if the current cut in oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day does not balance the market next year, the United Arab Emirates’ energy minister said on Sunday. Extending the output pact signed in early December will not be a problem and producers will do as the market demands, Suhail al-Mazrouei told a news conference at a gathering of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) in Kuwait. “What if the 1.2 million barrels of cuts are not enough? I am telling you that if it is not, we will meet and see what is enough and we will do it,” Mazrouei said. “The plan (to cut oil production) is well studied but if it does not work, we always have the power in OPEC to call for an extraordinary meeting,” he added. “If we are required to extend for (another) six months, we will do it ... I can assure you an extension will not be a problem.” The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies agreed earlier this month to slash oil production by more than the market had expected. Still, oil prices fell on Friday to their lowest since the third quarter of 2017 as global oversupply kept buyers away from the market ahead of holidays over the next two weeks. [O/R] The UAE minister said a joint OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee would meet in Baku at the end of February or the beginning of March, as producers aim to return the oil market to the balance reached in the summer of 2018. Mazrouei was speaking at a joint news conference with the Iraqi and Algerian energy ministers as well as Kuwait’s OPEC governor, Haitham Al-Ghais. Saudi Arabia’s OPEC governor, Adeeb Al-Aama, who attended the OAPEC meeting, said oil market oversupply had fallen to 37 million barrels of crude in November from 340 million barrels in January 2017, when OPEC and its allies began cutting production in an attempt to lift prices. The Iraqi minister, Thamir Ghadhban, said there was an expectation that the output cut decision could be renewed, adding that Iraq would be willing to extend the production agreement in April. OPEC is set to hold its next oil output policy decision meeting that month in Vienna.   “We will be watching the prices and how they react over time,” Ghadhban said. Saudi Arabia is fully committed to the reduction agreement, Al-Aama said, adding that the world’s top oil exporter’s production in January was seen at 10.2 million bpd, lower than its output target of 10.3 million bpd under the recent pact. The kingdom has over-committed with previous cuts, reducing by more than its share and reaching compliance of 120 percent from January 2017 until May 2018, Al-Aama said.

2018-12-24,"* Uniper carrying out strategic review of French business * EPH says deal is opportunity to enter French market * EPH plans to transfer Uniper gas units to Total By Bate Felix PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Central European energy group EPH, majority owned by Czech billionaire investor Daniel Kretinsky, has entered exclusive negotiations to acquire all the French assets of German energy group Uniper, both companies said on Monday. The companies did not disclose the value of the deal. Uniper said it had received a unilateral binding offer from Energetický a průmyslový holding, a. s. (EPH), and had agreed to exclusive talks on the sale of its activities in France. Its assets in France include two gas-fired power plants with a total capacity of 828 megawatts (MW), two coal power generation units with an installed capacity of 1,200 MW, a 150 MW biomass power plant and 100 MW of wind and solar resources. Jan Špringl, vice-chairman of EPH’s board, said in a statement that the group has entered a partnership with energy major Total to transfer Uniper’s two gas-fired plants to Total once the transaction closes. A Total spokeswoman confirmed that the company had signed an agreement with EPH to acquire, from Jan. 1, 2020, the two Uniper gas power plants as part of its low-carbon electricity strategy. Total, which is expanding its foothold in the French electricity market, has said it plans to increase its power generation capacity to 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2023 from around 5 GW currently. Uniper, which also supplies gas and power to French residential and industrial clients, said its French business contributed low single-digit millions of euros to its 2017 income. The Duesseldorf-based company, which last month reported a 60 percent drop in adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the first nine months of the year, said in August it planned to carry out a strategic review of its French business which employs around 490 people. The French government has announced plans to phase out coal power generation by 2022 as part of its long-term energy plan to meet its goal of curbing carbon emissions, a decision which will have a direct impact on Uniper’s main generation units. “Uniper France faces a special situation where the two coal-fired power plants, which are essential assets of the company both in terms of installed capacity and number of employees, have a limited life time based on the decision of the French government,” Špringl said in the statement. Špringl said the closure of the coal-power plants would require a reorganization and a new strategy, and privately-held EPH was ideally positioned for it. EPH gave no further details of its future plans for the coal-fired power plants. If concluded, the Uniper deal would be Kretinsky’s second major acquisition in France this year after his Czech Media Invest acquired a 49 percent stake in Le Nouveau Monde, the main shareholder of France’s daily Le Monde in October. Finland’s Fortum became Uniper’s largest investor in June after buying a 47 percent stake from E.ON for 3.8 billion euros. Fortum had sought a full takeover of Uniper but was rebuffed by Uniper’s management. $1 = 0.8776 euros

MSCI’s world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was 0.15 percent lower on the day and down almost 7 percent in the past seven sessions — its worst stretch of daily losses since January 2016. The index is also just off its lowest level since March 2017. “There are a whole number of factors that have triggered this latest risk off climate, including the Fed’s very modest deviation from its (rate hiking) plan and the government shutdown in the United States,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. The U.S. Senate has been unable to break an impasse over U.S. President Donald Trump’s demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico, and a senior official said the shutdown could continue until Jan. 3. “We may get some clarity on several factors in early 2019 starting with a clearer line of sight on the prospect for a resolution in U.S.-China trade dispute, but until there are some nerves flying around,” Investec’s Shaw said. So much so that U.S. President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary called top U.S. bankers on Sunday amid an ongoing rout on Wall Street and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the “Plunge Protection Team.” U.S. stocks have fallen sharply in recent weeks on concerns over slowing economic growth, with the S&P 500 index on pace for its biggest percentage decline in December since the Great Depression. The Nasdaq has fallen nearly 22 percent from its Aug. 29 high. European stocks followed Asian bourses lower, with a pan-European index lower half a percent on the day and a shade away from a one-year low hit on Friday. This added to a similar move in MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan, though losses were limited as many bourses were either shut or set to close early ahead of Christmas. By 1000 GMT, Britain’s FTSE 100 had fallen 0.5 percent, while France’s CAC and Spain’s IBEX had eased 0.9 and 0.5 percent respectively. Germany’s DAX and Italy’s FTSE MIB were shut for Christmas. “Markets (are) still under pressure from last week’s more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus,” said Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets. The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds. Ten-year Treasury yields were near their lowest since August at 2.789 percent, having fallen over 40 basis points in just six weeks. The gap between two- and 10-year yields has shrunk to only 14 basis points, a flattening of the curve that has sometimes heralded economic turning points in the past. “Many of the financial and economic indicators that turn first around business cycle peaks are now flashing red in advanced economies,” warned Simon MacAdam, global economist as Capital Economics. “This is consistent with our view that the recent loss of momentum in the world economy will develop into a more severe slowdown in 2019.” The flight to safe havens again boosted the Japanese yen, with the dollar near a three-month trough at 111.02 yen on Monday. It fared better against the euro, which was undermined by a run of poor European data. The single currency hovered at $1.1399, after being as high as $1.1485 last week. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar index was a shade softer at 96.745. Gold too has regained its appeal, holding near recent six-month peak around $1,262.6300 per ounce.

2018-12-24,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asian stocks were subdued on Monday as investors fretted that political instability in the United States was leaving the country rudderless at a time when the global economy was showing signs of faltering. Moves were limited by a holiday in Japan while many bourses are set to close early for Christmas. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan lost 0.5 percent to its lowest in seven weeks. Yet Chinese blue chips managed to edge up 0.2 percent, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 recouped early losses to rise 0.4 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump’s budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue into January, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives. Trump on Sunday said he was replacing Defence Secretary Jim Mattis two months early, a move officials said was driven by the president’s anger at Mattis’ resignation letter and its rebuke of his foreign policy. Sources also told Reuters Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, a move that would likely roil financial markets. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin felt it necessary to personally call the heads of the six largest U.S. banks to calm nerves and made plans to convene a group of officials known as the “Plunge Protection Team.” “It provides more than enough fodder for perceptions of chaos and instability in the White House,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “At the same time, the government shutdown offers a true foretaste of what lies ahead once the new Congress in sworn in on January 3.” The political uncertainty has only added to the air of risk aversion, punishing equities to the benefit of bonds.

2018-12-24,"* Brent, WTI hover near lowest levels since Q3 2017 * OPEC+ to meet again if cuts not enough - UAE minister * U.S. oil drillers add 10 rigs last week - Baker Hughes By Jane Chung SEOUL, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Monday ahead of the Christmas holiday break, adding to last week’s steep losses on concerns about a global oversupply. International benchmark Brent crude futures fell 27 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $53.55 a barrel at 0106 GMT. Brent touched $52.79 on Friday, its lowest since September 2017. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures eased 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to $45.51 a barrel. WTI hit its lowest since July 2017 on Friday at $45.13. Rising oil supplies and a slowing global economy have put crude oil under pressure, with both benchmarks down more than 35 percent from their recent peaks in early October. Oil production has been at or near record highs in major producers the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. To ease supply worries, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia agreed earlier this month to cut oil production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). The cuts will take place from January. Should they not be enough to balance the market, OPEC and its allies will hold an extraordinary meeting, the United Arab Emirate’s energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Sunday. “Oil ministers are already taking to the airwaves with a ‘price stability at all cost’ mantra,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. The UAE minister “left all options on the table by suggesting that OPEC can hold an extraordinary meeting to discuss finding the right balance,” Innes added. Mazrouei said a joint OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee would meet in Baku in late February or early March. Adding to concerns about oversupply, the number of active U.S. rigs for drilling oil rose by 10 in the week ended Dec. 21 to 883, according to a report by General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm. The United States has emerged as the world’s biggest crude producer, pumping 11.6 million bpd of crude, more than both Saudi Arabia and Russia.
