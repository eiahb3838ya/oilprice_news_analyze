2018-12-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 5 percent on Tuesday in heavy trade due to fears of oversupply and deteriorating demand, extending a selloff that has taken major crude benchmarks down more than 30 percent from an October peak.  U.S. crude and global benchmark Brent both extended declines in post-settlement trade after trade group The American Petroleum Institute said U.S. inventories unexpectedly climbed in the latest week. [API/S] U.S. crude oil fell $3.64, or 7.3 percent, to settle at $46.24 a barrel, the weakest since August, 2017. In post-close trade, the contract was down 8 percent to $45.91 a barrel. Global benchmark Brent lost $3.35, or 5.62 percent, to settle at $56.26 a barrel. During the session, Brent hit a 14-month low of $56.16.  U.S. crude stocks rose by 3.5 million barrels in the week to Dec. 14 to 441.3 million, API said, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 2.4 million barrels. If that build is confirmed by U.S. government data Wednesday, it will be the first increase in three weeks. [EIA/S] More than 900,000 contracts changed hands on Tuesday, far exceeding the 200-day moving average of 591,000 contracts. Investor confidence is deteriorating, with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s December investor survey showed. “There was a flood of supply-side news yesterday which, in combination with the demand destruction that the stock market slide implied, got us below $50 (a barrel for U.S. crude), and that gave us a strong sell signal,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures with Mizuho in New York. World stock markets inched higher as investors focused on the next move for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which kicked off a two-day monetary policy meeting on Tuesday. Equity markets have had steep declines over the last two months, with several stock sectors having reached bear-market territory. The Fed is expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday amid a host of calls to pause its tightening cycle or risk harming the economy.  Among the bearish factors, Britain’s largest oilfield restarted production, increasing supply, the U.S. government said output from shale would top 8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year and data suggested U.S. crude inventories would rise this week.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers agreed this month to curb production by 1.2 million bpd, equivalent to more than 1 percent of global demand, in an attempt to drain tanks and boost prices. But the cuts will not happen until next month and production has been at or near record highs in the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. Russian oil output hit a record 11.42 million bpd this month, an industry source told Reuters. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected by year-end to surpass 8 million bpd for the first time, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. Britain’s largest oilfield, Buzzard, restarted after repairs on pipe work, a spokesman for operator Nexen said on Monday. Buzzard produces about 150,000 bpd and is the largest contributor to the Forties pipeline that brings oil to shore from more than 50 fields. Separately, Libya’s state oil firm declared force majeure on operations at the country’s largest oilfield, El Sharara. The 315,000 bpd field, located in the southern part of the country, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds.

2018-12-18,"QUITO, Dec 18 (Reuters) - Ecuador will slash gasoline subsidies and cut government workers’ salaries in a bid to reduce the fiscal deficit by $700 million, officials said on Tuesday, as the cash-strapped OPEC nation seeks to reduce its debt load. Ecuadorean President Lenin Moreno clinched a $900 million loan from top financier China last week and has not ruled out a possible funding deal with the International Monetary Fund. The South American country has struggled with low oil prices in recent years. Moreno has sought to reduce the fiscal deficit since taking over from leftist Rafael Correa in 2017. Moreno earned Correa’s endorsement during the presidential campaign, but has since fallen out of the former populist leader’s favor while pursuing more market-friendly policies. The measures announced Tuesday included a cut in gasoline subsidies that Finance Minister Richard Martinez said had cost the government more than $50 billion in the past 10 years. Prices will rise from $1.48 per gallon to $1.85 per gallon, closer to prices in neighboring countries, but the hike will not apply to public transit, Martinez said. “All Ecuadoreans have been paying for the fuel used by luxury vehicles, like Mercedes-Benz or 4x4s,” Martinez said at a news conference, adding that the subsidy cut will save $400 million a year. The government will also save $300 million by reducing the salaries of state employees, Labor Minister Raul Ledesma said.

2018-12-18,"Dec 18 (Reuters) - The North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC), the U.S. watchdog for the electricity grid, said on Tuesday that new pipelines and power lines would be required to meet power demands if there are large-scale retirements of coal and nuclear power plants. “Large-scale retirements would likely create the need for electric and natural gas infrastructure, expedited buildout of new generation and increased use of demand-side resources,” NERC said in a report. The shift to natural gas generation could leave the bulk power system vulnerable to fuel delivery risks in areas where pipeline service does not exist, the report said. U.S. President Donald Trump has been advocating for steps to stem a surge in coal and nuclear plant retirements in recent years, arguing that more shutdowns would leave the country less able to bounce back from disruptions caused by storms, physical attacks, and hackers. The report could help the Trump administration to justify subsidizing the continued operation of coal and nuclear power plants, which are being hurt by low natural gas prices and the growing use of renewables to produce power, though critics said it mostly looked at extreme scenarios of shutdowns.

2018-12-18,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The Canadian government said on Tuesday that it would spend     C$1.6 billion ($1.19 billion), mostly through loans, to assist the country’s oil and gas industry, which has struggled to move energy to U.S. markets due to full pipelines. Natural Resources Minister Amarjeet Sohi said in Edmonton, Alberta, that the aid package would include C$1 billion for energy exporters to invest in new technologies, boost working capital or find new markets. Canada is producing a record 4.9 million barrels of oil per day this month, according to National Energy Board estimates, but pipeline capacity has not expanded as quickly to move crude to U.S. refineries. The bottlenecks have resulted in steep price discounts. The federal aid package also includes C$500 million in commercial financing spread over three years to help high-risk oil and gas companies weather current market conditions, Sohi said. Another C$100 million will go toward energy projects through an innovation fund, and C$50 million will fund projects that involve reducing environmental damage from resource extraction. The funds will stabilize struggling oil companies, but they really need greater access to markets, said Mark Scholz, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors. The struggles of the oil sector, concentrated in the western province of Alberta, have generated rallies in the past month demanding that Ottawa do more to help. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s Liberal government bought the Trans Mountain pipeline in the summer with plans to expand it, but a Canadian court quashed government approval of the project. This month, Alberta Premier Rachel Notley took the rare step of ordering oil curtailments amounting to 325,000 barrels per day, starting in January, to reduce the province’s glut. Small oil producers will benefit from Ottawa’s support package, although it is “cut and paste” from federal aid for other sectors, Notley told reporters in Calgary. “It’s a start, but offering Alberta industry the opportunity to go further in debt is not any kind of long-term solution.” Both Trudeau and Notley face elections next year and the oil industry’s problems pose a political liability. The Canadian economy is projected to grow by 1.9 percent next year, more slowly than this year’s 2.1 percent pace, partly due to weak energy investment, the think-tank Conference Board of Canada said.

El Sharara, which produces 315,000 barrels per day (bpd) for the OPEC member, was taken over on Dec. 8 by groups of tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. Officials in the North African country have been unable to persuade the groups to leave the partly unsecured site amid disagreements on how best to proceed, workers at the field said. Some officials favour offering quick cash payments to the occupiers, but NOC officials have warned that would set encourage more blockades, El Sharara workers said. NOC has described the occupiers as militia trying to get on the payroll of field guards. This is a recurring theme in Libya, where many see the seizing NOC facilities as an easy way to get heard by the weak state authorities. Pumping will restart only after “alternative security arrangements are put in place”, NOC said in a statement late on Monday. “Production at Sharara was forcibly shut down by an armed group - Battalion 30 and its civilian support company - that claimed to be providing security at the field, but which threatened violence against NOC employees,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in the statement. His comments came after the chief of staff of the Tripoli-based government, Abdulrahman Attweel, described some of Sanalla’s previous comments about the protesters as “irresponsible”. “These people (guards) were there to protect the field without salaries and without any attention to them and their daily needs, not in terms of accommodation, supply, transportation and communication,” Attweel told al-Ahrar channel. The blockade has been complicated by the presence of tribesmen, who have argued against quick cash payments saying they want funds to improve hospitals and other services. In an apparent bid to win over communities, a separate NOC statement said it had sent “108 trucks carrying 3.479 million litres of vehicle fuel, 1.493 million litres of diesel and five trucks carrying 100 metric tons of cooking gas” to the main southern city of Sabha. Distribution would be coordinated with communities to make sure fuel was was sold at official subsidised prices, it said. The south suffers from fuel shortages because much is smuggled abroad. El FEEL The shutdown of El Sharara has not affected the El Feel oilfield, also located in the south. It continued to pump about 70,000 bpd, field engineers said. Its exports were being routed via the Melittah oil and gas port, which like El Feel belongs to a joint venture NOC has with Italian energy company Eni, another engineer said. A spokesman for NOC was unavailable. El Sharara crude is transported to the Zawiya port, also home to a refinery. NOC runs the field with Spain’s Repsol , France’s Total, Austria’s OMV and Norway’s Equinor, formerly known as Statoil.

2018-12-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German auto supplier IAV Gmbh has agreed to plead guilty and pay a $35 million fine for conspiring to assist Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) in its effort to evade U.S. diesel emissions standards, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday. IAV, which is 50 percent owned by Volkswagen, will serve two years of probation and be under the oversight of an independent monitor, the Justice Department said. Volkswagen has previously agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States, owing to claims from vehicle owners, environmental regulators, states and auto dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. Susan Bodine, assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement that “IAV designed the software that allowed VW to cheat U.S. air emissions standards.” The Justice Department said it would have sought a higher fine but it could have jeopardized IAV’s viability. “We take these matters very seriously and see this resolution as an important step forward for our company,” said Kai-Stefan Linnenkohl, president and member of the IAV management board. “The misconduct identified does not reflect who we are as a company today. We are committed to a culture of compliance and accountability.” Volkswagen pleaded guilty in May 2017 as part of a $4.3 billion Justice Department settlement. In total, nine people have been charged in the diesel emissions scandal and two former VW executives have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison terms. Justice Department official John Cronan said Tuesday in a statement the government’s “investigation into emissions cheating is ongoing and we will follow the evidence wherever it leads.” IAV is set to plead guilty on Jan. 18 in Detroit. Separately, the Justice Department has an ongoing investigation into alleged excess emissions from 104,000 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCHA.MI) diesel vehicles. The company has denied any wrongdoing and said there was never an attempt to cheat emissions rules. U.S. and California regulators stepped up scrutiny of diesel vehicles after Volkswagen admitted in 2015 to illegally installing software in U.S. vehicles for years to evade emissions standards.  Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) said in 2016 it has received requests for information about its diesel emissions levels from U.S. regulators and that the Justice Department had asked it to investigate its emissions certification process. Daimler has said it faced ongoing investigations by U.S. and German authorities into excess diesel emissions that could lead to significant penalties and recalls.

2018-12-18,"PUGET-THENIERS, France (Reuters) - A French actor and a self-taught inventor have designed a low-tech machine that converts plastic waste into diesel and petrol, which they say could help fight pollution and provide fuel for remote communities in developing countries. Proponents of plastics-to-fuel technology say the sector could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the next five years, and that by melting plastics into fuel they are providing a solution to the planet’s plastic waste crisis. Opponents worry that the process creates harmful fumes.  “The idea is to encourage the collection of waste before it ends up in the oceans with a machine that fits in a shipping container and can create an income,” said Samuel Le Bihan, who has starred in French movies such as “Disco” and “Mesrine”. For three-and-a-half years Le Bihan has bankrolled the development of the crude machine — dubbed Chrysalis — in a hangar in Puget-Theniers in the hills behind the Riviera city of Nice. Its designer is a 35-year-old self-taught scientist.  Plastic pellets are fed into a closed reactor where they are broken down at 450 degrees centigrade to produce diesel, gasoline and a carbon residue that can be used in crayons. “A kilo of plastic gives a liter of liquid. It’s separated between diesel and petrol,” said creator Cristofer Costes. With 50,000 euro additional financing from the local authority, the two men plan to create a larger prototype capable of converting 50 kilograms of plastic into fuel every 80 minutes.  Simple in design, it will be reparable even in the depths of the African bush, said Costes. Every year about 260 million tonnes of plastic is produced. U.N. data shows eight million tonnes of plastic - bottles, packaging and other waste - enters the ocean each year, killing marine life and entering the human food chain.  Conservationists have warned that plastic pollution in the oceans could outweigh fish by 2050. Similar technologies to the Chrysalis have already been developed by companies looking to help solve one of the greatest environmental problems facing humanity. British firm Recycling Technologies says their machine - the RT7000 - can transform hard-to-recycle waste plastic into a novel raw material, called Plaxx, which can then be re-used by the plastics industry. “If people see that plastic waste has a value they won’t chuck it away,” said Le Bihan. “I can’t imagine how many tonnes of plastic waste there is lying around that we could treat.” Editing by Richard Lough and Alexandra Hudson",https://uk.reuters.com/article/plastic-fuel-invention/refile-french-pair-invent-plastic-to-fuel-recycler-fit-for-african-bush-idUKL8N1YN4PA,18 Dec 2018,"A French actor

2018-12-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Scientists have discovered the most distant object known in our solar system, so remote and unusual they chose the nickname “Farout” for the slow-moving, icy, pinkish dwarf planet about 120 to 130 times further from the sun than Earth.  Astronomer Scott Sheppard of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington said on Tuesday the dwarf planet, officially designated as 2018 VG18, is estimated to have a diameter of 310 to 375 miles (500 to 600 km). There are roughly 50 dwarf planets in the solar system. The biggest are Pluto, with a diameter of about 1,470 miles (2,370 km), and Eris, with a diameter of about 1,445 miles (2,325 km). “When I saw the object for the first time, it was moving so slowly, it was the slowest thing I’ve ever seen. So I kind of muttered to myself, ‘Far out,” kind of like, ‘That’s cool.’ But it’s also a very-far-out object in distance, so that’s why I went with calling it ‘Farout,’” Sheppard said. Its discovery was announced on Monday by the International Astronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center. “We don’t know too much about it,” Sheppard added. “We only detected it last month. From its brightness, we can determine its size. We know its color. It has a pinkish, reddish hue to it. If you put ices out there and you irradiate them from the solar radiation over time, ices turn kind of a reddish, pinkish color. So we think its surface is probably ice-covered.” Sheppard and other scientists spotted Farout during their search for extremely distant solar system objects including a potential Planet X that he said could be five to 10 times the size of Earth. In 2014, these researchers proposed the existence of a ninth major planet at the outer reaches of the solar system. They said Farout is moving so slowly that it might need more than 1,000 years for a single orbit of the sun. The second-most-distant observed Solar System object is Eris, which orbits at about 96 times the distance of the Sun to the Earth. Pluto orbits at about 34 times the distance of Earth from the Sun.

Steep declines in equity markets over the last two months have sapped investor confidence, spurring fund managers to predict global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s December investor survey showed. MSCI’s world stock index rose 0.2 percent. The index has fallen 10 percent this year and is set for its worst year in a decade. U.S. stocks were boosted by upbeat earnings and tech stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 283.83 points, or 1.2 percent, to 23,876.81, the S&P 500 gained 22.54 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,568.48 and the Nasdaq Composite added 65.32 points, or 0.97 percent, to 6,819.05. Still, the benchmark S&P 500 index began the trading session almost 8 percent lower for December. “We’re facing the biggest December fall in U.S. stocks since 1931 and this is striking and worrying at the same time,” said Chris Bailey, European strategist at international financial services firm Raymond James. “We are at a regime shift moment and the debate is how big that regime shift will be.” A speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping, which investors had hoped could lift morale, had little impact, with Chinese shares falling over 1 percent . Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent. In addition, the German Ifo economic institute’s business climate index fell for the fourth month in a row to its lowest level in more than two years and Japan’s government revised down its economic growth forecasts. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump and his top trade adviser stepped up their criticism of the central bank’s monetary tightening, raising investor anxiety. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 4/32 in price to yield 2.8444 percent, from 2.857 percent late on Monday.

2018-12-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - EDF Energy has extended by several weeks outages at its Hunterston nuclear plant in Britain, while the company seeks to prove it is safe for the more than 40-year-old plant to restart after cracks were discovered this year. Reactors 3 and 4 have been offline since March and October respectively after cracks were found during routine inspections at the plant, which can produce enough electricity to power more than 1.7 million homes. Before EDF is allowed to restart the reactors it must show they can operate safely. It must present safety cases to Britain’s nuclear regulator, the Office for Nuclear Regulation. The safety cases “must demonstrate that, for the next period of operation, the reactor will operate and shutdown safely during normal operation and during a highly unlikely earthquake scenario”, a spokeswoman for EDF Energy, owned by French energy group EDF, said by via email.  Hunterston B-7 (reactor 3) is now expected to return to service on April 30 while Hunterston B-8 (reactor 4) is expected to be back online from March 31, EDF Energy said on its website. The spokeswoman said the outages had been extended to allow for the assessment of the new seismic analysis and further modelling work required to underpin safety cases. A safety case has already been submitted to the ONR for reactor 4 while the company is preparing to submit a safety case for reactor 3. “It is not possible for us to confirm with certainty how long this process will take,” the spokeswoman said. EDF Energy’s 15 nuclear reactors provide about 20 percent of Britain’s electricity. Almost half of that capacity is due to go offline by 2025. EDF said it still expects Hunterston to close in 2023. Britain’s Centrica also owns a 20 percent stake in the nuclear fleet but hopes sell this by the end of 2020.

The decision marks the end of a heated battle between the 53 municipalities that own Eneco and the company’s board. The shareholders voted by a large majority to sell the company in October last year, but the board said it would prefer a stock market listing or partial sale that would ensure continuity as a renewables-oriented company. The dispute led to the dismissal of both the company’s CEO and chairman as well as an investigation into board decisions. The decision to opt for an auction, however, was finally supported by all parties, spokesman Edwin van der Haar said, with a final decision on the sale expected by the end of next year.

2018-12-18,"BERLIN/FRANKFURT/MUNICH (Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) may have to step up its plans for mass production of electric vehicles in order to meet tougher-than-expected European targets to cut greenhouse emissions from cars, its chief executive said on Tuesday. The remarks came after the European Union agreed on Monday to cut CO2 emissions from cars by 37.5 percent by 2030, and follow warnings from Germany, home to the bloc’s biggest automotive industry, that tough targets could cost jobs and harm the sector. This is more than the 30 percent Volkswagen (VW), still reeling from an emissions cheating scandal, expected and would translate into a share for electric vehicles of more than 40 percent of its expected total vehicle sales in 2030, CEO Herbert Diess said. “This means that our planned restructuring programme, which is needed to address this systemic change, is not yet sufficient.” German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the targets were at the limit of what was technically and economically feasible. Around 436,000 industrial jobs in Germany are tied to building petrol and diesel engined vehicles. “This is a tough stretch and is at the higher end of expectations – however, we are convinced that this will help the industry to finally accept that combustion engines and platforms need to be standardized,” Evercore ISI analysts wrote. VW, Europe’s largest carmaker, has earmarked about 30 billion euros (26.90 billion pounds) for the next five years to make sure it can achieve CO2 cuts of 30 percent by retooling its production process to focus more on electric vehicles. The tougher EU targets, Diess said in e-mailed remarks, would require further changes to its strategy. “Restructuring our product portfolio, possibly further reducing our combustion engine-based offering and a significant adjustment of our plant structures and additional battery cell and battery factories would be necessary,” Diess said. He added the group’s plans needed to be reviewed in autumn 2019, in line with the carmaker’s planning calendar. Overall, VW plans to spend almost 44 billion euros on developing electric cars, autonomous driving and new mobility services by 2023, aiming to become the most profitable manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles. German rivals BMW (BMWG.DE) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) declined to comment on the EU targets, referring instead to statements from industry groups.  German car association VDA said the targets were too high and criticised the lack of a clear roadmap for how the reductions would be reached.

Novatek aims to produce as much LNG as Qatar, one of the world’s top LNG suppliers that exported 6.2 million tonnes in November. Novatek has one plant in operation and Arctic LNG 2 on the Gydan Peninsula in the Kara Sea will be its second. The first plant, Yamal LNG, began running at its full capacity of 16.5 million tonnes of LNG a year this month. This week, Novatek issued tenders to build an airport for Arctic LNG 2 and to recruit its personnel. Two sources close to the talks said Saipem and Novatek planned to sign a firm deal in Italy this week for the construction of gravity-based structure (GBS) platforms that will stand on the seabed to support the LNG processing units. One of the sources said Italian export credit agency SACE planned to issue guarantees to support development of the Arctic LNG 2 project. The Saipem-Novatek deal had an estimated value of about 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion), the source said. In 2016, SACE and French export credit agency COFACE provided insurance cover for the 750 million euro loan issued by Italian bank Intesa for Yamal LNG. SACE would not comment on any support for Arctic LNG 2. “We have an excellent relationship with Novatek. Our plan is to support Italian companies involved in the Arctic project to be developed in coming months,” a SACE spokeswoman said. Saipem declined to comment and Novatek did not reply to a Reuters request for a comment. Novatek plans to start producing LNG at Arctic LNG 2 in 2022-2023, with production of 19.8 million tonnes a year when at full capacity. Arctic LNG 2 is estimated to cost $25.5 billion, compared with Yamal LNG’s $27 billion price tag. French energy major Total has already agreed to buy a 10 percent stake in the project. Saudi Aramco is also among those interested in a minority stake. $1 = 0.8776 euros

Investor confidence has deteriorated further with more fund managers expecting global growth to weaken over the next 12 months, the worst outlook in a decade, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s December investor survey showed. U.S. stock futures  pointed to a firm open for Wall Street a day after U.S. stocks fell to their lowest levels in more than a year, while European equity markets recovered some ground  . Still the overall tone remained downbeat, with many investors questioning whether the U.S. Federal Reserve will be able to raise rates much further in the face of turbulent markets and a weakening economy. MSCI’s world stock index has fallen 10 percent this year and is set for its worst year in a decade.

Oil prices dropped 4 percent, weakening for a third consecutive session as reports of swelling inventories and forecasts of record U.S. and Russian output. U.S. crude oil dropped $2.04, or 4.1 percent, to a low of $47.84, its weakest since September 2017, before recovering to around $48.53 by 1150 GMT. Brent crude lost $2.41, or 4.0 percent, to a 14-month low of $57.20. The dollar extended its falls against major currencies ahead of the Fed meeting. The euro was up 0.4 percent at $1.13935, having recovered all of its losses from Monday when it was hit by weak euro zone data. The dollar was also weaker against Japan’s currency, trading down 0.5 percent at 112.26 yen. The U.S. dollar replaced technology stocks known as FAANGs in the United States - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - and China’s BATs - Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent - as the most crowded trade for the first time since January, Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s December investor survey showed. “This year has been quite remarkable in the sense that pretty much all asset classes have been down, which is even worse than 2008 because during the GFC (global financial crisis) we at least saw some safe havens - U.S. government bonds, gold - performing positively,” said Stefan Keller, asset allocation strategist at Candriam in Luxembourg. “At least in real terms, that’s not the case today. This is indeed a huge challenge. Clearly it’s in sharp contrast to last year’s optimistic outlook.” Safe-haven U.S. and German bond markets appeared to be the beneficiaries of the risk-off mood in world markets for now. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell to a one-week low of 0.23 percent, while 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest since August at 2.82 percent.

2018-12-18,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese export hub Guangdong has stopped publishing a monthly economic indicator that gauges growth momentum in its massive manufacturing sector after central authorities claimed local surveying and publication of the data to be “illegal”.  The southern province of Guangdong, famed for its vibrant tech scene and vast factory base as one of the first beneficiaries of China’s opening policy, has been particularly vulnerable to China’s bitter trade war with the United States this year as billions in U.S. tariffs hit Chinese exports.    Its manufacturing purchasing managers’ index (PMI), published monthly by the Guangdong Department of Industry and Information Technology, had been treading lower than the official index for five straight months until the data series stopped updating in October.  In a bearish sign for the industry, the value of export orders to the United States signed in November at China’s largest trade fair in Guangdong’s provincial capital Guangzhou dropped 30.3 percent on the year. The abrupt data suspension breaks a near seven-year tradition since Guangdong started the series at the end of 2011. In its last release for September, Guangdong’s PMI was 50.2, compared to the official gauge of 50.8 for the month.  In a Q&A published on its website on Tuesday, the National Bureau of Statistics said it received complaints at the end of October that Guangdong had been illegally surveying for a monthly index.  “The investigation showed that Guangdong’s Department of Industry and Information Technology failed to renew approval from the statistics bureau after its previous registration expired,” the bureau said.  It added the Guangdong government had also been publishing the PMI data without submitting the numbers to the bureau first to be audited and approved. The bureau said Guangdong was taking corrective measures and if conditions were met, the data release could be resumed again in the future. The Guangdong Department of Industry and Information, in response to an anonymous inquiry on its website about the missing data on Dec. 10, said it received notice from the bureau at the end of October that surveying for the PMI index should be arranged by the bureau and the department had stopped data collection at its request.

The new European rules require carmakers to reduce carbon emissions from cars across their fleets by 37.5 percent between 2021 and 2030. Volkswagen’s CEO said the rules would mean that VW will have to hike its electric car production to a level that it cannot meet with its current overhaul programme. “Due to the current decisions, a review of our planning is necessary, which will be done in autumn 2019, in line with our planning calendar,” he said.

Germany’s Ifo economic institute said its business climate index fell for the fourth month in a row to its lowest level in more than two years, adding to the global growth worries. Blue-chip bourses in London, Paris and Frankfurt fell as much as 0.8 percent in early trade with oil stocks leading the decline as crude prices slid more than three percent. A speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping which investors had hoped could lift morale had little impact, with Chinese shares falling over 1 percent . Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent, with Monday’s fall in U.S. stocks to their lowest levels in more than a year hurting sentiment broadly. Turbulent stock markets and slowing international growth have fuelled speculation that the Federal Reserve, which opens a two-day meeting on Tuesday, could now pause its tightening cycle or risk harming the U.S. economy. MSCI’s world stock index, down a quarter of a percent on Tuesday, has slid 9 percent this year and is set for its worst year in a decade. “This year has been quite remarkable in the sense that pretty much all asset classes have been down, which is even worse than 2008 because during the GFC (global financial crisis) we at least saw some safe havens - U.S. government bonds, gold - performing positively,” said Stefan Keller, asset allocation strategist at Candriam in Luxembourg. “At least in real terms, that’s not the case today. This is indeed a huge challenge. Clearly it’s in sharp contrast to last year’s optimistic outlook.” While the Fed is expected to lift rates this week, many investors expect signs of economic turbulence to prompt the Fed to signal a slowdown in the pace of tightening next year. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump and his top trade adviser ratcheted up their criticism of the central bank’s monetary tightening, raising investor anxiety. The dollar meanwhile weakened ahead of the Fed’s meeting. The euro was up 0.2 percent at $1.1373, having recovered all of its losses from Monday when it was hit by weak euro zone data. The dollar was also weaker against Japan’s currency, trading down 0.4 percent at 112.35 yen. “Markets are starting to price out the expectation of rate hikes to come,” said Rainer Guntermann, rates strategist at Commerzbank. “Our base case is a rate hike this week, then we expect the Fed to pause after that.” Safe-haven U.S. and German bond markets appeared to be the beneficiaries of the risk-off mood in world markets for now. Germany’s 10-year bond yield fell to a one-week low of 0.23 percent, while five-year U.S. Treasury yields fell to their lowest since May at 2.66 percent. Earlier on Tuesday, Xi called for the implementation of reforms but offered no new specific measures in a speech that marked the 40th anniversary of China’s move towards market liberalisation. Oil prices meanwhile extended losses on signs of oversupply in the United States and as investor sentiment remained under pressure from concern over global economic growth and fuel demand. U.S. crude fell as low as $47.84 per barrel, its lowest since September last year. Brent crude oil futures fell 3 percent to $57.79 per barrel.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan shed 0.9 percent in mid-afternoon trade while Japan’s Nikkei lost 1.8 percent to close at its lowest since late March. European shares are expected to start in negative territory, with spread-betters expecting Britain’s FTSE to open 0.8 percent lower and Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC to give up 0.6 percent each. Chinese shares slumped, with the blue-chip index dropping 1.1 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index down 1.2 percent, while Australian shares also lost 1.2 percent. Markets did not find any relief after a highly-anticipated speech by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday. MSCI’s broadest gauge of the world’s stock markets, ACWI , was down 0.2 percent on Tuesday, after having hit its weakest level since May 2017 the previous day. It has declined 16 percent from a top hit on Jan. 29. U.S. stock futures last traded around flat on the day after erasing gains of up to half a percent booked earlier in the session. On Monday, the S&P 500 lost 2.08 percent to hit its lowest since October 2017 as it breached lows reached during a sell-off in February, having wiped out about $3.4 trillion of market value since late September. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.27 percent, with Amazon, one of the best performing shares this year, sliding 4.5 percent. A profit warning from ASOS, a previously high-flying UK online-clothing retailer, shocked investors, sending U.S. consumer discretionary shares down 2.8 percent “U.S. retailers have been stocking up consumer goods from China before hikes in tariff, piling up inventories. From now their costs are seen rising next year. That may have been kind of known to everyone but it’s becoming reality,” said Tatsushi Maeno, senior strategist at Okasan Asset Management. In addition, the National Association of Home Builders Housing Market Index indicated U.S. homebuilder sentiment had fallen to a three-and-a-half-year low. It was the second consecutive month of disappointing reading. The gloomy data came after weak economic news from China and Europe late last week. “The likelihood is growing that more weak figures will come out compared to what is currently being expected,” said Harumi Taguchi, principal economist at IHS Markit, adding that she sees a rising risk that next year’s global economic conditions will be weaker than what’s expected now. The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to 2.841 percent, edging near a Dec. 10 low of 2.825 percent, its lowest level since late August. The Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates on Wednesday, which would be its fourth hike this year. But many investors now expect signs of economic turbulence to prompt the Fed to signal a slowdown in the pace of tightening next year. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump and his top trade adviser ratcheted up their criticism of the central bank’s monetary tightening. “It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!” Trump wrote in a tweet. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro amplified those remarks a few hours later, calling the Fed “crazy” for having signalled that it would continue to raise rates next year. The Fed said in September that its policymakers see three more rate hikes in 2019 while money market futures are pricing in less than one such move. “The major event between now and the end of the year is going to be what the Fed does tomorrow,” said Jim McCafferty, Hong Kong-based head of Asia-ex-Japan equity research at Nomura. “Given the pace of change of sentiment seen from not just companies but (also) from major macro-economies, I think there might be an outside chance that the Fed gives a more muted message in terms of growth and how aggressive it will be in terms of future rate hikes,” he added. The spectre of a “dovish rate hike” kept the dollar in check. The euro was largely steady at $1.1342, after having gained 0.40 percent on Monday. The greenback lost 0.2 percent against the Japanese yen to 112.53 yen, adding to Monday’s fall of nearly half a percent. The offshore Chinese yuan was slightly stronger at 6.8935 to the dollar. China’s Xi on Tuesday called for the implementation of reforms but offered no new specific measures in a speech that marked the 40th anniversary of the country’s move towards market liberalisation. China is also expected to hold its annual Central Economic Work Conference later this week, where key growth targets and policy goals for 2019 will be discussed.

2018-12-18,"SINGAPORE, Dec 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices fell 1 percent on Tuesday after slipping below $50 a barrel in the previous session, with reports of a big climb in U.S. inventories and forecasts of record shale output stoking worries about oversupply. Concerns around future oil demand amid weakening global economic growth and doubts on the impact of planned OPEC-led production cuts were also hurting prices, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $49.35 per barrel at 0035 GMT, down 1.06 percent, or 53 cents, from their last settlement. U.S. crude prices have tumbled more than 35 percent since early October and are currently at levels not seen since October 2017. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. “Crude oil prices were lower amid fears of weaker demand pushing inventories higher in the United States,” ANZ Bank said on Tuesday. Oil production from seven major U.S. shale basins is expected to surpass 8 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of the year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Monday. Inventories at the U.S. storage hub of Cushing, Oklahoma, rose by more than 1 million barrels from Dec. 11 to 14, traders said, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape on Monday. “Investors also remained concerned that OPEC will struggle to keep to its agreement to reduce output. This is likely to see prices remain under pressure until there is evidence that output is being cut,” ANZ Bank said in a note. Supply curbs agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its Russia-led allies might not bring about the desired results as U.S. output goes on increasing and as Iran keeps pumping out more oil, analysts said. Fuelling those doubts, Russian oil output has been at a record-high of 11.42 million barrels per day (bpd) so far in December. “There remains high suspicion as to what extent Russia will fill their commitment,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. “But enveloping supply concerns is the increasing likelihood of a protracted economic downturn in China that continues to stoke fears of demand slowdown,” Innes added. China’s November retail sales grew at their weakest pace since 2003 and industrial output rose the least in nearly three years as the economy lost further momentum. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise interest rates again at the end of its two-day meeting on Wednesday, impacting the dollar, which in turn may usher a major move in oil prices, analysts said.

2018-12-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Companies and factories in England will have a legal obligation to foot the bill for the disposal or recycling of waste packaging they produce under new plans by Britain’s environment minister. Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to eradicate avoidable plastic waste by 2042 as a growing flood of plastic endangers life in the world’s oceans. “We can move away from being a ‘throw-away’ society, to one that looks at waste as a valuable resource,” Michael Gove, minister for the Department of the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), said in a statement on the proposed overhaul to England’s waste system. “We will cut our reliance on single-use plastics, end confusion over household recycling, tackle the problem of packaging by making polluters pay, and end the economic, environmental and moral scandal that is food waste.”     Producers of items that are harder to recycle, such as cars and batteries, will have to take more responsibility for what they produce, while a byzantine system for household recycling will be simplified in a bid to boost recycling rates. The proposals only affect England as environmental policy is devolved to regional assemblies in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The issue of single-use plastics has become more salient this year after China cracked down on imports of plastic trash, leading the U.N. environment chief to call on developed nations to re-think their use of plastics. In October, finance minister Philip Hammond announced a tax on plastic packaging which does not meet a threshold of at least 30 percent recycled content from April 2022. Britain also wants to tackle food waste. Supermarkets and other food businesses will have to report annual food surplus and government may consult on mandatory targets to prevent food waste if no more progress is made. “Our priority is to stop surplus food from becoming waste ... Ideally, surplus food should be redistributed for people to eat,” Gove’s strategy paper said.

2018-12-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global coal demand will edge higher until 2023 as growth in India and other Asian countries offsets a decline in Europe and the United States, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Consumption of the fuel is expected to rise by an average of 0.2 percent a year from 5,355 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2017 to 5,418 Mtce in 2023, the Paris-based agency said. The report comes days after nearly 200 countries agreed to rules for implementing a landmark climate deal aimed at curbing emissions from fossil fuels to keep global temperature rises this century well below 2 degrees Celsius. “Despite significant media attention being given to divestments and moves away from coal, market trends are proving resistant to change,” the report said. Coal remains the second-largest global source of primary energy, behind oil, and the largest source of electricity. For the world to meet its climate goals, more work is needed to develop carbon capture, storage and use (CCSU) technology which captures and then either stores carbon dioxide underground or uses it in other industries, the IEA said. “Simply put - to meet our sustainability goals, there can be no future for coal without CCSU,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said. Just 18 large-scale carbon capture and storage plants are in operation around the world, according to the Global CCS Institute. Coal consumption in China is projected to fall 0.5 percent per year to 2,673 Mtce in 2023, driven in part by efficiency improvements and policies to curb air pollution. A sharp increase is predicted for India, with demand rising by 146 Mtce to 708 Mtce in 2023, boosted by a rise in coal-fired power output and production of crude steel, the IEA said.
