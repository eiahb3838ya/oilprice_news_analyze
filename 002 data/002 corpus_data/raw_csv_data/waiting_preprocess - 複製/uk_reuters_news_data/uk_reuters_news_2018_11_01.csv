2018-11-01,"(Repeats item issued late Thursday, with no change to text) * More new projects in renewable than fossil fuel in past few yrs * Aims to raise $2.5 bln for climate finance by 2020 * Has recently made offer to North Korea for reforestation project * Has had positive response from North Korea By Jane Chung SEOUL, Nov 1 (Reuters) - The outlook for renewable energy is “very positive” with more new investments in renewable than fossil fuel but further efforts and money are needed to tackle climate change, the head of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) said. Renewable energy will keep growing out to 2023 led by growth in bioenergy consumption as countries seek to reduce green house gas emissions as a way to keep the planet from getting warmer, according to the latest report by the International Energy Agency. “In the last few years the investments in new projects are much more in renewable than in fossil fuel,” Frank Rijsberman, Director-General of the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Thursday. “We see a very positive outlook for renewable energy but it still needs to be sped up.” The GGGI, initially set up as a think-tank in 2010 by South Korea’s then president Lee Myung-bak before being converted to treaty-based international organisation in 2012, aims to help emerging countries develop green growth models to meet both economic growth and climate change policy goals. Last year, the GGGI helped raise more than $500 million for climate finance through investment projects and government funds to support developing nations, and it aims to raise $2.5 billion by 2020, Rijsberman said. “We think for the world, trillions of dollars are necessary to invest in sustainable infrastructure... there are many billions of dollars out there. They are ready to be invested. We’re just at the beginning,” he said. To further support renewable energy and curb gas emissions, he said the upcoming U.N. climate talks in Poland in December were important to implement the Paris Agreement in 2015. Government ministers will try to agree on rules for the agreement’s implementation at the Dec. 2-14 meeting. “If we can finish that this year, we can start implementing. There are all kinds of things that are linked to that,” Rijsberman said. Capping the global average temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was a target agreed at global climate talks in Paris in 2015. The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report, warning that temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 should the world fail to take rapid and unprecedented measures to cap the rise. Rijsberman also said the organisation has been exploring ways to help North Korea such as with a study plan for 100 percent renewable energy for the Korean Peninsula. It also made a forestry project offer to the North Korean government. “We do forestry projects in other countries like Indonesia and Colombia ... so we’ve written to the North Korean government to make that offer and we have had the first positive response,” he said. Following the historic inter-Korean summit in April, North and South Korea have been in talks to restore destroyed forests in North Korea. “We’re hoping that humanitarian action is allowed and reforestation should be allowed under that.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters-Summits For more summit stories, see (Reporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/commodities-summit-gggi/rpt-reuters-summit-gggi-sees-positive-outlook-for-renewable-energy-but-more-efforts-needed-idUKL3N1XC7QE,01 Nov 2018,"* More new projects in renewable than fossil fuel in past

2018-11-01,"IKATA, Japan (Reuters) - On a side street near a darkened shopping arcade full of abandoned storefronts in southwestern Japan, the Sushi Ko restaurant is unusually busy on a weekday. Balancing a tray full of drinks, Sachiyo Ozaki said most of her restaurant’s customers were there because of an industry shunned elsewhere: nuclear power. “He drives a minivan to take workers to the plant,” she said, gesturing towards a man sitting at the counter. Pointing to another man sipping a beer, she added, “And he works in construction, so they’ve been busy too.”    “We’re all for nuclear power, and you can print that,” Ozaki said. In the mostly residential neighbourhood around her restaurant, hotel rooms and local inns were also packed with workers preparing to reopen Shikoku Electric Power’s (9507.T) Ikata nuclear plant, nestled next to Japan’s inland sea at the base of the verdant Sadamisaki peninsula. Nearly eight years after an earthquake and tsunami triggered nuclear meltdowns at Tokyo Electric Power’s (9501.T) Fukushima Daiichi plant, the battered industry is making a quiet and somewhat unexpected return in Japan. Ikata is a poster child for that recovery. In September, a court reversed a decision that had idled Shikoku Electric’s sole nuclear reactor for about a year, paving the way for the operator to re-open the facility last week.     Regional utilities like Shikoku Electric have aggressively fought a string of lawsuits since 2011, hiring veteran lawyers to beef up their legal teams. At the same time, they wooed towns where nuclear plants are based, visiting with residents door to door while the government kept up a stream of generous subsidies for local projects. Thanks in large part to this strategy, Japan is on track to have nine reactors running in the near future. That is a far cry from the 54 running before 2011 - all of which were idled after the Fukushima disaster - but more than analysts and experts expected, considering it seemed at the time like the end of the road for the country’s nuclear industry.   A Reuters analysis calculates that as few as six more reactors are likely to restart within the next five years, eight will mostly likely be mothballed and that the prospects for two dozen others is uncertain. Despite that cloudy outlook, nuclear power recently overtook renewables like wind and solar in Japan’s energy mix for the first time since Fukushima. Japan embraced nuclear power after World War II, spurred by the promise of clean energy and independence from foreign suppliers. But the botched Fukushima disaster response sowed public distrust in the industry and the government. Given that scepticism, some see a recent run of court victories by utilities as the resurgence of an alliance of industry, government and host communities that for decades promoted the construction of nuclear facilities. “If our losing streak continues, we could see 20 to 25 reactors come back online,” says Hiroyuki Kawai, a prominent anti-nuclear lawyer who represented citizens in a suit against Shikoku Electric. Since 2011, hundreds of citizens represented by volunteer lawyers like Kawai have filed nearly 50 lawsuits against the Japanese government and utilities in 25 district and appellate courts.  In Ikata, Shikoku Electric spent months gaining approval for a restart from the tougher post-Fukushima regulator, rebooting one of its plant’s three reactors in 2016. But in December 2017, an appellate court issued a temporary injunction keeping the reactor, already idled for routine maintenance, shut down for nine more months. In response, the company pulled more staff into its legal department and drafted its head of nuclear power to supervise the team. The utility also recruited outside lawyers who had handled cases for other operators. “There are only a handful of lawyers knowledgeable about nuclear litigation, so they’re popular and sought after,” said Kenji Sagawa, the deputy general manager of the company’s Tokyo office. Yoshiaki Yamanouchi, 76, began his career in nuclear litigation in 1973 when he represented Shikoku Electric in a landmark suit brought by Ikata residents seeking to stop the plant from opening. He still represents the utility and works with other companies, advising younger lawyers fighting similar cases, which he calls “superficial,” in far-flung district courts. “Utilities, in particular Shikoku, have gotten much smarter about fighting for the plants they know they can reopen and mothballing others that would cost too much time and money,” Yamanouchi said. The utility is decommissioning two of the three reactors at Ikata. Shikoku Electric would not disclose how much it has spent fighting legal challenges, but said it was a fraction of the cost of idling a plant. Every month a nuclear reactor sits inoperative, the utility spends 3.5 billion yen (£23.9 million) for additional fuel at its conventional power plants. Shikoku has also spent 190 billion yen on safety upgrades to meet stricter rules set by the Nuclear Regulation Authority. Activists have seen some victories. Western Japan’s Kansai Electric Power Co Inc (9503.T) has had its reactors slapped with temporary injunction orders multiple times over the years. All of these decisions were later overturned by higher courts. “Before Fukushima, these utilities won by default - now, they have to work harder,” said Yuichi Kaido, a lawyer who has spent three decades duelling Yamanouchi in court. Shikoku Electric still faces several lawsuits and injunction requests. A Hiroshima court rejected a request from residents to extend the suspension of the Ikata reactor on Oct. 26, a day before the operator restarted it.  The quiet revival of Japan’s nuclear industry is most tangible in rural areas like Ikata, which are home to the bulk of the country’s nuclear plants. Ikata is best known for its “mikan” mandarin oranges harvested on terrace farms on the sides of steep hills overlooking the Seto Inland Sea and Uwa Sea.    The town, with 9,500 residents, relies on nuclear power for a third of its annual revenue. Since 1974, Ikata has received more than 101.7 billion yen ($908.4 million) in such payments. These funds literally built the town; Ikata’s roads, schools, hospitals, fire stations and even five traditional “taiko” drums for festivals were all paid for with subsidies.  “My biggest struggle now is finding one or two more pillars for this town other than nuclear power,” said Ikata Mayor Kiyohiko Takakado. The town and utility’s mutual dependence stretch back decades.     Kiyokichi Nakamoto was a city councilman in Ikata when he successfully wooed the utility to his hometown. On the walls of the dim parlour of his home are framed commendations from two prime ministers, thanking him for his contributions to Japan’s energy policy. “We were a poor village with only farming and fishing,” the 90-year old said. Had the town failed to attract the plant, Ikata would have gone broke, Nakamoto said. In the wake of the Fukushima disaster, Shikoku Electric campaigned to reassure residents of their plant’s safety. Employees wearing the company’s blue uniforms went from house to house to explain how their plant was different from Fukushima Daiichi - and therefore safe. “If something like Fukushima happened here, our reputation would be destroyed in an instant,” said orange farmer Shigeto Suka, 54, as he checked the still-green mikan on branches. He and other farmers in Yawatahama, a neighbouring town 15 kilometres (9 miles) from the plant, worry that even a hint of contamination would devastate their brand.      After the 2011 nuclear disaster, Fukushima’s farmers and fishermen were unable to sell their produce because of fears over contaminated food. Dozens of countries still have restrictions on Fukushima produce. For others in the area, the Ikata plant feels like an inextricable part of life. Hiroshi Omori, 43, spent most days over the summer at Shikoku Electric’s visitors’ house overlooking the Ikata plant. His three young children take free art classes there while Omori and other parents wait in air-conditioned rooms sipping water and tea. But Ikata is projected to shrink to 5,000 residents over the next 20 years, and Takakado recently said he found it hard to imagine an industry that could replace nuclear power. This year he joined dozens of other mayors across Japan to voice their support for the industry and ask the government to clarify its position on building new plants or replacing old ones.  “I’m just trying to prevent the town from losing even more people,” he said.

2018-11-01,"WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry will visit Ukraine, Poland and other eastern European countries next week as the Trump administration seeks to offer them alternatives to buying coal and gas from Russia. Perry will also visit Hungary and the Czech Republic on the trip. He will meet with government officials on topics from nuclear energy to cyber security and coal and liquefied natural gas exports, the Department of Energy said in a release on Thursday. The Trump administration is seeking foreign markets for coal as domestic consumption has dropped to the lowest level since 1983 due to closures of coal-fired power plants that are suffering from abundant, cheap supplies of natural gas. In July, 2017 Centrenergo PJSC, one of the largest power companies in Ukraine, agreed to buy 700,000 tons of U.S. coal. Last month, Poland’s top natural gas company, PGNiG , finalized the terms of a deal to buy liquefied natural gas (LNG) from U.S. company Venture Global LNG, as part of a move to cut reliance on Russia. Poland has relied on Russia’s Gazprom for more than half of its gas under a long-term deal that expires in 2022. The United States is touting its LNG as more reliable than pipelined gas from Russia, but LNG is more expensive because of the costs of shipping and super-cooling the fuel to the point where it becomes a liquid.

2018-11-01,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - EOG Resources (EOG.N) on Thursday topped Wall Street’s third-quarter profit and revenue estimates on record oil production, and raised its spending outlook for the full year.  Spurred by higher crude prices and advances in hydraulic fracturing, U.S. producers have hit records nearly every month this year. In August, the country’s oil production hit a record 11.35 million barrels per day (bpd). Houston-based EOG produced 415,000 bpd in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 27 percent from the year-earlier period. EOG raised its estimate of full-year oil production growth to 19 percent.  EOG also lifted its spending budget for 2018 to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion, up from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion previously. The company said the larger budget would allow it to “retain high performing service providers” through the end of the year, and provide service continuity into 2019. The company said it has secured 65 percent of its expected 2019 services.   The uptick in spending comes as oil and gas companies have been pressured by investors to rein in costs and focus on boosting shareholder returns. Although EOG lifted its 2018 spending guidance, the company also said it was on track to reduce total well costs by 5 percent this year.  EOG reported adjusted net income of $1 billion, or $1.75 per share, versus $111 million a year ago. Analysts had anticipated the producer to earn an adjusted $1.52 per share in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue for the quarter totaled $4.78 billion, up about 81 percent.  Shares were down slightly in after-market trading, at $106.85. They had closed at $106.89 on Thursday.

2018-11-01,"Nov 1 (Reuters) - Magellan Midstream Partners LP on Thursday became the latest company to join a crowded group looking to build an oil export terminal on the U.S. Gulf Coast designed to load supertankers. U.S. oil exports are expanding rapidly, but volumes are constrained because the country’s shores have limited capability to load giant vessels that can carry about 2 million barrels of crude oil. Numerous companies - including private equity firm Carlyle Group and commodities merchant Trafigura, and other pipeline operators - have already announced proposals, in what is quickly becoming a crowded field of those looking to finance and break ground on a project. Currently the United States, unlike top exporters such as Saudi Arabia, has limited capacity to fully load Very Large Crude Carriers, or VLCCs, forcing companies to do ship-to-ship transfers in deep waters, which is costly and inefficient. Magellan said it is considering a potential export terminal on Harbor Island in Corpus Christi, Texas, capable of loading VLCCs. Earlier this week, Carlyle said it was looking to build in partnership with the Port of Corpus Christi, which would need substantial dredging to deepen its waterways. Other Texas and Louisiana projects have been proposed by companies including Swiss-trader Trafigura AG and pipeline operators Enterprise Products Partners LP and Tallgrass Energy LP . To be sure, Magellan warned that it would take “considerable time” before a final decision on the project is made. “It’s very competitive ... We’ve got significant interest to date, but we’ll see how it plays out,” said Chief Executive Michael Mears. U.S. crude production hit a record 11.346 million bpd in August, and exports surged to as much as 3 million bpd in June. Magellan also said the total cost of its proposed crude oil pipeline from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Gulf Coast is expected to be about $2 billion with Magellan’s share being about $500 million. Permian production has outpaced pipeline capacity, prompting several new lines to be announced. Separately, Magellan said volumes on the BridgeTex pipeline, which moves crude from Midland and Colorado City, Texas, to East Houston averaged over 395,000 bpd during the third quarter compared with about 280,000 bpd a year earlier.

2018-11-01,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - An expansion of LNG Canada has a cost advantage over its rivals in the race to build more liquefied natural gas export capacity, but a go-ahead decision on phase two is likely still a few years away, Shell Canada’s president said on Thursday. The first phase of the C$41 billion ($31.3 billion) Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS)-led project was given the go-ahead last month, firing up a race among companies eager to be the next to tap into booming Asian demand for the gas that is supercooled into liquid form for export by tanker. “What’s in our favor now is expansions are typically lower capital cost,” Michael Crothers, Shell Canada President, told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. “I think that opens up an even more competitive opportunity for us and the partners.” That expansion cost saving adds onto the project’s other advantages, including a relatively short shipping distance to key Asian markets and cheap feed gas. The question of when the second phase, which would double output at the 14 million tonne per annum (mtpa) plant to 28 mtpa, will be approved remains unclear, Crothers said.     “I’m sure Shell leadership would like to see demonstrated performance before we start to consider this too closely. So that’s still probably a few years away,” he said. He added an LNG Canada expansion would have to compete with global rivals, including options in the U.S., Africa and Middle East, and would depend on the market for the fuel - though all signs point to sustained Asian demand. LNG demand has risen sharply in recent years, led by China, gobbling up an anticipated surplus and fanning fears of a shortage by mid-next decade. This has projects around the world scrambling to secure the long-term deals they need to finance multi-billion dollar builds. LNG Canada is a joint venture between Shell, Malaysia’s Petronas [PETR.UL], PetroChina Co Ltd (601857.SS), Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) and Korea Gas Corp (036460.KS). One of the key benefits for Canada-based LNG projects is access to cheap gas, Crothers said, noting that Western Canadian gas prices are roughly $1 less than the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark NGc1 and are not expected to rise anytime soon. Gas prices are so low that Shell has stopped drilling new wells at its massive Groundbirch field in northern British Columbia and will only resume in 2020 to ready for LNG Canada shipments. Crothers also sees a first-mover advantage domestically on labor costs, noting that a construction slowdown in Alberta’s oil sands is allowing LNG Canada good access to skilled workers. Shell pulled back from the oil sands last year and has focused on the Duvernay and Montney shale formations, which produce mainly light oils and natural gas. The market for that light oil, known as condensate, is booming as oil sand producers use it as a diluent to run their heavy crude through pipelines. The risk is that heavy oil producers could cut output in response to low prices. “If oil sands plays decline or people shut in production ... then the demand for local condensate could drop and that will impact the price,” said Crothers. For now, Shell’s Alberta light tight oil assets remain one of the top areas of unconventional spending for the company, but Crothers noted that an unfavorable tax situation is hurting its competiveness globally. “The performance of wells continues to look very encouraging, costs continue to come down,” he said. “It would be helpful if there was a better competitive story Canada when it comes to the fiscals.” Crothers also said Shell Canada is open to acquisitions in key shale regions, but declined to comment on any specific opportunities.

2018-11-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets began November with a broad rally on Thursday after a brutal October, boosted by strong corporate earnings and signs that a trade war between economic giants, China and the United States, could be contained. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stock markets in 47 countries, climbed about 1.1 percent. October was the index’s worst month since May 2012, as it lost 7.5 percent when equity market took a beating from factors such as trade wars and concerns over world economic growth and higher U.S. interest rates. Investor sentiment was bolstered by remarks from U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, who said he had a “very good” talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea, and that the two planned to meet at an upcoming G-20 summit.  “Over the past few days, we’ve seen the pressure valve taken off the selling which certainly helps from a sentiment perspective,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 264.98 points, or 1.06 percent, to 25,380.74, the S&P 500 gained 28.63 points, or 1.06 percent, to 2,740.37 and the Nasdaq Composite added 128.16 points, or 1.75 percent, to 7,434.06. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.41 percent. Sterling extended its rally on Thursday after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and hinted at a slightly quicker pace of future rate rises if Britain’s exit from the European Union goes smoothly. Sterling’s advance nudged the U.S. dollar off its recent peak. The dollar index, tracking the greenback against six major currencies, fell 0.87 percent, with the euro up 0.88 percent to $1.1409. The index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a U.S. ADP national employment report showing private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October. The dollar has enjoyed a boost from robust economic data, including last week’s gross domestic product growth numbers which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. “We’ve got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling,” said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 5/32 in price to yield 3.1398 percent, from 3.159 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices sank amid concerns over weaker global demand and record supply from the world’s major oil producers.

2018-11-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump resumes sanctions on Iran, the success of his push to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities may hinge on how flexible he is willing to be on his extensive demands to coax Tehran into talks. Washington will reintroduce sanctions on Monday targeting Iran’s most important industry - oil - and U.S. officials have indicated a measure of flexibility is needed to ensure global markets are well supplied to keep prices from surging. In abandoning the international 2015 Iran nuclear deal, Trump and his top aides have touted the re-imposition of economic penalties on Iran as part of a “maximum pressure” campaign to force a change in a wide range of Iranian behaviour.  What Trump wants from Tehran, though, is seen by former officials as a “maximalist” position that includes ending uranium enrichment, giving U.N. inspectors access to all sites across Iran and ceasing support for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthis in Yemen and the Hamas Palestinian militant group. On May 21, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo listed 12 demands that also covered Iran ending development of nuclear-capable missiles, withdrawing forces under its command in Syria, and ceasing threatening acts toward its neighbours. “They are maximalist demands and no Iranian government would be willing or able to accept them,” said Robert Einhorn, a former U.S. official now at the Brookings Institution. Trump wants Iran’s government to capitulate or collapse, Einhorn said. “They are not going to knuckle under,” he said. “But if the administration began to signal some flexibility ... it’s possible the Iranian regime would agree to enter into talks.” Such flexibility could include signalling that Iran might limit, but not eliminate, uranium enrichment and that it might allow for greater inspections than in the 2015 deal, if not the anywhere-anytime inspections Washington wants. The sanctions resuming on Monday include those aimed to force Iran’s oil customers such as China, India and Turkey, to cut their oil purchases, ideally to zero, though the White House appears to recognise that is unrealistic. “We want to achieve maximum pressure but we don’t want to harm friends and allies either,” White House national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday, in a hint Washington may grant “exceptions” to these sanctions for countries that significantly reduce their purchases from Iran. Another penalty would be to blacklist roughly two dozen previously sanctioned Iranian banks, which may get the Brussels-based SWIFT financial messaging system to disconnect them, further inhibiting Iran’s trade with the world. When he abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, Trump promised to impose “the highest level of economic sanction” on Iran, saying this would make them want a new pact. “When they do, I am ready, willing and able,” he said. A central impediment to any negotiation is the lack of trust given Trump’s abrogation of the 2015 agreement and the Iranian belief that his real aim, despite U.S. denials, is to bring down its government. Richard Nephew, a former U.S. official now at Columbia University, summed up Tehran’s stance on talks as “Why bother?” Iran was more likely to try to evade and resist U.S. sanctions, taking a position of “if we are going to go down, at least we won’t go down on our knees, we’re going to die standing up,” Nephew said. Iran may try to survive the shrinking oil revenues for two years to see if Trump is re-elected and then decide on talks. “They will be averse to doing so from a position of abject weakness,” said Jon Alterman, a former U.S. official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Before talking, Iran would likely increase support for regional proxies or conduct missile tests to create chips it could concede in a negotiation. “If I had to bet, all these things will happen - the U.S. will tighten the screws, the Iranians will do more things that are worrying to the Trump administration, and the two sides will talk,” Alterman said.

2018-11-01,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell nearly 3 percent on Thursday, with U.S. crude futures hitting lows not seen since April, due to growing concerns that global demand is weakening at a time when output from the world’s major oil producers is surging. Record production from the United States and post-Soviet Russia, along with a big move upward in output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, has culminated in a move to the exits by speculators.  Oil has also been under pressure on growing concern over a possible slowdown in global growth as the U.S-China trade dispute remains unresolved, and is starting to hit emerging market economies in particular. U.S. crude prices are 17 percent below highs reached in early October. Analysts said they anticipate more selling in coming days, noting that oil was unable to capitalize on weakness in the dollar on Thursday, nor did it benefit from a rebound in equity markets.

Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled down $2.15, or 2.9 percent, at $72.89 a barrel, while U.S. crude CLc1 lost $1.62, or 2.5 percent, at $63.69, its lowest close since April 9. The declines accelerated on Thursday after U.S. futures broke through $65, which had served as a buying level throughout the spring and summer. More than 750 million contracts changed hands, exceeding the 200-day moving average of 576 million contracts a day. “As we drop down we see additional liquidation from speculators, and that keeps things heading south,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates.

2018-11-01,"MEXICO CITY, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Mexico’s state-run Pemex is expected to start operating in April the largest offshore oil platform built in the country in a decade, which was constructed by McDermott International, an executive of the engineering firm said on Thursday. Pemex is trying to reverse a 14-year crude output decline by boosting its offshore operations, especially in shallow waters along the southern Gulf of Mexico. Pemex has long been focused on the area, which is expected to see more activity from private producers that have won development rights there since 2015. The new platform will replace a similar one that was damaged by a large fire in 2016 that killed three workers. “McDermott is 100-percent vertically integrated. We were in charge of engineering here in Mexico, purchases, construction, transportation and installation. We will deliver the platform ready for operation,” Alfredo Carvallo, director of McDermott’s Mexico unit, told Reuters in a interview. The Abkatun-A2 platform required an investment of $454 million, 180 Mexican engineers, 2,600 direct workers and over two years to be completed, Carvallo added. The facility can handle up to 220,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude output and 352 million cubic feet per day of natural gas. It is expected to serve Pemex’s most prolific shallow-water oilfields, including Ku-Maloob-Zaap, located in the Campeche Bay. The 15,000-tonne platform, built near the port of Altamira in northeastern Tamaulipas state, is the first one fully assembled in Mexico. Transportation to its final location is expected to be completed in November, followed by installation and testing in the following months. McDermott has built 10 platforms in the last decade for Pemex and is working on two additional infrastructure projects for the state-run firm. The company has been using its Altamira hub to build platforms for oil companies across the Americas, including Trinidad & Tobago in the Caribbean. McDermott earlier this week said it was awarded a contract by Brazil’s state-run Petrobras to design and build a pipeline associated with a gas export system in the Santos basin’s pre-salt area. McDermott also announced it plans to divest its global storage tank business and pipeline construction in the United States, which had combined revenues of about $1.5 billion last year. Pemex’s crude output slightly increased to 1.825 million bpd in September, but its accumulated annual average of 1.863 million bpd is 4 percent below last year’s production, the company said on Thursday.

2018-11-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump increased economic pressure on Venezuela’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday with new sanctions aimed at disrupting the South American country’s gold exports. Trump signed an executive order to ban anyone in the United States from dealing with entities and people involved with “corrupt or deceptive” gold sales from Venezuela, Trump’s  national security adviser John Bolton said in a speech in Miami. “The Maduro regime has used this sector as a bastion to finance illicit activities, to fill its coffers, and to support criminal groups,” Bolton said. Bolton made the announcement as part of a pledge to crack down on what he called “the troika of tyranny” in the western hemisphere, naming Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. Miami is home to large numbers of immigrants from Cuba and Venezuela. Bolton made his appearance there just days before U.S. congressional elections that include close races for a Senate seat and the governorship in Florida. Bolton’s remarks were likely to be well received by those Cuban-Americans and other Hispanics in Florida who favor stronger U.S. pressure on Cuba’s Communist government and other leftist governments in Latin America. Bolton spoke at Freedom Tower - a building where Cuban refugees were welcomed in the 1960s following Fidel Castro’s revolution - a day after Trump campaigned in Florida for Republican candidates. Florida has traditionally been a swing state and former President Barack Obama was scheduled to rally Democrats in Miami on Friday ahead of the Nov. 6 elections. Bolton said Cuba is aiding Maduro’s government in Venezuela, referring to the close ties between the two countries since Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, came to power in 1999. Trump has taken a harder line on Cuba after Obama sought to set aside decades of hostility between Washington and Havana. He has rolled back parts of Obama’s 2014 detente by tightening rules on Americans traveling to the Caribbean island and restricting U.S. companies from doing business there. Bolton said the U.S. State Department would “within days” add more than two dozen entities to a list of Cuban organizations associated with country’s military and intelligence services. U.S. persons and companies are banned from doing business with the restricted companies. He said the administration would review whether to allow U.S. citizens whose property was seized by the Castro government to sue foreign companies that have invested in the properties in Cuba. The review, requested by a group of Republican lawmakers from South Florida, was first reported by McClatchy. “We want to look at this question with a fresh set of eyes,” Bolton said. Bolton also singled out Nicaragua for criticism over leftist President Daniel Ortega’s crackdown on political opponents, saying its government “will feel the full weight of America’s robust sanctions regime” with measures coming “in the very near future.” Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015, driven out by food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. Thousands have made their way to south Florida. Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an “economic war” led by the United States. Venezuela this year turned to gold as a way to receive desperately-needed hard currency, exporting 23.62 tonnes of gold worth $900 million to Turkey in the first nine months of the year, compared with zero in the same period last year, official Turkish data showed. In 2016, Maduro declared war on illegal miners and declared gold a strategic priority in an effort to spur production in the so-called ‘Mining Arc’ to create an alternative source of revenue for the oil-dependent economy. Critics and opposition leaders say this decision has in fact led to a surge in wildcat mining and violence, with the government reaping the benefits of illegal gold production. The country’s gold revenues remain small compared to the OPEC member’s oil sector, which accounts for over 90 percent of export revenue. The Trump administration had threatened sanctions on Venezuela’s oil industry, but a senior U.S. official said this month there is less need to target the energy sector given that it is unraveling under Maduro-appointed military officials. Analysts say higher oil prices and a desire to protect U.S. Gulf Coast refiners have also weighed on Washington’s decision. Early in his presidency, Trump briefly spoke about a “possible military option” for Venezuela, without providing details. Bolton brushed off a question about whether Trump would consider interventions other than stepped-up sanctions. “I don’t see that happening in part because I am very firmly of the view that as the sanctions torque up, the pressure will become unbearable,” Bolton said.

2018-11-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s largest oil producers could reverse their strategy of raising output and revert to reduction mode if the price of crude holds near $70 a barrel into next year, Mercuria Chief Executive Marco Dunand said on Thursday. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), together with Russia, Oman and others, embarked on a strategy in 2017 of cutting output to drain a vast overhang of global oil inventories and prop up the price. “If we start moving into the low $70s on Brent, I think some of those producers will start asking themselves whether they haven’t overreacted to the earlier price rally and start considering balances,” Dunand told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. “They’ve spent the past three years bringing inventories down to more historical levels. Is there going to be enough cohesion among them to curtail production again?” The producers’ plan worked to the extent that the price of a barrel of oil rose to a four-year peak around $85 a barrel in early October, from less than $45 in mid-2017, while global inventories fell to OPEC’s five-year target. With the impending loss of anything up to 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude exports because of U.S. sanctions, OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, has pledged to raise output to prevent the gap between supply and demand from becoming too tight. Sanctions come into force from Nov. 4.  The price has slipped to around $72 in recent weeks, thanks largely to concerns over the impact to demand growth from an escalating trade dispute between the United States and China, while inventories worldwide have begun to swell again. Mercuria trades more than 2 million bpd of oil and, together with rivals Vitol, Trafigura and Gunvor, ships billions of tonnes of commodities between the world’s producers and consumers. “Because of trade tensions and a number of other factors, such as a bit of exuberance on other fronts, there is plenty of risk that demand growth will not be a strong as originally anticipated,” Dunand said. “If you put it all together, the chances are that we are going to be building (oil) inventories.” Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (For more summit stories, see) Reporting by Amanda Cooper; Editing by David Goodman",https://uk.reuters.com/article/commodities-summit-mercuria-oil/reuters-summit-mercuria-says-oil-near-70-is-litmus-test-for-producer-strategy-idUKL8N1XC7GK,01 Nov 2018,"The world's largest oil producers

2018-11-01,"(Reuters) - Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) on Thursday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on improved onshore oil production and higher sales prices, sending shares of the U.S. oil and gas producer up more than 5 percent. Oil sales volumes from the company’s U.S. onshore business were 109,000 barrels per day in the third quarter, up 23 percent from a year ago. Overall volumes from onshore assets averaged 249,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a gain of roughly 14 percent.  The company’s total sales volumes declined by 10,000 bpd versus a year ago to 345,000 bpd due to lower offshore output in Israel and Equatorial Guinea, and the sale of its deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico assets earlier this year. The Houston-based company said average realized prices for U.S. onshore oil rose roughly 41 percent to $65.54 per barrel from a year ago, benefiting from a rise in crude prices to four-year highs during the quarter.  Noble, which has operations in Colorado, said it is closely watching the outcome of a ballot measure in that state that would place strict curbs on new drilling activity near populated areas. The company said it has contingency plans if voters pass the measure in the Nov. 6 election.  “We are confident the measure will be defeated,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Stover told analysts on a conference call on Thursday.  Other energy companies with operations in Colorado, including Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Liberty Oilfield Services Inc (LBRT.N), have said they could move investments and equipment to other states if the measure passes. Noble’s total third-quarter revenue rose to $1.27 billion from $960 million.     Net income attributable to Noble was $227 million, or 47 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $136 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Noble earned 27 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 18 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

2018-11-01,"WASHINGTON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Washington ratcheted up pressure on Venezuela’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro on Thursday with new measures aimed at disrupting the South American country’s gold exports, U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said. Bolton promised a tough stance by the Trump administration toward “dictators and despots near our shores” and singled out Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua in a speech in Miami, which is home to large numbers of migrants from Cuba and Venezuela.

In his prepared remarks for the speech, Bolton said President Donald Trump had signed an executive order to ban U.S. persons from dealing with entities and individuals involved with “corrupt or deceptive” gold sales from Venezuela. “Many of you in the audience today have personally suffered unspeakable horrors at the hands of the regimes in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, only to survive, fight back, conquer, and overcome,” Bolton said in his prepared remarks. “The troika of tyranny in this hemisphere - Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua - has finally met its match,” he said. Bolton spoke at Freedom Tower - a building where Cuban refugees were welcomed in the 1960s following Fidel Castro’s revolution - a day after Trump campaigned in Florida for Republican candidates in tight Senate and gubernatorial races.

2018-11-01,"(Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator TransCanada Corp said on Thursday it is eyeing joint ventures and asset sales, among other options, to finance the construction of its $8 billion Keystone XL crude oil pipeline. The Calgary-based company also said it has had substantial interest from potential partners for its Coastal Gaslink pipeline, which will carry natural gas to the LNG Canada export terminal in British Columbia. “In terms of where we would ultimately end up in terms of equity ownership, I’d give you a range of us retaining somewhere between 25 percent and 49 percent ownership, post bringing in JV partners,” said Chief Executive Russ Girling on a conference call. TransCanada said it will start construction on the 670 kilometer (420 miles) gas pipeline in 2019, despite a jurisdictional review by the National Energy Board. The company did not say when it expects to make a final investment decision on Keystone XL, but said it continues to work toward construction on the 830,000 barrel-per-day oil pipeline in 2019 and is looking at all options for financing. “We do have a sizeable portfolio of saleable assets, contracted, that we would be willing to part with to fund part of the Keystone XL program,” said Girling. “We would entertain JV partners on this project.” The company did not say how much stake it would want to retain in Keystone XL, which it is has been developing for more than a decade. The project has galvanized environmentalists, tribal groups and ranchers in opposition to the $8 billion 1,180 mile (1,900 km) pipeline that would carry heavy crude from Canada’s oil sands in Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. From there the crude would be sent to refineries and potentially for export. TransCanada said it now expects a decision on routing from the Nebraska Supreme Court by the first quarter of 2019, as oral hearings began on Thursday. It is also anticipating a Montana court ruling in December, along with a final environmental assessment report on routing changes that month, and additional permits issued by early 2019. U.S. President Donald Trump has backed the project, which was axed by former President Barack Obama in 2015 on environmental concerns emission concerns. The company, which reported a 52 percent rise in third-quarter results, said earnings from its liquids pipelines business rose 56 percent to C$316 million. Net income rose to C$928 million ($708.18 million), or C$1.02 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from C$612 million, or 70 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier.

2018-11-01,"NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - State-run Indian refiner Hindustan Petroleum said it may resume buying Iranian oil if New Delhi secures a waiver from U.S. sanctions, its chairman M K Surana said on Thursday. India is Iran’s top oil client after China and hopes to get a waiver on U.S. sanctions before they take effect on Sunday, after significantly reducing its oil imports from Iran. “Why not?” Surana told a press conference, when asked if his firm would look at resuming oil imports from Iran if India gets a waiver. “Iranian crude is not a significant item in our crude basket.

2018-11-01,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that Iran should implement policies to safeguard its macroeconomic stability in the face of reimposed U.S. sanctions that will cut Iranian economic growth by reducing oil exports. IMF spokesman Gerry Rice also told a regular media briefing that the Fund was urging Iran to strengthen its anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing frameworks to comply with international standards by a deadline in February 2019. “The reimposition of U.S. sanctions will reduce economic growth by restricting Iran’s oil exports and Iran should implement policies to safeguard macrostability,” Rice said, particularly “the most vulnerable groups.” Rice said the IMF was sending a mission to Islamabad on Nov. 7 to launch financing talks with Pakistan, which formally requested an IMF bailout program during the fund’s annual meetings in Indonesia in October. The talks are aimed at reaching a staff-level agreement, which would be submitted to the IMF’s executive board for consideration, Rice said.

2018-11-01,"HOUSTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation of utility company NiSource Inc over gas explosions and fires in three Massachusetts communities that killed one person and injured at least 21 others in September, the company disclosed on Thursday.  Grand jury subpoenas were served to NiSource and its subsidiary Columbia Gas of Massachusetts on Sept. 24, according to a NiSource regulatory filing. The company said it is cooperating with the investigation.  The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts is conducting the probe, NiSource said in its filing.  The explosions occurred in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, all communities northwest of Boston, while Columbia Gas of Massachusetts was conducting repairs on its system. Fires erupted after the gas lines became over-pressurized, and critical valves controlling the flow of gas were not shut for almost 3-1/2 hours after the first alarm was raised.  NiSource spokesman Ken Stammen declined to comment on details related to the investigation, and a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling, whose office is overseeing the investigation, also declined to comment.  NiSource recorded $461.9 million in expenses related to the incident in its third quarter and said it expected to recover most of those costs through insurance. The company has liability insurance for damages up to roughly $800 million, according to its filing.  Shares of NiSource were up less than 1 percent in morning trading at $25.56. The disaster was the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline incident since 2010 in terms of structures involved, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. Eight years ago, a gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Company ruptured in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, destroying 38 buildings and damaging 70 others.  NiSource said it replaced all of the 45-mile distribution network necessary to return service to Massachusetts customers impacted by the explosions, but that it had further work to do.  It anticipates restoring service to all customers affected by the gas-line explosion by Dec. 16, executives said on the call.

2018-11-01," (The Nov. 1 story corrects the year in paragraph 5 to 2012 from 2013) By Jane Chung SEOUL (Reuters) - The outlook for renewable energy is “very positive” with more new investments in renewable than fossil fuel but further efforts and money are needed to tackle climate change, the head of the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) said. Renewable energy will keep growing out to 2023 led by growth in bioenergy consumption as countries seek to reduce green house gas emissions as a way to keep the planet from getting warmer, according to the latest report by the International Energy Agency.     “In the last few years the investments in new projects are much more in renewable than in fossil fuel,” Frank Rijsberman, Director-General of the Seoul-based Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Thursday. “We see a very positive outlook for renewable energy but it still needs to be sped up.”   The GGGI, initially set up as a think-tank in 2010 by South Korea’s then president Lee Myung-bak before being converted to treaty-based international organization in 2012, aims to help emerging countries develop green growth models to meet both economic growth and climate change policy goals.   Last year, the GGGI helped raise more than $500 million for climate finance through investment projects and government funds to support developing nations, and it aims to raise $2.5 billion by 2020, Rijsberman said. “We think for the world, trillions of dollars are necessary to invest in sustainable infrastructure... there are many billions of dollars out there. They are ready to be invested. We’re just at the beginning,” he said. To further support renewable energy and curb gas emissions, he said the upcoming U.N. climate talks in Poland in December were important to implement the Paris Agreement in 2015. Government ministers will try to agree on rules for the agreement’s implementation at the Dec. 2-14 meeting.   “If we can finish that this year, we can start implementing. There are all kinds of things that are linked to that,” Rijsberman said.    Capping the global average temperature rise to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels was a target agreed at global climate talks in Paris in 2015.  The U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a report, warning that temperatures are likely to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius between 2030 and 2052 should the world fail to take rapid and unprecedented measures to cap the rise.   Rijsberman also said the organization has been exploring ways to help North Korea such as with a study plan for 100 percent renewable energy for the Korean Peninsula. It also made a forestry project offer to the North Korean government.  “We do forestry projects in other countries like Indonesia and Colombia ... so we’ve written to the North Korean government to make that offer and we have had the first positive response,”   he said.  Following the historic inter-Korean summit in April, North and South Korea have been in talks to restore destroyed forests in North Korea.  “We’re hoping that humanitarian action is allowed and reforestation should be allowed under that.”  Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters-Summits         For more summit stories, see Reporting By Jane Chung; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise",https://uk.reuters.com/article/commodities-summit-gggi/corrected-reuters-summit-gggi-sees-positive-outlook-for-renewable-energy-but-more-efforts-needed-idUKL3N1XB4MB,01 Nov 2018,"* More new projects in renewable than fossil fuel in past

2018-11-01,"* All-country index rises 0.3 percent * Robust earnings drive European shares to 2-week high * Sterling rallies on financial services deal hopes, BoE By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks began the new month buoyantly on Thursday after a brutal October while the pound rallied on reports that Britain and the European Union were close to a post-Brexit deal on financial services. A hint from the Bank of England of slightly faster future rate rises also helped the pound further. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. October was the index’s worst month since May 2012 - a loss of 7.5 percent - as shares globally took a battering on a number of factors ranging from trade wars to concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates. European markets followed a strong start in Asia, with robust company earnings helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index touch a two-week high. Britain’s FTSE 100 was flat, however, as the pound strengthened on a report Britain and the EU were advancing towards a deal that would give financial services firms in the UK continued access to European markets once Brexit happens. The pound extended its rally on Thursday after the Bank of England kept interest rates on hold and hinted at slightly faster future rate rises if Brexit goes smoothly. S&P 500 futures were up about 0.3 percent. Eyes were on iPhone-maker Apple, reporting its third quarter results later in the day. The MSCI index of developing-world stocks rose 0.8 percent and was on track for a one-week high, as Chinese stocks , rose on the latest in a round of official measures to support the domestic markets. “It is worth noting that such a sharp month of (equity) outflows - a rare occurrence - tends to be a buying opportunity,” the Institute of International Finance (IIF) said in a note, referring to emerging markets in the October exodus. “In the 4 months we have on record since the 2008-09 crisis that have seen least $10 billion in equity outflows. The subsequent 12 months saw an average of $65 billion in inflows.” Onshore, China’s yuan strengthened past 6.95 per dollar. A Reuters poll of analysts showed Chinese authorities will defend the yuan from weakening past 7 per dollar, although some expected the currency to breach that level. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since August 2015. The improved mood had filtered down to Asia from Wall Street, which rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favourites lifted spirits. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.5 percent on Thursday and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent following two days of big gains. In currencies, sterling’s rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. The index measuring the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.7 percent at 96.437. The index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a ADP national employment report showing U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October. The dollar has enjoyed a boost from robust data, including last week’s GDP numbers which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. The Australian dollar and the Kiwi dollar were up 1.4 percent and 1.7 percent respectively after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia’s biggest trading partner. “We’ve got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling,” said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. In another sign of improving risk sentiment, Scandinavian currencies - the Norwegian crown and Swedish crown - rallied as well. The euro rose over 0.75 percent to $1.1376 after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August. The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone. In commodities, U.S. crude futures were down 0.35 percent at $65.08 per barrel, while Brent crude lost 0.5 percent to $74.62 per barrel. The two benchmarks remained on the back foot after falling more than $10 from a four-year peak reached early in October as broader market ructions were seen hurting demand for fuel.

2018-11-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production is rising at the fastest rate on record as the increase in prices over the last year boosts drilling and completion activity and energy firms employ more horsepower to fracture larger wells. Crude and condensates output hit a record 11.35 million barrels per day in August, up from 10.93 million bpd in July, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, Oct. 31). Crude output has increased by more than 2 million barrels per day over the past 12 months, an absolute increase that is unparalleled in the history of the U.S. oil industry (tmsnrt.rs/2P1FGR7). In percentage terms, output is up by nearly 25 percent over the last year, the fastest increase since the 1950s (excluding the recovery from hurricanes).  U.S. oil production is now rising faster than at the height of the last drilling and fracking boom before prices slumped in the second half of 2014.  Most of the increase is coming from onshore shale fields, where output has risen by more than 1.9 million bpd over the last year, with a smaller contribution from the Gulf of Mexico, where output is up 200,000 bpd.  In the first nine months of the year, the number of wells drilled in the United States was up by 26 percent while well completions were up by 24 percent (“Drilling productivity report”, EIA, Oct. 15).  Increasing U.S. output has helped alleviate earlier concerns about a possible crude shortage following the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran with effect from Nov. 5.  Surging domestic output coupled with increased production from Russia, Saudi Arabia and a number of other OPEC countries has pushed oil prices lower and driven the futures markets back towards contango.  Spot prices and calendar spreads for WTI have weakened rapidly since July, much further and faster than for Brent, in response to the improved availability of crude in the midcontinent of the United States.  Six-month WTI calendar spreads are trading around 70 cents contango compared with a backwardation of more than $3 per barrel in July as traders become more confident about availability.  But the accompanying increase in domestic inventories and crude exports has ensured weakness in inland WTI has begun to bleed into the seaborne crude market and started to pull down Brent prices too.  Experience suggests there is an average delay of around 3-4 months between a change in futures prices and the number of rigs drilling for oil.  Completions take an extra six months or so, giving a total lag from futures price changes to production of roughly 9-12 months.  The surge in production reported in the first eight months of the year is therefore the lagged effect of the sharp rise in oil prices during the second half of 2017 and early 2018.  But benchmark futures prices have levelled off since April and wellhead prices have softened significantly as a result of insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity in west Texas.  The number of rigs drilling for oil was basically flat between the end of May and the end of September, which is likely to lead to a slowdown in production growth by the second and third quarters of 2019.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration forecasts average crude and condensates production will rise by just over 1 million b/d in 2019 after increasing by almost 1.4 million b/d in 2018.  Production in the lower 48 states excluding federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico, most of it from shale plays, is predicted to rise by 900,000 b/d next year down from 1.4 million b/d in 2018.  Provided they are sustained, lower prices should help bring an unsustainable production boom back under control and keep domestic and international markets closer to balance.  — John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst.

2018-11-01,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Thursday it had not yet been granted a waiver from a U.S. plan to reimpose sanctions aimed at cutting Iran out of international markets, while the top two customers for Iranian oil, China and India, were awaiting word on possible exemptions.  The United States has said it is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil. The renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran are set to come into effect on Nov. 4.  “Japan-U.S. talks have been conducted four times so far on U.S. sanctions on Iran,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, Japan’s top government spokesman, told a news conference.  “The Japanese side has asked that the impact would not affect the activities of Japanese companies. I’d like to refrain from further comments on the details of the talks.”      U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran’s crude exports to strain Tehran, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil. India also hopes to secure a waiver, as it has significantly cut Iranian oil imports ahead of the deadline, officials there said last month. “The U.S. is aware of our stand. We have told them that we cannot stop buying Iranian oil. We will continue to buy Iranian oil in this fiscal year,” an Indian government official said on Thursday. The Indian official, who is involved in discussions with U.S. authorities, said Washington may announce a waiver on Nov. 4. A Japanese oil market analyst who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said Japan’s chances of winning a waiver would increase if India were granted one.  The Japanese government and industry officials were hopeful of gaining an exemption, the analyst said.  A senior Japanese trade ministry official on Thursday declined to provide further details.  Japan joined South Korea in temporarily halting Iranian oil loadings, but three of Iran’s top five customers – India, China and Turkey - are resisting the call to end purchases outright, according to sources familiar with the matter. While China, Iran’s largest oil client, has halted lifting Iranian crude in November, Beijing is keenly awaiting word from Washington on a waiver the country is hopeful of winning.  “China has sought a full waiver, arguing that its refineries are configured to process Iranian oil, which can’t be easily and economically replaced by supplies from other producers,” said a state oil official with knowledge of the situation.   Japan imported about 172,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude last year, down 24.2 percent from 2016, trade ministry data showed. Japan has cut Iranian imports significantly from nearly 315,000 bpd in 2011, the year before the previous international sanctions on Iran were imposed.  Japan won waivers from the previous sanctions that allowed it to buy limited amounts of oil from Iran before the restrictions ended in 2016.  Chinese customs data released earlier on Thursday showed China’s Iranian oil imports in September fell by a third from a year earlier to 518,300 bpd, and compared to nearly 800,000 bpd in August.

2018-11-01,"BELGRADE (Reuters) - A protracted drought and higher than average September-October temperatures have lowered water levels across the Western Balkans, hitting hydropower output and driving up power prices. Along the Danube and Sava rivers, sandbanks unseen for decades emerged as waters gradually subsided due to scarce rainfall. Navigation along stretches of the Danube in Hungary has been halted or was significantly slower. In Serbia, this week and last, ships and barges were able to navigate at reduced draught while in Croatia, levels in the Danube fell to a 15-year-low, according to the state hydro-meteorological service.   Daily production from Serbia’s hydropower plants dropped by 20 percent to 15 million kilowatt hours (kWh), power utility Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) said in an email. The current water flow at the Djerdap hydropower plant is about to beat record lows recorded in 1986 to the worst ever since the opening of the dam in 1972, EPS said.  “The main reasons are poor water levels on all watercourses, not only in Serbia, but elsewhere throughout the region,” it said. An electricity trader told Reuters that hydropower output in Serbia fell by around 27 percent year-on-year and the trend was similar in neighboring Bosnia. Spot power prices on the Serbian and Croatian power exchanges have risen more than 30 percent since the start of 2018 and power utilities across the region, and especially in Albania which relies on hydro to produce power, are forced to import to meet demand. EPS said its total daily output, including coal-fired plants, was around 86 million kWh and that it was supplementing it with daily purchases of 0.8 million kWh from other sources. Demand from the Balkans also drove power prices higher in neighboring Hungary, another trader said. The December contract there traded at 60.40 euros a megawatt hour (MWh) on Thursday, or more than 9 euros above the Czech equivalent, bourse data showed. Despite forecasts for fresh rain, the water levels at the Danube would not rebound as fast due to its large size, the Croatian hydro-meteorogical service said. As a result, the power prices are forecast to remain at similar levels in the first and probably the second quarter of 2019, said the trader. In Belgrade where hulks of barges and boats surfaced after being submerged for decades, Ljubomir Pejcic, the director of the United Anglers of Serbia warned low water levels were also threatening wildlife. “These extreme weather situations will become worse and more frequent due to climate changes,” he said.

2018-11-01,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German consumer group vzbv filed a lawsuit against Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) on Thursday over diesel emissions tests rigging, using new class-action rules which came in on Nov. 1, potentially making it easier to win damages from companies. VW has already had to pay compensation over the emissions scandal in the United States to car owners. But in Germany, VW was able to strike a deal with regulators to fix emissions with a software update, allowing its cars to retain their road-worthiness certification. The class action lawsuit seeks to ascertain whether owners of cars with type EA 189 diesel engines had been intentionally harmed by the carmaker’s use of engine management software designed to disguise excessive pollution levels. Volkswagen said on Thursday the possibility of class action suits did not change its standpoint that there was no legal basis for consumers to make claims in connection to the diesel issue in Germany. Around 40,000 consumers have expressed interest in joining the lawsuit before a statute of limitations on claiming damages expires this year, vzbv said. Owners of VWs with diesel engines have seen the value of their cars tumble after regulators found they produced excessive levels of pollution. Regulators have even sought to ban diesel cars from inner cities, further denting residual values. In response to the so-called dieselgate scandal, lawmakers amended class action rules in Germany, making it easier for individuals to join group lawsuits without having to file a new case. Whether consumers are entitled to damages and what form these damages may take, will need to be established in a separate lawsuit.  Vzbv has said it wanted to get compensation for some 2 million owners of diesel cars that were not as environmentally friendly as VW said they were at the time of purchase. VW admitted in 2015 it had used illegal engine control devices to cheat U.S. emissions tests. Reporting by Hans Edzard Busemann. Additional reporting by Jan Schwartz. Writing by Edward Taylor.

2018-11-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell’s profits soared to a four-year high in the third quarter, boosted by rising oil and gas prices as the company accelerated its giant $25 billion share buyback program. Although the $5.6 billion quarterly profit slightly missed  forecasts for a fourth quarter, investors took heart from a nearly 60 percent rise in Shell’s cash generation to $12.1 billion, as deep cost savings in recent years filtered through.  Excluding one-off charges, cashflow was the highest in 10 years at $14.7 billion, the company said on Thursday.  “Good operational delivery across all Shell businesses produced one of our strongest-ever quarters,” Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement. Shell’s A shares were down 2.4 percent by 0830 GMT, while the broader oil and gas index was down 1 percent. The Anglo-Dutch company launched a three-year $25 billion share buyback program in July, making good on a promise to boost shareholder returns following the 2016 acquisition of BG Group, in a show of confidence in its cash generation and profit growth outlook. Shell said it completed the first tranche of buybacks in October for $2 billion and was launching a second tranche on Thursday of up to $2.5 billion by Jan. 28. “The main takeaway is the very strong cash generation,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel told Reuters. “Continued buybacks are a pretty strong catalyst for the shares.” Shell’s shares have come under pressure in recent months after three disappointing quarterly results that raised concerns over its ability to meet the share buyback target on top of a $15 billion annual dividend payout, the world’s biggest. This year’s sharp rise in oil prices to a four-year high of around $85 a barrel has boosted revenues for oil and gas companies. British rival BP on Tuesday reported its highest quarterly profits in five years, while French rival Total’s profits rose to their highest since 2012 as both firms ramped up production. Shell’s net income attributable to shareholders in the quarter, based on a current cost of supplies (CCS) and excluding identified items, rose 39 percent to $5.624 billion from a year ago. That compared with $4.691 billion in the second quarter, and a company-provided analysts’ consensus of $5.766 billion. Profits benefited from stronger oil and gas prices as well as bigger contributions from trading operations, though that was offset by weaker refining margins, tax and currency exchange effects. Chief Financial Officer Jessica Uhl said Shell will stick to its $25 to $30 billion capital expenditure plans in the coming years despite rising waging and services costs.  “We are seeing wage inflation and inflation affecting the supply chain and we are actively managing it,” Uhl told reporters in a conference call. Debt levels remained stubbornly high. Shell’s debt ratio versus company capitalization, known as gearing, declined to 23.1 percent in the quarter from 23.6 percent at the end of June. Oil and gas production in the quarter fell 2 percent from a year earlier to 3.596 million barrels of oil equivalent. Output was expected to rise in the fourth quarter due to lower maintenance, Shell said.

2018-11-01,"* All-country index rises 0.3 percent * Robust earnings drive European shares to 2-week high * Sterling rallies on financial services deal hopes By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Global stocks started the new month on firmer ground on Thursday after a brutal October, while sterling rallied on reports that Britain and the European Union are close to a post-Brexit deal on financial services. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks stocks in 47 countries, was up 0.3 percent on the day. October was the index’s worst month since May 2012 - a loss of 7.5 percent - as shares globally took a battering on a number of factors ranging from trade wars to concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates. European markets followed a strong start in Asia, with robust company earnings helping the pan-European STOXX 600 index hit a two-week high. Britain’s FTSE 100 however fell 0.1 percent as the pound strengthened on a report Britain and the EU are close to a deal that would give financial services firms in the UK continued access to European markets once Brexit happens. “This is a significant development for the pound as it alleviates some market concerns on how London would finance its big current deficit,” said Ulrich Leuchtmann, a currency strategist at Commerzbank. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since August 2015. The improved mood had filtered down to Asia from Wall Street, which rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favourites lifted spirits. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.5 percent on Thursday and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 1 percent following two days of big gains. “What we are seeing is the equity markets trying to rebound after bottoming out. Corporate earnings in the U.S. and Japanese markets have been relatively strong on the whole, which means there are plenty of bargain hunting opportunities,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. In currencies, sterling’s rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. The index measuring the greenback’s strength against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.6 percent at 96.539. The index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a ADP national employment report showing U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October. The dollar has enjoyed a boost from robust data, including last week’s GDP numbers which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. The Australian dollar and the Kiwi dollar were up 1.2 percent and 1.4 percent respectively after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia’s biggest trading partner. “We’ve got a reasonably risk-friendly market, and with the new month we have some dollar selling,” said Kit Juckes, a strategist at Societe Generale. In another sign risk sentiment was improving, Scandinavian currencies - the Norwegian crown and Swedish crown - rallied as well. The euro rose over half a percent to $1.1376 after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August. The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone. In commodities, U.S. crude futures were down 0.86 percent at $64.75 per barrel and Brent crude lost 1.13 percent to $74.19 per barrel. The two benchmarks remained on the back foot after falling more than $10 from a four-year peak reached early in October as broader market ructions were seen hurting demand for fuel.

2018-11-01,"TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Japan has not yet been granted a waiver from Washington’s plan to reimpose sanctions to cut Iran out of international markets, even after several rounds of talks with U.S. officials, the Asian nation’s top government spokesman said on Thursday. The Trump administration has said it is considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are reducing their imports of Iranian oil on a case-by-case basis. The renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran are set to come into effect on Nov. 5. “Japan-U.S. talks have been conducted four times so far on U.S. sanctions on Iran,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. “The Japanese side has asked that the impact would not affect the activities of Japanese companies. I’d like to refrain from further comments on the details of the talks.” U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran’s crude exports to strain Tehran, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil. India also hopes to secure a waiver, as it has significantly cut Iranian oil imports ahead of the deadline, officials there said last month. A Japanese oil market analyst who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter said the chances for Japan winning a waiver would increase if India was granted one. The Japanese government and industry officials were hopeful of winning an exemption, said the analyst. A senior Japanese trade ministry official on Thursday declined to provide any further details. Japan joined South Korea in temporarily halting Iranian oil loadings, but three of Iran’s top five customers – India, China, and Turkey - are resisting the call to end purchases outright, according to sources familiar with the matter. Japan imported about 172,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Iranian crude last year, down 24.2 percent from 2016, and accounting for 5.3 percent of total, trade ministry data showed. Japan has cut Iranian imports significantly from nearly 315,000 bpd in 2011, the year before the previous international sanctions on Iran were imposed. Japan won waivers from the previous sanctions that allowed it to buy limited amounts of oil from Iran before the restrictions ended in 2016.

2018-11-01,"(Adds further CEO comment) COPENHAGEN, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Danish energy group Orsted posted third-quarter profit well above analyst expectations on Thursday and lifted its outlook for the year, in part thanks to the contribution from new offshore wind projects. Orsted now expects EBITDA for the year excluding new partnership deals at 13 billion to 14 billion Danish crowns, up from 12.5 billion to 13.5 billion previously guided. “The increase is primarily due to good progress on our offshore construction projects,” Chief Executive Henrik Poulsen said in a statement, noting a faster ramp-up of power generation at the Borkum Riffgrund 2 project in Germany. Higher natural gas prices also helped to lift earnings in the third quarter. Orsted is rebranding itself as a renewable energy firm after it sold its oil and gas unit to Ineos last year, courting investors interested in green investments which have seen a boost amid policies to protect the climate. The firm, formerly known as DONG Energy, reported earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of 2.23 billion Danish crowns ($340 million), compared with 1.85 billion crowns forecast in a Reuters analyst survey. Including profits from the Hornsea 1 partnership in the UK, Orsted said it still expects EBITDA for the year to be “significantly higher” than the 22.5 billion achieved in 2017. Analysts on average expect EBITDA of 27.3 billion for 2018. The company’ power generation increased 12 percent between July and September compared to a year earlier. The company also said it submitted a bid in a clean energy auction in Connecticut in September and expects to receive the outcome of the auction before the end of the year. The bid comes after it said in August it would acquire U.S. wind farm developer Lincoln Clean Energy. “During the third quarter we have secured a very strong and long-term growth platform in the American market,” Poulsen said in a statement.

2018-11-01,"SINGAPORE, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Emirates National Oil Company (ENOC) has scheduled month-long maintenance for November at its 140,000 barrels per day (bpd) condensate splitter in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), industry sources said on Thursday. The planned maintenance will include the integration of a new crude distillation unit (CDU) pipeline that is expected to come onstream late next year, the sources said. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak with media. ENOC did not immediately reply to an email from Reuters on the matter. The maintenance comes as companies including ENOC and South Korea’s Hanwha Total are grappling with feedstock condensate supply tightness due to sanctions against Iran which will take effect this month. ENOC had chartered at least one vessel to store jet fuel to ensure supply to airlines in Dubai, sources told Reuters last month. It also has onshore tanks to store refined oil products, including gasoline and feedstock. Separately, ENOC last month announced that it would be constructing a jet fuel pipeline that can carry 2,000 cubic metres of the aviation fuel per hour to Al Maktoum International Airport.

2018-11-01,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.AS) profits soared to a four-year high in the third quarter, boosted by rising oil and gas prices as the company accelerated its giant $25 billion (19 billion pounds) share buyback programme. Although the $5.6 billion quarterly profit slightly missed  forecasts for a fourth quarter, investors took heart from a nearly 60 percent rise in Shell’s cash generation to $12.1 billion, as deep cost savings in recent years filtered through.  Excluding one-off charges, cashflow was the highest in 10 years at $14.7 billion, the company said on Thursday.  “Good operational delivery across all Shell businesses produced one of our strongest-ever quarters,” Chief Executive Ben van Beurden said in a statement. Shell’s A shares were down 2.4 percent by 0830 GMT, while the broader oil and gas index .SXEP was down 1 percent.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to follow Asia’s lead and open mostly higher, with Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC each rising 0.1 percent, although Britain’s FTSE was forecast to shed 0.4 percent following the pound’s appreciation. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day, though this came after a brutal October month. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, its worst monthly performance since August 2015, as factors ranging from Sino-U.S. trade tensions to worries about global economic growth, higher U.S. interest rates and company earnings spurred volatility in global markets. There were tentative signs of the gloom slowly beginning to lift, led by a rebound in beaten-down U.S. shares. Wall Street rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favourites lifted spirits. The improved mood filtered down to Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.5 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 0.2 percent.

Corporate earnings in the U.S. and Japanese markets have been relatively strong on the whole, which means there are plenty of bargain hunting opportunities,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “The ongoing rebound has further room to go. The U.S.-China trade conflict will continue popping up as a market factor going forward, but the worst fears appear to have subsided for now, at least through the U.S. midterm elections.” The pound surged 0.65 percent to $1.2848 after the Times reported that British Prime Minister Theresa May had sealed a deal with Brussels that would give British financial services companies continued access to European markets after Brexit. The bounce lifted the pound - dented recently on worries over whether Britain could secure an orderly exit from the European Union - further away from a 2-1/2-month low struck on Tuesday. Sterling’s rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. An index which measures the U.S. currency’s strength against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.27 percent at 96.867.

The greenback has recently enjoyed a boost from robust economic reports, including data last week which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. “For now we think that the strength of the U.S. economy and still stimulatory financial conditions will see the Fed continue its tightening path despite growing external vulnerabilities,” wrote economists at ANZ. “In this context, it’s possible that higher U.S. yields in combination with slowing emerging market growth may continue to weigh on emerging markets. The Fed is not about to come to the rescue of financial markets, not yet, anyway.” The euro rose 0.3 percent to $1.1343, given a reprieve after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August. The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone region. The Australian dollar advanced 0.75 percent to $0.7125 after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia’s biggest trading partner. China’s yuan strengthened a touch to 6.9668 per dollar in onshore trade after a firmer daily fix by the central bank, but it was still not far off a decade low at 6.9780 hit the previous day on trade tensions and slowing Chinese growth. The People’s Bank of China on Wednesday said it will issue bills in Hong Kong for the first time, which would allow it to absorb excess yuan liquidity in the onshore market and guide market expectations.

2018-11-01," (The story corrects name of OTC platform in paragraph 8 from Cleartrade to Cleartech.) By Henning Gloystein and Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE (Reuters) - German exchange group Deutsche Boerse is revamping its Asian business with the launch of its European Energy Exchange (EEX) in Singapore, looking to boost its business in the world’s fastest growing commodity markets. Deutsche Boerse, which has global ambitions for EEX, said it would rebrand its Singapore-based subsidiary Cleartrade Exchange (CLTX) as EEX Asia, offering futures contracts on freight and seaborne commodities such as fuel oil and iron ore. German-based EEX is Europe’s biggest bourse for trading power and also a leading exchange for natural gas, coal and carbon trading. “We have the ambition to become a global commodities exchange,” said Egbert Laege, EEX Group board member and its head of global commodities. In 2016, EEX Group bought CLTX, which deals in commodities like iron ore and fuel oil, to get a foothold in Asia, which is by far the world’s biggest and fastest growing commodity and energy market. Last year, EEX bought U.S. power and natural gas bourse Nodal Exchange. “The acquisition of CLTX was the first step. Then last year, Nodal was the next step,” Laege told the Reuters Global Commodities Summit series of interviews that takes place this week. EEX Group will also operate Cleartech out of Singapore as a platform handling support for commodities traded outside exchanges, known as over-the-counter (OTC) markets. EEX Asia will initially focus on expanding its freight offerings. “It’s the freight market we find most interesting, especially in Asia. It’s a key facilitator for global trade ... and there’s a huge overlap of Asian and European freight clients,” he said, speaking to Reuters while attending the Singapore International Energy Week (SIEW). “The next step will be iron ore.” Growing its dry-bulk business will put EEX Asia in competition with the dominant bourse in this field, the Baltic Exchange, which was bought by Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 2016. “In some of our offerings, we will be competing with SGX’s offerings, for sure,” said Laege. In Europe, EEX started off as an electricity exchange, before branching out into the main fossil fuels that fire power stations: thermal coal and natural gas. While it has established some links in Asia, including early product design projects with the Japan Electric Power Exchange (JEPX), Laege said electricity was not a priority for EEX Asia at this stage. “As an exchange, you cannot front-run a market. There needs to be a threshold market size and liquidity first, and in Asia’s (power and gas markets) we’re not quite there yet.” This was also the case for the booming liquefied natural gas (LNG) market. “While it is true that LNG demand is growing, you have a lack of standardized delivery contracts,” Laege said, with higher standardization a prerequisite for an LNG exchange product. Despite some attempts to chance the status quo, “it will have to be seen whether you’ll ever have such standardization (in Asian LNG) as you have in U.S. and European natural gas markets,” he added.

2018-11-01,"* Drops extends hefty October losses for Brent, WTI * Signs of rising supplies on eve of Iran sanctions * Goldman Sachs sticks to $80/bbl Brent year-end forecast (Updates prices, adds Goldman note) BEIJING, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Thursday, extending losses in previous sessions, amid signs of rising supply and growing concerns that demand might weaken on the prospect of a global economic slowdown. The Brent crude January futures contract lost 46 cents, or 0.61 percent, to trade at $74.58 per barrel by GMT0451. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell 41 cents to $64.90 a barrel. Both benchmarks posted their worst monthly performance since July 2016 on Wednesday, with Brent falling 8.8 percent for October and WTI dropping 10.9 percent. Thursday’s drops came after U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed crude oil inventories climbed for a sixth straight week. “The strong built in oil inventories is likely to keep downward pressure on oil prices,” ANZ Research analysts said in a note. Still, Goldman Sachs on Thursday reiterated a year-end forecast for Brent prices of $80 barrel. The bank said 2018 oil demand growth, though down slightly, remains above consensus expectations, and said Chinese demand continues to show resilience despite concerns over the world’s second-biggest economy. Meanwhile a Reuters survey found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) boosted oil production in October to its highest since 2016, as higher output led by the United Arab Emirates and Libya more than offset a cut in Iranian shipments due to U.S. sanctions, set to start on Nov. 4. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday in a presidential memorandum that he had determined there was sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products from nations other than Iran to permit a reduction in purchases from that country. China delivered disappointing PMI data, with its manufacturing sector in October expanding at its weakest pace in over two years.

2018-11-01,"(This is a repeat of an item issued on Wednesday) By Alexandra Ulmer and Nidhi Verma WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA has shipped a crude cargo valued at $35 million as partial payment to Indian oil company ONGC Videsh Ltd for overdue dividends from a joint venture, according to two people familiar with the matter. The payment is based on an agreement signed in 2016 by PDVSA and ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp, to repatriate about $530 million in dividends due from their San Cristobal oil project in Venezuela. But Caracas-based PDVSA had not transferred any money to ONGC Videsh in over a year, the sources said, due to Venezuela’s economic meltdown and sanctions that complicate payments through U.S. banks that had made it difficult to pay in cash. That changed when some 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude left Venezuela’s main oil port of Jose earlier in October, according to one of the sources. “ONGC Videsh confirms that in October 2018 PDVSA has allocated Merey 16 crude oil parcel of 500,000 barrels to ONGC Videsh towards payment of outstanding dividend,” ONGC Videsh said in an email reply to Reuters. It was not immediately clear which tanker was carrying the crude. Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) Iwatesan and Kassab set sail from Jose several weeks ago with India’s Sikka port as their destination, according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. PDVSA, which faces U.S. and international court actions over pending debts, recently has begun paying some creditors, mostly in oil, to avoid further asset seizures. The company is also seeking to stimulate investment in Venezuela’s unraveling oil industry, where annual production is at its lowest in almost seven decades, by trying to meet some of its obligations to foreign partners. The payment to ONGC was arranged through India’s Reliance Industries, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex. Reliance will receive the Venezuelan crude and will ultimately pay the $35 million to ONGC, according to one of the sources. Venezuela depends on oil for almost all its export revenue. The combination of falling crude production and exports from a lack of investment, U.S. sanctions and hyperinflation have pushed the OPEC-member country’s economy to near-collapse. ONGC had previously received $89 million from PDVSA as part of the 2016 payment agreement, reducing the outstanding debt to about $440 million, but no other transfers had been received in more than a year. These payments were made by Russia’s state-run Gazprombank in January 2017 and by Reliance in April 2017. ONGC Videsh Managing Director N. K. Verma said in May that PDVSA had halted all payments to the firm for more than six months. “Since the (payment) process has again started, we hope to receive more such parcels in India to clear outstanding dues,” one of the sources said. Reliance and PDVSA did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. The Venezuelan state-run firm this week started transferring payments to holders of its 2020 bonds, which are backed by collateral in its Citgo Petroleum refining arm, after shifting its export logistics during the third quarter to raise more cash. Since late August, PDVSA also made partial payments in cash and crude to U.S. producer ConocoPhillips to honor a $2-billion arbitration award.

2018-11-01,"* MSCI Asia-Pacific index up 0.9 pct * GBP up on report May sealed Brexit deal on financial services * Dollar index nudged away from 16-mth high as pound rallies * Crude continues to sag after last month’s big slide * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday as bruised investor sentiment got some relief from another robust Wall Street session, while the pound rallied on a report Britain has secured a deal that would give its financial services firms continued access to European markets after Brexit. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.9 percent, adding to modest gains the previous day, though this came after a brutal October month. The index had fallen 10.2 percent in October, it worst monthly performance since August 2015, as factors ranging from Sino-U.S. trade tensions to worries about global economic growth, higher U.S. interest rates and company earnings spurred volatility in global markets. There were tentative signs of the gloom slowly beginning to lift, led by a rebound in beaten-down U.S. shares. Wall Street rose for a second day on Wednesday as strong company results and bargain hunting of beaten-down technology and internet favourites lifted spirits. The improved mood filtered down to Asia. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1.5 percent and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.2 percent. Australian stocks also advanced 0.5 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI put on 1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 0.5 percent following two days of big gains. “What we are seeing is the equity markets trying to rebound after bottoming out. Corporate earnings in the U.S. and Japanese markets have been relatively strong on the whole, which means there are plenty of bargain hunting opportunities,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “The ongoing rebound has further room to go. The U.S.-China trade conflict will continue popping up as a market factor going forward, but the worst fears appear to have subsided for now, at least through the U.S. midterm elections.” The pound surged 0.65 percent to $1.2850 after the Times reported that British Prime Minister Theresa May had sealed a deal with Brussels that would give British financial services companies continued access to European markets after Brexit. The bounce lifted the pound - dented recently on worries over whether Britain could secure an orderly exit from the European Union - further away from a 2-1/2-month low struck on Tuesday. Sterling’s rally nudged the dollar off its recent peak. An index which measures the U.S. currency’s strength against a basket of six major currencies was down 0.25 percent at 96.899. The dollar index had spiked to a 16-month high of 97.20 overnight on a ADP national employment report which showed that U.S. private sector payrolls increased by the most in eight months in October. The greenback has recently enjoyed a boost from robust economic reports, including data last week which showed the U.S. economy slowed less than expected in the third quarter. The euro rose 0.25 percent to $1.1336, given a reprieve after retreating to $1.1302 on Wednesday, its lowest since mid-August. The single currency has been weighed by less-than-stellar economic news from the euro zone region. The Australian dollar advanced 0.55 percent to $0.7112 after strong domestic trade data helped offset some of the concerns about slowing growth in China - Australia’s biggest trading partner. China’s yuan strengthened a touch to 6.9680 per dollar in onshore trade, but still not far off a decade low at 6.9780 hit the previous day on trade tensions and slowing Chinese growth. The People’s Bank of China on Wednesday said it will issue bills in Hong Kong for the first time, which would allow it to absorb excess yuan liquidity in the onshore and guide market expectations. In commodities, U.S. crude futures were down 0.3 percent at $65.11 per barrel and Brent crude lost 0.37 percent to $74.76 per barrel. The two benchmarks remained on the back foot after falling more than $10 from a four-year peak reached early in October as the global market tumult last month was seen hurting demand for fuel.
