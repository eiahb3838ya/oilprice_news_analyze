2019-01-28,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has agreed to buy a Texas oil refinery with a troubled past and space to handle a coming flow of shale from its West Texas operations, two sources familiar with negotiations said on Monday. The U.S. oil major is expected to disclose the deal to acquire a 112,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Pasadena, Texas, this quarter, the sources said. The plant is operated by Pasadena Refining System Inc, a Texas-based unit of Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA.  Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall declined to comment on Monday. Carlos Monteiro, a spokesman for Petrobras in Rio de Janeiro, said any communications on an agreement would be disclosed to the market.     A deeply indebted Petrobras put the plant on the market in early 2018 after sinking more than $1.18 billion into it since it acquired its first stake in the operation in 2006. Chevron and Petrobras’ negotiations were delayed in part by Brazil’s presidential election and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc dropping out of talks to operate a terminal at the site as a joint venture, the sources said.  Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long declined to comment. Petrobras has been looking to divest $21 billion in assets to reduce its debt load amid a series of corruption scandals including allegations bribes were paid to executives as a result of the 2006 purchase of the Pasadena plant.     The rapid expansion of U.S. shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico has stirred demand for new U.S. refining capacity and crude-export facilities. Oil output has soared to an estimated 3.8 million bpd this month, from 1.48 million five years ago.     Chevron, which reported a 150,000 bpd increase in shale production in the third quarter, has said it wants a second Gulf Coast facility to handle that crude and better supply its retail gasoline network. The plant produces mostly gasoline and distillates such as diesel.      The refinery covers 192 acres on the Houston Ship Channel and the purchase includes another 274 acres of terminal and other cleared land available for expansion. The site has storage tanks that can hold 5.1 million barrels and a marine terminal for exports.  The plant’s 300-strong work force is represented by the United Steelworkers union, and would become Chevron employees once the deal is completed.  There are several small U.S. refineries on the market. Husky Energy Inc earlier this month began marketing a 12,000-bpd refinery in Prince George, British Columbia.     Royal Dutch Shell recently began accepting bids for its 75,000-bpd Sarnia, Ontario, refinery, according to people familiar with the matter. Delta Air Lines Inc last September began marketing a stake in its 185,000-bpd Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery.     In November, CVR Energy Inc said it may buy out the public holders of its refining unit, CVR Refining GP, which operates refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma. That decision would unwind a partnership making a future sale easier.

Sempra will sell its fully-owned Chilean subsidiary Chilquinta Energia, the country’s third biggest electric utility, and an 83.6 percent stake in Luz del Sur, Peru’s biggest electric company. Its ownership in two other energy services companies based in Chile and Peru would also be sold, Sempra said, without providing any financial details of the sales. “We have set a clear strategic goal of becoming North America’s premier energy infrastructure company,” Sempra Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Martin said in a statement. “This planned sale allows us more focused capital investment in the U.S. and Mexico to support additional growth opportunities,” he added. Sempra had come under pressure last year from activist investors Elliott Management and Bluescape Resources, which had pushed for sweeping changes at the company, including the sale of international business lines and the addition of new directors to the board. In September the utility reached an agreement with the investors and promised to add two board members and review its liquefied natural gas business. Funds affiliated with Elliott and Bluescape owned a combined 4.9 percent stake in Sempra valued at $1.6 billion, the company said at the time. Neither Elliott nor Bluescape immediately responded to requests for comment on Monday. San Diego-headquartered Sempra said it expects the sales to be completed by the end of the year.

2019-01-28,"(Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed president Juan Guaido ordered congress on Monday to appoint new boards of directors to state oil company PDVSA and U.S. subsidiary Citgo, shortly before the United States imposed sanctions on the firm. The moves were aimed at intensifying pressure on President Nicolas Maduro, who was re-elected last year in a contest widely seen as fraudulent. Guaido proclaimed himself president last week, but without a source of revenue or control of the military, he faces difficult odds in assuming the post, despite support across most of the Western Hemisphere. Guaido, who has not yet appointed a Cabinet, faces the intricate legal challenge of nominating new leadership for PDVSA and its subsidiaries, including Citgo Petroleum, who would manage the companies during a transition. The White House’s measures to freeze PDVSA’s U.S. assets, including proceeds from oil exports, and limit the company’s transactions are an attempt to largely cut off Maduro’s access to oil revenue that accounts for most of the country’s income in hard currency.  U.S. refineries in the United States can receive Venezuelan oil already paid for and currently at sea, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.     “If the people in Venezuela want to continue to sell us oil, as long as the money goes into blocked accounts we will continue to take it. Otherwise, will we not be buying it,” Mnuchin told reporters in Washington on Monday. U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said the sanctions would block $7 billion in PDVSA’s assets “plus over $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year.” It is unclear if Venezuela will continue selling oil to customers in the United States. Venezuela exports about 500,000 barrels of oil daily to the United States, mostly to Citgo and refineries owned by Valero Energy Corp and Chevron Corp. The country’s production has dropped in recent years to about 1.4 million barrels a day because of economic mismanagement and lack of investment.  Maduro remains in control of the country because of support from the military, despite massive protests against his government amid an economic crisis that has caused millions to flee the country. Many people are going hungry, while inflation has skyrocketed and left basic goods unaffordable. The sanctions do not prohibit deals between PDVSA and major U.S. oil-companies operating in Venezuela, including Chevron, Halliburton Co and Schlumberger NV. It does, however, prevent U.S. firms from exporting certain oil products Venezuela needs to blend with its own crude for sale elsewhere. Attempting to redirect funds to Guaido’s team could give him maneuverability in the short term as appointing new boards at PDVSA and Citgo could take a long time, according to experts. Frank Holder, the head of Berkeley Research Group’s Latin American practice, said Guaido could face difficulties in appointing a Citgo board against the wishes of its parent. But Guaido’s team may try a number of things, even if they are unlikely to work, because “politically it shows he is trying to do something, that he has power,” Holder said. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela and PDVSA in 2017 that prevented Citgo from repatriating dividends to its parent company. Citgo had about $500 million in cash at the end of September, according to a creditor who spoke to Reuters last week, and $900 million in available credit. Citgo also faces a July deadline to refinance its revolving credit, a task that could be delayed because of sanctions affecting the subsidiary’s ability to access to credit.

Mexican state-run oil company Pemex in October purchased four shipments of 350,000 barrels of light crude oil from the United States for delivery in November to be used at its refineries. Mexico imported about 300,000 barrels of crude in December, according to President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1 and has repeatedly said he wants to reduce fuel imports from abroad. The imports last year marked a stark shift for historically major crude exporter Mexico, where decades of oil self-sufficiency are a badge of pride.

2019-01-28,"(Adds quotes, details and context) By Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Monday imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, the toughest U.S. financial challenge yet to the country’s embattled socialist president, Nicolas Maduro. The sanctions ratchet up pressure against Maduro to step aside and turn over power to Juan Guaido, the Venezuelan opposition leader who proclaimed himself interim president last week and was immediately recognized by the United States and a host of other countries. “We have continued to expose the corruption of Maduro and his cronies and today’s action ensures they can no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people,” U.S. national security adviser John Bolton told reporters at a White House briefing. President Donald Trump’s order freezes U.S.-based assets of PDVSA, Venezuela’s largest source of revenue and the owner of U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum, the OPEC member’s most important foreign asset. The Trump administration had long held off on targeting Venezuela’s vital oil sector for fear that it would hurt U.S. refiners and raise oil prices for Americans. White House officials had also expressed concern about inflicting further hardship on the Venezuelan people. The latest sanctions appear to seek to build on the momentum that has mounted in recent weeks against Maduro at home and abroad. U.S. officials said the sanctions on PDVSA were intended to prevent Maduro’s government from siphoning off funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power. Bolton said Monday’s announcement would block Maduro from accessing PDVSA assets worth $7 billion and cost him $11 billion in lost export proceeds over the next year. The United States stopped short, however, of imposing a ban on imports of Venezuelan oil, a move that U.S. oil refiners had opposed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Citgo in the United States would be able to continue to operate, provided funds go to a blocked account. He said oil supplies were sufficient to ensure no significant impact on U.S. gas prices in the short term and that the U.S. Treasury Department would issue temporary licenses to permit some transactions with PDVSA. Even though the Venezuelan military has shown no sign of abandoning Maduro, Bolton said: “Our assessment based on numerous contacts on the ground is that the rank and file of the Venezuelan military is acutely aware of the desperate economic conditions in the country and we think they look for ways to support the National Assembly government.” Countries around the world have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful leader, and the United States vowed to starve Maduro’s administration of oil revenue after he was sworn in on Jan. 10 for a second term that was widely dubbed illegitimate. Maduro says the United States is promoting a coup against him and promised to stay in office, backed by Russia and China, which have bank rolled his government and fought off efforts to have his government disavowed by the United Nations. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.S. move. Bolton warned Maduro that he would be held responsible for the safety of U.S. diplomatic personnel in Venezuela as well as Guaido and other opposition figures. He also did not appear to rule out U.S. military intervention, though such action is widely considered to be unlikely. “The president has made it very clear on this matter that all options are on the table,” Bolton said.

The largest U.S. oil producer, which has been considering a third processing unit at the plant since at least 2014, has authorized financing for equipment needed to convert shale crude from its West Texas oilfields into precursors for gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products. The authorization is the final step to begin building a third crude distillation unit (CDU) that would process between 250,000 and 350,000 bpd of light crude at the refinery located 87 miles (140 km) east of Houston. With a 250,000 bpd CDU, the plant’s total capacity would reach 615,644 bpd, placing it ahead of the nation’s largest, Motiva Enterprises’ 603,000 bpd refinery, in nearby Port Arthur, Texas. “It has been approved,” said one of the people familiar with the refinery expansion. Employees have been asked to keep the approval confidential, said the person, who could not be identified because of the restrictions. The company has not publicly disclosed the cost of the expansion, which is part of a $20 billion investment program outlined in 2017 to increase its U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing over 10 years. Exxon spokeswoman Sarah Nordin said on Monday she had no updates on the status of the project. In October, she had confirmed that site preparation work had begun in advance of a final decision. Last October, Exxon has said construction on the project was expected to begin this year after a final investment decision, and estimated the work would be completed in 2022. Exxon aims to triple its daily crude production in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to 600,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boepd) by 2025.

2019-01-28,"DOUALA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Cameroonian authorities arrested opposition leader Maurice Kamto on Monday, his lawyer said, after weekend protests that security forces dispersed with live bullets, wounding six people. Kamto has been mobilising dissent against President Paul Biya since losing what he says was a fraudulent election in October. Kamto declared himself winner at the time of the poll and has since challenged Biya’s win in the African Union court. Protests are rare in Cameroon, outside its troubled Anglophone western region, and tend to be swiftly put down by force and mass arrests. “I can confirm that professor Maurice Kamto was arrested (today),” his lawyer, Agbor Bala, told Reuters by telephone, adding that it was because of the weekend protests in which dozens took part. The treasurer of his Cameroon Renaissance Movement party, Alain Fogue, was also detained, Bala said. At 85, Biya is the oldest leader in sub-Saharan Africa and most Cameroonians have known only him as president. He holds Cabinet meetings only every few years and spends a lot of his time on private trips to Switzerland. But the opposition has been unable to mount a credible challenge to him. The election cemented his place as one of Africa’s longest- serving leaders, but allegations of ballot stuffing and intimidation loomed over his victory, and turnout was low because of a secessionist uprising in the Anglophone regions in which hundreds have died. Biya’s camp has denied all allegations of electoral fraud.

2019-01-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock markets tumbled on Monday after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp warned of weak Chinese demand while oil posted its biggest one-day drop in a month on expectations of growing U.S. crude supply. Equities also were slammed by plunging shares of Brazilian miner Vale SA, which lost some $19.3 billion of its market value following the collapse of a tailing dam last week that killed at least 60 people.  Vale shares dropped 24.5 percent in Sao Paulo trade.  The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday and the results of U.S.-China trade talks this week. The euro reached a 10-day high against the dollar ahead of  voting in Britain’s parliament on Tuesday that aims to break the Brexit deadlock. Caterpillar, a bellwether for global industrials, fell 9.1 percent as its quarterly profit missed Wall Street estimates, hurt by softening Chinese demand, a strong dollar and higher manufacturing and freight costs. It was Caterpillar’s worst single-day drop since August 2011. Nvidia slid 13.8 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars, hit by weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data centre sales. Apple’s downward guidance two weeks ago, along with the announcements by Caterpillar and Nvidia, suggest the U.S.-China trade war will affect more companies, said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. “I view this as a cause for concern. It’s not a crisis, but it’s likely to be a few more canaries in the coal mine because there is going to be a significant cohort of stocks that are likely to be impacted by the U.S.-China trade war,” Hooper said. Earnings at Chinese industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 0.96 percent while MSCI’s all-country world equity index declined 0.62 percent.  Stocks on Wall Street, down more than 1 percent for most of the session, recouped some losses at the close. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 208.98 points, or 0.84 percent, to 24,528.22. The S&P 500 lost 20.91 points, or 0.78 percent, to 2,643.85 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 79.18 points, or 1.11 percent, to 7,085.69. Emerging market stocks lost 0.39 percent. Volatility has picked up as investors fret about an economic cycle that is long in the tooth, leading to sharp reactions in the market to news, said Laura Kane, head of investment themes for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management. Equity markets have solid underpinnings with fourth-quarter earnings looking good, a likely truce in the U.S.-China trade talks and the Fed sounding a dovish message, leading her to be optimistic, Kane said. “But the complication of volatility being uncomfortable and the fact we’re later in the (business) cycle, that’s why we’re seeing these larger reactions to market news than we’re used to,” she said. U.S. energy companies last week boosted the number of rigs drilling for oil for the first time since late December.      U.S. crude production, which rose to a record 11.9 million barrels per day late last year, has undermined sentiment in the oil market, traders said. Also weighing on oil prices are concerns about whether Chinese refiners will continue to import crude at 2018’s breakneck pace. U.S. crude settled down 3.17 percent at $51.99 per barrel and Brent fell 2.77 percent to settle at $59.93. In FX markets, the ICE index that tracks the dollar versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was down 0.05 percent at 95.745. It hit a near two-week low at 95.673 earlier in the session. The euro rose 0.11 percent to $1.1425 while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.16 percent versus the greenback at 109.36 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 1/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7458 percent. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,303.10 per ounce.

2019-01-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil fell about 3 percent on Monday, its biggest one-day percentage drop in a month, after an increase in U.S. crude drilling pointed to further supply growth amid continuing concerns about a global economic slowdown.  Brent crude oil futures sank $1.71, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $59.93 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude slumped $1.70, or 3.2 percent, to settle at $51.99 a barrel. The last time both crude benchmarks saw bigger daily percentage drops was on Dec. 27. “We’re seeing oil prices really start to break down here,” said Phillip Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago. “One of the factors that played (into prices) is the rising rig count that we saw on Friday.” U.S. drillers added 10 oil rigs last week, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes on Friday, in another sign of the expanding record U.S. crude production that has soured market sentiment.  GRAPHIC: U.S. oil production & drilling levels - tmsnrt.rs/2Tm4u4I The trade war between Washington and Beijing weighed on futures as investor optimism waned that the two sides would soon end the months-long tariff fight that has damaged China’s economy. That, coupled with uncertainty about how long the U.S. government will stay open after Washington agreed to end a historic shutdown, dampened investor optimism, said Gene McGillian, director of market research at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “I think both those factors seem to have sparked fears about slowing demand growth, which have been one of the main bearish drivers in the market for a while,” McGillian said. Crude futures remain on course for their strongest monthly gains in more than two years following production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies this month. Brent has risen nearly 12 percent so far in January, which would be the largest monthly percentage increase since December 2016. WTI has risen more than 13 percent this month, the biggest jump since April 2016, when it surged almost 20 percent. Investors have added to bets on a sustained rise in the oil price this month for the first time since September, according to data from the InterContinental Exchange.  Much of the demand outlook hinges on China and whether its refiners will continue to import crude at 2018’s breakneck pace.  Industrial companies in China reported a second monthly fall in earnings in December, despite the government’s efforts to support borrowing and investment.

2019-01-28,"(Updates with background on Citgo, Venezuela) By Corina Pons and Marianna Parraga CARACAS/MEXICO CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido’s team of advisers is rushing to take control of the country’s main foreign asset, U.S. refiner Citgo Petroleum, before a potential bond default that could leave half the company in creditors’ hands, sources close to the talks told Reuters on Monday. Guaido, who proclaimed himself president last week and has not yet appointed a cabinet, faces the intricate legal challenge of nominating new leadership for PDVSA, the state-owned oil and natural gas company, and its subsidiaries, including Citgo, who would manage the companies during a transition. Other ideas are also in discussion to gain control of the firms. Guaido, who runs the opposition-controlled congress, assumed Venezuela’s presidency after President Nicolas Maduro was re-elected last year in a voting widely considered a sham. The United States and numerous nations in the hemisphere recognized Guaido as the president but Maduro still controls the military and PDVSA. Holders of Venezuela’s most watched PDVSA bonds, which mature in 2020, are due a $72 million interest payment in late April. Those bonds are collateralized with 50.1 percent of Citgo Holdings’ equity, meaning in the absence of a payment, creditors could seize control of the company. Without sources of revenue and control of foreign assets, Guaido’s team faces long odds in succeeding, despite massive protests against Maduro’s regime due to an economic crisis that has caused millions to flee the country. Many people are starving while inflation has skyrocketed and left basic goods unaffordable. The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuela in 2017 that have prevented Citgo from repatriating dividends to its parent company. It had about $500 million in cash at the end of September, according to a creditor who spoke to Reuters last week, and $900 million in available credit. Citgo separately faces a July deadline to refinance its revolving credit, a task that is facing delays due to sanctions affecting the subsidiary’s ability to access to credit.

2019-01-28,"(Adds gold, oil settlement prices) * Warnings from Caterpillar, Nvidia highlight China worries * Crude oil drops on expectations of growing U.S. supply * U.S.-China trade talks, FOMC meeting in focus By Herbert Lash NEW YORK, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Global stock markets tumbled on Monday after Caterpillar and Nvidia Corp warned of weak Chinese demand while oil headed for its biggest one-day drop in a month on expectations of growing U.S. crude supply. Equities also were slammed by a plunge in shares of Brazilian miner Vale SA wiped out about $16 billion in market value following the collapse of a tailing dam last week that killed at least 60 people. Vale shares dropped 22.6 percent in Sao Paulo trade. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies as traders awaited the Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting ending Wednesday and U.S.-China trade talks this week. The euro reached a 10-day high against the dollar ahead of voting in Britain’s parliament on Tuesday that aims to break the Brexit deadlock. Caterpillar, a bellwether for global industrials, fell 9.2 percent as its quarterly profit widely missed Wall Street estimates on softening Chinese demand, a strong dollar and higher manufacturing and freight costs. Nvidia slid 15.4 percent after the chipmaker cut its fourth-quarter revenue estimate by half a billion dollars, hit by weak demand for its gaming chips in China and lower-than-expected data center sales. When companies cite China as problematic regarding their earnings, investors realize China-related issues are going to spread, said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. “Without China growing at a good clip it will be hard for the global economy and the U.S. to continue an expansion,” Nauman said. Earnings at Chinese industrial firms shrank for a second straight month in December, hit by slowing prices and weak factory activity amid the protracted U.S.-Sino trade war. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading regional shares closed down 0.96 percent while MSCI’s all-country world equity index declined 0.77 percent. Stocks on Wall Street fell more than 1 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 291.41 points, or 1.18 percent, to 24,445.79. The S&P 500 lost 29.04 points, or 1.09 percent, to 2,635.72 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 98.00 points, or 1.37 percent, to 7,066.87. Emerging market stocks lost 0.4 percent. Volatility has picked up as investors fret about an economic cycle that is long in the tooth, leading to sharp reactions in the market to news, said Laura Kane, head of investment themes for the Americas at UBS Wealth Management. Equity markets have solid underpinnings with fourth-quarter earnings looking good, a likely truce in the U.S.-China trade talks and the Fed sounding a dovish message, leading her to be optimistic, Kane said. “But the complication of volatility being uncomfortable and the fact we’re later cycle, that’s why we’re seeing these larger reactions to market news than we’re used to,” she said. U.S. energy companies last week boosted the number of rigs drilling for oil for the first time since late December, U.S. crude production, which rose to a record 11.9 million barrels per day late last year, has undermined sentiment in the oil market, traders said. Also weighing on oil prices are concerns about whether Chinese refiners will continue to import crude at 2018’s breakneck pace. U.S. crude settled down 3.17 percent at $51.99 per barrel and Brent fell 2.77 percent to settle at $59.93. In FX markets, the ICE index that tracks the dollar versus the euro, yen, sterling and three other currencies was down 0.07 percent at 95.730. It hit a near two-week low at 95.673 earlier in the session. The euro rose 0.14 percent to $1.1428 while the Japanese yen strengthened 0.23 percent versus the greenback at 109.28 per dollar. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose 3/32 in price to push their yield down to 2.7404 percent. U.S. gold futures settled up 0.4 percent at $1,303.10 per ounce. Reporting by Herbert Lash

2019-01-28,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities on Monday approved a new, privately run foreign exchange system that will operate in parallel to the official currency control system, as an emboldened opposition challenges President Nicolas Maduro. The currency controls, originally created by late socialist leader Hugo Chavez in 2003, have sold dollars at an advantageous rate for basic goods while at times also selling hard currency for other items at a less favourable rate. Critics call the currency controls one of the principal distortions of the crisis-stricken economy, which is expected to see inflation reach 10 million percent this year amid a broad collapse that has fuelled a humanitarian crisis. With prices doubling every few weeks, cash is scarce and even the smallest transactions are carried out with debit cards. “The system will not correct the distortion,” Henkel Garcia, a director of local consultancy Econometrica. “The country’s most serious problem is the inadequate supply of dollars.” The announcement comes as opposition leader Juan Guaido seeks to pressure the government and hold new elections, a push that has won widespread support overseas. Guaido has proclaimed himself president due to what he says was a fraudulent vote leading to Maduro’s re-election last year. Maduro says the United States is promoting a coup against him and promised to stay in office, backed by Russia and China. The new currency platform, called Interbanex, began operations on Monday, selling dollars at 3,200 bolivars, it said on Twitter. That rate is 34.5 percent weaker than the official rate of 2,084 bolivars to the dollar. Venezuela’s central bank said on Twitter that Interbanex “will become part of the country’s currency exchange market,” and that it was authorized by the Finance Ministry.  The central bank did not respond to a request for comment. Manuel Armas, a spokesman for Interbanex’s customer service department, said Venezuela’s state institutions would not participate for now due to U.S. sanctions on Maduro’s government. Interbanex also said that private Venezuela bank BOD would trade on the platform. BOD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  The ruling Socialist Party has over the years launched six “complementary” foreign exchange systems meant to improve access to dollars, but those systems all collapsed amid complaints by businesses that they could not obtain the greenbacks they needed. On its Twitter page, Interbanex says it is owned by “Spanish investors” and on its website it lists its owner as Interban Exchange. Interban is owned by a Granada, Spain-registered company called Ampajesu and a Barbados-registered company called Bull Equity Management, according to Interbanex.

2019-01-28,"(Recasts with comments from acting president, senator, lawyer and environment minister, updated share reaction and fines) By Gram Slattery BRUMADINHO, Brazil, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Brazil’s government weighed pushing for a management overhaul at miner Vale SA on Monday as grief over hundreds feared killed by a dam burst turned into anger, with prosecutors, politicians and victims’ families calling for punishment. By Monday, firefighters in the state of Minas Gerais had confirmed 60 people killed by Friday’s disaster, in which a burst tailings dam sent a torrent of sludge into the miner’s offices and the town of Brumadinho. Nearly 300 more people are unaccounted for, and officials said it was unlikely that any would be found alive. Brazil’s acting president Hamilton Mourao told reporters a government task force on the disaster response is looking at whether it could or should change Vale’s top management. Public-sector pension funds hold several seats on the miner’s board. “The question of Vale’s management is being studied by the crisis group,” said Mourao, who is serving as acting president for some 48 hours while President Jair Bolsonaro recovers from surgery. “I’m not sure if the group could make that recommendation.” Shares of Vale, the world’s largest iron ore and nickel producer, plummeted as much as 25 percent in Monday trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange, erasing more than $16 billion in market capitalization. Senator Renan Calheiros, who is in the thick of a Senate leadership race, called on Twitter for Vale’s top management to be removed urgently “out of respect for the victims ... and to avoid any destruction of evidence.” One of Vale’s lawyers, Sergio Bermudes, told newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that management should not leave the company and Calheiros was trying to profit politically from the tragedy. Brazil’s top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be held strongly responsible and criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said. The disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine occurred less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton , killing 19 and dumping toxic sludge in a major river. While the 2015 Samarco disaster unleashed about five times more mining waste, Friday’s dam break was far deadlier as the wall of mud hit Vale’s local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill. “The cafeteria was in a risky area,” Renato Simao de Oliveiras, 32, said while searching for his twin brother, a Vale employee, at an emergency response station. “Just to save money, even if it meant losing the little guy... These businessmen, they only think about themselves.” As search efforts continued on Monday, firefighters laid down wood planks to cross a sea of sludge that is hundreds of meters wide in places, to reach a bus in search of bodies inside. Villagers discovered the bus as they tried to rescue a nearby cow stuck in the mud. Longtime resident Ademir Rogerio cried as he surveyed the mud where Vale’s facilities once stood on the edge of town. “The world is over for us,” he said. “Vale is the top mining company in the world. If this could happen here, imagine what would happen if it were a smaller miner.” Nestor José de Mury said he lost his nephew and coworkers in the mud. “I’ve never seen anything like it, it killed everyone,” he said. The board of Vale, which has raised its dividends over the last year, suspended all shareholder payouts and executive bonuses late on Sunday, as the disaster put its corporate strategy under scrutiny. Since the disaster, courts have order a freeze on 11.8 billion reais of Vale’s assets to cover damages. State and federal authorities have slapped it with 349 million reais of administrative fines. German insurer Allianz SE may have to cover some of the costs of the dam collapse, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. “I’m not a mining technician. I followed the technicians’ advice and you see what happened. It didn’t work,” Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman said in a TV interview. “We are 100 percent within all the standards, and that didn’t do it.” Many wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards. “There are safe ways of mining,” said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. “It’s just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way – and put lives at risk.” Reaction to the disaster could threaten the plans of Brazil’s newly inaugurated president to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swaths of the Amazon jungle for mining. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said in a TV interview on Monday that Brazil should create new regulation for mining dams, replacing wet tailings dams with dry mining methods. Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque proposed in Sunday newspaper interview that the law should be changed to assign responsibility in cases such as Brumadinho to the people responsible for certifying the safety of mining dams. “Current law does not prevent disasters like the one we saw on Brumadinho”, he said. “The model for verifying the state of mining dams will have to be reconsidered. The model isn’t good.” The ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the interview. ($1 = 3.7559 reais) Reporting by Gram Slattery

2019-01-28,"(Reuters) - Canadian construction and engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc cut its full-year 2018 profit forecast on Monday, citing ongoing trade challenges in Saudi Arabia as well as a problem with a project in its mining and metallurgy unit, sending its shares down as much as 31 percent. The company is in the crosshairs of an ongoing diplomatic spat between Ottawa and Riyadh over a number of issues which have strained relations between the two countries.  “Inter-governmental relations between Canada and Saudi Arabia, together with unpredictable commodity prices and uncertain client investment plans, have led to deterioration in our near-term prospects which we cannot ignore,” Chief Executive Neil Bruce said in a statement. SNC’s biggest shareholder and Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec said in an emailed statement that “short-term bumps in the market don’t change our views on SNC and its solid performance prospects over the long term.” The Caisse, which holds about 20 percent of SNC’s outstanding shares, declined to comment further. Saudi Arabia contributed about 11 percent of SNC’s total revenue in 2017, according to Canaccord Genuity analyst Yuri Lynk. Over 15 percent of the company’s global workforce is employed in the country. The company said it will take a non-cash after-tax goodwill impairment charge of C$1.24 billion, or C$7.06 per share, in the year. SNC now expects earnings of C$2.15 to C$2.30 per share in 2018. It had earlier forecast C$3.60 to C$3.85 per share. “We can’t discount the possibility that a strained trade relationship between Canada and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia won’t hamper the company’s ability to secure future work,” analyst Lynk said in a note last week. SNC had said in August its financial performance would take an impact if a long-term embargo was placed on Canadian commercial interests in the middle-eastern country. On Monday, the company also said earnings before interest and tax in its mining and metallurgy segment will be lower due to added costs for a project. The unit was expected to contribute about 7 percent to overall revenue in 2019, while the oil and gas unit was set to make 24 percent, analyst Lynk said. SNC shares fell as low as C$33.51, before trading down 27.4  percent at C$35.21 in Toronto at mid-afternoon.

2019-01-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Didi Chuxing has set up joint ventures with a unit of Chinese carmaker BAIC and Germany’s Volkswagen as part of the ride hailing giant’s goal to ultimately develop purpose-built cars for its services.  China’s biggest ride-hailing operator said on Monday the joint venture (JV) with state-owned BAIC, called BAIC-Xiaoju New Energy Auto Technology Co. Ltd, aimed to develop “next-generation connected-car systems.” It is the first JV between the two companies and follows another partnership announced by Didi last year with Volkswagen. Volkswagen said on Monday the two firms formally set up their JV last month. Chinese company registration records showed that Didi holds a 60 percent share in the JV, called Shanghai Juzhong Smart Mobility Co, while Volkswagen Group China owns 40 percent. This JV “will focus on fleet operations, fleet sales, fleet management, repair and maintenance services. The new JV will also explore fleet leasing business,” Volkswagen said in a statement to Reuters.  “At the same time, it will carry out extensive discussions to cooperate with industry leading companies in the field of smart mobility,” Volkswagen added. The two JVs are among the most significant projects that Didi has begun pursuing as part of a broad alliance the Chinese company formed with 31 automakers and parts suppliers last year.  Didi said at the time that it formed the alliance to offer its customer and operational skills to automakers wanting to develop their own ride-sharing services in return for design expertise. Eventually, the Chinese firm intends to develop cars purpose-built for its services. The growing popularity of ride-hailing services for commuting and running errands in congested cities such as Beijing and Shanghai is showing early signs of reducing private car ownership.

2019-01-28,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco is pushing for a top credit rating ahead of its first international bond sale, but Saudi Arabia’s sluggish economy may curb the state-owned oil firm’s ambitions. Aramco intends to issue its first U.S. dollar-denominated bonds, expected to be at least $10 billion, in the second quarter to help finance the acquisition of a stake in SABIC, the world’s fourth-largest petrochemicals maker. Chief Executive Amin Nasser said last week that Aramco was talking to credit rating agencies ahead of its debut on the international capital markets, which comes after it last year pulled what would have been the biggest ever stock flotation. Credit ratings allow investors to compare and assess the credit quality of bond issuers and their debt securities and are important in determining how much borrowers have to pay. As the world’s top oil producer, Aramco expects to match the ratings of Exxon and Shell, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Exxon is rated triple-A by agency Moody’s and AA+ by its rival S&P, putting it on par with the rating of the United States. But this would put Aramco, which declined to comment, four to six “notches” above Saudi Arabia itself, creating an unprecedented gap between a state-owned firm and its government. Bond market investors expect Aramco to have a similar, if not lower, rating than Saudi Arabia, meaning its bonds will have to offer a higher yield than government debt to attract buyers. “We wouldn’t buy Aramco’s bonds if they were yielding lower than Saudi Arabia’s sovereign bonds of similar maturity,” Charles de Quinsonas, Co-Fund Manager, M&G (Lux) Emerging Markets Income Opportunities Fund, said. Moody’s and S&P declined to comment on Aramco, while a third agency Fitch did not respond to a request for comment. As a standalone business, Aramco could outweigh its international peers, but most of its assets are in Saudi Arabia and it is tightly linked to Saudi Arabia’s economic policies. And national oil companies are generally rated at the same level as or slightly lower than their governments. Several investors said they expect Aramco’s rating to be in line with the country’s sovereign rating as a result, even though its full-year accounts for 2016, seen by Reuters, show that cashflow from operations put it well above Exxon, the world’s largest listed oil firm and Aramco’s nearest rival. “We would anticipate that the group as a whole, at face value, would have a credit rating equivalent or slightly below that of the sovereign,” Ehsan Khoman, head of MENA research and strategy at MUFG, said. Saudi Arabia is trying to diversify its revenues away from oil and stimulate a sluggish economy bruised by a price slump in the past few years. The Aramco IPO, which has been pushed back to 2021, was a cornerstone of its reform plans. When it comes to what Aramco will have to pay investors, the oil firm may have to offer higher yields than the government. “One would expect Aramco, as an entity that is less core than the sovereign per se, to trade wider than sovereign bonds,” MUFG’s Khoman said. While Aramco’s revenue stream depends on hydrocarbon sales, which are cyclical and subject to international supply-demand fundamentals, the state has access to more diversified wealth buffers to meet its contractual obligations. Almost 70 percent of state revenues are set to come from oil this year and Aramco is the sole holder of Saudi oil concessions and the country’s most important source of foreign currency. “There is not a clear fundamental advantage (to buy Aramco, rather than Saudi bonds), but the spread concession to the sovereign could make it the more attractive investment when considering the relative credit risk profile,” Janelle Woodward, head of income at BMO Global Asset Management, said. A spread differential of 20 to 30 basis points when comparing quasi-sovereign entities with their sovereigns was typical for highly-rated entities, Woodward said, adding that this would be the case with Aramco, which she expects will be rated at par with the kingdom.

2019-01-28,"BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - A high-level delegation from Libya’s parallel government in the east visited the main southern city of Sabha on Monday after its forces this month seized control of the city, an official said. The eastern government is allied to Khalifa Haftar, whose Libyan National Army (LNA) launched a campaign this month in southwestern Libya. Sabha had been nominally under the control of the internationally recognised government in Tripoli but in reality was run by local groups including tribes. Control of Sabha is seen as vital for securing southern Libya’s oilfields, one of the stated goals of the LNA campaign. The interior, health and junior justice ministers of the eastern government, which is based in Benghazi, were seen meeting local officials in the municipality of Sabha in pictures sent to Reuters by members of the visiting delegation. The officials later visited the main hospital and a court, journalists said.  Tripoli officials could not be reached for comment on the visit, which further highlighted the internationally recognised government’s continued lack of authority in most of Libya. Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj said during a visit to Vienna on Monday that “many things” were not going well in the south, but he did not allude to the visit by the eastern delegation or to the LNA advance. “Regarding the south we need better support for our security forces. We need more cooperation between all security forces,” he said. The LNA has secured Sabha airport and other strategic sites in the area in recent days, after local groups handed them over without a fight. The LNA says its campaign is aimed at combating militant groups and securing oil facilities in the south, which include El Sharara oilfield, Libya’s biggest. On Monday LNA forces killed a suspected al Qaeda fighter  called Adel Ahmed al-Abdaly when they stormed his house in Sabha, LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said. Otherwise the city has been largely quiet since the arrival of the LNA. Al Qaeda and Islamic State have been using southern Libya as a base for attacks in Libya and neighbouring countries, exploiting a security vacuum created by the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in a 2011 rebellion backed by NATO air strikes.

2019-01-28,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria plans to issue several tenders for renewable energy projects this year as it seeks to meet growing demand for electricity and save gas for export, an official said on Monday. The OPEC oil producing member hopes to build solar plants to produce 22,000 megawatts (MW), or 27 percent of its electricity needs, by 2030, up from about 350 MW now. Algeria will soon invite bids from national and foreign firms to set up a solar plant with a capacity of 150 MW, a senior official at the energy ministry said. “We are (also) planning tenders to produce 2,000 megawatts before the end of 2020,” he added, without giving more details. Turning to solar power is part of a drive to guarantee cheap retail energy prices. The authorities are keen to avoid social unrest, and face sporadic protests in some areas over a lack of electricity and gas supplies. “Our development plan is also aimed at maintaining contractual commitments with partners in terms of gas supply,” said Noureddine Yassa, head of a National Renewable Energy Development Center set up to develop the sector. The increase in demand for electricity has averaged 6.91 percent annually over the past years, according to official data, in a country where the population has been growing by nearly a million people per year. Algeria is currently using gas to generate 98 percent of its power output of 19,000 MW. Increasing or maintaining the level of gas and oil exports is a top priority for the country as the two energy products make up 60 percent of the budget and 94 percent of total sales abroad. Solar energy will also be used at oil and gas fields. State energy firm Sonatrach has already signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Italy’s ENI to build solar plants. The North African country wants to use the expertise of foreign firms but needs to tackle bureaucracy and slowness reported by investors. “The (solar energy) plan is applicable if there is a political will,” said economist El Houari Tighersi, also a member of the parliamentary finance committee. “The investment climate must be improved if we want to change the situation for the better.” Reporting by Hamid Ould Ahmed; Editing by Ulf Laessing and Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/algeria-energy/algeria-plans-solar-energy-tenders-to-tackle-rising-electricity-needs-idUKL8N1ZP25E,28 Jan 2019,"Algeria plans to issue several

2019-01-28,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Spike Aerospace Inc has signed up its first orders and is close to selecting an engine for the $125 million supersonic business  jet it is developing, its president said on Monday. Spike and other U.S.-based start-ups are aiming to revive ultra-fast flights to serve a market that has been dormant since Concorde stopped flying in 2003. Spike is aiming to start test flights in two years with its S-512 aircraft entering into service in 2025. “We already have two orders,” Vik Kachoria told Reuters in an interview in Dubai where he was attending an industry conference. There were also ongoing discussions with a commercial airline, he added. He declined to disclose further details but said that the orders they had booked were not from an airliner. Spike believes that there will be demand for around 850 supersonic jets in the decade to 2035 - largely from commercial airlines. Spike is planning for its S-512 aircraft to seat up to 18 passengers, flying at Mach 1.6 - above the Mach 0.9 speed of rival subsonic business jets. “The business jet is going to appeal to private owner-operators, fractional operators and corporate flight departments but this can also be used by airlines as an upgrade from economy to business to first to supersonic class,” Kachoria said. Spike, Aerion Supersonic, and Boom Supersonic are targeting to have their supersonic jets flying by the mid-2020s by modifying existing engines rather than spending billions of dollars to make a new one. General Electric is to manufacture the engine for Aerion’s AS2 jet.     Spike is close to selecting an engine after holding discussions with GE and Rolls-Royce. “One of those companies is more advanced discussions,” Kachoria said, adding that an announcement “may be a little longer” than six weeks away. GE and Rolls-Royce did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment on whether they have held such talks. Spike plans to manufacture four supersonic test aircraft, Kachoria added.  The development of new supersonic business jets has, however, raised debate as to whether aerospace standards and guidelines need to be updated, such as those related to noise.

2019-01-28,"WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Nathan L’Etoile and Caroline Taylor are both passionate about preserving farmland, but they differ over a question being posed across the United States: should farmers devote some, or even all, of their land to solar energy? In recent years, the country has experienced a solar boom: installed capacity last year reached 60 gigawatts, up from about 9GW a decade ago, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. It expects this figure will more than double in the next five years, with about 14GW being installed annually. For a start, that means much more land will be needed: under a scenario that sees solar reach 1,618GW by 2050, the government estimates a total of 6.6 million acres (2.7 million hectares) will be required by 2050 - roughly the size of Massachusetts. By comparison, the country’s capacity from all sources in 2017 was about 1,100GW, according to the Energy Information Administration, a government body. Coal and natural gas accounted for about 64 percent of that total. Flat, undeveloped tracts that enjoy plenty of sun are in growing demand, said L’Etoile, whose family farms 250 acres in Massachusetts and has been approached repeatedly by solar developers - who to date have been unsuccessful. “We only have so much land, and we all have our own idea of the best use of that land,” L’Etoile told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Further south in Maryland - where Taylor lives – the state government has pledged that a quarter of the electricity sold by local utilities will come from renewables by 2020; legislation underway could see that double by 2030. Although Taylor supports those goals, she heads a group called the Montgomery Countryside Alliance that works with a nationally recognised agricultural reserve — 93,000 acres located just miles from Washington, D.C. The reserve was zoned in the 1980s to protect farmland and agriculture. She fears that it is increasingly under threat as state laws look to boost solar generation. “We’re concerned that industry will want to come look for arable land - it’s the easiest way to go,” she said, adding that last year the alliance fought off one legislative attempt to allow large-scale solar projects within the reserve. Taylor said more research was needed on how to combine solar with farming. She is also concerned at the U.S.’s “scattershot” approach to renewables, saying legislators should come up with a comprehensive plan for achieving clean-energy goals. L’Etoile’s family grows turf, as well as hops and grain that they mill and sell to local restaurants and bakeries. He said the area had some of the country’s best soil - which is one reason his family has turned down solar developers. “We have emotional ties to the land ... and we feel it’s important that they stay in agriculture,” he said. Historically, he said, farmland could be used for solar or for farming - not both. But that could change. In August, Massachusetts began a programme to push farmers and the solar industry to work together: tiered incentives under which “dual use” projects were eligible for about 50 percent more financial assistance, L’Etoile said. This includes projects that combine solar arrays with active agriculture. Typically that means placing solar panels high off the ground, and spacing them to ensure crops can grow beneath. Research suggests that works, he said. The L’Etoile family estimates a 20-year solar lease would bring in $10-15,000 per acre over that time, in addition to the revenue the land continued to generate from farming. That would help the farm and bolster rural economies, L’Etoile said. But, like Taylor, the implications of what looks to be easy money worry him. He also works for an advocacy group - the American Farmland Trust - that last year found more than 31 million acres of farmland were lost to development between 1992 and 2012, double previous estimates. “It’s an easy path to just convert farms to solar. Many people say that solar is only a 20-year thing, that the land can always go back to agriculture,” L’Etoile said. But, he said, that reversion generally did not happen. His family has not applied for state subsidies, but they are talking to developers knowing they could produce solar energy and crops on the same land at the same time. “It’s not a binary choice ... maybe we can balance.” Other collaborative models are also springing up. In 2016, Minnesota passed legislation requiring new solar development to say whether it was “pollinator friendly”. Rather than building the solar array on a gravel bed, developers plant the area with perennial flowers, said Rob Davis of Fresh Energy, a non-profit based in the state. That attracts bees that can pollinate crops, Davis said, and could help to roll back some of the 10 million acres of pollinator habitat lost nationwide over the past two decades. Doing so would cut maintenance costs, he said, and could increase the amount of solar energy generated. “It creates a cooler microclimate, and solar panels produce more electricity when they’re cooler,” he said. Minnesota’s requirement that all large solar projects be pollinator-friendly was a major selling point in getting communities to support new developments, he said. The law has sparked similar legislation in five other states, and has led large utilities - which are some of the major investors in solar power in the United States - to follow that lead, Davis said. Cypress Creek Renewables - an independent solar developer in North Carolina - started a pollinator programme last year and has similar projects in four states, said Bryanna Glod Ocitti, its senior director of strategic development. A pilot programme is assessing having livestock graze around solar arrays: that could let farmers could keep using land that is generating energy, and solar developers cut costs by having animals trim the vegetation, Ocitti said. “Putting solar on some underutilised parts of their land ... has helped (landowner partners) to weather the ups and downs of farming,” she said. Others are looking to avoid competition over land-use by targeting landfill and other degraded areas. Some of the most innovative work is taking place in Nevada, where in August authorities amended state law to include solar development as a valid use for former mine lands, said John Zablocki of the Nature Conservancy, an advocacy group. That has been supported across the political spectrum, including by environmental groups and the mining industry, he said. He and his colleagues see great potential nationally. Government data shows the United States has more than 80,000 degraded sites comprising more than 43 million acres - far more than would be needed by 2050 - which could in theory generate 6,700GW annually, according to a 2015 report by the Environmental Protection Agency, a government body. Zablocki and his colleagues want to transfer their knowledge to West Virginia, another state with a long mining history. “I’d say it’s America’s greatest untapped energy resource — tens of millions of acres that can generate energy,” he said. ""Mining companies are starting to see they can turn liabilities into assets, so we see Nevada and West Virginia as the tip of the spear."" (Reporting by Carey L. Biron; Editing by Robert Carmichael.

2019-01-28,"* World shares slip on concerns over China economy * Sino-U.S. trade talks, FOMC meeting in focus * Sterling drifts lower ahead of Brexit votes on Tuesday (Updates prices throughout; adds German bond prices) By Tom Wilson LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - World shares slipped into the red on Monday, with equities markets from Europe to Asia buffeted by nerves over China’s economy and investors staying cautious ahead of a week packed with major events. Major European bourses fell in morning trade, mirroring a retreat for Asian peers as gloomy data on China’s industrial profits outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the U.S. government shutdown late last week. At the start of a busy week, investors were focused on Sino-U.S. trade talks and the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting. Also in focus was a looming twist in Britain’s exit from the European Union, with crucial votes due on Tuesday in the British parliament designed to break the Brexit deadlock. By 1150 GMT, The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent. MSCI’s main European Index dropped 0.5 percent, with the broader Euro STOXX 600 losing the same. Major indexes in France, Germany and Britain all fell. In Asia, bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul had earlier all closed down, though MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat. Investors said stocks fell on worries over a second straight monthly fall in profits for China’s industrial firms. The data suggested trouble ahead for Chinese manufacturers already struggling with falling orders, job layoffs and factory closures amid a protracted trade war with the United States. “A slowdown in the Chinese economy could be sometimes taken as an idiosyncratic event which would be dealt with by Beijing,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “It’s pretty clear that the current situation is more global, in terms of the tariff tension between the U.S. and China and the threat of that dispute spilling over more widely.” Investors are now waiting for Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s visit to Washington on Jan. 30-31, for the next round of trade negotiations with the United States. With the sides still far from resolving trade issues, the dollar stood firm as traders sought a safe haven as they await news from U.S.-China talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. The dollar index - a gauge of its value versus six major peers - was flat at 95.793. “In this environment the dollar is holding up well,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, a forex strategist at Commerzbank. “I assume that this will continue to be the case, even as the conflict intensifies at the end of the week,” she said, referring to the talks. The dollar will also get a strong steer from this week’s Fed meeting, where the central bank is expected to signal a pause in its tightening cycle and to acknowledge growing risks to the world’s biggest economy. Though the Fed has forecast two more interest rate hikes for 2019, a darkening global economic outlook and highly volatile stock markets have clouded the policy picture. Elsewhere in currency markets, sterling drifted lower ahead of crucial votes in the British parliament aimed at breaking the Brexit deadlock. The British currency lost 0.3 percent to $1.3164, as investors consolidated positions ahead of Tuesday’s Brexit votes. Lawmakers earlier this month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal to leave the EU, which included a nearly two-year transition period to help minimize economic disruption. That defeat set up a series of votes in parliament, through which lawmakers and the government will try to find a way forward. Elsewhere, Germany’s 10-year government bond yield was marginally lower at 0.194 percent, having fallen last week when European Central Bank President Mario Draghi warned that risks to the euro zone economy had eased. Draghi is due to speak later on Monday at the European Parliament in Brussels. Investors said they will look for any further details on potential changes to monetary policy. Brent crude futures were down 1.8 percent, at $60.56 a barrel. The fall came as moves by U.S. firms to add rigs signalled that crude output may rise further, and worries grew over the signs of economic slowdown in China, the world’s second-largest oil user. Gold was slightly down. Spot gold was down 0.2 percent at $1,300.56 per ounce, hovering just below a more than 7-month high of $1,304.40 reached earlier in the session.

2019-01-28,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers stepped up their purchases of oil and refined products last week on growing hopes of a U.S.-China trade truce and that the global economy will avoid a severe slowdown in 2019. But fund buying has been concentrated in crude rather than fuels, which is consistent with producer club OPEC tightening the supply side of the market while the demand outlook remains more uncertain. Hedge funds and other money managers boosted their net long position in Brent crude futures and options by 30 million barrels to 203 million barrels in the week to Jan. 22. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2ThSHUZ). Portfolio managers have raised their net long position in Brent in six of the last seven weeks, by a combined 66 million barrels since Dec. 4, according to exchange data. Funds now hold four bullish long positions in Brent for every one bearish short position, up from a ratio of just over 2:1 in early December, but far from the recent peak of 19:1 at the end of September. Fund managers also increased their net long position in European gasoil for the third week running by 4 million barrels to 15 million barrels. Gasoil positions are up by 13 million barrels since the end of December. In both cases, however, most of the new buying last week came from the closure of existing short positions rather than opening fresh long ones. It follows the largest sell-off ever recorded in crude and gasoil during the fourth quarter and confirms many fund managers sense prices have found a floor, at least temporarily. The preponderance of short-covering suggests most managers think oil prices will not fall further rather than any great optimism about future increases. By cutting oil production early and aggressively, OPEC has removed some of the downside risk to oil prices in 2019 but the upside potential remains unclear until the threat of recession is resolved.

2019-01-28,"MADRID (Reuters) - Hundreds of taxis blocked a central traffic artery in Madrid during Monday’s morning rush hour, in their biggest show of strength yet as a protest seeking tighter regulation of Uber and other ride-hailing services entered its second week. Anti-riot police backed by a fleet of tow trucks took several hours to clear the vehicles from the capital’s Paseo de la Castellana. Stoppages are expected elsewhere as the protest drags on.  The city’s taxi drivers started the protests last week against the private services, which offer rides that often undercut taxi prices and can be hailed via the internet rather than in the street.  In September, Spain’s government gave ride-hailing companies four years to comply with regulation granting them just one new licence for every 30 taxi licences.  The cab drivers are demanding stricter regulations now. “They (ride-hailing services) can’t do the same services that a taxi does. They can’t pick up people on the streets. That is illegal but nothing happens,” said taxi driver Juan Mateos.  Taxi drivers in Barcelona ended a strike last week after regional authorities proposed the ride-hailing services can only be booked a short time in advance and cannot be hailed in the street. Negotiations there remain ongoing, and some ride-hailing platforms say they may be forced to leave Barcelona if the new rules take effect.

2019-01-28,"(Reuters) - Indonesian oil and gas group Medco got an extension to Jan. 31 to make a firm takeover offer for Ophir Energy or walk away, the London-listed company said, adding the parties were discussing a 55 pence per share offer. Earlier this month, Ophir rejected Medco’s $437 million potential buyout offer based on 48.5 pence per share saying it undervalued the company and that Medco had initially mooted 58 pence per share. Ophir’s shares lost almost half of their value last year as it failed to find financing for a liquefied natural gas project in Africa’s Equatorial Guinea.

Ophir’s current output of 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil equivalent combined with Medco’s stated 2018 target of 85,000 bpd of oil equivalent would make Medco, which has been expanding, the seventh largest non-national oil company upstream producer in Southeast Asia, according to research firm WoodMac.

2019-01-28,"MFOU, Cameroon, Jan 28 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Adrienne Ngonou’s 25-seat restaurant used to open from 8 am to 5 pm, shutting it doors as the sun began to go down. But these days it’s open until 11 pm - and her profits have tripled. “We now sell both during the day and late in the night because of the constant electricity supply,” she said. “Two years ago, this was not possible.” Ngonou’s new power source is a government-provided solar array that supplies power to about 300 homes, businesses and other institutions in Mfou, a town of about 10,000 people east of Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital. Earlier the area relied in part on grid power, which has been unreliable as more erratic rainfall and droughts linked to climate change hit the county’s hydropower dams, which supply the majority of its energy. But the $13,000 battery-backed solar grid, installed in 2017, has given the area it serves 24-hour reliable power - and is now being replicated in other power-hungry parts of Cameroon, as the government tries to plug a stubborn energy gap and shore up its energy system against climate change, officials say. Mfou’s solar system was part of a deal between Cameroon’s government and China’s Huawei telecommunications company, which also installs solar installations, to supply solar energy to more than 160 villages, largely in rural areas, they say. So far solar power - much of it small-scale and often installed by non-governmental organisations - provides only about 1 percent of Cameroon’s energy needs, according to 2017 government figures. Energy expansion plans for Cameroon have focused largely on fossil fuel plants and hydropower expansion, mostly funded by China. But now Cameroon’s President Paul Biya “has thrown his hefty political weight in support of renewable energy and this has brought a new stimulating perspective,” Martine Akame Mesumbe, director of gas exploitation at the  Ministry of Water and Energy, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The government hopes to boost Cameroon’s electricity access in rural areas as part of its “Vision 2035” development plan, aimed at expanding the economy and slashing poverty to 10 percent. So far that expansion has been hampered by a lack of power, experts say. According to a 2018 World Bank report, just half of Cameroon’s people have access to electricity, with 80 percent of the supply concentrated in urban areas. Rural electrification is just 17 percent, it said. As part of its push to change that, the government now aims to reach 1,000 communities - about 250,000 people in total - with solar power by the end of 2020, according to Mesumbe. Altogether it hopes to get electricity, from a variety of sources, to 40 percent of rural Cameroonians by 2020. “This could drive significant economic change in rural Cameroon,” Mesumbe said. More than $120 million in funding for the push is coming from a Bank of China loan for renewable energy projects, he said. Communities now hooked up to solar panels - like those in Mfou - say they are happy to have a cleaner and less costly source of energy. “It is a cheaper alternative to diesel generators and wood energy ... used in the past to power small businesses,” said Roger Belinga, the mayor of Mfou. Jarome Angwi, a beer vendor in the town, said solar energy to power his refrigerator and premises costs just a fifth of what he used to pay for diesel. Local officials say they hope access to electricity will help keep young people from deserting rural areas for jobs in Cameroon’s cities. In Mfou, “even some of those who left are already coming back” since the solar panels were installed, Belinga said. Whether the new solar systems will be maintained, however, remains a question. Local authorities in some towns said they lack the funds to train local solar technicians. “Many local councils do not have the financial resources to sustain these projects. They need financial support from government,” Rose Ngassa, the mayor of Tombel, in southwest Cameroon, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview in Yaounde. But national government officials say an ongoing political decentralisation push in Cameroon - including an expected 70 percent boost in cash transferred to local authorities in 2019 - should give local councils more money to invest in and maintain solar energy systems. Greater use of solar power could also help cut worrying deforestation rates in Cameroon, home to part of Africa’s Congo Basin forests, environmentalist say. “The cutting of trees for wood and charcoal used for cooking and heating will now reduce in many villages with the coming of solar energy,” said Augustine Njamnshi, the Cameroon-based coordinator of the African Coalition for Sustainable Energy.

2019-01-28,"* World shares slip on concerns over China economy * Sino-U.S. trade talks FOMC meeting in focus * Sterling drifts lower ahead of Brexit votes on Tuesday By Tom Wilson LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - World shares fell into the red on Monday, with equities markets from Asia to Europe buffeted as Chinese industrial profits fell and investors stayed cautious ahead of a busy week including Sino-U.S. trade talks and the Federal Reserve’s policy meeting. Major European bourses fell in early trade, mirroring a retreat for Asian stocks as concerns over Chinese growth outweighed any boost from the tentative end to the U.S. government shutdown late last week. Investors also braced for another major twist in Britain’s exit from the European Union, with crucial votes due on Tuesday in the British parliament designed to break the Brexit deadlock. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, fell 0.1 percent, while MSCI’s main European Index dropped 0.5 percent. The broader Euro STOXX 600 also fell 0.4 percent. “A slowdown in the Chinese economy could be sometimes taken as an idiosyncratic event which would be dealt with by Beijing,” said Philip Shaw, chief economist at Investec. “It’s pretty clear that the current situation is more global, in terms of the tariff tension between the U.S. and China and the threat of that dispute spilling over more widely.” Earnings at China’s industrial firms shrank for the second straight month, suggesting trouble ahead for manufacturers struggling with falling orders, job layoffs and factory closures amid a protracted trade war with the United States. Investors are now waiting for Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s visit to the United States on Jan. 30-31, for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. But with the sides still far from resolving trade issues, the dollar stood firm as traders sought a safe haven as they await news from U.S.-China talks on Tuesday and Wednesday. The dollar index, a gauge of its value versus six major peers, was flat at 95.801. “In this environment the dollar was holding up well,” said Thu Lan Nguyen, a forex strategist at Commerzbank. “I assume that this will continue to be the case, even as the conflict intensifies at the end of the week,” she said, referring to the talks. The dollar will also get a strong steer from this week’s Fed meeting, where the central bank is expected to signal a pause in its tightening cycle and to acknowledge growing risks to the world’s biggest economy. Though the Fed has forecast two more interest rate hikes for 2019, a darkening global economic outlook and highly volatile stock markets have clouded the policy picture. Elsewhere in currencies, sterling drifted lower as investors consolidated positions ahead of crucial votes in the British parliament designed aim to break the Brexit deadlock. The British currency edged down a quarter of a percent lower to $1.3164. Lawmakers earlier this month rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s EU withdrawal agreement, which included a nearly two-year transition period to help minimize economic disruption. That defeat set up a series of votes on Tuesday through which lawmakers and the government will try to find a way forward. Overnight in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was flat, with bourses in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul all losing ground. Brent crude futures were down 1.8 percent, at $61.01 a barrel. Oil prices fell amid signals that crude output may rise further, and worries grew over the signs of economic slowdown in China, the world’s second-largest oil user. Gold was slightly down. Spot gold was down 0.2 percen at $1,300.56 per ounce, hovering just below a more than 7-month high of $1,304.40 reached earlier in the session.

2019-01-28,"* Independent refiners seek oil for March-April delivery -sources * Demand sparked by restocking, expectation crude prices will rise * Hunt for oil from Africa, Europe, Russia, Oman pushes up prices By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Chinese demand for crude oil is rebounding as independent refiners push to buy before prices climb further from low levels hit late last year, restocking with supplies that will arrive in March and April, trade sources said. That appetite from such refiners, often known as ‘teapots’, has driven up spot premiums for oil from Africa, Europe, Russia and Oman, the sources said, with prices for some grades hitting multi-month highs. That comes after teapots slowed crude purchases for delivery in the first two months of 2019 as demand for the fuel they churn out typically fades over the Lunar New Year holidays, which this year fall in early February. “It’s as if someone lit a match and the market’s caught fire,” said one of the sources. All sources declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to media. Global benchmark Brent oil prices had fallen more than 30 percent to just above $50 a barrel by the end of 2018, but prompt May crude futures have rebounded to above $60 a barrel this month. Teapots tend to time their crude purchases based on oil price movements, and often when one buys others will follow, the sources said. Spot premiums for crude grades popular with Chinese buyers are between 50 cents and more than $1 a barrel higher than price quotes seen at the start of the month, they said. For example, Oman’s spot premium almost doubled last week to $1 a barrel from the start of the month, while offers of Russian ESPO crude for delivery to China in March have risen by 50 cents to about $3.20 a barrel to May ICE Brent futures, according to the sources and Reuters data. However, demand is expected to cool by the end of this week as would-be buyers leave the office for the week-long Lunar New Year break, the sources said. China’s refined product consumption could only see 0.5-percent growth in 2019 from last year as gasoline demand slows with an expected 5-percent drop in passenger vehicle sales, while diesel use will continue to contract on weaker industrial output, Lin Chen, Nomura’s head of greater China energy global markets research, said in a note. Still, the world’s biggest oil importer could see crude imports rising to 9.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, up more than 4 percent from the previous year, Chen said. China’s refining throughput is set to hit another all-time high of 12.7 million bpd in 2019, about 600,000 bpd more than last year, driven by new refineries Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical, he added. Competition from these new plants means that other independent refiners are unlikely to increase their throughput this year, Chen said. Also, oil imports in the key refining region of Shandong in the east of the country are unlikely to rise until Dongjiakou city completes a port expansion by year-end, he said.

European shares are expected to dip at their open, with spread-betters looking to a fall of 0.3 percent in London’s FTSE and a 0.4 percent drop in Frankfurt’s DAX and Paris’s CAC. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 were last down 0.4 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was almost flat, pulling back after hitting its highest since Oct. 4 early in the session. China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng lost almost 0.2 percent while South Korea’s KOSPI was largely flat. Japan’s Nikkei closed 0.6 percent lower while Australian financial markets were shut for their ‘Australia Day’ holiday. Facing mounting pressure, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Friday to temporarily end a 35-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown without getting the $5.7 billion he had demanded from Congress for a border wall. In response Wall Street rallied broadly on Friday as investors were relieved to see an end to one of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. The shutdown had left the markets anxious as it came at a time of heightened worries over slowing global growth, signs of stress in corporate earnings and a still unresolved Sino-U.S. trade war. Attention now shifts to Chinese Vice Premier Liu He’s visit the United States on Jan. 30-31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. The high-level talks in Washington will include discussions about China’s currency practices, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. He has criticized the yuan’s weakness in the past, but in recent days, positive sentiment towards the talks has lifted the yuan’s value against the dollar. “Although coming to an agreement is still tricky, both sides have little incentive to escalate tensions,” said Tai Hui, Hong Kong-based chief market strategist for Asia Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a note. “Markets will at least expect an extension of the truce in tariff increases beyond early March, while more difficult issues are still being worked on by both sides.” Besides the underlying anxiety on trade, the temporary nature of the U.S. government’s reopening - Trump has threatened to resume the shutdown on Feb. 15 if his demands aren’t met - remained a source of concern. “As things stand this morning, we have only 18 days left before we get another government shutdown, or a Wall. That should keep things interesting for markets,” wrote strategists at Rabobank. In the currency market, the pound hovered not far off a three-month high of $1.3218 set on Friday on the back of optimism that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, but the country’s members of parliament remain far from agreeing a divorce deal and longer term prospects for sterling remained far from clear. The immediate focus was on Tuesday, when the British parliament will debate and vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit “plan B”. The euro was also on the front foot against the sagging dollar, which was on the defensive as the Federal Reserve convenes its first policy meeting of 2019 where it is expected to leave interest rates unchanged after raising them five times in as many quarters in December. The attention will be on the policy outlook as the Fed has signalled a slower pace of rate increases this year with markets speculating it might pause its tightening cycle soon. The single currency was a shade higher at $1.1410 after gaining 0.9 percent on Friday, paring the losses from earlier last week on dovish-sounding comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback slipped 0.2 percent to 109.31 yen, extending mild losses at the end of last week. The yield on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes edged down to 2.740 percent compared with its U.S. close of 2.751 percent on Friday. In commodity markets, U.S. crude oil futures were off 61 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $53.08 per barrel, with a rise in U.S. rig count stopping a two-day winning run. Brent crude futures were last down 63 cents, or 1 percent, at $61.01 a barrel. Oil prices rose towards the end of last week as political turmoil in Venezuela threatened to tighten crude supply, with the United States signalling it may impose sanctions on exports from the South American nation. Gold was slightly higher. Spot gold was traded at $1,302.20 per ounce, hovering just below a more than 7-month high of $1,304.40 reached earlier in the session.

2019-01-28,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s renewable power capacity rose 12 percent in 2018 compared to a year earlier, official data showed on Monday, with the country still rolling out new projects despite transmission capacity concerns and a growing subsidy payment backlog.  China has been aggressively promoting renewable power as part of an “energy revolution” aimed at easing its dependence on coal, a major source of pollution and climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions.  Total capacity - including hydro and biomass as well as solar and wind - rose to 728 gigawatts (GW) by end-2018, the National Energy Administration (NEA) said during a briefing.  That amounted to 38.3 percent of China’s total installed power capacity, up 1.7 percentage points on the year and around 7 percentage points higher than at the end of 2015.  China hooked up another 20.59 GW of new wind power capacity to its grid in 2018, the NEA said. New solar capacity reached 44.3 GW, slightly higher than a figure given by an industry association earlier this month, but still down compared to 2017 following a decision to slash subsidies.  China also completed another 8.54 GW of hydropower capacity, mostly in the nation’s southwest, bringing total hydropower to 352 GW by the year’s end.  China has tried to change the “rhythm” of renewable power construction to give grid operators time to raise transmission capacity and ensure clean electricity generation is not wasted.  Li Chuangjun, deputy head of the NEA’s new energy section, said overall rates of waste in the wind power sector had fallen to 7 percent last year, down 5 percentage points on the year.  The major wind generation regions of Xinjiang and Gansu in the far northwest, however, still failed to get around a fifth of potential wind power onto the grid over the period.  China’s “energy revolution” has also involved the installation of new emissions control technology at its coal-fired power plants, still the dominant form of energy in China.  Around 810 GW, or 80 percent, of China’s coal-fired capacity was employing “ultra-low emission” technology by the end of 2018, according to the transcript of a speech by China environment minister Li Ganjie published on Monday.  But despite China’s efforts to cut coal consumption and promote renewable power domestically, it has been criticized for backing new coal-fired projects overseas that use obsolete equipment no longer permitted at home.

2019-01-28,"BRUMADINHO, Brazil, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Grief over the hundreds of Brazilians feared lost in a mining disaster on Friday has quickly hardened into anger as victims’ families and politicians say iron ore miner Vale SA and regulators have learned nothing from the recent past. By Sunday night, firefighters in the state of Minas Gerais had confirmed 58 dead after a tailings dam broke, sending a torrent of sludge into the miner’s offices and the town of Brumadinho. Some 300 others are unaccounted for, and officials said the odds were slim that any would be found alive. The disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine came less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton, killing 19 and filling a major river with toxic sludge. While the 2015 Samarco disaster dumped about five times more mining waste, Friday’s dam break was far more deadly, as the wall of mud hit Vale’s local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill. “The cafeteria was in a risky area,” Renato Simao de Oliveiras, 32, said while searching for his twin brother, a Vale employee, at an emergency response station. “Just to save money, even if it meant losing the little guy. ... These businessmen, they only think about themselves.” Chief Executive Fabio Schvartsman said facilities were built to code and equipment had shown the dam was stable two weeks earlier. “I’m not a mining technician. I followed the technicians’ advice and you see what happened. It didn’t work,” Schvartsman said. “We are 100 percent within all the standards, and that didn’t do it.” Many wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards. “There are safe ways of mining,” said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. “It’s just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way – and put lives at risk.” German auditor TUV SUD said on Saturday it inspected the dam in September and found all to be in order. Blowback from the disaster could threaten the plans of newly inaugurated President Jair Bolsonaro to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swaths of the Amazon jungle for mining.

2019-01-28,"HANOI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Vietsovpetro, a Vietnam-Russia oil joint venture, has started crude oil production at the Ca Tam field offshore southern Vietnam, Vietnamese state oil firm PetroVietnam said on Monday. Initial production from Ca Tam, jointly developed by Vietsovpetro, PetroVietnam Exploration Production Corp (PVEP) and Bitexco Group, is 1,630 tonnes per day, PetroVietnam said in a statement. The field in block 09-3/12, 160 km (100 miles) southeast of Vietnam, is hooked up to the facilities in the nearby block 09-1, which houses the country’s largest oil field Bach Ho, PetroVietnam said. Ca Tam is the first new field to be brought into production in Vietnam in years after a 2014 plunge in oil prices slashed exploration. The start-up is significant as declining production from the country’s key fields has left it struggling to maintain oil and gas output. PetroVietnam, formally known as Vietnam Oil and Gas Group, said earlier this month that tension in the South China Sea will continue to weigh on its offshore operations this year, adding that Ca Tam is one of the two offshore fields it expected to start commercial production this year.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.4 percent. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.7 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng was up 0.5 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.1 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and eased 0.3 percent. Australian financial markets were shut for their ‘Australia Day’ holiday.

The shutdown had left the markets anxious as it came at a time of heightened worries over slowing global growth, signs of stress in corporate earnings and a still unresolved Sino-U.S. trade war. “The rise in the broader stock markets looks to keep going. The U.S. government reopening is definitely a plus for market sentiment,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments. “There are still potential risk factors, such as the U.S.-China trade row and Brexit,” he said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30-31 for the next round of trade negotiations with Washington. Besides the underlying anxiety on trade, the temporary nature of the U.S. government’s reopening - Trump has threatened to resume the shutdown on Feb. 15 if his demands aren’t met - remained a source of concern. “As things stand this morning, we have only 18 days left before we get another government shutdown, or a Wall.

2019-01-28,"* U.S. rig count last week rose for the first time in 2019 * China hopes fiscal stimulus can stem economic slowdown By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Monday after U.S. energy firms added rigs for the first time this year in a sign that crude production there will rise further. U.S. spot crude oil futures were at $53.37 per barrel at 0027 GMT, down 32 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures were at $61.37 a barrel, down 27 cents, or 0.4 percent. Analysts said high U.S. crude oil production, which hit a record 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd) late last year, was weighing on oil markets. In a sign that output could rise further, U.S. energy firms last week raised the number of rigs looking for new oil for the first time in 2019, adding 10 facilities, to 862, Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its weekly report on Friday. Beyond oil supply, a key question for this year will be demand-growth. Oil consumption has been increasing steadily, likely averaging above 100 million bpd for this first time in 2019, driven largely by a boom in China. However, an economic slowdown amid a trade dispute between Washington and Beijing is also weighing on fuel demand-growth expectations. China, which recorded the slowest pace of economic growth since 1990 last year, is trying to stem the slowdown with aggressive fiscal stimulus measures. But there are concerns that these measures may not have the full desired effect as China’s economy is already laden with massive debt and some of the bigger government spending measures are seen to be of little real use. High supply and an economic slowdown are weighing on the oil price outlook. “We expect U.S. crude oil prices to range between $50-$60 per barrel in 2019 and about $10 more per barrel for Brent,” Tortoise Capital Advisors said in its 2019 oil market outlook. However, Tortoise added that oil prices would be supported above $50 per barrel as it was “very clear that Saudi Arabia will no longer be willing to accept these lower oil prices”. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), de-facto led by Saudi Arabia, started supply cuts late last year to tighten markets and buoy prices.

2019-01-28,"* Asian stock markets: tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Asia lifted after end to US govt shutdown boosts Wall Street By Shinichi Saoshiro TOKYO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Asian stocks advanced on Monday as Wall Street rallied after a deal was announced to reopen the U.S. government following a prolonged shutdown that had shaken investor sentiment. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed 0.2 percent. South Korea’s KOSPI edged up 0.2 percent, New Zealand stocks were up a touch, while Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trends and eased 0.2 percent. Australian financial markets were shut for their ‘Australia Day’ holiday. Facing mounting pressure, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed on Friday to temporarily end a 35-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown without getting the $5.7 billion he had demanded from Congress for a border wall. In response Wall Street rallied broadly on Friday as investors were heartened to see the back of the longest U.S. government shutdown in history. The shutdown had left investors anxious and frustrated as it came at a time of heightened worries over slowing global growth, signs of stress in corporate earnings and a still unresolved Sino-U.S. trade war. “The rise in the broader stock markets looks to keep going. The U.S. government reopening is definitely a plus for market sentiment,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments. “There are still potential risk factors, such as the U.S.-China trade row and Brexit,” he said. In the currency market, the pound stood tall, hovering near a three-month high of $1.3218 set on Friday on the back of optimism that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. Britain is set to leave the European Union on March 29, but the country’s members of parliament remain far from agreeing a divorce deal. That has kept markets, worried about the possibility of a disorderly Brexit, on edge for much of the last several weeks. The euro was also on the front foot against the sagging dollar. The single currency was 0.05 percent higher at $1.1412 after gaining 0.9 percent on Friday, paring the losses from earlier last week on dovish-sounding comments by European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. The dollar was slightly lower at 109.48 yen following mild losses at the end of last week. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield was little changed at 2.754 percent after popping up 4 basis points on Friday in the wake of surging U.S. shares. U.S. crude oil futures were down 0.55 percent at $53.39 per barrel, losing some momentum after two sessions of gains. Oil prices rose towards the end of last week as political turmoil in Venezuela threatened to tighten crude supply, with the United States signalling it may impose sanctions on exports from the South American nation.
