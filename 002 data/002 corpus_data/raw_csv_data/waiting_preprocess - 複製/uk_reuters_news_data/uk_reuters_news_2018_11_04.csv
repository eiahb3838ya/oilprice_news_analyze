2018-11-04,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Investors stay focussed on Sino-U.S. trade war talks * Xi Jinping delivers speech later in the day * U.S. mid-term elections on Nov.6 By Swati Pandey SYDNEY, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The British pound jumped to a two-week high on Monday on hopes Britain was inching closer to a smooth Brexit, while Asian stocks will likely have a nervous start amid worries about shaky Sino-U.S. trade relations. With just five months to go until the UK exits the EU, Britain’s divorce talks are at an impasse, fuelling huge uncertainty among businesses and causing the value of sterling to see-saw on any news about a possible breakthrough in the negotiations. A Sunday Times report that an all-UK customs deal will be written into the agreement governing Britain’s withdrawal from the EU was enough to cheer investors who sent the pound to $1.3062, the highest since Oct. 22. The currency has faltered in seven of the 10 months of this year so far, losing as much as 3.6 percent. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s office called the Sunday Times report speculatory but added that 95 percent of the withdrawal agreement was settled and negotiations were ongoing. Elsewhere, investors will keep their eyes peeled for any headline on the Sino-U.S. trade war ahead of a meeting of the leaders of the world’s two biggest economies later this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping delivers a speech at the China International Import Expo later in the day, which could provide further clues on the subject. Markets had climbed early on Friday on hopes the United States and China were mending their relations, but gains faded on news a tariff deal may not be imminent. The outlook for global shares has also been clouded by the prospect of faster rate rises in the United States amid robust economic data in recent months. On Friday, the world’s biggest economy reported solid jobs growth for October, with wages at 9-1/2-year highs, further boosting expectations for a December rate rise. “The U.S. employment report supports our view that the Federal Reserve will raise rates three more times from now until mid-2019,” Capital Economics said in a note. “After that, we suspect that the cumulative effect of monetary policy tightening will start taking a toll on the US economy, forcing the Fed to end its tightening cycle and pulling Treasury yields, the US stock market and the dollar down.” Broadly, trading is expected to be rangebound ahead of U.S. congressional midterm elections on Tuesday. Opinion polls show strong chances that Democrats may win control of the House of Representatives in the elections after two years of wielding no practical political power in Washington, with President Donald Trump’s Republican Party likely to keep the Senate. A Reuters analysis of the past half century shows stocks fared better in the two calendar years after congressional elections when Republicans control Congress and the presidency than when Democrats controlled the two branches, as well as during times of gridlock. In commodities, oil traders will keenly await the outcome of negotiations on possible waivers to U.S. sanctions on Iran. “Any deals allowing oil importers to continue buying from Iran could see prices come under further pressure,” ANZ said in a morning note to clients.

2018-11-04,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar named new heads to its giant state-run energy firm and deep-pocketed sovereign wealth fund on Sunday while appointing the CEO of its largest bank as its new trade minister. It was the first government shuffle in Qatar, the world’s top liquefied natural gas producer, since early 2016, but diplomats and analysts said the changes did not represent a significant shift in power. The wealthy country has been subject to a diplomatic and economic boycott by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt since June 2017. They accuse Qatar of backing terrorism and cozying up to Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty. Qatar’s ruler issued decrees outlining changes to the boards of state gas giant Qatar Petroleum (QP) and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), the world’s ninth largest sovereign wealth fund with about $300 billion in assets. Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani was named chairman of QIA, which injected billions of dollars into Qatari banks last year to offset foreign outflows just after the Arab boycott began. Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad al-Thani, the 30-year-old deputy and brother of the emir, was named chairman of Qatar Petroleum, which expects to ramp up gas production by some 43 percent over the next five to six years. Though limited, the cabinet shuffle pulled in business heavyweights like Qatar National Bank (QNB) CEO Ali Ahmed al-Kuwari, who was appointed to a new portfolio combining commerce and industry under one ministry. Saad al-Kaabi, the chief executive of QP, was named minister of state for energy affairs. New ministers were appointed to  head the departments of justice, of labor and social affairs, and of municipality and environment. Western diplomats and analysts did not see the shake-up as indicative of a shift in policy nearly 18 months since the start of the regional rift, which Qatar has weathered with new trade routes and higher oil prices that have helped it swing to a budgetary surplus this year.    “The cabinet shuffle was expected to come earlier, but was apparently on hold as the country dealt with the blockade and now as the ramifications have been successfully dealt with, it was time,” said Majed al-Ansari, an analyst and professor of political sociology at Qatar University. “It does not signal a change in policy or power shift in the government,” he said.      It was not clear whether Kuwari would retain his post at QNB, the Middle East’s largest lender by assets. The bank, which is 50 percent owned by the country’s sovereign wealth fund, did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. QP’s Al-Kaabi, a U.S.-educated engineer, rose through the ranks to become chief executive in 2014 and also sits on the board of the Qatar Investment Authority.   He has gained a reputation among executives of the world’s energy majors, such as Exxon (XOM.N), Shell (RDSa.L) and Total (TOTF.PA), as a reliable counterpart for energy projects that have made the tiny nation of 2.6 million people the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Abdulla Abdulaziz Al Subaie was appointed minister of municipality and environment, a post seen as key to preparations for the country’s 2022 World Cup. Subaie has served as managing director and CEO of Qatar Rail, which expects to launch Doha’s first metro line this year. A separate decree on Sunday appointed Mohammed Bin Hamad Al-Thani chairman of the Qatar Financial Markets Authority as part of a shuffle of its board of directors.

2018-11-04,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Sunday Israel had asked for consultations on a special land deal agreed in their peace treaty that the Jordanian government wants to end.  Under the peace treaty, two border areas were recognised to be under Jordanian sovereignty but gave Israel special provisions to use the land and allow Israelis free access. Jordan formally notified Israel two weeks ago it would not renew the 25-year deal over Baquora where the Yarmouk River flows into the Jordan River and in the Ghumar area in the southern Wadi Araba desert where Israeli farmers have large plantations. Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi told Reuters after the decision the kingdom was waiting for Israel to invoke a provision in the peace treaty to hold consultations after giving notice before the deadline. Petra state news agency quoted government spokeswoman Jumana Ghunaimat as saying Jordan had received the Israeli request but did not say when the discussions would begin. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged  Jordan’s move and said his country sought to enter negotiations on the possibility of extending the arrangement. The 25-year special regime would be automatically renewed unless either of the parties notified the other a year before expiry that it wished to terminate the agreement. Safadi said the deal, which was signed in November 1994, had been conceived as a temporary arrangement from the start. The kingdom had contemplated the move for a while before the Nov. 10 deadline. King Abdullah, who stressed the territories were Jordanian lands and would remain so, said the move was made in the “national interest” at a period of regional turmoil.  Jordan is one of only two Arab states that has a peace treaty with Israel and the two countries have a long history of close security ties. But the treaty is unpopular in Jordan where  pro-Palestinian sentiment is widespread.

2018-11-04,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Thousands of Iranians chanting “Death to America” rallied on Sunday to mark the anniversary of the seizure of the U.S. Embassy during the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the imminent reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil sector. Students attending the government-organised rally in the capital Tehran, broadcast live by state television, burned the Stars and Stripes, an effigy of Uncle Sam and pictures of President Donald Trump outside the former embassy compound. Hardline students stormed the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979, soon after the fall of the U.S.-backed shah, and 52 Americans were held hostage there for 444 days. The two countries have been enemies ever since. State media said millions turned out for rallies in towns and cities, swearing allegiance to the clerical establishment and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The figure could not be independently confirmed by Reuters. Rallies are staged on the embassy takeover anniversary every year. But rancour is especially strong this time following Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from world powers’ 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and reimpose sanctions on Tehran. The deal brought about the lifting of most international financial and economic sanctions in return for Tehran curbing its disputed nuclear activity under U.N. surveillance. Trump said the deal was weak and favoured Iran. The other signatories - Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China - remain committed to the accord. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the penalties set to return on Monday “are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the Islamic Republic of Iran.” Interviewed on “Fox News Sunday,” Pompeo said, “There’s a handful of places where countries already have made significant reductions in their crude oil exports and need a little more time to get to zero. And we’re going to provide that to them.” He did not elaborate. Pompeo noted that oil sanctions would be coupled with financial sanctions involving “over 600 designations of individuals and companies in Iran.”  The Iranian military said it would launch two days of air defence drills on Monday and assured Iranians that it could neutralise any threats, the state news agency IRNA reported. “We can assure our people that the enemy will not be able to carry out its threats against our country,” IRNA quoted Habibollah Sayyari, the coordinating officer, as saying. Among the anniversary events was an exhibition of cartoons in Tehran called “Donald Salman” - a reference to the close ties between the U.S. president and King Salman, ruler of Iran’s regional rival, Saudi Arabia. “It’s black humour, but the audience can also be brought to reflect on the contradictions in the behaviour of Trump and (the royal house of) Al Saud,” artist Masoud Shojaei Tabatabai told state television in Tehran. The restoration of U.S. sanctions on Monday targeting Iran’s oil sales and banking sector is part of an effort by Trump to force Iran to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes outright, as well as its support for proxy forces in conflicts across the Middle East. In a speech on Saturday, Khamenei said Trump’s policies faced opposition around the world. “America’s goal has been to re-establish the domination it had, but it has failed. America has been defeated by the Islamic Republic over the past 40 years,” he said.

2018-11-04,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will tender off 19 new offshore blocks to oil and gas companies, its energy ministry said on Sunday, hoping to rebound from a disappointing bidding round a year ago. Israel discovered in 2009 that it had large reserves of natural gas off its Mediterranean coast. It will publish details of the tender by the end of the month and, about half a year later, choose the winning companies, said Udi Adiri, the ministry’s director general. Last year’s auction elicited bids from only two groups of companies, and the ministry said it expects more to compete this time as conditions have improved. In 2017 the energy market was weaker and companies in general were investing less. There was also concern over where to sell any newfound gas, since Israel is a small market. “There is strong interest in this tender, certainly compared to the previous round,” Adiri said. The 19 blocks have been divvied up into four sectors that benefit from more comprehensive geological studies than last time, he said. Israel has also signed major export deals with Jordan and Egypt over the past two years, opening new markets to companies looking to sell gas from Israel. Adiri further said conditions in the global energy market had improved with companies more willing to make investments. The exploration licenses will be for three years, with options to extend up to four more years, should terms be met. There have been seven natural gas discoveries in Israeli waters, though not all have been developed. The Tamar field has been producing gas since 2013 and the huge Leviathan project, as well as two smaller fields, are expected to come online in the next few years. Last year Israel received bids from Energean (ENOG.L) and a consortium of Indian firms including ONGC Videsh ONVI.BO, Bharat PetroResources (BPCL.NS), Indian Oil Corp (IOC.NS) and Oil India (OILI.NS).

2018-11-04,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey will not allow the exploitation of gas reserves in Turkish and north Cypriot waters of the eastern Mediterranean, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday. The eastern Mediterranean is believed to be rich in natural gas, and attempts to tap resources there have revived tensions between Turkey and Greece, which has a defence protection pact with the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government. Turkey and Cyprus have overlapping claims of marine jurisdiction and both plan to carry out exploratory drills this year. Ankara only has diplomatic relations with a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the island that is not recognised by other countries.  Speaking at a ceremony to mark the delivery of a naval corvette and submarine, Erdogan said countries that thought they could operate in the east Mediterranean or Aegean seas without Ankara’s agreement were mistaken. “We will not accept attempts to extract natural resources in our country, Cyprus or in the eastern Mediterranean,” Erdogan said. Last month Turkey complained that a Greek frigate had harassed a Turkish exploration ship west of Cyprus. Greece denied the charge and Cyprus accused Turkey of stirring up tensions. Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Ankara, says any offshore wealth also belongs to its citizens, as partners in the establishment of the Cyprus republic in 1960. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup.

Thousands of students in the government-organised rally in the capital Tehran, broadcast live by state television, burned the Stars and Stripes, an effigy of Uncle Sam and pictures of President Donald Trump outside the leafy downtown compound that once housed the U.S. mission. Hardline students stormed the embassy on Nov. 4, 1979 soon after the fall of the U.S.-backed Shah, and 52 Americans were held hostage there for 444 days. The two countries have been enemies, on opposite sides of Middle East conflict, ever since. Iranian state media said millions turned out for rallies in most cities and towns around the country, swearing allegiance to the clerical establishment and its hardline top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The turnout figure could not be independently confirmed by Reuters. Rallies replete with “Death to America” chants are staged on the embassy takeover anniversary every year.

But America’s plots and its plans for sanctions will be defeated through continued resistance,” said Jafari.

2018-11-04,"(Repeats story that moved on Friday; no changes to text) * Iranians expect price rises of daily essentials * Scramble to get by has become harder since August * Curbs target oil and banking sectors * Defiant Iran leaders vow no policy By Parisa Hafezi and Tuqa Khalid DUBAI, Nov 2 (Reuters) - Iranians fear an even more painful squeeze on living costs     after additional U.S. sanctions take effect on Monday, from businesses struggling to buy raw materials to the sick and elderly unable to afford life-saving medicines. The United States will reapply curbs to the country’s vital petroleum and banking sectors on Monday in an effort to rein in its arch foe’s nuclear, missile and regional activities. Iran’s clerical rulers have played down the U.S. move, but many ordinary Iranians appear apprehensive. “All the prices are going higher every day ... I cannot imagine what will happen after 13 Aban (Nov. 4). I am scared. I am worried. I am desperate,” said elementary school teacher Pejman Sarafnejad, 43, a father of three in Tehran. “I cannot even buy rice to feed my children or pay my rent.” The daily struggle to make ends meet has been getting harder for months: The economy was battered by the reimposition of a first raft of U.S. curbs in August after Washington’s pullout from a nuclear deal between Tehran and global powers in May. Foreign businesses of all types, ranging from oil companies, trading houses to shipping, have stopped doing business with Iran for fear of incurring U.S. penalties. A Tehran Grand bazaar grocery shop owner said: “I am very nervous because already there is shortage of some goods in the market and the rial has lost so much value. “What will happen after the reimposition of new sanctions?” Iran’s leadership says Tehran will not succumb to pressure to halt its missile programmes or to change its regional policy. Yet while some Iranians back their leaders’ defiance, others are fearful that the economy, weakened by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption, may collapse when the U.S. puts more pressure on the world’s Number 3 crude exporter. “Statements by government officials that ... the sanctions (will) have no impact are political slogans,” said Washington-based lawyer Farhad Alavi, who focuses on U.S. trade regulation and sanctions. “The fact is that these restrictions significantly increase transaction costs for Iranians.” Since the reimposition of the first round of curbs in August, prices of bread, cooking oil and other staples have soared and the rial national currency has fallen sharply. Rice, one of the staples of Iran’s diet, has more than tripled in price since last year because of the rial’s fall. Ordinary Iranians fear cuts in Iran’s oil sales could be the ultimate hammer blow to the economy, since energy exports are still the country’s main source of earnings. Iranian leaders hope sanctions waivers granted to eight buyers of Iranian crude, combined with rising oil prices, will compensate for a reduction oil export volumes. But even without the new measures due on Monday, Iranian businessmen have been finding it harder to cope. Some 70 percent of small factories, businesses and workshops have already started to shut down in the past months due to lack of raw materials and hard currency, according to Iranian media. “I had to close my business. Those European companies that were racing to ink a deal with me last year, now refuse to return my calls,” said a businessman in Tehran, who declined to be named. Mohammad Reza Sadoughi says ordinary people will bear the brunt of the sanctions, in terms of medicines for the sick such as cancer patients and food shortages and currency problems. “My father has cancer, and with sanctions, the cancer-treatment medicine that his life depends on will only be available in the black market for a higher price,” said the 38-year-old government employee in the northern city of Sari. The U.S. sanctions permits trade in humanitarian goods such as food and pharmaceuticals. Yet measures imposed on banks and trade restrictions will make life hard for Iranian patients. “At the end of the day, it’s the Iranian people with their aspiration to lead a good life who are suffering due to lack of good sense from their own regime who are not ready to compromise with the world power (U.S.),” said Dubai-based businessman Aftab Hasan, a member of the Iranian Business Council in Dubai. However analysts say that economic grievances are unlikely to revive anti-government unrest such as the demonstrations in December that turned into anti-government rallies. “I don’t care about politics. I don’t care who is responsible for our problems. I don’t want a regime change. I just want to live peacefully with my family in my country,” said housewife Fariba Shakouri, 51, in the central city of Yazd.

2018-11-04,"(Reuters) - The oil market’s two-year bull run is running into one of its biggest tests in months, facing a tidal wave of supply and growing worries about economic weakness sapping demand worldwide.  After topping out at more than $75 and $85 a barrel just a month ago, both U.S. crude and Brent benchmark futures have grappled with near-relentless selling. For a time, prices had some support on hopes that renewed U.S. sanctions on Iran would force barrels off the market.  That changed in the last week. The world’s three largest producers - Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States - all indicated they were pumping at record or near-record levels, while the United States said it would allow waivers that could allow buyers to keep importing Iranian oil, lessening the threat of a supply crunch.  Those factors, along with a spate of recent weak economic reports out of China and other emerging markets, have shifted the conversation back towards worries about oversupply, and pushed U.S. futures to lows not seen since April, interrupting an upward move that had consistently found support during the rally’s modest pullbacks. The structure of the U.S. crude futures curve had for several months indicated expectations for tighter supply, but future-dated contracts now suggest investors think markets could be awash in oil over the coming months. “The magnitude of recent selling is strongly suggesting that global oil demand is weaker than expected as a result of tariff issues, especially between the U.S. and China,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates.  There has been an exodus among speculators as well. In the last two weeks, net bullish bets on oil have declined to the lowest level in over a year. Selling notably accelerated on Thursday after U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures fell below $65 a barrel, a level that had stood firm in previous selloffs during the summer and fall.  The oil market ran higher in anticipation of this week’s formal re-imposition of sanctions against Iran by the United States, and on concerns that supply from producers like Saudi Arabia would not be able to make up the difference.  For graphic on Russian, U.S. & Saudi crude oil production, click on tmsnrt.rs/2CTwqaq However, the U.S. government said on Friday it will temporarily allow several countries including South Korea and Turkey to keep importing Iranian oil when U.S. sanctions come back into force on Monday, sparing them for now from the threat of U.S. economic penalties. Still, some analysts believe the current selloff has come too far, too quickly. Major OPEC producers won’t be able to add more supply should it become necessary, particularly with production in Iran, Venezuela and Libya still at risk.       “A loss of 1 million bpd from Iran, further declines in Venezuela, coupled together with geopolitical disruption in Libya and Nigeria could easily wipe out what little spare capacity we have left,” Bernstein analysts said this week.  Output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, led by Saudi Arabia, rose to levels not seen in two years. U.S. production hit a record 11.3 million barrels a day in August, and Russia’s output rose to 11.4 million bpd, a post-Soviet era peak.  For U.S. crude, the key area to watch is between $64.45 and $64.80, where prices had found support in the past, said Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com. If oil dips below this point, “the path of least resistance would be to the downside,” he said. For Brent, Razaqzada is watching the range between $69.50 and $69.60 a barrel, and if it were to slip below that, we could see a much larger correction, he said.
