2018-10-14,"(Reuters) - The United States is seeking “regime change” in Iran, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, adding that the current U.S. administration is the most hostile that the Islamic Republic has faced in its four decades. Tensions have increased between Iran and America after U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from a multi-lateral agreement on Iran’s nuclear programme in May, saying it was flawed because it did not include curbs on Iran’s ballistic missiles programme or its support for proxies in Syria, Yemen, Lebanon and Iraq. “In the past 40 years there has not been a more spiteful team than the current U.S. government team towards Iran, Iranians and the Islamic Republic,” Rouhani said in a speech broadcast on state TV.  “There was a time when there was one person who had enmity. The rest were moderate. Now ... the worst have gathered around each other,” he added in a speech marking the beginning of the academic year at Tehran University.  In Washington, a U.S. State Department spokesman repeated its position that it wants a change in Iran’s behaviour but “the United States is not seeking regime change.” He said Trump has voiced a willingness to enter into talks with Iran and wants a deal that also covers its missile programme, support for terrorism and “malign regional behaviour.” “Our hope is that ultimately the regime will make meaningful changes in its behaviour,” he added. Rouhani accused the Americans of using psychological and economic warfare and questioning the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic. “Reducing the legitimacy of the system is their final goal. When they say getting rid of, regime change in their own words, how does regime change happen? Through reducing legitimacy, otherwise a regime doesn’t change,”  He used the English phrase “regime change” to emphasise his point. Washington reintroduced steps against Iran’s currency trade, metals and auto sectors in August.  With U.S. curbs on Iran’s oil exports set to come into force next month, some Iranians fear their country is entering an economic slump that may prove worse than the period from 2012 to 2015, when it last faced major sanctions. Vice-president Eshaq Jahangiri played down the impact of the planned restrictions. Iran has been able to find new partners  to buy its oil even though some countries have stopped purchases, Jahangiri said on Sunday, according to Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB). “America will certainly not be able to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero,” he said.  “America thinks Saudi Arabia can replace this oil. But right now Iran’s oil has reached more than $80 and with half the previous exports we will have the same income as before,” he added on comments on the IRIB website.

2018-10-14,"(Adds details, background) * No oil imports from Iran in Sept, 1st time since Sept. 2012 * Jan-Sept Iran crude imports fall 49.1 pct y/y to 7.15 mln tonnes * Total Sept crude imports at 10.83 mln tonnes, down 11.8 pct y/y By Jane Chung SEOUL, Oct 15 (Reuters) - South Korea did not imported any oil from Iran in September for the first time in six years, before U.S. sanctions against the Middle East country take effect in November, customs data showed on Monday. The last time South Korea did not import oil from Iran was September 2012, according to customs data. South Korean buyers, among major Asian buyers of Iranian oil, suspended Iranian oil loading from July due to the uncertainty of getting a waiver from the U.S. government. The South Korean government has been in talks with the U.S. government to get exemptions on Iran crude imports. During the previous rounds of sanctions from 2012 to 2015, South Korea could buy Iranian oil by capping its Iranian oil imports volume. A U.S government official said in early October that the U.S. government was actively considering waivers on sanctions for countries that are lowering their imports of Iranian oil. Oil imports from Iran have declined for the past months. In the first nine months of the year, South Korea’s imports of Iranian oil dropped 49.1 percent to 7.15 million tonnes, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the data. In total, the world’s fifth-largest crude buyer, imported 10.83 million tonnes of crude oil in September, down 11.8 percent from 12.28 million tonnes a year earlier. Imports from Saudi Arabia, South Korea’s top crude supplier, were 3.41 million tonnes in September, down 6.9 percent from 3.67 million tonnes a year earlier. Meanwhile, South Korea’s imports of U.S. crude increased five-fold to 668,704 tonnes in September from 131,125 tonnes last year, the data showed. In the January-September period of the year, 110.45 million tonnes of crude oil, were imported into South Korea, nearly unchanged from 110.44 million tonnes over the same period last year. State-run Korea National Oil Corp (KNOC) will release South Korea’s final September crude oil imports data later this month.

2018-10-14,"MANILA, Oct 14 (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Sunday it would suspend the implementation of a further increase in excise tax on fuel products, set to take effect in January 2019, to stem rising inflation expectations. Inflation in one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies has been rising since January, due to higher taxes, costlier food and fuel and a weak peso, causing a decline in President Rodrigo Duterte’s popularity. The Department of Finance (DOF) expects foregone revenues of up to 40 billion pesos ($740 million) a year from the suspension. That amount is part of the crucial funding for Duterte’s $180 billion “Build, Build, Build” programme, which aims to upgrade the country’s infrastructure. Under the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law, the excise tax on fuel products is to be gradually increased between 2018 and 2020, with the first hike implemented in January and the second to take effect on Jan. 1 next year. The law allows for the suspension of the second hike if the average price of Dubai crude, based on Mean of Platts Singapore, reaches or exceeds $80 per barrel from October to December 2018. “The President is making an early announcement of the temporary suspension of the January 2019 oil excise increase” ahead of the trigger, the Department of Finance said in a statement. “Today’s price and multiple estimates of crude prices over the next two months show that the average price will stay above the $80 threshold,” it said. The government expects the tax hike suspension to help tame inflation, which quickened to 6.7 percent in September, the fastest in nearly a decade and marking the seventh straight month the rate stayed outside the 2-4 percent target this year. Higher inflation and expectations that it will remain elevated in the last quarter prompted the central bank to tighten monetary policy by hiking key interest rates. The central bank, which has two more policy meetings this year, expects inflation to return to within its 2-4 percent target next year.

2018-10-14,"KAMAKO, Democratic Republic of Congo/LUANDA (Reuters) - Congolese migrants and officials said dozens of people were killed this month in neighbouring Angola in a crackdown on artisanal diamond mining, an accusation Angolan security forces strongly denied. Angola, the world’s fifth largest diamond producer, has launched an operation in recent weeks to clear tens of thousands of people involved in digging for precious stones in the northeast of the country in order to attract more private investment. Many of them are from neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and hundreds of thousands of people have poured over the border into the Kasai region, border guards there told Reuters. In interviews with Reuters, more than 20 Congolese migrants who crossed the border between October 4-12 described violence, looting and forced displacement by Angolan security forces as well as a local tribe called the Tshokwe. The worse of the violence, they said, occurred in the town of Lucapa, located some 100 km south of the border with DRC in the heart of the diamond-rich Lunda Norte province. Angolan security forces stormed the town, according to 15 witnesses, killing dozens of people, burning down homes, looting property and forcing people to leave. Some of those people were legally residing in Angola, the witnesses added. “There was a lot of violence in Lucapa. The military was shooting at us while Tshowke were killing people with machetes. They jointly killed more than a dozen people,” said Victor Tshambapoko, 28, who worked as a diamond digger in the region. Reuters could not independently verify the accusations. Angolan Police Commissioner Antonio Bernardo, spokesman for the operation, denied there had been rights abuses by security forces, and said the only fatality he knew of was in a traffic accident. “We have no record of any burning of homes, much less reprisals and or assaults on anyone,” he told Reuters. “Angola and its government appeals to the common sense of the international community to realize that there is no underlying xenophobia, but only the legitimate normalizing of the socio-economic life of the country and national security.” Amadhou Kabaseke Taty, Kasai’s provincial director of the Congolese border agency (DGM) told Reuters that he believed there had been “serious violations of human rights” during the Angolan operation. “I am worried about the situation,” he said. “Congolese people have been expelled in degrading conditions. They have been molested, beaten and killed, especially in Lucapa, by the Angolan military police.” Angolan President Joao Lourenco is trying to boost investments in his country and wean it off a heavy reliance on oil exports. Reforming the diamond industry is part of that drive, and “Operation Transparency” in Lunda Norte aims to reduce diamond smuggling and raise more revenues for state coffers from the lucrative sector. Several Congolese migrants who entered from Angola in recent days said the authorities there had given them an Oct. 15 deadline to leave. Border guard officials said the Angolan operation began on Oct. 1. According to an internal DGM document seen by Reuters, 200,000 people crossed into Kasai region from Angola in the first 12 days of October. Border officials believe the true figure is higher because people also cross through the bush rather than checkpoints. The need to resettle so many people threatens to further destabilise Kasai, a region which saw widespread violence involving armed groups and government forces in 2016 and 2017. Security sources in DRC and Angola have already said they are concerned about heightened tensions in the area in the run-up to Congolese elections in December. A Reuters reporter in the Congolese border town of Kamako saw thousands of people making their way on foot and in trucks along the red dirt road to Tshikapa, the provincial capital of Kasai located some 50 km to the north. Exhausted men and women rested by the side of the road, washed in a river or picked fruit from giant mango trees to feed themselves on a journey that lasts up to a week. Many carried household belongings on their head, including plastic chairs, mattresses, animals and even ovens. Some said they also had diamonds in their possession.

2018-10-14,"LISBON (Reuters) - At least 300,000 homes were without power on Sunday after tropical storm Leslie hit Portugal’s Atlantic coast, bringing with it heavy rain, strong winds and surging seas. Leslie was downgraded from a hurricane before it reached Portugal late on Saturday. Authorities had urged people to stay indoors and keep away from coastal areas. At least 1,000 trees were uprooted, mainly in coastal towns north of Lisbon where the storm first reached land, hitting power lines and blocking roads.  The A1, the main motorway running through Portugal, was temporarily blocked by a fallen tree, authorities said. More than 300,000 homes lost electricity as the storm passed, said Belo Costa, commander at the Civil Protection Agency. The storm, carrying winds of up 100 km/h (60 mph), was most intense during the night. By Sunday morning the powerful winds and heavy rains had mostly subsided. In Spain, winds of up to 100 km/h uprooted trees in the centre of the country early on Sunday morning. Emergency services issued flood warnings for the north and northwest of the country for Sunday afternoon and evening, advising Spaniards to avoid driving in the storm.

2018-10-14,"(Repeats story that ran Friday) * U.S. has imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese products * Trade war complicates China’s already weakening growth outlook * Three-week Canton Fair in Guangzhou to kick off on Monday By Ryan Woo BEIJING, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Amid gathering gloom over the state of the Chinese economy, exporters of motorcycles, tractors, photocopiers and Christmas tree lighting will join thousands of other companies peddling their wares at China’s largest trade fair Monday. Many of those exporters will have something in common - uncertainty over future U.S. orders as a trade war with the United States rages. The turmoil has added to concerns over the health of the Chinese economy, already under pressure from a cooling property market, a crackdown on corporate debt and risky lending practices, and a nationwide anti-pollution campaign. The United States over the summer levied tariffs of up to 25 percent on $250 billion of Chinese goods as punishment for what it says are unfair trade practices by China. The latest tariff salvo represented half of the $500 billion of products that the United States bought from China last year. The rapid escalation of the trade dispute has taken many Chinese exporters by surprise. At the spring session of the twice-a-year Canton Fair in Guangzhou, only a quarter of the exporters whom Reuters spoke to said they expected a full-blown trade war. As exporters gather at the autumn session of the three-week gathering that starts Monday, a far more sombre outlook is expected to pervade the tens of thousands of exhibition booths at the fair. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs on more Chinese imports in an intensifying trade war that has led many forecasters, including the International Monetary Fund, to cut their global economic projections for 2018 and 2019. Beijing has been urging Chinese exporters to diversify their overseas destinations and rely less on the United States - China’s biggest trading partner - or turn their focus to domestic customers instead. “Our existing U.S. orders are relatively stable, but our U.S. clients are not increasing their orders,” said an official at a Guangzhou-based battery maker, one of many facing higher U.S. tariffs on Chinese batteries. “We’re keeping prices stable and swallowing the tariffs ourselves,” the official said. As export-reliant cities and provinces like Guangdong show the strain, policymakers are increasingly rolling out measures to help businesses weather the trade storm. The central bank has cut the amount of cash that commercial banks need to set aside as reserves four times this year to spur lending to small businesses. The finance ministry has reduced taxes and increased tax rebates to help lower the overheads of businesses. Billion-dollar infrastructure projects have been put on the fast track to stimulate growth. The authorities, while saying they will not resort to competitive devaluation of China’s currency to boost exports, have allowed the yuan to fall about 6 percent against the dollar this year. Overall Chinese exports have been mostly resilient, with data Friday showing that September shipments soared 14.5 percent year-on-year, far exceeding expectations for an 8.9 percent uptick. The trade war with the United States is complicating an already weakening picture of growth in China this year. Beijing has set a GDP growth target of around 6.5 percent for 2018. The economy expanded 6.9 percent last year. Growth has been slowing as China sheds excess production capacity and shuts polluting factories, with fixed asset investment slumping this year and monthly industrial output growth stuck in a relatively low range of 6-7 percent. Meanwhile, curbs and restrictions put in place to fend off property speculators have resulted in a slowdown in the residential real estate market, hitting construction and other related sectors. The impact of a multi-year crackdown on corporate debt levels and risky lending practices has also become more apparent. Private firms are warning about tighter financing as their access to shadow financing - a cheaper source of funds than bank loans - shrinks. Annual growth in outstanding total social financing, a broad gauge of credit that includes off-balance sheet financing, slowed to 10.1 percent in August, the lowest on record. As businesses struggle or even go belly-up, domestic consumption, a driver of the economy, has started to moderate. Monthly growth in retail sales, one gauge of China’s consumption, dipped below 10 percent in April where they have remained since. The last time retail sales grew less than 10 percent was over a decade ago. Automobile sales fell for the third straight month in September, down 11.6 percent from a year earlier, as worries about the economy prompted consumers to tighten their purse-strings and forego big-ticket purchases. WAIT-AND-SEE The state-controlled media has so far played up China’s capability to tackle both internal and external challenges, including the trade war, saying there are ample policy tools available to keep growth on an even footing. “The impact of the trade war is not too obvious yet because the U.S. tariffs have not filtered down to some sectors yet,” said Joe Chung, owner of a ceramic tile manufacturer in Guangdong. “The worry is not just about the United States. With exports to the U.S. slowing, there will be increased competition for other overseas markets,” Chung said, predicting tough times over the next two years. Ceramic floor materials are on the U.S. tariff hit-list. Chinese exporters of goods not yet on any U.S. tariff retaliation list vary, including products like toys, sewing machines and wigs. China’s foreign trade growth may slow in the fourth quarter, the country’s customs agency said on Friday.
