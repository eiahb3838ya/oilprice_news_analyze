2018-11-16,"(Reuters) - The chief of California’s top utilities regulator said on Friday he was shocked to learn that reassurances he made to investors about PG&E (PCG.N) caused the embattled power utility’s stock to surge over 40 percent in a matter of minutes. PG&E’s stock had slumped over 60 percent since the state’s deadliest-ever wildfire broke out last week on fears that without help from California’s government, the utility could go bankrupt should it eventually be found responsible. The fire destroyed the town of Paradise and has killed at least 63 people. California Public Utilities Commission President Michael Picker told Reuters on Friday that utilities must be able to borrow money cheaply in order to properly serve ratepayers. That echoed comments he made on an investor conference call organized by Bank of America on Thursday, when he said he could not imagine allowing the state’s largest utility to go into bankruptcy. Picker was surprised hours later on Thursday to learn that PG&E’s stock had surged over 40 percent in extended trading in reaction to his comments. “I was stunned and terrified,” Picker said. “I left the call yesterday and I went back to a workshop I was in, so I didn’t find out about it until several hours later.” Picker’s market-moving remarks to a private group were unusual, in part because public companies and their executives must follow federal rules aimed at avoiding selective disclosure of material news, but a government official or other outside parties sharing an outlook on a public company does not face the same obligations, experts say. PG&E shares on Friday closed up 37.54 percent at $24.40 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is still down about 50 percent from before the fire started, erasing nearly $13 billion in market capitalization. The cause of the Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise remains under investigation. With PG&E potentially facing mounting costs from wildfires, the regulator would also consider potential options to restructure the company, including separating its electricity and gas units, Picker told Reuters. Keeping Wall Street interested in investing in PG&E and other California utilities is key to reducing the state’s carbon emissions and making the power system more efficient, he said. “I don’t think we over-reward people. ... But we want to make sure that we can continue to keep the lights on, and be cleaner and cleaner, and ideally more reliable.” GRAPHIC: PG&E shares surge after Thursday's close on utility regulator's comments - tmsnrt.rs/2QNMYF1 California state Senator Bill Dodd told Reuters it was “too soon” to speculate about future legislation that might provide relief to PG&E in case it is found liable for the Camp Fire. Dodd sponsored legislation passed this year that lets utilities pass some of the costs related to liability from wildfires on to ratepayers, but the bill did not specifically provide for 2018. GRAPHIC: Fire Fear - tmsnrt.rs/2PyMu9a Citigroup on Friday upgraded PG&E’s stock to “buy” from “neutral.”  “Given the reaction in the stock market, we think there was an appropriate level of urgency that something needed to be done,” Citigroup analysts wrote, referring to the regulator’s statement.  The price for PG&E’s more than $18 billion of bonds also rose. The price of the March 2034 694308GE1= bond was up about 5 points in afternoon trading after earlier trading as much as 11 points higher. PG&E’s debt was pressured earlier this week after the utility borrowed $3.3 billion under its credit lines and warned it could face liabilities in excess of its insurance coverage should its equipment be found to have caused the fire. The gains in bond prices came even after both Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s cut their credit ratings on PG&E late Thursday to just one notch above junk bond territory and said the outlook remained negative.  Fitch Ratings on Friday also downgraded the utility’s long-term issuer default ratings. With the collapse in its bond prices this week, most of PG&E’s bonds were trading as though they were already speculative-grade securities, although Friday’s recovery brought many of them back in line with comparably low-investment-grade-rated corporate bonds. PG&E has about $500 million of floating rate notes maturing in two weeks and does not face another maturing security until October 2020.  That October 2020 $800 million bond, with a 3.5 percent coupon 694308GT8=RRPS, yielded more than 10 percent at one point in trading on Thursday, the first of PG&E’s securities to have breached that threshold. On Friday, the October 2020 note was up more than 4 points to 95.25 cents on the dollar, with the yield dropping to 6.24 percent. Shares of Edison International (EIX.N), whose Southern California Edison subsidiary provides power in Southern California, jumped 15 percent. While investors view it as at less risk than PG&E to massive liabilities from wildfires, its stock has been volatile over the past week as a second fire burned in that region. The Woolsey Fire in Southern California also remains under investigation.   The volatility in PG&E shares has drawn a rush of trading in options. Traders are betting the stock will remain prone to wild gyrations in the near term.

2018-11-16,"HOUSTON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - BP Plc’s trading arm on Friday entered a tolling agreement with the owners of an idled oil refinery in St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands, cementing plans to bring the plant back online six years after it was idled by previous owners, the company said. Under BP’s tolling agreement with Limetree Bay Refining LLC, owner of the idled Hovensa refinery, BP will supply the facility with crude and sell its products, low-sulfur fuels that will meet an International Maritime Organization mandate in 2020, it said in a statement. BP declined to comment further. Limetree did not respond to requests for comment. Limetree, owned by private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC, is investing $1.5 billion to bring the Hovensa refinery, one of the largest such facilities in the world, back online by late 2019, with plans to process 200,000 barrels per day (bpd). It aims to produce low-sulfur fuels that satisfy the International Maritime Organization rule calling for large vessels to switch by 2020 to fuels containing no more than 0.5 percent sulfur from 3.5 percent. The rule is widely expected to spur new demand for the distillates the refinery would produce. Limetree’s facility has more than 1,100 construction workers on site and has brought online 25 million barrels of crude storage capacity.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil ended slightly firmer after volatile trading on Friday, supported by expectations that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would agree to cut output next month, though prices fell for the sixth straight week amid global oversupply concerns. OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia is keen for the major producers to cut output by about 1.4 million barrels per day, around 1.5 percent of global supply, to support the market, sources told Reuters this week. But other producers, including Russia, have been reluctant to agree to a cut.   Brent LCOc1 settled up 14 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $66.76 a barrel. The global benchmark fell 4.6 percent in the week, the sixth consecutive decline.  U.S. crude CLc1 settled unchanged at $56.46 a barrel after trading between $55.89 and $57.96. The contract, which had its steepest one-day loss in more than three years on Tuesday, fell 5.6 percent in the week, also its sixth straight weekly decline.  After Tuesday’s sharp fall, the market was due for a slight correction, and was now stabilizing, said Tariq Zahir, managing member at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.  “A relief rally was in the cards,” said Bob Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho in New York. OPEC is likely to be spurred to action as U.S. production continues to climb, he said.  Still, the day’s gains were likely to be limited as traders were cautious going into the weekend, he said. “It would take a brave soul to go home really long this weekend considering the slaughter we’ve had in the past eight weeks.”  OPEC ministers meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna to decide on production policy for the next six months amid a growing surplus in world markets. U.S. crude production C-OUT-T-EIA reached another record last week, at 11.7 million barrels per day, government data showed. The record output contributed to the biggest weekly build in U.S. crude stockpiles C-STK-T-EIA in nearly two years. U.S. drillers added two oil rigs this week, bringing the total count to 888, still the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report . RIG-OL-USA-BHI The rig count is seen as an indicator of future production growth. The United States imposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports this month and Iranian crude exports have fallen sharply in recent months, although Washington cushioned the blow by granting some temporary exemptions. Other oil producers have more than compensated for the lost Iranian oil and most analysts now see a significant supply surplus with inventories building, putting pressure on prices. Fearing a repeat of the 2014 price rout, OPEC is widely expected to start trimming output soon. This could produce a swift price rebound, some analysts say, especially if production falls further in Venezuela and Libya. “We are likely from December onwards to have at least 1 million barrels per day (bpd) less of (Iranian) crude exports,” Harry Tchilinguirian, global head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, told Reuters Global Oil Forum. Tchilinguirian said he would not be surprised if Brent recovered to $80 this year. Also supporting prices, Iraq resumed exporting oil from its northern Kirkuk oilfields on Friday, pumping 50,000-100,000 bpd, an oil ministry spokesman said. Some analysts had expected the volumes to be much higher, at closer to 300,000 bpd.     Hedge funds and other money managers cut their bullish wagers on U.S. crude futures and options in New York and London during the week ended Nov. 13 by 8,259 contracts to 165,121, the lowest since June 27, 2017, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said. Brent speculators on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) cut net longs by 45,216 contracts to 214,832 in the week, also the lowest since June 27, 2017.

2018-11-16,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar weakened and Treasury yields slid on Friday after a top Federal Reserve official said U.S. interest rates were near a neutral rate, while the S&P 500 ended positive after a seesaw session helped by optimism over U.S.-China trade ties.  Oil prices steadied but still posted their sixth straight week of losses. Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union clouded currency and other markets. Markets were shaken by comments made by Richard Clarida, newly appointed Fed vice chair, in a CNBC interview that U.S. interest rates were nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, and being at neutral “makes sense.”     He also said there was “some evidence of global slowing.” While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December, the number of hikes next year is a matter of debate. “The big driver right now is Fed speech,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. “Clarida indicated a modestly dovish bent on Fed policy, and not a particularly aggressive stance.” On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 123.95 points, or 0.49 percent, to 25,413.22, the S&P 500 gained 5.94 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,736.14 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 11.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 7,247.87. Clarida’s comments helped support stocks, which were also boosted by comments from President Donald Trump on trade.  Trump said he may not impose more tariffs on Chinese goods after Beijing sent the United States a list of measures it was willing to take to resolve trade tensions. “The market is paying attention very closely to anything surrounding trade,” said Veronica Willis, investment strategy analyst at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. “(A trade deal) would boost expectations for global growth, which would ultimately be good for stocks.” Investors are pointing toward the G20 meeting later this month, when leaders from the United States and China are expected to meet, and the Fed’s meeting in December as key events for markets. Weighing on equity sentiment and the Nasdaq was a disappointing forecast by chip company Nvidia Corp. Nvidia shares tumbled 18.8 percent while the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.2 percent. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.35 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.20 percent as traders waited on more clarity involving Britain’s exit from the EU, known as Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of the most prominent Brexiteer in her government as she fought to save a draft EU divorce deal that has stirred up a plot to force her out of her job. After tumbling a day earlier, sterling was last trading at $1.2825, up 0.40 percent, while the euro was  up 0.78 percent to $1.1414. “Sterling volatility has woken up from its 100-year slumber and is likely to remain reactive,” said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, FX strategist at Commerzbank.

2018-11-16,"* Kirkuk exports had been halted since October 2017 * Iraq took over Kirkuk after failed Kurdish independence vote * Washington was pressing Baghdad, Erbil to find compromise * Current flows still modest, not clear when will rise (Adds U.S. State Department comment) By Dmitry Zhdannikov and Ahmed Rasheed LONDON/BAGHDAD, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Iraq on Friday restarted exports of Kirkuk oil, halted a year ago due to a standoff between the central government and Kurdistan’s semi-autonomous region, after a new government in Baghdad agreed a tentative deal with Erbil. The development is a win for the U.S. government, which has been urging both sides to settle the dispute and resume flows to help address a shortage of Iranian crude in the region after Washington imposed new sanctions on Tehran. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Twitter that resumption of exports of Kirkuk oil was “another important step in our efforts to reduce Iran’s oil exports.” Flows resumed at a modest level of around 50,000-60,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with a peak of 300,000 bpd seen last year and it was not clear when and by how much they would rise, industry sources said. The Kirkuk crude is being exported to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan by a pipeline crossing Kurdistan. A spokesman for Iraq’s Oil Ministry, Asim Jihad, confirmed exports had restarted, adding that an agreement had been reached to resume flows at 50,000-100,000 bpd. “The resumption of Kirkuk shipments of between 50,000 and 100,000 barrels per day will not add to Iraq’s total exports,” Jihad said. Oil prices rose, with Brent crude up more than $1 per barrel, supported partially by the lower-than-expected flows from Kurdistan. The deal signals that new Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi and Oil Minister Thamir Ghadhban are ready to work with Erbil despite previous tensions and a failed independence referendum in September 2017. The halting of exports from Kirkuk in October 2017 stopped almost 300,000 bpd flowing out of Iraq towards Turkey and international markets - causing a net revenue loss of some $8 billion over the past year. Most of Iraq’s exports come from southern fields, but Kirkuk is one of the biggest and oldest oilfields in the Middle East, estimated to contain 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil. Exports had been on hold since Iraqi government forces retook Kirkuk from Kurdish authorities in 2017. The Kurds had taken control of Kirkuk and its oilfields after Islamic State militants drove the Iraqi army out in 2014, and Kurdish forces, in turn, ejected the militants. A pipeline Baghdad once used for export via Turkey was wrecked by Islamic State - leaving only one working. Kurdistan is producing and exporting some 400,000 bpd via the pipeline. Resumed flows from Kirkuk will lift this to 450,000-500,000 bpd, but short of the 700,000 bpd the Kurdish region had exported at some point last year. Iraqi authorities say they still need to feed local refineries, where Kirkuk’s output has been diverted over the past year. The refineries are set to receive some 185,000 bpd under the latest deal, the sources said. Baghdad and Erbil have yet to find a compromise over maximum flow levels as well as budget transfers from the central government to Erbil - something the two sides have struggled to agree on for many years.

2018-11-16,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate the acting head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, to take on the position permanently.  Wheeler, a long-time Washington insider known to shun the spotlight, took the reins at the EPA in July after former Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned. Pruitt faced a slew of ethics controversies that included his first-class travel, round-the-clock security detail, and expensive office equipment. Wheeler has done a “fantastic job, and I want to congratulate him,” Trump said as he announced his decision during a Medal of Freedom ceremony at the White House. He had previously hinted that Wheeler might be nominated. Trump will have to formally nominate Wheeler and then the U.S. Senate will vote on his confirmation, an expected outcome as the chamber is led by Trump’s fellow Republicans. In Wheeler, Trump has seen another avid supporter of his deregulatory agenda and advocate for the fossil fuels industry, but without the constant criticism over alleged mismanagement that had plagued Pruitt. Wheeler had worked at the EPA in the 1990s and later in the Senate under Republican Senator Jim Inhofe, a skeptic of mainstream climate science, before moving to the private sector as a lobbyist and consultant. He has said that he is “not at all ashamed” of his lobbying for the coal company Murray Energy Corp, the focus of criticism by environmentalists. Wheeler had also lobbied for utility Xcel Energy Inc and consulted for biofuels industry group Growth Energy, agricultural merchant and biofuels producer Archer Daniels Midland Co and International Paper Co, according to his public disclosures. He has been in his latest EPA job for more than 100 days, one of the longest tenures for an acting chief at the agency in decades. Wheeler has said that EPA, under his leadership, would take the same course as under Pruitt, prioritizing cleaning up industrial Superfund sites, areas contaminated by hazardous waste and identified by the EPA as a candidate for cleanup, and financing investments in water infrastructure.

2018-11-16,"BOGOTA, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Private oil producers in Colombia said on Friday they are optimistic about promises by President Ivan Duque to improve security and bolster the sector. Duque, who has been in office for 101 days, pledged during his campaign to lower taxes on businesses and improve security for crude producers in the country, where leftist rebels regularly bomb pipelines and community protests sometimes stymie output. “We’re seeing progress - we have all the confidence in the world in the administration,” said Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub, on the sidelines of an oil and gas conference in Bogota. Occidental operates the Cano Limon field in eastern Arauca province. The Cano Limon pipeline, run by state oil company Ecopetrol, has been offline for most of the year because of attacks by the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels. Production and exports from the field have remained normal despite the bombings because Ecopetrol is able to use the smaller Bicentenario pipeline for transport. Though the pipeline is currently shut, it was attacked repeatedly last weekend. Hollub, who said Occidental hopes to more than double its 30,000 barrels per day net output in the coming years, was optimistic about the security situation. “The military is incredible here.” Oil companies may be among those who benefit from a proposed tax cut to corporations that is wending its way through Congress. The government wants to reduce duties on businesses to 30 percent over the next four years, down from 35 percent. Other private producers were more cautious. “It’s still early but all the signs are positive,” said Frontera Energy chief executive Richard Herbert. “What we need now is security in prospective, less developed areas,” he said, adding that blocks won by Frontera back in 2010 in southern Caqueta and Putumayo provinces have not been developed because of ongoing security worries. Herbert said he hoped there would be a new bidding round in 2019 so further oil areas could be opened to exploration. Colombia has repeatedly delayed its deadline to receive offers for 15 onshore areas at its Sinu-San Jacinto auction. The round would be the first since 2014. Frontera estimates its average production will end 2018 at 66,000 bpd, some 57,000 of which comes from fields in Colombia. Speaking at the close of the conference, mines and energy minister Maria Fernanda Suarez said she was confident the oil sector would continue to contribute to the country’s development and its bid to become energy self-sufficient.

2018-11-16,"(Adds Permian rig count in paragraph 5) By Scott DiSavino Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week added oil rigs for a fifth time in six weeks, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years and crude production from shale basins at a record high. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Nov. 16, bringing the total count to 888, still the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI After rig additions stalled at five during the third quarter, drillers have added 25 rigs so far this quarter. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 738 rigs were active because energy companies have spent more this year to ramp up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. More than half the total U.S. oil rigs are in the Permian Basin, the country’s biggest shale oil formation. Active units there increased by one this week to 493, the most since January 2015. U.S. crude output from seven major shale basins was expected to rise 113,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 7.9 million bpd in December, driven largely by increases in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said this week. The EIA also said producers drilled 1,577 wells and completed 1,308 in the biggest shale basins in October, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up 269 at a record high 8,545, according to data going back to December 2013. That was the most wells drilled in a month since February 2015 and the most completed in a month since March 2015, according to EIA data. U.S. crude futures were trading around $57 a barrel on Friday after falling to their lowest since November 2017 earlier this week on concerns the global market is over supplied. Looking ahead, crude futures for calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 were both trading around $58 a barrel. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 25 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $90.0 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,082 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018.

2018-11-16,"Nov 16 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms this week added oil rigs for a fifth time in six weeks, keeping the rig count at its highest in over three years and crude production from shale basins at a record high. Drillers added two oil rigs in the week to Nov. 16, bringing the total count to 888, still the highest level since March 2015, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI After rig additions stalled at five during the third quarter, drillers have added 25 rigs so far this quarter. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 738 rigs were active because energy companies have spent more this year to ramp up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. U.S. crude output from seven major shale basins was expected to rise 113,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 7.9 million bpd in December, driven largely by increases in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said this week. The EIA also said producers drilled 1,577 wells and completed 1,308 in the biggest shale basins in October, leaving total drilled but uncompleted wells up 269 at a record high 8,545, according to data going back to December 2013. That was the most wells drilled in a month since February 2015 and the most completed in a month since March 2015, according to EIA data. U.S. crude futures were trading around $57 a barrel on Friday after falling to their lowest since November 2017 earlier this week on concerns the global market is over supplied. Looking ahead, crude futures for calendar 2019 and calendar 2020 were both trading around $58 a barrel. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating a 25 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $90.0 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Cowen said early 2019 capital spending budgets were mixed. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,082 oil and gas rigs are already in service, drillers do not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,026. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2018-11-16,"The risk of a “flash crash” in markets is rising, strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said on Friday, after a week in which previously-booming cryptocurrency Bitcoin tumbled, oil sank, and investors piled into stocks perceived as safer. Rising volatility across a range of asset classes and rapid deleveraging like that seen in oil markets in recent weeks are signs a bear market could have further to go, they said. Brent crude hit an eight-month low on Tuesday in its steepest one-day fall in more than three years and Bitcoin hit a 13-month low on Thursday, the latest assets to fall sharply. “Sell rallies,” strategists at the U.S. bank advised clients, saying that despite sharp falls in the stock market, positioning by institutional investors was not pessimistic enough to signal the market could be at rock bottom.  “Ingredients of flash crash rising ... bond, FX, equity volatility all trending up, vicious deleveraging events, dislocation risk via abnormal spreads ... triggers could be violent U.S. dollar move and/or shock macro data forcing abrupt GDP and earnings downgrades,” they wrote.  The bear market has been such that cash has outperformed stocks and bonds this year for the first time since 1992, the strategists said, noting that despite this $122 billion has flowed into equities, $35 billion into money market funds, and $24 billion into bonds. This week saw modest inflows of $4.6 billion into equities, while bonds suffered outflows of $5.2 billion, EPFR data showed.  Corporate bonds saw big outflows - investment grade corporate bond funds lost $2 billion and high-yield bond funds lost $2.3 billion. Indeed, the next assets to drop could be high-yield credit and the U.S. dollar, BAML reckoned, which is up 5.1 percent year-to-date.  The “last bulls standing” are high-yield corporate bonds, the strategists wrote, and the U.S. dollar - which they see climbing further into the end of this year and first quarter of 2019 before falling. In terms of regional flows, investors pulled $1.3 billion from European equity funds, which have seen outflows for 35 of the past 36 weeks.  U.S. equities, the world leaders in terms of performance and valuations, saw $2.6 billion of inflows. A nascent appetite for emerging market stocks was visible,  with $1.2 billion going into the region, its fifth straight week of inflows. GRAPHIC: Growth stocks begin to capitulate Nov 16 - tmsnrt.rs/2QIuNjT Apple (AAPL.O), which BAML strategists labeled the “king of buybacks”, has cracked, they said, as the stock fell to below its 200-day moving average, a level seen as important for sentiment.  Apple shares are on course for their worst month since April 2016, and have suffered seven consecutive weeks of losses as the iPhone maker’s weak results and stress in the semiconductor space dented the stock.  Its recent decline signals share buybacks - which have been a key driver of the rapid rise of U.S. stocks - are no longer sufficient to fuel the market. This year has seen a record $800 billion of U.S. buybacks so far, yet the S&P 500 buyback index - which tracks the performance of the 100 stocks in the index with the highest buyback ratios - is up just 0.9 percent year-to-date, and down 5.9 percent this quarter. The recent decline of U.S. tech stocks like Apple which had led the market higher is one symptom of a building rotation from “growth” stocks into “value” stocks, further evidenced this week with $1 billion flowing into value-focused funds and $0.6 billion leaking out of growth-focused funds.  Defensive - steady revenue and high dividend yielding - sectors like healthcare and utilities also led the way in terms of inflows. Some $1.1 billion poured into healthcare funds and $700 million into utilities funds.  Financials funds, meanwhile, saw $1.2 billion of outflows.

Oil climbed for a third session as it clawed back from steep recent losses. Wall Street’s main indexes were little changed in initial trading. Disappointing forecasts by chip companies Nvidia Corp and Applied Materials weighed on sentiment, but that may have been countered by prospects of a less-aggressive path of rate hikes following comments from Richard Clarida, the newly appointed vice chair of the Federal Reserve. Clarida said in a CNBC interview that U.S. interest rates are nearing Fed estimates of a neutral rate, and being at neutral “makes sense.” “Investors are starting to look at the vice chairman’s remarks this morning as perhaps a little dovish, and it is bringing up worries about global growth,” said Chris Gaffney, president of World Markets at TIAA Bank in St. Louis. While the Fed is widely expected to raise rates in December, the number of hikes next year is of investor debate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 72.85 points, or 0.29 percent, to 25,362.12, the S&P 500 gained 2.61 points, or 0.10 percent, to 2,732.81 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 24.48 points, or 0.34 percent, to 7,234.56. Nvidia tumbled 17.0 percent while the Philadelphia semiconductor index fell 1.7 percent. Energy shares climbed, supported by higher oil prices. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.24 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.07 percent. The index was on course for a weekly loss as Brexit chaos, Italy’s budget showdown with the European Commission and anxious oil markets sapped risk appetite. British Prime Minister Theresa May won the backing of the most prominent Brexiteer in her government as she fought to save a draft European Union divorce deal that has stirred up a plot to force her out of her job. After tumbling a day earlier, sterling was last trading at $1.2837, up 0.49 percent, while the euro was up 0.61 percent to $1.1395. “We are seeing the euro rebound a bit, we’re seeing the pound rebound a bit,” Gaffney said. “Both of those items are on the back of perhaps a little more positive news on Brexit, although it’s still a long way from getting done.” The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.41 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last rose 8/32 in price to yield 3.0884 percent, from 3.118 percent late on Thursday. Oil rose on expectations that OPEC and its allies would agree to cut output next month but prices remained down on the week on concerns that the global market was oversupplied. U.S. crude rose 2.13 percent to $57.66 per barrel and Brent was last at $67.88, up 1.89 percent on the day. Additional reporting by Richard Leong in New York, Helen Reid

2018-11-16,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Friday said it would ask the country’s highest court to overturn a ruling ordering it to speed up reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, an appeals court upheld a 2015 ruling ordering the government to ensure CO2-emissions are at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by the end of 2020, saying the government had not done enough to prevent the dangers of climate change. The government said it would adhere to the ruling, but questioned whether the court was allowed to rule on its policies. “This can have large consequences for future governments and their room for making policies on climate or any other subject,” Economy minister Eric Wiebes said in a statement. Last year, emissions were only 13 percent lower than 1990 levels in the Netherlands, which is among the most pollutant countries in the Europe Union.  Despite its limited achievements in recent years, the government expects current plans to reduce emissions to 23 percent below the 1990 figure by the 2020 deadline. However, uncertainty around the 2020 goals, coupled with the court ruling, could force the government to take drastic measures to reach them, including the immediate shutdown of one or more coal-fired power plants, experts have said. In May, the Netherlands said it would ban the use of coal in electricity generation in the coming decade, shutting down two of its five coal-fired plants at the end of 2024. Reporting by Bart Meijer.

2018-11-16,"PARIS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - France’s Eiffel Investment Group on Friday announced the closing of its 350 million euros ($398 million) fund which aims to serve as a bridging finance vehicle for small-scale renewable energy projects in France and other European countries. The Eiffel Energy Fund, backed by investors including the European Investment Bank and French insurance group MAIF, was launched a year ago with 200 million euros. It has financed 500 projects with a total capacity of 300 megawatts (MW), the company said in a statement. The size of the fund has been increased to 350 million euros, which will enable the investment of around 1.5 billion euros over 10 years in energy transition through the recycling and reinvestment of the fund, it said. New investors in the increased fund include insurance group Aviva. Fabrice Dumonteil, chief executive of Eiffel Investment Group which has around 1.6 billon euros under management, said the energy fund was targeting a niche market in the renewables sector where there is a real financing gap. “If you are a small developer with a project of around 5 MW or 10 MW or 15 MW, we come in with the bridging finance on a short-term basis until banks step in with long-term financing,” Dumonteil said, adding that the fund provides critical finance for projects for up to three years. Dumonteil said that in the one year since the fund was launched, it has financed around 10 percent of all new renewable energy projects in France. $1 = 0.8784 euros

2018-11-16,"DUSHANBE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Tajikistan started the first turbine of its Rogun hydroelectric power plant on Friday, part of a dam project that aims to secure the Central Asian nation’s energy independence. The former Soviet republic issued its first Eurobond last year to help finance the project, which will include the world’s tallest dame when it is completed in 2026. Italy’s Salini Impregilo won a $3.9 billion contract, making it the biggest single investment in Tajikistan since it gained independence in 1991. The government hopes the plant will help end power rationing in winter months while also allowing Tajikistan to boost energy exports its neighbours, such as Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. “This historical date will be inscribed in golden letters in Tajikistan’s modern history and will be a source of pride for the next generation,” Tajik President Imomali Rakhmon said as he started the power plant, 100 km (62 miles) east of Dushanbe. The launch ceremony followed by a fireworks show televised on outdoors screens across the nation. At Friday’s launch of the first turbine, the dam on the Vakhsh river in the Pamir mountains was just 75 metres (yards) tall. By 2026, it will to rise to 335 metres and will have six turbines with installed capacity of 3,600 megawatts (MW). Starting the turbines gradually before the dam’s completion will help finance construction. Tajikistan’s Finance Ministry estimates the project will require $4 billion to complete. Uzbekistan, which lies downstream, previously voiced concerns about the impact on the water flows to Uzbek farmers. But Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev, who took power after Islam Karimov died in 2016, has softened Tashkent’s stance and eased tensions.

2018-11-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - The Nordic region’s most high-profile cruise fleet operator is refitting its ships to make them less polluting, and plans to use a byproduct of rotten fish to help power their new, leaner engines. Norway’s Hurtigruten, best known for the ships that ferry tourists along the country’s fjords and coastline and up into the Arctic, is investing 7 billion crowns ($826 million) over three years to adapt its 17-strong fleet. Six of its older vessels will be retrofitted to run on a combination of liquefied natural gas (LNG), electric batteries and liquefied bio gas (LBG).  “We are talking about an energy source (LBG) from organic waste, which would otherwise have gone up in the air. This is waste material from dead fish, from agriculture and forestry,” Hurtigruten CEO Daniel Skjeldam told Reuters in an interview. “Our main aim is to improve and cut emissions,” he said. Hurtigruten, also the world’s biggest expedition cruise operator to destinations including Antarctica, Svalbard and Greenland, is also ordering three new ships that will run on electricity, with a diesel engine only as back-up. The shipping sector is facing tougher international regulations, including cuts in CO2 emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 compared with 2008 levels, and a ban on fuels with sulphur content above 0.5 percent from 2020 against 3.5 percent now. Hurtigruten wants to be carbon neutral by 2050.  “We definitely have to be there in 2050 as a company and the cruise industry must definitely have to come a long way as well,” said Skjeldam.  Two of the electric battery-powered ships, costing above 150 million euros each, are already under construction while Hurtigruten has a letter of intent for a third. That will help Hurtigruten market itself as a green cruise company - especially useful given the vulnerable eco-systems its ships sail through.     “The changes in the Arctic over the past 20-30 years are not caused by carbon dioxide emissions in the Arctic, but you can see the effects of the emissions elsewhere in the world first in the Arctic,” Skjeldam said. “Our crews have seen glaciers retreat and plastic waste on beaches where they land.”  Editing by Gwladys Fouche and John Stonestreet",https://uk.reuters.com/article/hurtigruten-cruiseship-environment/rotten-fish-to-help-power-hurtigruten-cruise-ships-after-refit-idUKL8N1XQ6SH,16 Nov 2018,"The Nordic region's most

London, Paris and Frankfurt struggled to maintain a modest early bounce having been battered the previous day when Britain’s Brexit minister quit in protest over a draft deal with Brussels on leaving the European Union. Wall Street tech stocks looked set to take a hit, with Nasdaq futures pointing more than 1 percent lower as disappointing results from U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp hit the chip sector globally. Sterling faired a little better than on Thursday when it slumped more than 2 cents versus the dollar in what was also its worst day against the euro since the post-Brexit vote fallout of 2016. But with reports of a UK political coup still rife and a fear that the country could crash out of the EU without a divorce deal, it couldn’t get much beyond 88.50 pence per euro and $1.2875 on cable. “As long as no deal remains as likely as it is, there is a risk of a sterling depreciation spiral that is self-intensifying,” said Ulrich Leuchtmannan, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. UK and euro zone government bond yields edged up as some stability returned to fixed-income markets. Still, 10-year yields on German bonds, considered one of the safest assets in the world, were set for their biggest weekly fall in three weeks, in a sign that Brexit uncertainty and worries about Italy’s finances continued to support demand. In Frankfurt, the head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, said the bank still plans to dial back its stimulus at the end of the year, but acknowledged the economy had hit a soft patch and inflation may rise more slowly than expected. “If firms start to become more uncertain about the growth and inflation outlook, the squeeze on margins could prove more persistent,” Draghi told a conference. Some of Europe’s biggest funds who took part in a Reuters summit this week said they now think Draghi will be the first president in the ECB’s history not to have raised interest rates during their term. Asian shares had ended their session firmer after reports the United States might pause on further China tariffs, but a near 17 percent plunge in Nvidia’s stock in after-hours Wall Street dealing had tempered the mood. The chip designer forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter, pinning the blame on unsold chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the cryptocurrency mining boom evaporated. Also falling after hours were shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Losses in semiconductor shares dragged Japan’s Nikkei down 0.5 percent, while Nasdaq futures were last down 1.3 percent. “It started with Apple, then Nvidia ... Since performances of these companies set the tone for the global tech and chip industries, related Japanese stocks will likely be sluggish for a while,” said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Europe’s tech stocks suffered too but Brexit remained the region’s main focus. Fears that UK Prime Minister Theresa May’s hard-fought deal could collapse had sent British markets into gyrations not seen since the June 2016 referendum on EU membership. Britain’s FTSE 100 was at a three-week low, down 0.85 percent, with FTSE 350 bank stocks down 1.4 percent as lender RBS slid a further 4 percent. “If and when a vote on the withdrawal agreement occurs is uncertain. Whether the withdrawal bill is passed by both houses of Parliament is uncertain,” Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA, said in a note. “Whether the Prime Minister resigns or is challenged for the leadership is uncertain. And, whether there is a second referendum and/or an election is uncertain.” Away from sterling, the dollar dipped on its way to a fifth straight weekly gain, as cautious comments from the Federal Reserve’s newly appointed vice chair about growth saw the euro strengthen to $1.1390. Also under water was the cryptocurrency Bitcoin which hit a one-year trough overnight, having tumbled 10 percent early in the week when support at $6,000 gave way. It was last changing hands at $5,547 on the Bitstamp platform. In commodity markets, the weaker dollar gave gold a leg up to $1,223. oil prices rose too, helped by a decline in U.S. fuel stockpiles and the possibility of a cut in OPEC output. U.S. crude was trading up 80 cents at $57.27 and Brent crude rose roughly 1 dollar to $67.65 a barrel. It was still set for a sixth straight weekly loss, however.

2018-11-16,"OSLO (Reuters) - It could take more than a year to recover funds from a trader whose default forced members of the Nasdaq Commodities exchange to plug a $130 million hole, two market participants told Reuters, a day after the trader struck a deal with creditors. The deal, which two sources said would return at least half of the funds lost, allows Einar Aas to avoid bankruptcy and keep his home in Norway, though he will have to auction other assets in Norway and Spain. “Α lot of the assets will take a lot of time to liquidate. The timespan could easily be more than a year,” said Stefan Barkholt Ovesen, chief executive of Nordstroem Invest, a Nasdaq clearing member that trades power. The derivative trader’s default was caused by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads in early September, as heavy rain had pushed down prices in the hydroelectric-dependant Nordic region, while a spike in the cost of carbon drove up German prices. A source at one of Nasdaq’s largest clearing members, who had direct knowledge of the deal’s details and did not want to be identified, also said recovering the money would take time. “Evaluating the assets across countries, organizing and conducting auctions, reaching a conclusion on how to distribute the proceeds ... It will take years, not months,” the source said. Aas did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Some members contacted by Reuters said they were satisfied with the deal creditors struck, though some were still awaiting answers on how the default occurred. “We are very happy with the deal ... as it avoids bankruptcy, which was a risky scenario. There is still the question of how could this happen. It is not something you forget,” investor relations manager Maans Holmberg at Finland’s Fortum (FORTUM.HE) said. At least one firm was publicly unhappy.  Agder Energi, the only firm that initially opposed the settlement, according to Nasdaq, said it had agreed to participate because not doing so would only have delayed the process. “It (the deal) is unbalanced,” Steffen Syvertsen, Agder Energi’s director of energy management and trading, told Reuters. “As long as it was not possible to change the agreement, but only slow down the process with increased costs, we therefore decided to accept.”  Nasdaq said it did not want to speculate on the final outcome of the process, declining to estimate how much money would be recovered and when.

2018-11-16,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2QN4usW By John Kemp LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Global oil markets are increasingly over-supplied with light distillates, such as gasoline, while there are not enough middle distillates, such as diesel, which has opened a big price differential between the two fuels. To keep meeting healthy demand for mid-distillates, refiners are processing high volumes of crude and creating a glut of gasoline. U.S. gasoline prices for delivery in June 2019 are trading just $7 per barrel above benchmark Brent futures for the same month, compared with a premium of $18 per barrel for low-sulphur distillate fuel oil. Early in October, the gap in cracking margins was much narrower, with premiums of $14 and $17 per barrel over Brent respectively, but since then gasoline prices have slumped amid fears of over-supply. Gasoline prices have been hit by a combination of record refinery processing in the third quarter and flattening consumption from U.S. motorists which have left the market carrying record stocks for the time of year. Diesel prices, on the other hand, have been supported by strong demand from the freight, manufacturing and mining sectors as well as from oil and gas drillers themselves. Distillate prices are also being supported by the prospect of even higher consumption from the start of 2020 when new pollution regulations on bunker fuels used in the shipping industry come into force. Regulations adopted by the International Maritime Organization will require shipping firms to switch from using heavy fuel oil to middle distillates unless they install expensive scrubbers to clean up their sulphur emissions. Differential growth in light and middle distillate consumption is not a new problem (tmsnrt.rs/2QN4usW). Gasoline and diesel consumption are driven by different factors which means that growth rates differ more often than they are the same. Gasoline consumption is more weighted towards private motorists while distillate is geared towards commercial freight transport, aviation, manufacturing, farming, mining and oil and gas production. Gasoline is weighted regionally towards the United States and Japan while distillate is weighted more towards Europe, Latin America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. As a result, gasoline use tends to be steadier across the business cycle while distillate consumption varies much more with the state of the economy. In a typical expansion, gasoline consumption tends to dominate in the early stages while distillate growth takes over as the cycle becomes more mature. If the expansion or contraction is synchronised globally, the impact on distillate demand becomes much more pronounced than if it is concentrated in only a few regions. Late-cycle growth in distillate demand during 2017 and 2018 has left inventories relatively low while the introduction of new IMO regulations threatens to tighten them even further in 2019 and 2020. CO-PRODUCTION Like any commodity market, even small imbalances between the production and consumption of individual fuels can have an outsized impact on prices. But gasoline and distillate are co-products from the same refining process, so refiners have no option but to cope with the resulting large swings in margins. Refiners have some flexibility to change the ratio in which they produce light and middle distillates by altering the slate of crudes they process and running their fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) units in max-distillate rather than max-gasoline mode but the flexibility is quite limited. For the most part, the market for individual fuels is made to balance through changes in prices and consumer behaviour. Rising distillate prices will force the freight transportation sector to focus on improving fuel economy by trimming schedules, consolidating loads, switching from air freight to ocean shipping, and slow steaming. Freight and logistics firms have considerable scope to cut fuel consumption by reducing part loads, minimising empty backhauls and switching away from air freight, sacrificing delivery speed for improved fuel economy. Shipping companies can also achieve large reductions in fuel consumption by making even a small reduction in sailing speed. In a period of high fuel prices, shipping companies can trade increased sailing times, smaller schedules and larger fleets (higher capital costs) for reduced fuel consumption (lower operating costs). The growing gap between diesel and gasoline prices will also accelerate the shift away from diesel towards gasoline for private motor cars and fleet vehicles especially in Europe. Government regulations and taxation policies are already favouring the sale of gasoline and electric vehicles rather than diesel cars, but the fuel price differential will speed up the shift. In Britain, for example, the average retail price of diesel is now more than 8 pence per litre (6 percent) higher than gasoline and the gap has almost doubled since the end of August. British sales of diesel cars have already fallen by almost 31 percent in the first 10 months of 2018 compared 2017, accounting for just 32 percent of new sales down from 43 percent the previous year. Petrol car sales rose by 9 percent over the same period and their share grew to 62 percent from 53 percent, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Reduced diesel consumption in favour of gasoline in Europe will play an important role in helping make more middle distillates available for the shipping industry in 2020. The biggest source of uncertainty for both refiners and middle distillate consumers is the outlook for the global economy in 2019 and 2020. Synchronised global growth provided a big boost to middle distillate consumption in 2017 tightening the market considerably. But global freight volumes have grown much more slowly in 2018 as the economy has lost momentum, easing some of the pressure on distillate supplies. If the global economy continues to slow or tips into recession in 2019, the looming distillate shortage will largely disappear, and distillate margins will soften. If the global economy accelerates again, however, then strong freight demand coupled with the new IMO regulations will likely push the premium for distillate fuels even higher.

2018-11-16,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria is backtracking on some economic reforms such as cutting costly subsidies as the country wants to minimise the risk of protests before presidential elections next year, according to the budget data and experts. The North African oil producer country had said at the start of the year subsidies for fuel and other products would be lowered from 2019 to rein in spending following a fall in oil revenues from 2014 to 2017. It gave no specifics. But its draft budget for next year includes a 7 percent increase in subsidy spending, accounting for 21 percent of the budget. The rise will be used to subsidise basic food items including milk and cereals as well as housing, officials say. The government had also approved this year higher and new taxes for some products and increases in subsidised fuel prices for the third straight year. But no new such hikes are planned for next year, according to the draft. Analysts said a rise in oil prices this year had made officials confident of being able to postpone cuts in subsidies, part of welfare spending to discourage dissent, without straining public finances. Speaking to Reuters, central bank governor Mohamed Loukal noted that the 2019 budget assumes oil prices at $50 a barrel, whereas benchmark crude prices are around $67, and hit $87 last month. Finance Minister Abderrahmane Raouia signalled the change in tack this month. “Our subsidy policy will be maintained because Algerian citizens still need it,” he said, without giving  details. Algeria has avoided upheaval like other Arab countries but riots broke out in 2011 over a rise in sugar and cooking oil prices. This year doctors and teachers went on strike for months over work conditions, while the unemployment rate remains at around 11 percent. Youth unemployment is believed to be higher. “(The) next elections require a stable social policy. It would be wrong to upset people (by cutting subsidies),” said economics professor Abderrahmane Aya. The ruling coalition has called on President Abdelaziz Bouteflika to seek a fifth term in the election in April. The 81-year old, in office since 1999, has not yet said whether he would stand. The economy has improved in recent months. Oil and gas revenues, which account for 60 percent of the budget and 94 percent of export revenues, rose by 15 percent in the first nine months from the same period in 2018. The economy is expected to grow by 4 percent this year after 2.2 percent last year. But diplomats and business leaders say backtracking on curbing subsidies might give investors the impression the government is not serious about reforms and opening up the state and oil dominated economy. Officials have repeatedly said they wanted to boost the small non-energy sector to reduce the import bill and create jobs. Ali Haddad, head of the country’s largest business association, Algerian Business Forum, said Algeria needed to encourage private investment. “This ... requires bold reforms,” he said. Another prominent businessman, Boualem Merakech, head of the Algerian Confederation of Employers (CAP), recently complained about “difficulties faced by business leaders seeking to invest in a calm environment and a clear economic vision”. Some diplomats said the shelved subsidy plan will add to confusion among investors trying to figure out economic policies in a secretive country. They point to three different rules applied in the past two years to reduce imports. “I think that this kind of changes (of the import rules) makes it difficult for firms to make plans and understand the environment in which they will work in six or 12 months,” U.S. ambassador John Desrocher told reporters. “Attracting more investment requires more transparency, more predictability and better access to markets.” Reporting by Hamid Ould Ahmed; editing by David Stamp; Editing by Ulf Laessing and David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/algeria-economy/algeria-shelves-subsidy-reforms-before-presidential-elections-idUKL8N1XK4QM,16 Nov 2018,"Algeria is backtracking on some

2018-11-16,"* Few tankers free for spot trades, boosting shipping rates * Some vessels used as storage in hope of price rises * Ample supply added to by new U.S. start-up from Cheniere By Sabina Zawadzki LONDON, Nov 15 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell this week despite several Japanese buyers in the market, as sellers held onto cargoes hoping for higher bids and used tankers as storage, which also reduced ship availability for other deals. Spot prices for January delivery in North Asia LNG-AS were heard at $10.90 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), 30 cents lower than last week. A trade was heard at $11.10 on Thursday, lower than on Monday. For late December, spot prices were heard at $10.40 per mmBtu, although they were under the $10 mark for early December delivery weeks. Spot prices for the whole month of December were estimated at $10.10, compared to $10.30 last week. LNG prices have fallen in eight of the past ten weeks after an earlier rush to stock up on supplies ahead of winter at the start of September. LNG shipping rates hit their highest on record this month, with several shippers heard paying $200,000 a day to transport the super-chilled fuel. Such levels signal very little availability of vessels for December and January. Rates began rising as more production came onstream and as charterers, fearing even higher costs, locked in vessels for multi-month contracts. This is now being compounded by owners of LNG with chartered ships hanging onto the cargoes in the hope of a rise in prices. Up to 20 tankers with at least 2 million cubic metres of LNG worth $400 million are floating in Asian waters, sources said. “All traders exposed to the freight market will think twice about moving a cargo in the spot market,” said one LNG trader. “Portfolio players with a contracted fleet will perform much better. We’ll probably see more swapping cargoes.” There were several Japanese buyers in the market — Tohoku Electric Power Co Inc awarded a one-cargo tender to Qatar for Dec. 25-30 delivery, according to one trader. Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal sought one cargo for mid-January delivery in a closed tender after sounding out the market last week. And power utility Kansai Electric Power Co was seeking two cargoes for December delivery. Pakistan’s tender for one cargo in January and two in February was still open with bids due on Dec. 5. Gladstone, operated by Australia’s Santos, was heard offering a cargo for Dec 12-14 delivery. Abu Dhabi’s ADNOC awarded a tender for mid-December loading. Adding to recent new supply from Australia and Russia, Cheniere Energy produced first LNG from the U.S. Corpus Christi plant, a major milestone marking the start of the third major LNG export facility operating in the country.

2018-11-16,"PARADISE, Calif., Nov 16 (Reuters) - Rescue workers searched on Friday for 630 people reported missing in a northern California town reduced to ashes by the deadliest wildfire in state history. At least 63 people were killed in and around Paradise by the Camp Fire that erupted a week ago in the Sierra foothills 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco. The fire is among the most lethal U.S. wildfires since 2000. Authorities attribute the death toll in part to the speed with which flames raced through the town of 27,000, driven by wind and fueled by desiccated scrub and trees. Nearly 12,000 homes and buildings burned hours after the blaze erupted, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said. The fire left a ghostly expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with debris. Thousands of additional structures are still threatened as firefighters, many from distant states, labored to contain and suppress the flames. The revised roster of 630 missing people is up from 297 listed on Thursday by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office. Sheriff Kory Honea on Thursday said the remains of seven victims have been located since Wednesday's tally of 56. Nearly 300 people reported missing have been found alive and the list of missing bit.ly/2BaiYxy would fluctuate, he said. The sheriff has asked relatives of the missing to submit DNA samples to hasten identification of the dead. But he said some of those unaccounted for may never be identified. The were other smaller blazes in southern California including the Woolsey Fire that is linked to three fatalities and destroyed at least 500 structures near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. Scientists say two seasons of devastating wildfires in California are linked to drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. Two electric utilities say they sustained equipment problems close to the origins of the blazes around the time they were reported. The White House said on Thursday that President Donald Trump plans to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Critics say Trump politicized the fires by casting blame on forest mismanagement. Cal Fire said 40 percent of the Camp Fire’s perimeter is contained, up from 35 percent, even as the blaze footprint grew 2,000 acres to 141,000 acres (57,000 hectares). The Woolsey fire is 57 percent contained. Public schools in Sacramento and districts 90 miles (145 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, said Friday’s classes would be canceled as the fire worsened air quality. Many of those who survived the flames but lost homes stayed with friends or relatives or at American Red Cross shelters. Reporting by Terray Sylvester;

2018-11-16,"(Adds context, background) MADRID, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Spanish utility Endesa plans to close two of its coal plants in Spain, representing around two-fifths of its coal-fired generating capacity in the country, the company said on Friday. As companies globally move towards a lower carbon economy, Endesa’s Italian parent company Enel, is phasing out coal-fired power plants and focusing on electricity grids, renewable energy and its retail business. “We will present the application shortly because we do not plan to carry out the necessary investments to comply with European regulations,” an Endesa spokesman said. The European Union set new standards on resources and emissions for combustion plants last year, requiring expensive technological upgrades. Spain’s Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez signalled his intention to go green when he took power in June, bringing together energy and environment into one ministry, which is now working on a new law on climate change. A working draft for the new law includes plans to raise the share of renewable sources in the energy mix to 35 percent by 2030. The plants in Teruel in the country’s north-east, which has a capacity of 1,101 megawatts (MW), and Compostilla in the north-west, with a 1,051 MW capacity, are due to close in 2020. With the climate change law, the government aims to help re-train people in sectors that will be affected by the shift away from carbon, and introduce social security measures. Endesa’s coal capacity is currently much larger than peers Iberdrola and Naturgy, who respectively run 874 MW and 2,010 MW in Spain.

2018-11-16,"(Adds detail, background) JOHANNESBURG, Nov 16 (Reuters) - South Africa’s cash-strapped power utility Eskom said on Friday it had revised its coal strategy to focus on contracts that offer long-term, fixed prices and security of supply as it faces possible power outages and low stockpiles of the fuel. “Eskom’s long-term coal strategy has been revised to revert Eskom’s coal supply to dedicated long-term coal contracts for the life of the stations, with a preference for conveyor-delivered coal,” an Eskom presentation showed. Eskom, which supplies more than 90 percent of the nation’s power, has warned of potential power outages amid low coal inventories after a major supplier cut supplies and sought insolvency protection. The utility also said it would extend its “cost-plus” mine contracts, through which it pre-pays mines to start up mining operations, pays the operating costs and a management fee and in return receives security of supply. Africa’s largest public utility said it would in the short term buy 4 million tonnes of coal for immediate supply to bring all power stations above the minimum required level for stockpiles by the end of March 2019. Eskom said it had 10 power stations with coal supplies of fewer than 20 days. Five of those had fewer than 10 days’ supply. Eskom said it had concluded 27 new, short-term coal contracts between January and October for the supply of 15.8 million tonnes of coal in the current financial year. In 2015 Eskom, whose generation capacity is around 45,000 megawatts, carried out controlled outages - known as load-shedding - as low cash flow and administrative problems affected operations. The utility was also forced to cut power supplies for a few days in June due to a strike.

2018-11-16,"(Adds output figures, background) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Malaysia’s gas exports have been severely impacted since the second quarter of the year due to a supply disruption at a gas field in the eastern state of Sabah, the finance minister said on Friday. “Major repairs and assessment works are still ongoing and production is only expected to return to full capacity by the middle of next year (at) the latest,” Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng said in a statement. The supply disruption has affected the country’s economic growth and petroleum income tax revenue received by the government, he said. Malaysia is the world’s third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), and state energy company Petronas is a significant contributor to the state coffers. Reuters reported in August that Malaysia’s exports of LNG fell to a four-year low in July as domestic gas pipeline issues since January took their toll. Recent trade data shows Malaysia’s third-quarter LNG exports totalled 8.7 billion ringgit ($2.08 billion) in value, down about 21 percent from the same period last year. Earlier on Friday, Malaysia said its economy grew at its slowest in two years in the July-September quarter as the country grappled with weak external demand, and what the central bank called “supply shocks” for LNG and palm oil. The central bank governor, though, added that the supply shocks have bottomed. Minister Lim said the disruption was from a production breakdown in Kebabangan gas field in Sabah. Natural gas production in the second quarter totalled 553,264 million standard cubic feet, down 10 percent from the first quarter. Third quarter output fell another 3 percent quarter on quarter, Lim said. $1 = 4.1900 ringgit

2018-11-16,"* Long-awaited expansion to help double LNG exports from nation * Negotiations over revenue sharing need more work -prime minister * Papua New Guinea is hosting APEC forum (Adds comment from Oil Search, Exxon Mobil, analyst) By Jonathan Barrett and Sonali Paul PORT MORESBY/MELBOURNE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A long-awaited project led by France’s Total SA that will help double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea has come another step closer, with the government agreeing to set financial terms early next year. The LNG expansion, which analysts estimate will cost $13 billion, is crucial to the Pacific island nation’s economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said in the country’s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that “physical terms” had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work. “I’d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,” O’Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters. Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG. A non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on Friday is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total. The signing was held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly. “There is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I’d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,” Pouyanne said. Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant. At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P’nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year. Exxon said in an emailed comment that it was pleased to see progress on the Papua LNG talks. Oil Search, a partner in both Papua LNG and PNG LNG, said all parties were “aligned on the need to ensure that new LNG developments in PNG remain competitive with other new LNG projects worldwide”. The companies are racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. But analysts say that timeline might be hard to meet as a final investment decision may not come until 2020 or 2021. “Ultimately the timeline for Papua will be dictated by Exxon’s patient and disciplined centralised decision making process, and all other parties will just need to fall in line with that,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic. Analysts estimate the expansion will cost around $13 billion, well below the $19.5 billion cost of the original project, which involved building a wide range of infrastructure from scratch, including a 700-km (435-mile) pipeline through the nation’s rugged highlands down to the coast. The government is aiming to strike better fiscal terms for the country than it did with Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG project in 2009, when it was looking secure the biggest foreign investment in the country amid the global financial crisis.

The British pound also lay battered and bruised after a bout of political turmoil fanned fears the country could crash out of the European Union without a divorce deal. Asian shares had started firm after reports the United States might pause on further China tariffs gave Wall Street a fillip, but a near 17 percent plunge in Nvidia’s stock tempered the mood. The chip designer forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter, pinning the blame on unsold chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the evaporation of the cryptocurrency mining boom. Also falling after-hours were shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Losses in semi-conductor shares dragged Japan’s Nikkei down 0.1 percent, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.5 percent. “It started with Apple, then Nvidia... Since performances of these companies set the tone for the global tech and chip industries, related Japanese stocks will likely be sluggish for a while,” said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan were still up 0.3 percent, helped by gains in China. European bourses also looked set to start firmer according to spreadbetters. Sterling had stolen the limelight overnight after a rash of resignations rocked Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and threw into doubt her long-awaited Brexit agreement just hours after it was unveiled. Fears that May’s hard-fought deal could collapse sent British markets into gyrations not seen since the June 2016 referendum on EU membership. The pound suffered its biggest one-day loss against the euro since October 2016 and was last at 88.60 pence. Against the dollar, it was huddled at $1.2790 after shedding 1.6 percent overnight. Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA, listed just some of sterling’s woes. “If and when a vote on the withdrawal agreement occurs is uncertain. Whether the withdrawal bill is passed by both houses of Parliament is uncertain,” Capurso said in a note. “Whether the Prime Minister resigns or is challenged for the leadership is uncertain. And, whether there is a second referendum and/or an election is uncertain.” All of which helped British bonds rally sharply as investors wagered the political chaos and risk of a hard Brexit would deter the Bank of England from tightening anytime soon. Yields on 5-year paper staged the largest one-day decline since the Brexit vote, at almost 15 basis points. The plunge in sterling lifted the dollar against a basket of currencies to 96.993, even as the euro firmed a touch to $1.1333. Also under water was the crypto currency Bitcoin, which hit a one-year trough overnight after tumbling 10 percent early in the week when support at $6,000 gave way. It was last changing hands at $5,560.73 on the Bitstamp platform. In commodity markets, gold was up a shade at $1,214.30 . Oil prices regained a little composure after their recent drubbing, helped by a decline in U.S. fuel stockpiles and the possibility of a cut in OPEC output.

2018-11-16,"PARADISE, Calif. (Reuters) - A search for victims of a catastrophic blaze that reduced a northern California town to ashes intensified on Thursday, as authorities expanded to 630 the number of those reported missing in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in state history. At least 63 people have been confirmed dead in the Camp Fire, which erupted a week ago in the drought-parched Sierra foothills 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco and now ranks as one of the most lethal single U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Authorities attributed the high death toll in part to the staggering speed with which the wind-driven flames, fuelled by desiccated scrub and trees, raced with little warning through Paradise, a town of 27,000. Nearly 12,000 homes and buildings, including most of the town, were incinerated last Thursday night hours after the blaze erupted, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) has said. What was left was a ghostly, smoky expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris.     Thousands of additional structures were still threatened by the blaze, and as many as 50,000 people were under evacuation orders at the height of the blaze. An army of firefighters, many from distant states, laboured to contain and suppress the flames. The revised official roster of 630 individuals whose whereabouts and fate remained unknown is more than double the 297 listed earlier in the day by the Butte County Sheriff’s Office.  Sheriff Kory Honea said nearly 300 people initially reported as unaccounted for had been found alive. He said the list of missing bit.ly/2BaiYxy would keep fluctuating with names being added and others removed, either because they turn up safe or are identified among the dead. The higher confirmed death toll, and rising number of those unaccounted for, were revealed at an evening news briefing by Honea, who said the remains of seven more Camp Fire victims had been located since Wednesday’s tally of 56. The sheriff has asked relatives of the missing to submit DNA samples to hasten identification of the dead. But he acknowledged some of those unaccounted for may never be conclusively found. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of smaller blazes in Southern California, including the Woolsey Fire, which has been linked with three fatalities and destroyed at least 500 structures in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. The latest blazes have capped a pair of calamitous wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. The cause of the fires are under investigation. But two electric utilities have said they sustained equipment problems close to the origins of the blazes around the time they were reported. The White House said on Thursday that President Donald Trump, who has been criticized as having politicized the fires by casting blame on forest mismanagement, plans to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet displaced residents. Cal Fire said that 40 percent of the Camp Fire’s perimeter had been contained, up from 35 percent, even as the blaze footprint grew 2,000 acres to 141,000 acres (57,000 hectares). Containment of the Woolsey fire grew to 57 percent. But smoke and soot spread far and wide. Public schools in Sacramento and districts 90 miles (145 km) to the south, and as far away as San Francisco and Oakland, said Friday’s classes would be cancelled as the Camp Fire worsened air quality. Those who survived the flames but lost homes were moving in temporarily with friends or relatives or bunking down in American Red Cross shelters. At a shelter set in a church in nearby Oroville, a bulletin board was plastered with dozens of photos of missing people, along with messages and phone numbers. Church officials posted lists of names they received in phone calls from people searching for friends and family. Evacuees are asked to check the boards to see if their names appear. Many others found haven at an encampment that sprang up in the parking lot outside a still-open Walmart store in Paradise, where dozens of evacuees pitched tents or slept in their cars. Part of the lot was roped off as a distribution centre for clothes, food and coffee. Portable toilets were also brought in. Evacuees milling in the parking lot faced morning temperatures that dropped to just above freezing and many wore breathing masks for protection from lingering smoke. Nicole and Eric Montague, along with their 16-year-old daughter, showed up for free food but have been living with extended family in the neighbouring city of Chico, in a one-bedroom apartment filled with 15 people and nine dogs. They recounted being stunned at how swiftly the fire roared through Paradise the first night. “We didn’t have any time to react,” Eric said. “The news didn’t even know the fire was coming. It just happened so quick.” Nicole said she fled once her home’s mailbox caught fire and neighbours’ propane tanks began exploding. Facing walls of flames and traffic gridlock, her evacuation with her daughter was so harrowing that she called her husband to say farewell. “I called him and said, ‘Honey, I’m not going to make it. I love you,’” Nicole said.

The British pound also lay battered and bruised after a bout of political turmoil fanned fears the country could crash out of the European Union without a divorce deal. Asian shares had started firm after hopes for a thaw in Sino-U.S. trade relations gave Wall Street a fillip, but a near 17 percent plunge in Nvidia’s stock soured the mood. The chip designer on Thursday forecast disappointing sales for the holiday quarter, pinning the blame on unsold chips piling up with distributors and retailers after the evaporation of the cryptocurrency mining boom. Also falling in after-hours trading were shares of Advanced Micro Devices and Intel. Losses in semi-conductor shares dragged Japan’s Nikkei down 0.2 percent, while Nasdaq futures fell 0.6 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan erased early gains to go flat, then edged up 0.1 percent. “It started with Apple, then Nvidia... Since performances of these companies set the tone for the global tech and chip industries, related Japanese stocks will likely be sluggish for a while,” said Takatoshi Itoshima, a strategist at Pictet Asset Management. Sterling had stolen the limelight overnight after a rash of resignations rocked Prime Minister Theresa May’s government and threw into doubt her long-awaited Brexit agreement just hours after it was unveiled. Fears that May’s hard-fought deal could collapse sent British markets into gyrations not seen since the June 2016 referendum on EU membership. The pound suffered its biggest one-day loss against the euro since October 2016 and was last at 88.60 pence. Against the dollar, it was huddled at $1.2780 after shedding 1.6 percent overnight. Joseph Capurso, a senior currency strategist at CBA, listed just some of sterling’s woes. “If and when a vote on the withdrawal agreement occurs is uncertain. Whether the withdrawal bill is passed by both houses of Parliament is uncertain,” Capurso said in a note. “Whether the Prime Minister resigns or is challenged for the leadership is uncertain. And, whether there is a second referendum and/or an election is uncertain.” All of which helped British bonds rally sharply as investors wagered the political chaos and risk of a hard Brexit would deter the Bank of England from tightening anytime soon. Yields on 5-year paper staged the largest one-day decline since the Brexit vote, at almost 15 basis points. The plunge in sterling lifted the dollar against a basket of currencies to 96.976, even as the euro firmed a touch to $1.1333. Also under water was the crypto currency Bitcoin, which hit a one-year trough overnight after tumbling 10 percent early in the week when support at $6,000 gave way. It was last changing hands at $5,575.53 on the Bitstamp platform. In commodity markets, gold was up a shade at $1,214.30 .

2018-11-16,"* OPEC expected to cut supply to prevent glut * U.S. oil output & storage levels: tmsnrt.rs/2PXBD8e By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Oil prices were stable on Friday, supported by expected supply cuts from OPEC but held back by record U.S. production. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil futures were at $56.5/ per barrel at 0132 GMT, up 12 cents from their last settlement. Brent crude oil futures were up 7 cents at $66.69 a barrel. Prices were mainly supported by expectations the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would start withholding supply soon, fearing a renewed rout such as in 2014 when prices crashed under the weight of oversupply. However, Morgan Stanley warned a cut by the Middle East dominated producer cartel may not have the desired effect. “The main oil price benchmarks - Brent and WTI - are both light-sweet crudes and reflect this glut,” the U.S. bank said. “OPEC production cuts are usually implemented by removing medium and heavier barrels from the market but that does not address the oversupply of light-sweet.” Due to the structural oversupply that has emerged in the market from record production by many countries, Morgan Stanley said that “OPEC cuts are inherently temporary (because) all they can do is shift production from one period to another”. While OPEC considers withholding supply, U.S. crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA reached another record last week, at 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd), according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data published on Thursday. U.S. output has surged by almost a quarter since the start of the year. The record output meant U.S. crude oil stocks posted the biggest weekly build in nearly two years. Crude inventories C-STK-T-EIA soared 10.3 million barrels in the week to Nov. 9 to 442.1 million barrels, the highest level since early December 2017. This surge contributed to oil prices falling by around a quarter since early October, taking many by surprise. “Oil bulls, us included, have capitulated and we no longer see oil climbing to $95 per barrel next year,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note. While sentiment has turned bearish, some analysts warn that 2019 could be tighter than expected. “We expect 2019 oil demand to reach 101.1 million bpd,” natural resources research and investment firm Goehring & Rozencwajg said, up from just under 100 million bpd this year. At the same time, the firm said production outside North America was set to disappoint. Add OPEC’s expected supply cuts, and Goehring & Rozencwajg said “those investors who are able to adopt a contrarian stance ... and stomach the volatility ... are being presented with an excellent investment opportunity” to buy into oil after the recent slump. Bank of America agreed, saying “we believe oil is oversold and will likely bounce up from the current levels, as OPEC+ dials back production in December”.

2018-11-16,"Nov 15 (Reuters) - The National Transportation Safety Board said on Thursday that utility company NiSource Inc failed to adequately draft and oversee natural gas pipeline work orders and those lapses led to deadly blasts in three Massachusetts communities in September. The federal regulator said in a review of how Columbia Gas Co of Massachusetts, a subsidiary of NiSource, handled pipeline repair work that better construction orders could have prevented the disaster. Explosions and fires that killed one person, injured 21 and damaged 131 buildings erupted as Columbia Gas was replacing cast-iron pipe with plastic lines. Utilities have told state regulators that thousands of miles of natural gas pipelines in Massachusetts are leak-prone and need repairs. The National Transportation Safety Board said that a field engineer who developed the work orders told investigators that he did not recognize the critical role of pressure sensors in the work and did not document the location of the regulator-sensing lines that, when disconnected, flooded the system with high-pressure gas. The agency recommended that NiSource revise its review process, update its records and documentation and be able to immediately shut down gas pipeline systems during repairs. It said Massachusetts should require professional engineers to sign off on utility company work orders, which is not currently required. The review expanded on a preliminary study into the explosions and fires in Lawrence, North Andover and Andover, Massachusetts. NiSource, based in Merrillville, Indiana, said in a statement that it would adopt the agency’s safety recommendations at all of its utility companies, and spend $150 million to install devices that would “slam shut” gas lines when they sense pressure reaching risky levels. The company said in a regulatory filing this month that the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Massachusetts was conducting a criminal probe of the company as a result of the disaster. It was the largest U.S. natural gas pipeline accident since 2010 in terms of structures involved. Eight years ago, an interstate gas transmission line operated by Pacific Gas and Electric Co ruptured in San Bruno, California, killing eight people, destroying 38 buildings and damaging 70 others, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

2018-11-16,"(Corrects paragraph 13 to distinguish vegetation burning in two fires) By Terray Sylvester PARADISE, Calif., Nov 15 (Reuters) - The search for victims of a catastrophic blaze that reduced a northern California town to ashes intensified on Thursday as authorities posted an expanded list of nearly 300 people reported missing in the deadliest and most destructive wildfire in California history. At least 56 people have been confirmed dead so far in the Camp Fire, which erupted a week ago in the drought-parched Sierra foothills 175 miles (280 km) north of San Francisco and now ranks as one of the most lethal single U.S. wildfires since the turn of the last century. Authorities attributed the high death toll in part to the staggering speed with which the wind-driven flames, fueled by desiccated scrub, raced through Paradise, a town of 27,000 residents. Nearly 9,000 homes and other buildings, including most of the town, were incinerated last Thursday night, hours after the blaze erupted, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). What was left was a ghostly, smoky expanse of empty lots covered in ash and strewn with twisted wreckage and debris. Thousands of additional structures were still threatened by the blaze, and as many as 50,000 people remained under evacuation orders. An army of firefighters, many from distant states, labored to contain and suppress the flames. The revised official roster of 297 individuals whose whereabouts and fate remained unknown is more than double the number of people Butte County Sheriff Kory Honea said on Wednesday night had been reported missing by loved ones. Honea said the list of missing bit.ly/2BaiYxy would fluctuate as more names are added and others are removed, either because they turn up safe or come to be identified among the dead. The sheriff has asked relatives of the missing to submit DNA samples to hasten identification of the dead. But he acknowledged some of those unaccounted for may never be conclusively found. The Butte County disaster coincided with a flurry of smaller blazes in Southern California, most notably the Woolsey Fire, which has been linked with three fatalities and destroyed at least 500 structures in the mountains and foothills near the Malibu coast west of Los Angeles. The latest blazes have capped a pair of calamitous wildfire seasons in California that scientists largely attribute to prolonged drought they say is symptomatic of climate change. The White House said on Thursday that President Donald Trump, who has been criticized as having politicized the fires by casting blame on forest mismanagement, plans to visit the fire zones on Saturday to meet with displaced residents. Fire officials said the Woolsey Fire had little to do with forest management because it occurred mostly in dry brush, chaparral and oak woodlands, and the Paradise Fire began in an area consisting primarily of private timber and scrub not managed by the government. Cal Fire said that 40 percent of the Camp Fire’s perimeter had been contained, up from 35 percent, even as the footprint of the blaze grew 2,000 acres to 140,000 acres (57,000 hectares). Containment of the Woolsey fire grew to 57 percent. Those who survived the flames but lost their homes were adapting to a refugee lifestyle and many found a haven at a still-open Walmart store in Paradise. A section of the store’s parking lot was roped off for use as a distribution center for clothes, food and coffee, while people who fled their homes set up dozens of tents in an adjacent field or slept in their cars in the parking lot. Portable toilets were brought in. Evacuees milling in the parking lot faced morning temperatures that dropped into the mid-30s Fahrenheit and many wore breathing masks for protection from lingering smoke. Nicole and Eric Montague, along with their 16-year-old daughter, went to the Walmart parking lot for free food but have been living with extended family in nearby Chico, in a one-bedroom apartment filled with 15 people and nine dogs. They recounted being stunned at how swiftly the fire roared through Paradise. “We didn’t have any time to react,” Eric said. “The news didn’t even know the fire was coming. It just happened so quick.” Nicole said she decided to flee once her home’s mailbox caught fire and neighbors’ propane tanks began exploding. With approaching flames and immovable traffic, her evacuation with her daughter was so harrowing that she called Eric to say they were going to die. “I called him and said, ‘Honey, I’m not going to make it. I love you,’” Nicole said. Reporting by Terray Sylvester;

A Financial Times report said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has told some industry executives that another round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports has been put on hold. CNBC later reported that Lighthizer’s office had denied the story, but markets were cheered anyway.
