2019-01-17,"Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are bidding up prices for scarce types of crude oil needed for their most sophisticated plants as the United States reconsiders harsher sanctions on Venezuela that could further reduce imports of the country’s oil. Trump administration officials in recent days met with U.S. oil company executives to lay out potential actions in response to the Jan. 10 inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an election it considered illegitimate. Among other steps, U.S. officials have recognized the opposition-run Venezuelan congress as the only legitimately elected authority. But the proposals that would most affect the energy industry involve banning U.S. exports of refined products or limiting oil imports - a move that, until now, the White House has not taken even after sanctioning individuals and barring access to U.S. banks. “It’s more serious than I’ve heard before,” said a refining industry executive familiar with the White House discussions. “They are setting the table to pull the trigger if they have to.” U.S. refiners have few supply alternatives if the Trump administration were to cut off crude imports from that country. Supplies of the heavy oils preferred by Gulf Coast refiners have been harder to secure in recent months because of cutbacks and production curbs in Western Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. One type of U.S. heavy oil, called Mars, traded at a $6.80 per barrel premium to U.S. crude futures on Thursday, the strongest in nearly five years and up from a $4.50 per barrel premium on Tuesday, a U.S. oil broker said. U.S. oil companies that depend on Venezuelan oil have opposed past proposals that would halt imports and did so again this week, said several people close to the talks. Two big refiners, Phillips 66 and PBF Energy, cut their dependence on the South American country last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Latin American advisors have warned the administration that oil sanctions could backfire by making the United States appear too involved in the Venezuelan political crisis, said a person familiar with talks among the White House, the National Security Council and oil firms. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has become directly involved, accelerating possible financial and political steps against Maduro, the person said. State Department spokespeople were not immediately available for comment. Venezuela exported 500,013 barrels per day to the United States last year, down from 591,422 bpd in 2017. The largest U.S. importers of Venezuelan oil last year were Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA, Valero Energy, Chevron Corp and PBF Energy. Citgo, Valero and PBF Energy either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment. Chevron declined to comment on the potential for sanctions, but said it actively manages supplies and has plans in place to make necessary adjustments to ensure it can supply customers. White House officials are aware hitting Venezuela with oil sanctions could deepen the humanitarian crisis there and hurt U.S. businesses and consumers by raising fuel prices. “With regard to sanctions, all options are on the table,” said Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council who declined to discuss specifics of the deliberations. Mexico, a supplier of heavy crude, reported its production dropped to 1.72 million barrels per day in November, from 1.93 million bpd at the start of the year.

2019-01-17,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury in Detroit on Thursday indicted four managers at Volkswagen AG’s (VOWG_p.DE) luxury Audi unit as part of the U.S. government’s investigation into the German automaker’s diesel emissions cheating scandal, according to court documents. VW admitted in September 2015 to secretly installing software in nearly 500,000 U.S. vehicles to cheat government exhaust emissions tests and pleaded guilty in 2017 to felony charges. In total, 13 people have been charged in the United States, including the four Audi managers. Managers Richard Bauder, Axel Eiser, Stefan Knirsch and Carsten Nagel all worked in Audi’s engine development division in Germany. Bauder was head of Audi’s Diesel Engine Development department. A Justice Department spokesman said none are in custody. All are believed to be in Germany. Lawyers for the four could not immediately be identified. The government previously indicted one former Audi manager in July 2017, Giovanni Pamio. The new indictment is a significant expansion of the government’s criminal probe. The four managers are charged in a 12-count indictment with conspiring to evade U.S. emissions standards in diesel vehicles sold in the United States with 3.0-liter engines. The vehicles include the 2009-2015 Audi Q7 vehicles as well as other Q5, A6, A7 and A8 diesel models and VW Touareg vehicles. They are accused of wire fraud, violating the Clean Air Act and conspiracy. Volkswagen spokesman Pietro Zollino said the company continues “to cooperate with investigations by the Department of Justice into the conduct of individuals. It would not be appropriate to comment on individual cases.” The indictment said the Audi managers realized they could not meet U.S. pollution standards given design constraints by Audi “including the need for a large trunk and high-end sound system.” Audi engineers told Bauder in 2008 that unless the tank was larger “Audi had to cheat to pass U.S. emissions tests” and ensure that drivers could go 10,000 miles between dealer service visits, the indictment said. In total, Volkswagen has agreed to pay more than $25 billion in the United States for claims from owners, environmental regulators, states and dealers, and has offered to buy back about 500,000 polluting U.S. vehicles. The buybacks will continue through 2019. In 2017, VW also pleaded guilty to fraud, obstruction of justice and falsifying statements in a U.S. court. Under the plea deal, the automaker agreed to sweeping reforms, new audits and oversight by an independent monitor for three years. U.S. prosecutors previously charged former VW Chief Executive Officer Martin Winterkorn, who remains in Germany. Two other former VW executives have pleaded guilty in the investigation and are in prison. Germany does not typically extradite its citizens for prosecution in U.S. courts. Former Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was not among those indicted. He is being investigated in Germany for his alleged role.  VW in October terminated Stadler’s contract against the backdrop of a criminal investigation into whether he was involved in emissions cheating.

2019-01-17,"MADRID, Jan 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world has made far too little progress on the global goals governments agreed in 2015 to end poverty and hunger and tackle climate change, with a rising tide of nationalism acting as a wrecking ball, architects of the goals said on Thursday. Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister who headed the United Nations Development Programme from 2009-2017, said the foot-dragging on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - due to be met by 2030 - “has gone under the radar”. “There has been ... a lot of lip service but not enough action,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on the sidelines of a debate on how to meet the 17 global goals, hosted by the Spanish government. For example, the number of hungry people in the world has gone up three years in a row after falling, which Clark said was “undoubtedly related to climate change and displacement”. And on current estimates, 6 percent of the global population - or close to half a billion people - would still be living in extreme poverty by 2030, she said. Changes in the world’s political landscape have also made the 2030 goals more elusive. Clark said the unity of the international community that had allowed the SDGs and Paris Agreement on climate change to be adopted in 2015 had been shattered by a shift to the political right in countries such as the United States and Brazil. Sealing those deals would no longer be possible today because of the disruptive impact of the United States under President Donald Trump, she said. The U.S. leader has given notice he wants to pull out of the Paris accord on climate change, and refused to join a new global compact on migration. “You’ve got a major country missing in action, and that takes the pressure off others to act, including China and India,” Clark said. Both are still investing in coal-fired power plants despite signalling a shift away from dirty energy, she added. Jeffrey Sachs, a U.S. economics professor who advised governments and the United Nations on the SDGs, said “nothing” had happened at the global level in the past three years. “Somehow we’re trying to make a global change with no one in charge,” he told the Madrid event. Sachs, director of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, blamed slow movement on the SDGs and the Paris Agreement on a dearth of leadership, the unfairness of the economic system, and the lack of a plan for putting the 2015 agenda into practice. He pointed to the world’s 2,200 billionaires whose wealth adds up to about $9 trillion, and called for a tax of at least 1 percent on the net worth of those individuals, which he said would raise close to $100 billion per year to get education to every child on the planet. Both Sachs and Clark said the problem lay not with a lack of solutions to the world’s ills - whether using clean energy or getting basic services to those in need - but governments’ abdication of responsibility towards citizens, many of whom are trying to push ahead. Sachs said change would eventually happen. The world would end up with wind and solar power as the basis of its energy system in the middle of the century, while everyone would be driving electric vehicles in 30 years, for example. ""I guarantee we're going to do the right thing at some point,"" he said. ""It's obvious, but how hard it is to move!"" (Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Jason Fields.

2019-01-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global stock indexes rose on Thursday as optimism over a resolution to the trade war between the United States and China lifted sentiment, while sterling strengthened amid hopes of a second referendum on Britain’s membership in the European Union. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the internal deliberations.    U.S. stocks rallied following the report, but pared some of those gains after a Treasury spokesperson told CNBC that Mnuchin had not made any such recommendations. “The market wants to hear some positive trade news. The way it’s acted since that Christmas Eve low, the market is expecting to hear at least something incrementally positive,” said Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis. S&P 500 industrials .SPLRCI, which have been sensitive to trade developments, ended up 1.7 percent, among the biggest gains of S&P sectors. Also boosting the industrials were shares of defence contractors Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N), which rose after President Donald Trump unveiled a revamped U.S. missile defence strategy.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 162.94 points, or 0.67 percent, to 24,370.1, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 19.86 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,635.96 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 49.77 points, or 0.71 percent, to 7,084.46. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.40 percent. Earlier in the day, some investors took heart from Beijing’s confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will head to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington. Recent talks to resolve a protracted trade battle between the U.S. and China brought little progress.  Adding to concerns was legislation introduced by U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei HWT.UL or other Chinese telecommunications equipment makers that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. The British pound rose to a two-month high against the euro EURGBP= and GBP= firmed towards a two-month high against the dollar. It was trading up 0.77 percent at $1.298, its highest since Nov. 15. Prime Minister Theresa May has been meeting lawmakers from all parties in an attempt to find a way out of an impasse over how Britain should leave the EU, after May’s own plan was rejected by parliament on Tuesday.  While she has repeatedly rejected the idea of a second referendum, a vocal campaign in favour of holding a new vote has the support of some lawmakers.       U.S. Treasury yields rose with the benchmark 10-year yield reaching near three-week highs as better-than-expected economic data and hopes for progress in U.S.-China trade talks diminished safe-haven demand for government debt. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 6/32 in price to yield 2.7486 percent, compared with 2.729 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices steadied, boosted by a rebound in U.S. equities and news that OPEC sharply curtailed production in December, after earlier losses on fears about surging U.S. crude output and weakening global demand.

2019-01-17,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Thursday, boosted by a rebound in U.S. equities and news that OPEC sharply curtailed production in December, after earlier losses on fears about surging U.S. crude output and weakening global demand. Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 slipped 14 cents to settle at $61.18 a barrel after trading as low as $60.04 intraday. U.S. crude futures CLc1 fell 24 cents to settle at $52.07 a barrel, up from a low of $50.98. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, in its monthly market report, cut its forecast for average daily demand for its crude in 2019 to 30.83 million barrels, down 910,000 bpd from the 2018 average. [OPEC/M]  However, OPEC also said it cut oil output by 751,000 bpd in December before a new accord to limit supply took effect, suggesting that producers have made a strong start to averting a glut in 2019. The group and its allies plan to meet on April 17-18 in Vienna to review the supply reduction deal that began in January.  “One thing we’ve seen in the past - and I think we’ll see it again - is that when OPEC over the last couple of years has decided to cut, they’ve followed through,” said Tony Headrick, energy market analyst at St. Paul, Minnesota, commodity brokerage CHS Hedging LLC.  Even as the OPEC-led cuts reduce supplies, U.S. output neared 12 million bpd last week. Some traders and investors are concerned that growth in global supply this year will outpace demand. “That was a key factor in the losses overnight,” Headrick said. U.S. crude output has climbed by 2.4 million bpd since January 2018 and stockpiles of crude and refined products have risen sharply, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed. [EIA/S] Wall Street’s main indexes were slightly higher, helping to steady oil futures, which sometimes track equities. [.N]  In response to the drop in price in the second half of last year, OPEC and non-members elected to cut production by a joint 1.2 million bpd this year. Oil is still about 20 percent above the lows reached in late December. Analysts said Brent has been trading in the low $60s and U.S. crude in the low $50s due to ongoing nervousness about relations between Washington and Beijing, and China’s economic outlook. For Brent to return to $70 per barrel, the market needs to “not have negative news emerging around U.S.-China trade talks that caused high levels of angst and de-risking last December,” BNP Paribas head of commodities Harry Tchilinguirian said in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.

2019-01-17,"PARIS (Reuters) - Hitachi’s decision to freeze its $28 billion nuclear power project in Britain strengthens the hand of France’s EDF and its Chinese partner in talks with the government on how to finance new reactors. Funding new nuclear plants has become critical as Hitachi became the second Japanese firm to say its British nuclear power project had hit the buffers over financing. The two projects would have covered about 13 percent of Britain’s power needs. EDF and its partner China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) want to use a financing model under which investors in their nuclear projects receive payment from the moment they start construction, reducing their risk. But to proceed with this approach, the government must first win over lawmakers and consumers, already frustrated by hefty energy bills and costly nuclear projects that often face delays. “The question is whether it is sellable to parliament that all the risks go to the public. But if that is not the case, they will get no investors,” said Stephen Thomas, emeritus professor of energy policy at Greenwich University.  EDF is negotiating with the government on funding the Sizewell C project using the so-called regulated asset base model in which investors earn a government-set fixed return from the start, instead of waiting years until construction is completed before receiving a return. China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) has a 20 percent stake in Sizewell C, while EDF has a 33.5 percent stake in CGN’s project to build a reactor at Bradwell, Essex. “If new nuclear is to be successful in a more competitive energy market – which I very much believe it can be – we need to consider a new approach to financing future projects,” Energy Secretary Greg Clark told parliament, saying this included Sizewell and Bradwell. He addressed lawmakers after Hitachi said it had failed to find private equity investors, even though the government had considered partly funding it with taxpayer’s money. That announcement followed Toshiba’s decision in November to scrap its NuGen project in Britain after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer for the plan. Specialists say both projects were doomed from the start. Only utilities have the steady cash flows to fund such long-term projects, but most European utilities pulled out of Britain’s nuclear plans after the 2011 Fukushima disaster led to rising safety costs and as renewable energy became a more competitive investment prospect. The regulated asset base model may now be one of the few remaining options to fund new nuclear plants in Europe. It is commonly used to fund construction of electricity transmission lines and, in Britain, has been used to fund the Thames Tideway Tunnel, a “super sewer” for London. “Dialogue about a regulated asset base financing model for Sizewell C is progressing,” an EDF official said.  But the model has not be used in the nuclear industry, so talks are likely to be tough as the government seeks a clear outline of how much it would have to spend over a specified period and works to avoid writing a blank cheque to cover cost overruns. The government intends to publish its assessment by the summer at the latest. For now, the only nuclear plant under construction in Britain is EDF’s Hinkley Point C project, in which CGN also has a 33.5 percent stake. The deal to fund that plant involved EDF taking on the financing and bearing the full risk for construction delays or cost overruns. In return, it was guaranteed a power price of up to 92.50 pounds per megawatt-hour for 35 years, more than twice the market rate when signed. That drew fierce criticism from lawmakers and the public for being too generous and there are no plans to repeat it. After the Hitachi and Toshiba announcements, the government is now depending on just EDF and CGN to deliver on its plans for a fleet of new reactors to meet energy demand as it phases out old nuclear facilities and coal-fired plants. “Britain’s energy security and decarbonisation strategy are hanging by a thread,” said French consultant Thibault Laconde.

2019-01-17,"(Adds comments by Don Evans) HOUSTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Former U.S. Commerce Secretary and energy executive Don Evans will chair a partnership of top energy companies that have pledged $100 million toward easing the civic strain of the shale oil and gas boom in West Texas and New Mexico, the group said on Thursday. The Permian Strategic Partnership was formed late last year to ease the strain on health care, education, housing and the workforce created by companies flocking to the Permian Basin. Its 19 members include Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips , Occidental Petroleum Corp, Pioneer Natural Resources and Royal Dutch Shell PLC. The nation’s largest oil field is expected to pump 3.8 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) this month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Evans, who started his career working on a rig for Tom Brown Inc and eventually became its chief executive, served as commerce secretary during the administration of former President George W. Bush. He is a longtime resident of Midland, Texas, where the partnership will be based. Restaurants, local governments and other employers in the area have come under pressure with staff leaving for oilfield jobs. Midland’s unemployment rate was 2.1 percent in October, compared to the nation’s 3.7 percent rate. The last decade’s shale boom has led to school overcrowding, soaring traffic fatalities, drug abuse and strains on the power grid. The region needs more pediatricians, better schools and affordable housing to attract families, Evans said. While oil and gas workers can afford rising rents, “it’s the teachers and nurses and other support services that you need in any community that it’s tough on,” he added. The partnership has started holding community meetings in the region and is still recruiting staff. It has no timetable or plan yet on how to spend the initial $100 million contribution, though Evans said the group is set up to receive and consider grant applications.

S&P 500 industrials rose, led by defense contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman , after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a revamped U.S. missile defense strategy. Also among sectors with the biggest gains were materials and health care, a sector that has been a laggard this year after having outperformed all other major S&P sectors in 2018. “Stocks have been supported this year by a lot of rebalancing that’s going on. There is a ritual in the stock market of buying what was down the most or selling what was up the most the prior year,” said John Augustine, chief investment officer for Huntington Private Bank in Cincinnati. Those gains helped to offset declines in other areas. Morgan Stanley shares fell after it reported disappointing earnings, hot on the heels of similarly weak numbers from JPMorgan Chase earlier in the week. Investors have also begun to worry  that the U.S. government shutdown is taking a toll on the U.S. economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week that it continues. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 17.53 points, or 0.07 percent, to 24,224.69, the S&P 500 gained 8.52 points, or 0.33 percent, to 2,624.62 and the Nasdaq Composite added 19.31 points, or 0.27 percent, to 7,054.00. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.04 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.20 percent. Some investors took heart from Beijing’s confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will head to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington. Recent talks to resolve a protracted trade battle between the U.S. and China brought little progress. Adding to concerns was legislation introduced by U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei or other Chinese telecommunications equipment makers that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses. European banks tumbled after France’s Societe Generale issued a profit warning, and carmakers skidded after U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought President Donald Trump was “inclined” to impose tariffs on European cars. Sterling firmed toward a two-month high against the dollar. It was last trading up 0.7 percent at $1.297. As expected, British Prime Minister May narrowly won a confidence vote late Wednesday and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit agreement. An outline for a Brexit Plan B reut.rs/2TVKYfe is due by next Monday and markets are currently assuming that with no easy way forward for May she will have to extend the date of Britain's exit from the European Union past the scheduled March 29. “Risk assets are performing well as of late, despite what’s happening with the Brexit situation. The confidence vote was a positive step for May,” said Charlie Ripley, senior investment strategist at Allianz Investment Management in Minneapolis. U.S. Treasury yields ticked up as better-than-expected economic data offset the trade tensions between China and the United States, holding down safe-haven bids for U.S. government debt. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 1/32 in price to yield 2.7325 percent, compared with 2.729 percent late on Wednesday.

2019-01-17,"Jan 17 (Reuters) - Facing a colder winter than usual, Southern California Gas said it will pull more natural gas from the Aliso Canyon storage facility, which has been treated as an asset of last resort since a massive leak in 2015-16 resulted in evacuation of a neighborhood. SoCalGas, a unit of California energy company Sempra Energy , said it needs to draw gas from Aliso Canyon so it can limit reductions at other storage caverns to preserve supplies in case the weather remains cold later this winter. “We are experiencing colder weather than last winter and already have less gas in our non-Aliso storage fields than this time last year,” SoCalGas said in a filing with state regulators made available this week. The utility said it needs gas from its storage fields to bolster what its pipelines can deliver to meet consumer heating demand on the coldest winter days. Aliso is the biggest field for SoCalGas, but the utility is limited in what it can pull out of Aliso following the massive leak between October 2015 and February 2016. After the leak, the state mandated Aliso can be used only to maintain system reliability after all other storage facilities and pipelines have been exhausted. “If Southern California experiences persistent cold weather conditions...our storage assets will not be positioned to respond, unless we act now,” SoCalGas said in explaining why it would pull more gas out of Aliso to preserve supplies in other caverns. Gas supplies were expected to remain tight in Southern California this winter due to limitations on several SoCalGas pipelines and reduced availability of Aliso. SoCalGas projected demand would average 2.8 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) for the rest of January. Most of that gas will come from other regions flowing into the state on the utility’s pipelines, but some will have to come from its storage facilities. On Jan. 2, for example, the utility’s pipelines delivered just 2.3 bcfd of the system’s 3.5 bcfd of demand. The rest came from storage. SoCalGas said its non-Aliso storage fields were only able to deliver 0.880 bcfd, down from 1.036 bcfd before Dec. 26. The SoCalGas website said about 60.3 bcf of gas is left in storage, most of it in Aliso, down from 62.2 bcf a year ago and well off the five-year (2014-2018) average of 69.2 bcf. SoCalGas has also urged consumers to reduce gas use, especially when temperatures are extremely cold, and has worked with electric grid operators to limit the amount of gas power plants burn.

2019-01-17,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany should finish the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline despite U.S. opposition and growing domestic concerns, but future energy projects should be coordinated by the European Union, a veteran German diplomat said on Thursday. Wolfgang Ischinger, chairman of the Munich Security Conference, said the initial “birth defect” of the $11 billion project was the fact that European treaties had allowed the German government to deem the project as purely commercial. In fact, he told reporters, it was clear that such a large project clearly had a political nature, particularly given Russia’s annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and other actions in recent years. The pipeline, which would carry gas straight to Germany under the Baltic Sea, has been criticized in some quarters because it would deprive Ukraine of lucrative gas transit fees, potentially making Kiev more vulnerable in the future. Germany and Russia have been at odds since Moscow annexed Crimea, but both countries have a common interest in the pipeline, which will double capacity of the current route. Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM) is building the project jointly with Western partners Uniper (UN01.DE), Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Engie (ENGIE.PA), OMV (OMVV.VI) and Shell (RDSa.AS).  Ischinger cautioned against abandoning the project as it neared its completion date of late 2019, citing German foreign policy’s focus on consistency and sustainability. “Saying ‘forget it’ now would not be good German foreign policy.” The U.S. ambassador in Berlin, Richard Grenell, drew fire this week for telling German companies involved in the project that they could face sanctions if they continued with the plan that is already far advanced. Germany says U.S. sanctions against Nord Stream 2 would be the wrong way to solve the dispute.

2019-01-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC cut oil output sharply in December before a new accord to limit supply took effect, it said on Thursday, suggesting that producers have made a strong start to averting a glut in 2019 as a slowing economy curbs demand. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said in a monthly report that its oil output fell by 751,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December to 31.58 million bpd, the biggest month-on-month drop in almost two years. Worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies, OPEC and allies including Russia agreed in December to return to production cuts in 2019. They pledged to lower output by 1.2 million bpd, of which OPEC’s share is 800,000 bpd. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo told Reuters that producers were seeking to avoid a build-up in the industrialised world’s oil inventories above the five-year average. They were above that mark in November, figures in OPEC’s report showed. “We are not yet out of the winter woods,” he said. “The oil industry cannot afford to relapse into another downturn,” he said in reference to a 2014-2016 oil market slump. The supply reduction in December means that if OPEC fully implements the new Jan. 1 cut, it will avoid a surplus that could weaken prices. Oil LCOc1 slid from $86 a barrel in October to less than $50 in December on concerns over excess supply.  OPEC expects 2019 global oil demand growth to slow to 1.29 million bpd from 1.5 million in 2018, though it was more upbeat about the economic backdrop than last month and cited better sentiment in the oil market, where crude is back above $60. “While the economic risk remains skewed to the downside, the likelihood of a moderation in monetary tightening is expected to slow the decelerating economic growth trend in 2019,” OPEC said in the report. Barkindo added that he remains optimistic that “healthy demand” would hold this year. The supply cut was a policy U-turn after the producer alliance known as OPEC+ agreed in June 2018 to boost supply amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower prices and cover an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. OPEC changed course after the slide in prices starting in October. A previous OPEC+ supply curb starting in January 2017 - when OPEC production fell by 890,000 bpd according to OPEC figures - got rid of the 2014-2016 glut. The group confirmed on its website that it plans to meet over April 17-18 in Vienna to review the supply cut agreement. OPEC sources said another meeting could follow in June. The biggest drop in OPEC supply last month came from Saudi Arabia and amounted to 468,000 bpd, the report showed. Saudi supply in November had hit a record above 11 million bpd after President Trump demanded more oil be pumped. The kingdom told OPEC that it lowered supply to 10.64 million bpd in December and has said it plans to go even further in January by delivering a larger cut than required under the OPEC+ deal. The second-largest was an involuntary cut by Libya, where unrest led to the shutdown of the country’s biggest oilfield. Iran registered the third-largest decline in output, also involuntary, as U.S. sanctions that started in November discouraged companies from buying its oil.  Iran, Libya and Venezuela are exempt from the 2019 supply pact and are expected by some analysts to post further falls, giving a tailwind to the voluntary effort by the others. OPEC said in the report that 2019 demand for its crude would decline to 30.83 million bpd, a drop of 910,000 bpd from 2018, as rivals pump more and the slowing economy curbs demand.  Delivering the 800,000 bpd cut from December’s level should mean the group would be pumping slightly less than the expected demand for its crude this year and so avoid a surplus. Last month’s report had pointed to a surplus. The figures for OPEC production and demand for its crude were lowered by about 600,000 bpd to reflect Qatar’s exit from the group, which now has 14 members.

2019-01-17,"(Reuters) - Canadian oil producer Husky Energy (HSE.TO) shocked investors on Thursday when it abandoned its hostile bid for MEG Energy (MEG.TO), saying it could not win sufficient MEG shareholder support after Alberta’s government ordered production cuts to reduce a crude glut. MEG’s shares plummeted 36 percent in Toronto, while Husky stock jumped 12 percent. The bid reflected Husky’s strategy to double down on heavy oil production even though clogged pipelines drove down Canadian prices. But market conditions changed dramatically since Husky’s September offer, and Canadian prices surged this month after the provincial government ordered temporary production cuts. In a statement, Husky said the government intervention and a lack of progress on expanding pipelines hurt the “business and economic environment.” While production cuts have helped some producers, integrated companies like Husky previously benefited from processing cheap oil in its refineries. Alberta’s move and declines since autumn in global crude prices likely swayed Husky not to extend its offer and try to complete the deal, CIBC analyst Jon Morrison said in a note. Husky was expecting to secure over 50 percent support from MEG’s shareholders, people familiar with the situation told Reuters on Wednesday ahead of its deadline. It had offered to buy MEG for C$11 in cash per share or 0.485 of a Husky share. Those Husky shares lost nearly one-third of their value since the offer, however, making the bid less attractive.       “Given the outcome of the tender process, Husky will continue to focus on capital discipline and the delivery of the five-year plan,” Husky Chief Executive Officer Rob Peabody said in a statement. Husky did not say how much support it received.  Husky last week put a refinery in British Columbia and a chain of gas stations up for sale, deeming them “non-core.”  In a statement, MEG Chief Executive Derek Evans said the result confirms the offer did not recognize the company’s quality and long-term potential. The heavy oil producer is now likely to return to its plan to expand production, according to AltaCorp Capital.   Hostile takeovers are rare in the Canadian energy sector. Suncor Energy’s (SU.TO) hostile bid for Canadian Oil Sands in 2015 met with resistance before they agreed to a sweetened deal. Husky had argued its bid gave investors exposure to Husky’s stronger balance sheet.   MEG shares were down 36 percent at C$5.48 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, while Husky stock was 12 percent higher at C$17.47.

2019-01-17,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A steep downturn in U.S. ethanol output linked to the trade war with China is raising costs for American farmers who feed a byproduct of the corn-based biofuel to hogs, cattle and chickens. Sales of the feed, known as distillers’ dried grains, or DDGs, were one of the bright spots for ethanol makers such as Green Plains Inc (GPRE.O), Valero Energy Corp VLO.N. and Pacific Ethanol Inc (PEIX.O) after China all but stopped buying corn ethanol, contributing to oversupply. But now cuts to ethanol production are tightening supplies of DDGs and raising prices paid by livestock farmers. Many are turning to other feeds including soybean meal, the price of which eased as China halted imports of American soybeans.  While soymeal is more expensive than DDGs, it is also more nutritious for livestock and therefore more cost-effective at current prices. The shift away from DDGs is another blow to a struggling biofuel sector. Robust demand for DDGs had been a buffer as the lowest ethanol prices in over a decade dragged on the industry. The Maschhoffs, the largest U.S. family-owned pork producer, roughly halved DDG use from the autumn to December due to routine cost assessments, nutrition director Omarh Mendoza said. DDGs formerly accounted for up to 30 percent of hogs’ rations, he said, but the Carlyle, Illinois-based company now is using more corn and soymeal instead. “A lot of ethanol is not being produced and therefore there’s not a whole lot of product out there,” Mendoza said about DDGs. Ethanol makers slashed production rates last year due in part to negative profit margins, according to the companies and traders.   Green Plains, the fourth largest U.S. producer, also put several plants up for sale, complaining of burdensome biofuel supplies. The cuts in output pushed up prices of DDGs and prompted switching to soymeal, company spokesman Jim Stark said. Still, more reductions in ethanol output were necessary as supplies continued to outpace demand, Stark added.  U.S. ethanol inventories this month climbed to a near-record of over 23 million barrels even as output slowed to the lowest in over six months, Energy Information Administration data showed. Prices for DDGs in the eastern half of Iowa, the top ethanol producing state, surged to $180 per ton in December, the highest in 3-1/2 years, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Meanwhile, soymeal prices in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, were more stable, averaging $283 per ton last month.  Soymeal has more protein than DDGs, making it more expensive. However, in Cedar Rapids, soymeal’s premium to DDGs reached just $103 per ton in mid-December, the smallest since 2012, the data showed. The shift from DDGs is largely in the hog sector, a DDGs trader working for a publicly traded company said. Cattle generally are not fed as much soymeal and need fiber from DDGs, he said. Hog producers are cutting the percentage of DDGs in their rations to as little as 10 percent from 30 percent due to high prices, said swine nutritionist John Goihl, who owns 3-D Nutrition Services in Shakopee, Minnesota. Farmers are reluctant to abandon DDGs completely because they provide energy, amino acids and phosphorus important for healthy animals, he said, meaning that producers absorb some of the price increase. “They’ll stay at the lower levels unless this DDG price relationship really gets out of hand,” Goihl said. China, formerly the top importer of both DDGs and ethanol, last year stopped buying U.S. products due to the trade war.  Thailand recently halted imports of U.S. DDGs, too, over concerns about beetles found in two shipments. U.S. exports of DDGs have remained robust elsewhere in Asia and in Mexico.  “DDGs had really helped keep the ethanol industry going when ethanol prices were low, and supplement margins,” said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist for U.S. broker INTL FCStone.

2019-01-17,"* Q3 consolidated net profit a record 102.5 bln rupees * Consumer business contribute more than 25 pct to EBITDA * Refining will continue to be weak, said Reliance exec (Adds details from press conference, quotes) By Promit Mukherjee and Tanvi Mehta Jan 17 (Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries on Thursday posted record quarterly profit driven by its telecoms, retail and petrochemicals businesses, which offset the impact of a weaker refining margins due to volatile crude prices. The results saw the conglomerate making progress in its drive, announced last year, to make its consumer businesses eventually as large as its core energy operations, which are also struggling with slowing growth in China. “Consumer business now contributes more than 25 percent of the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and profit),” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer said, referring to the telecoms and retail businesses. The businesses contributed around 12 percent to EBITDA in 2017. Net profit on a consolidated basis rose to 102.5 billion rupees ($1.44 billion) in October-December, beating analysts’ average estimate of 96.48 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Consolidated revenue grew 56.4 percent to 1.60 trillion rupees. Gross refining margin (GRM) - the profit earned on each barrel of crude processed - was $8.8 per barrel for the quarter, the lowest for 16 quarters but outperforming the benchmark Singapore complex margin by $4.5 per barrel. Operating profit from refining fell 18 percent year-on-year, despite a 47 percent jump in revenues from that business. Srikanth said that while there would be short-term weakness in refining, the company could cope due to its ability to process a wide variety of crudes and a diversified business portfolio. Reliance’s refinery in the western state of Gujarat is the world’s biggest single-location refinery, with a capacity to process 1.36 million barrels per day of crude. The telecoms business is central to the ambition of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, to boost the company’s consumer operations. In the last two years, Reliance’s telecoms start-up Jio has used cut-price data and free voice calls to corner over 250 million subscribers, leaving rivals nursing losses. Jio posted a nearly 65 percent jump in quarterly profit to 8.31 billion rupees ($117 million). The company said last month it would hive off its tower and fibre assets, a move that could help sell or list the assets in future. “We’re in the process of de-merging our tower and fibre business and the end objective will be to have different set of investors who would want to run these companies,” said Srikanth. “This means that these assets go off our balance sheets so the liabilities also go down,” he added. Reliance’s outstanding debt in the end of December was around $40 billion, while cash and cash equivalents was $11 billion.

Disappointing earnings in the U.S. from Morgan Stanley , hot on the heels of similarly weak numbers from JP Morgan Chase earlier in the week, hurt sentiment on Wall Street. Morgan Stanley shares slumped more than 5 percent. Gains in U.S. healthcare and consumer discretionary shares offset the losses, leaving the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 equity index nearly flat. Investors have been worried, too, that the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on the U.S. economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week that it continues. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.31 points, or 0.11 percent, to 24,179.85, the S&P 500 gained 3.06 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,619.16 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.39 points, or 0.13 percent, to 7,044.08. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.08 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.03 percent. Some investors took heart from Beijing’s confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will head to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington. Recent talks to resolve a protracted trade battle between the U.S. and China brought little progress. Adding to recent worries was news that U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei or other Chinese telecoms firms that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. “Concerns about trade policy have been simmering there for a while,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses. European banks tumbled after France’s Societe Generale issued a profit warning, and carmakers skidded after U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought President Donald Trump was “inclined” to impose tariffs on European cars. Sterling firmed towards a two-month high against the dollar. It was trading 0.3 percent up at $1.292, inching towards a mid-November high of $1.293. As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won a confidence vote overnight and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit agreement. An outline for Plan B reut.rs/2TVKYfe is due by next Monday and markets are currently assuming that with no easy way forward for May she will have to extend the date of Britain's exit from the European Union past the scheduled March 29. U.S. Treasury yields ticked up as better-than-expected economic data offset the trade tensions between China and the United States, holding down safe-haven bids for U.S. government debt. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 3/32 in price to yield 2.7378 percent, from 2.729 percent late on Wednesday. Oil prices fell after U.S. crude production neared an unprecedented 12 million barrels per day (bpd). Brent crude was last down $0.82, or 1.34 percent, at $60.5 a barrel.

2019-01-17,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish gas distributor Palmet is in talks to acquire the Turkey energy business of Germany’s EWE, an official from Palmet said on Thursday, after Azeri state firm SOCAR confirmed it had withdrawn from discussions to buy the assets. Reuters reported last month that SOCAR was negotiating to acquire EWE’s Turkish business, which includes gas distribution networks in the industrial cities of Bursa and Kayseri. The acquisition was due to be completed in the first quarter of this year. However, a SOCAR official said it had now withdrawn from the negotiations, without giving a reason. A representative for Palmet said it was in advanced talks for the assets, and would pay between 130 million and 150 million euros ($148-170 million). An EWE spokesman declined to comment.  EWE, the fourth-largest natural gas supplier in Turkey in terms of customers, has said it was looking to sell its local distribution units after being hit by the weakening lira. The lira lost 30 percent of its value last year, putting pressure on companies, particularly in energy and construction, that have large foreign debts and lira-denominated revenue.  Palmet has gas distribution businesses in the Gebze district of Kocaeli province and the eastern city of Erzurum.  EWE’s energy operation in Turkey includes gas distributors Bursagaz and Kayserigaz. It also includes the EWE Enerji and Enervis businesses, which are involved in energy trade and service, according to its annual report.

2019-01-17,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway’s Aker BP will boost dividend payments between now and 2023 and step up investment in developing offshore oil and gas fields next year, the independent oil company said on Thursday. The result of a 2016 merger between the Norwegian operations of BP and the Det norske oil firm owned by Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, Aker BP has become the second largest license holder on the Norwegian continental shelf. While Aker BP expects its output to be broadly flat year-on- year in 2019 at between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), it aims to about triple the production to around 440,000 boepd by 2025. After paying a dividend of $450 million for 2018, the company aims to raise its 2019 payout to $750 million, $200 million more than previously planned, and then gradually increase it to $1.15 billion in 2023, it said. (GRAPHIC: Aker BP dividend plan - tmsnrt.rs/2AJTLJZ) “The most surprising piece of information was 2019 dividend guidance ... well above consensus’s expectations of $550 million,”  Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said. “As the company is increasing its production, and the production costs are falling, then dividends should be trending upwards. That’s simple,” Aker BP’s outgoing Chief Financial Officer Alexander Krane told an investor presentation. He told Reuters the company could stick to its new dividend plan even if the price of North Sea oil falls back to $50 a barrel, where it stood at the end of 2018. Brent was trading at over $60 a barrel on Thursday. The aggressive dividend policy sent Oslo-listed Aker BP shares up 5.2 percent by 1455 GMT, outperforming the European oil and gas index which was down 0.3 percent. The company also said it would raise capital expenditure by a third to $1.6 billion between 2018 and 2019, and its exploration spending by 40 percent to $500 million over the same period as it planned to drill 15 exploration wells, an annual record. Evy Gloerstad-Clark, Aker BP’s new exploration head, said the company’s ambition was to become the leading explorer on the Norwegian continental shelf, changing gear in its strategy. “Looking at the market from 2013 and onwards, it was cheaper to buy than to find oil, but the trends are changing, and in 2018 it was cheaper to explore for oil and gas instead of buying,” she told the investors’ presentation. Holding company Aker ASA, controlled by Roekke, owns a 40 percent stake in Aker BP, while BP owns 30 percent.

2019-01-17,"(Adds details, background) By Chijioke Ohuocha LAGOS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Nigerian energy firm Forte Oil plans to enter into talks to sell its power unit to its major investor, billionaire Femi Otedola, after it failed to secure a deal via a public tender. Forte said in a statement it was seeking shareholder approval in a vote on Feb. 7 to start talks with Otedola. Otedola will not take part in the vote, it added. Forte plans to use proceeds from the sale to expand its fuel retailing unit, its main focus. Amperion Power Distribution Company Limited, Forte’s power subsidiary, paid $132 million to acquire a 414 megawatt power plant six years ago under a government-led privatisation scheme meant to tackle decades of chronic blackouts. Forte also imports fuel and car lubricants, which it resells at petrol stations. Nigeria’s retail fuel sector operates under a tightly regulated fixed margins, and so requires a lot of capital to expand. The sector could be deregulated given its impact on the Nigerian currency and import bill. Last year, Forte decided to sell its power generating unit, upstream services business and downstream venture in Ghana to focus on its fuel distribution operation at home. The company said on Thursday that Otedola had shown interest in bidding for the power unit and that his proposal would be reviewed by management and an independent adviser. A public tender to sell the power asset received “unexpectedly low interest”, Forte said, adding that pricing proposals it received did not meet its expectation. Shares in Forte rose 2.55 percent on Thursday to 30.15 naira, valuing the company at 39.3 billion naira ($128 million). Otedola has also agreed to sell his 75 percent interest in Forte Oil’s downstream business, with the deal expected to close in the first quarter. $1 = 306.35 naira

2019-01-17,"LONDON (Reuters) - Oil traders seem increasingly convinced OPEC’s prompt action in cutting production will be enough to offset the impact of rising shale production and slowing global growth. Brent futures prices have stabilised around $60 per barrel in recent sessions, well below the peak of over $85 at the start of October, but significantly higher than the trough of less than $50 in late December. More importantly, Brent’s six-month calendar spread has strengthened from a contango (discount) of almost $1.80 per barrel to just 35 cents over the same period. Calendar spreads have been correlated with the changing balance between production and consumption, alternating between contango and backwardation as the market cycles between over- and under-supply. The narrowing discount on futures for early delivery in recent weeks indicates traders expect the market to be less oversupplied than before. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Hixl8t) Stronger spreads suggest OPEC’s cuts have succeeded in shifting market expectations about the outlook for 2019. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have implemented substantial reductions in production and exports during December and the first part of January. OPEC crude production declined by 750,000 barrels per day in December, according to industry sources surveyed by the OPEC secretariat. Most of the reduction came from Saudi Arabia (470,000 bpd), but there were also substantial cuts from Iran (160,000 bpd) and Libya (170,000 bpd) as a result of U.S. sanctions and domestic unrest respectively. Saudi Arabia has said its output will decline even further this month as the kingdom attempts to avoid an accumulation of excess oil inventories. By acting quickly and aggressively, Saudi Arabia and its allies hope to avert an extended period of over-production and a sharper drop in prices, and early evidence suggests they have succeeded. The biggest uncertainty is still from the global economic outlook, where OPEC acknowledged in its most recent monthly report that risks to world growth “remain skewed to the downside”. If global growth slows further, the potential for an oil market surplus will re-emerge, and OPEC members will come under pressure to reduce output even further. However, the organisation is hopeful the major central banks will respond to signs of an economic slowdown by becoming less aggressive in tightening monetary policy. The result would be an easing of financial conditions, a weaker dollar, and a soft landing for the global economy and oil market in 2019. (“Monthly Oil Market Report”, OPEC, Jan. 17) Most traders and hedge funds favour the soft-landing scenario rather than a hard-landing or a re-acceleration of growth. Fund positioning in the main crude and fuels futures contracts is close to neutral. In practice, there are substantial risks in both directions. Faster-than-expected growth would leave the market short of crude, hedge funds racing to rebuild bullish positions, and propel prices higher quickly, allowing OPEC to relax some of its recent cutbacks. If the economy does slow further and slides into recession, however, prices and calendar spreads will come under renewed pressure, forcing OPEC to cut again. In the current market, the supply picture looks comfortable, with plenty of spare capacity and Saudi Arabia acting as swing producer, so prices will be determined primarily by events on the demand side.

2019-01-17,"LONDON/TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Hitachi Ltd (6501.T) put a $28 billion (£21.6 billion) nuclear power project in Britain on hold on Thursday, dealing a blow to the country’s plans for the replacement of ageing plants. Hitachi’s UK unit Horizon Nuclear Power failed to find private investors for its plan to build a plant at Wylfa in Anglesey, Wales, which was expected to provide about 6 percent of Britain’s electricity. “We’ve made the decision to freeze the project from the economic standpoint as a private company,” Hitachi said, adding it had booked a write-down of 300 billion yen (£2.1 billion). Chief executive Toshiaki Higashihara said Hitachi could seek to withdraw completely from the project and sell the Horizon unit, depending on discussions with the British government. Hitachi shares have risen 13 percent since Japanese media first reported the possible suspension last week. The Japanese company had urged the UK government to boost financial support for the planned power station. Higashihara, however, denied turmoil over Britain’s impending exit from the European Union had any impact on Hitachi’s decision to freeze the project. People close to the matter had previously said it had limited the government’s capacity to devise plans. The withdrawal of the Japanese conglomerate could leave the nuclear newbuild industry open to Russian and Chinese state-owned companies as Western private firms struggle to compete. China’s General Nuclear Services, an industrial partnership between China General Nuclear Power Corp (CGN) and French utility EDF (EDF.PA), plans to make a number of investments in Britain’s nuclear power sector, most notably the Hinkley Point C project in southwest England. China’s CGN told Reuters it would bring forward plans to build a nuclear plant in Bradwell, eastern England, helping to plug a potential supply gap. British Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the government would explore different options for funding new nuclear plants, as costs for renewable energy had fallen so sharply it was difficult to justify higher subsidies. One option is a regulated asset-based model, under which investors receive some of the funding for projects as they are developed, rather than the contract-for-difference model, which provides funding only when electricity generation has begun. The government will give an update on this assessment during summer. Britain wants new nuclear plants to help replace its ageing fleet of nuclear and coal plants coming offline in the 2020s, but high up-front costs have deterred construction. Another Japanese firm, Toshiba Corp (6502.T), scrapped its British NuGen project last year after its U.S. reactor unit Westinghouse went bankrupt and it failed to find a buyer. In total, the two Japanese projects had aimed to add some 9.6 gigawatts (GW) to UK electricity capacity. Horizon had planned to build in total at least 5.8 GW of new capacity at the Wylfa site and in south Gloucestershire, and Toshiba’s NuGen was expected to add around 3.8 GW with three reactors. Horizon Nuclear Power said it could resume development at Anglesey in the future. The project, which was slated for completion in the late 2020s, had approval for the nuclear reactor design but had not yet started construction.  The firm said it would begin consultations with existing staff. The plant would have employed 850 people once operational, with construction workforces of up to 9,000.   Mycle Schneider, publisher of the World Nuclear Industry Status Report, said the Hitachi decision was a consequence of changing energy economics. The investment would not even be able to compete with unsubsidised offshore wind, the most expensive renewable energy technology, Schneider said.  “Time for the UK government to come up with a plan B,” Schneider added.

There are technological limitations for reducing oil output in Russia, Interfax news agency cited Novak as saying. “Russia, as a matter of principle, cannot sharply decrease oil production but we will try to do it faster,” Novak reportedly said. Earlier this week, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said Russia was cutting its oil production more slowly than expected. The Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and Russia agreed last month to cut their combined oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to support a sluggish oil market. Of that, Russia pledged to curb its output by 228,000 bpd, starting in January. Novak has said Russia will reduce production this month by around 50,000 bpd and reach the target in the first quarter. Last Friday, Novak said Russian oil production was declining gradually and had fallen by more than 30,000 bpd in January from October’s level, the baseline for the global deal. Reducing production presents a challenge because the country’s harsh winter climates can cause wells to freeze, Russian officials have said.

2019-01-17,"LONDON, Jan 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The world’s population must drastically change diets in order to prevent “potentially catastrophic” damage to the planet, scientists have warned. Global food production is the largest strain on the earth caused by humans and unsustainable farming is already driving climate change, deforestation and biodiversity loss, found a major project commissioned by The Lancet health journal. As researchers warned that people must sharply cut the amount of meat they eat to live sustainably, here is why managing food supply is key to controlling climate change: Food production creates about a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions, experts estimate. Livestock farming for meat and dairy represents more than half of that total at 14.5 percent of all emissions, with cattle the biggest offenders. Agriculture is the biggest single driver of deforestation, stripping away forests that reduce climate change by absorbing and storing carbon. Livestock takes up the most space, with land used to grow animal feed and for grazing using nearly 80 percent of all agricultural land. About 70 percent of the world’s freshwater is used for agriculture, with climate change expected to increase the number of people facing water scarcity. More efficient farming could reduce water use, helping to meet climate challenges. Up to a third of all food is wasted - totalling around 1.3 billion tonnes per year. It results in unnecessary emissions and means food does not reach those who need it. Experts predict the amount of food waste will rise further without action. The number of people on earth is expected to grow to 9.8 billion by 2050, adding pressure on the world’s resources. It is estimated that world food production may have to double to keep pace with demographic changes.

Fresh big market-moving news was thinner on the ground for most of the European session, but dealers had more than enough to digest from the previous 24 hours to ensure most of the major bourses stayed in the red. Disappointing earnings from Morgan Stanley, hot on the heels of similarly weak numbers from JP Morgan earlier in the week, meant its shares were marked down 5 percent and futures pointed to Wall Street’s first fall in three days. Europe’s banks tumbled 1.8 percent after France’s Societe Generale issued a profit warning and carmakers skidded as much as 1.5 percent after U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought President Donald Trump was “inclined” to impose tariffs on European cars. On top of that, the tech sector took its latest hit as one of world’s biggest chip producers, Taiwan Semiconductor , forecast its steepest drop in revenue in a decade. “There is some focus on the Grassley comments in relation to auto trade tariffs and also reference to there not being much progress in the U.S.-China negotiations last week,” said Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi strategist Derek Halpenny. “There has obviously been a lot of optimism (in markets) since the start of the year and risk appetite has had a pretty good run, but this will place a few question marks over that.” MSCI’s broadest index of world stocks was fractionally lower having hit a five-week high. Markets like Japan had dithered in both directions while futures pointed to Wall Street starting 0.25 percent lower. Some took heart from Beijing’s confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington, but it wasn’t enough to tip the balance more broadly. China’s blue-chip index ended down 0.55 percent, led lower by a decline in the country’s second-largest home appliances maker, Gree Electric, after it warned of slower profit growth as the economy loses steam. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised increased government investment this year and the central bank injected more cash into the financial system, bringing the amount for the week to 1.14 trillion yuan ($167 billion). Stoking additional caution, however, was news that U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei or other Chinese telecoms firms that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses. Separately, Handelsblatt reported the German government is actively considering stricter security requirements and other ways to exclude Huawei from a buildout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. Also lurking were worries the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on the U.S. economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week it goes on. The pound was up at $1.2913, and though it was still short of Monday’s peak of $1.2929, it did manage a new seven-week high of 88.25 pence against the euro. As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won a confidence vote overnight and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit agreement. An outline for Plan B is due by next Monday and markets are currently assuming that with no easy way forward for May she will have to extend the date of Britain’s exit from the European Union past the scheduled March 29. “Nothing has happened in the last 24 hours to dissuade us from the view that we are headed in the direction of an Article 50 delay, a softer Brexit or no Brexit,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. The U.S. dollar was mixed, easing against the yen to 108.80 but flat versus the euro at $1.1400. The dollar index was barely moving too at 96.043 as a drop in euro zone bond yields also helped drag down those on Treasuries. In commodity markets, palladium hit record highs thanks to increasing demand and lower supply while gold was little changed at $1,294.91 per ounce. Oil prices eased as traders worried about the strength of demand in the United States after its gasoline stockpiles grew last week more than analysts had expected.

Sawan, 44, a Canadian citizen of Lebanese origin, currently heads Shell’s deepwater operations, one of the company’s cash growth engines in recent years. He joined Shell in 1997.  Brown, 56, will remain a member of Shell’s executive committee until his departure on Sept. 30, Shell said in a statement. “I am grateful to Andy for his strong leadership of the Upstream business, particularly having improved business performance during the recent years of low oil prices,” Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden said in a statement.  Shell, the second largest publicly-traded oil company behind Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), produced nearly 3,600 barrels per day of oil and gas equivalent in the third quarter of 2018. Shell transformed its upstream operations following the $54 billion (£41.9 billion) acquisition of smaller rival BG Group in 2016 that gave it a leading position in Brazil’s rapidly growing deepwater production.  Since then Shell has sold many oil and gas assets in order to focus on the most competitive fields in areas such as the North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.

2019-01-17,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Jan 17 (Reuters) - The spot price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia has completely missed its usual winter peak, with much of the blame being laid at the door of milder-than-usual temperatures trimming demand. That sounds perfectly plausible, but doesn’t quite tally with the fact that delivered volumes into the major consuming region of Northeast Asia hit a record-high in December. A total of 20.25 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel were delivered in December to the region, which includes the top three consumers of Japan, China and South Korea, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. This was up 12.4 percent from the same month in 2017, adding to a 14-percent gain in shipments in November, 2018, from the same month a year earlier. It was also the most on record, eclipsing the 19.46 million tonnes from January, 2018. China was the main driver of the jump in imports, with 6.42 million tonnes arriving in December, up 27 percent from the same month in 2017. Top consumer Japan saw imports weaken, dropping by 9 percent to 7.72 million tonnes in December, whilst No.3 South Korea recorded an 11-percent increase to 4.81 million tonnes. The shipping data does show that LNG demand was strong for the first part of the northern winter, but it doesn’t yet give a picture of how the rest of the cold season will play out. It’s here that the spot pricing comes into play, and this is pointing to a weak back-end of winter. The spot price for cargoes delivered to Asia LNG-AS was $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week ended Jan. 11. It has been trending down since a minor early winter peak of $10.90 per mmBtu in the week to Nov. 16, and is well below the summer-high of $11.60, reached in the week to June 15. The spot price is usually for deliveries of around four to eight weeks in advance, so the current price reflects cargoes that will arrive in February. It’s worth noting that the $10.90 reached in mid-November reflected cargoes delivered in December, when demand reached an all-time high in Northeast Asia. The fact that even this strong demand couldn’t spark a sustained rally in prices shows that it’s more likely ample supply is playing a greater role than demand. This view is supported by spot prices for March delivery, at around $8.30 per mmBtu, being weaker than those for February. There is usually a sharp drop in spot LNG prices as winter ends and the market enters the lower-demand shoulder season of spring, and the strength of any summer recovery is largely dependent on how hot the weather is, as this drives power demand for air-conditioning. The fact that the winter rally in LNG prices didn’t materialise, even in the face of solid demand growth, raises the possibility of a weaker-than-usual first-half. The market narrative of LNG has swung in recent months from one of an expected oversupply on the back of a raft of new projects mainly in Australia and the United States, to a consensus that strong demand growth in Asia will lead to a deficit in coming years, unless new ventures are sanctioned. However, while this view may well be correct from a longer-term perspective, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of short- to medium-term periods where supply exceeds demand. This may be the situation for the next few months as the spot market struggles to absorb the extra supply from projects that came online in 2018. These include two Australian projects in Inpex’s 8.9 million tonnes per annum Icythys venture and Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude floating plant, as well as Dominion’s Cove Point and Cheniere’s Corpus Christi projects in the United States. While the longer-term outlook for LNG demand growth appears to be rosy once again, the market may have little bouts of indigestion every now and again, as it has to absorb the lumpy nature of supply additions.

2019-01-17,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Angry Dutch citizens on Thursday asked their country’s highest court to put an immediate end to natural gas production in the Groningen region due to the risk of earthquakes. Once Europe’s largest gas field, decades of extraction have led to dozens of minor tremors every year, damaging thousands of homes and sparking unrest among locals and prompting authorities to impose caps on activity at Groningen. “Seismic risks are still increasing, all we hear are promises of future improvements, but nothing’s really happening”, resident and politician Nette Kruzenga said in court. An unusually severe magnitude 3.4 quake prompted the Dutch government last year to pledge to end production by 2030 and to lower it as quickly as possible in coming years. Groningen is run by NAM, a 50-50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil. Output is set to drop to 19.4 billion cubic meters (bcm) in the year that began in October, down from a 2013 peak of 54 bcm. It will be cut by another 75 percent in the next five years, the government has said. “Production has already been lowered to the lowest possible level”, state lawyer Hans Besselink said in court on Thursday. “Further reductions would lead to shortages at companies in the Netherlands and abroad.” But many in the region still feel their safety concerns are being ignored, as tremors are expected to continue, while numerous attempts to set up a compensation scheme for damage and repairs have failed. The petitioners demand drilling be stopped immediately, or at least capped at 12 bcm per year, a level the Dutch gas regulator last year said would limit risks. “We need two to three years to get at 12 bcm, it’s impossible to reach it straight away without disrupting consequences,” Besselink said . The government expects the 12 bcm level might be reached by the end of 2020, by switching large industrial users away from Groningen gas and by building extra capacity to convert high-caloric imported gas to the low-caloric gas needed for the Dutch network. The Netherlands still depends on Groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply and export obligations. The High Court in 2017 said certainty of supply should play a role in decisions on the production level, but should not outweigh safety concerns. The court expects to deliver its verdict on Jan. 31. It will also hear 26 other complaints from local authorities and interest groups in April.

Europe’s carmakers fell as much as 1.5 percent after U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said he thought Donald Trump was “inclined” to impose tariffs on European cars to win better terms on agriculture. Banks were hit by disappointing Societe Generale results and the tech sector was under pressure too after one of world’s biggest chip producers, Taiwan Semiconductor, forecast its steepest drop in revenue in a decade. “There is some focus on the Grassley comments in relation to auto trade tariffs and also reference to there not being much progress in the U.S. China negotiations last week,” said Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi strategist Derek Halpenny. “There has obviously been a lot of optimism (in markets) since the start of the year and risk appetite has had a pretty good run, but this will place a few question marks over that.” MSCI’s broadest index of world stocks was fractionally lower having hit a five-week high. Markets like Japan had dithered in both directions while futures pointed to Wall Street starting 0.3 percent lower. Some took heart at Beijing’s confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will travel to the United States on Jan. 30 for more negotiations with Washington, but it wasn’t enough to tip the balance more broadly. China’s blue-chip index had ended down 0.55 percent, led lower by a decline in the country’s second-largest home appliances maker, Gree Electric, after it warned of slower profit growth as the economy loses steam. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang promised increased government investment this year and the country’s central bank injected more cash into the financial system, bringing the amount for the week to 1.14 trillion yuan ($168.74 billion). Stoking additional caution however was news that U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei or other Chinese telecoms firms that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses. Separately, Handelsblatt reported the German government is actively considering stricter security requirements and other ways to exclude Huawei from a buildout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. Also lurking were worries the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on its economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week it goes on. As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won a confidence vote overnight and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit agreement. An outline for Plan B is due by next Monday and markets are currently assuming that with no easy way forward for May she will have to extend the date of Britain’s exit from the European Union past the scheduled March 29. “Nothing has happened in the last 24 hours to dissuade us from the view that we are headed in the direction of an Article 50 delay, a softer Brexit or no Brexit,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. All of which left the pound at $1.2872, and though it was still short of Monday’s peak of $1.2929, it did manage a new seven-week high of 88.32 pence against the euro before steadying . The U.S. dollar was mixed, easing against the yen to 108.80 but flat versus the euro at $1.1400. The dollar index was barely moving too at 96.043 as a drop in euro zone bond yields also helped drag down those on Treasuries. In commodity markets, palladium hit record highs thanks to increasing demand and lower supply while gold was little changed at $1,294.91 per ounce. Oil prices eased as traders worried about the strength of demand in the United States after its gasoline stockpiles grew last week more than analysts had expected.

2019-01-17,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Angry Dutch citizens on Thursday will ask their country’s highest court to put an immediate end to gas production in the Groningen region due to the risk of life-endangering earthquakes. Decades of extraction from what once was Europe’s largest natural gas field have led to dozens of minor tremors every year, damaging thousands of homes and sparking unrest among locals. An unusually severe, magnitude 3.4 quake prompted the Dutch government last year to decide to end production by 2030 and to lower it as quickly as possible in coming years. Gas production at Groningen is run by NAM, a 50-50 joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil. Output is set to drop to 19.4 billion cubic metres (bcm) in the year that began in October, down 65 percent from its 2013 peak, and will be cut by another 75 percent in the next five years, the government said in December. But many in the region still feel their safety concerns are being ignored, as tremors are expected to continue, while numerous attempts to set up a compensation scheme for damage and repairs have failed. The Dutch High Court last week said it would hear two “pressing” objections to the government’s production plans on Thursday, while 26 other complaints from local authorities and interest groups would be dealt with in April. The petitioners demand drilling be stopped immediately, or at least capped at 12 bcm per year, a level the Dutch gas regulator last year said would limit risks. A sudden halt to output would put the Netherlands in a tight spot, as the country still depends on Groningen gas for a significant part of its energy supply and export obligations. The High Court in 2017 said certainty of supply should play a role in decisions on the production level, but should not outweigh safety concerns. The court expects to take a few weeks to reach a verdict.

2019-01-17,"BARCELONA, Jan 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - E nvironmentalists in France and Ireland are pushing forward with legal cases aimed at forcing their governments to step up action on climate change, motivated by a 2018 flagship ruling that the Netherlands must cut emissions faster to keep its people safe. In October, a Dutch appeals court said the government had “done too little to prevent the dangers of climate change and is doing too little to catch up”, ordering it to ensure planet-warming emissions are at least 25 percent below 1990 levels by the end of 2020. Tessa Khan, a lawyer with the Urgenda Foundation which brought the Dutch case on behalf of nearly 900 citizens, said this and other ongoing climate legal actions are based on the principle that governments must meet their obligations under human rights law and the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. “(These cases) all spring from the same sort of inspiration and the broad notion that our governments have the duty to protect us from threats of this scale that they have contributed to knowingly,” said Khan, who is co-director of the Climate Litigation Network. In France, four non-governmental groups, including Greenpeace and Oxfam, fired the starting gun on Dec. 17. They sent a “preliminary request for compensation” in a 41-page letter to the French prime minister and a dozen government ministers, denouncing the state for failing to take concrete and effective measures to combat climate change. The government has two months to respond, and if it fails to give a satisfactory answer, the groups are preparing to file a full legal action with the Paris Administrative Court in March. Armelle Le Comte, climate and energy advocacy manager at Oxfam France, said the ripple of lawsuits on climate action around the world - from Europe and North America to Pakistan and Colombia - reflected growing urgency as the impacts of extreme weather and rising seas become more visible. Governments, including France, have talked a lot about tackling climate change, but have not done enough in practice, she noted. “So I think it is not surprising that more citizens, charities and NGOs ... decide that legal action is maybe the answer,” she said. In the meantime, the NGOs have been raising awareness about the case and the need for stronger climate action in France through a YouTube video featuring celebrities such as actress Juliette Binoche, and writer and film director Cyril Dion. They also launched an online petition in support of what they are calling the “Case of the Century” that has garnered nearly 2.1 million signatures in about a month. Le Comte said wide public support for the legal action was important in providing a sense of legitimacy to the approach. The case is particularly poignant in France, which has been rocked in recent months by “yellow vest” protests over social inequality and the high cost of living that were initially sparked by planned hikes in fuel tax. French President Emmanuel Macron launched a national policy debate this week that includes how the country could shift to using more clean energy. Urgenda’s Khan said the court cases were aimed at ensuring emissions targets are met, not telling states how to do it. “Then it’s up to the governments and the public to make sure the policies that are put in place are ones that ensure a just (energy) transition and ... the poorest aren’t the ones who bear the burden of that transition,” she said. Oxfam’s Le Comte said the “Case of the Century” social media campaign was meant to provide more information, especially to young people, on the measures that could be taken. In Ireland, backers of the climate change case, scheduled to begin in the High Court on Jan. 22, are organising a children’s rally in Dublin on Saturday to urge leaders that “2019 must be the year of ambitious climate action”. About 12,600 members of the public have backed “Climate Case Ireland” with online messages of support. Spokeswoman Sadhbh O Neill said awareness was growing in the country which has among the highest emissions per capita in the European Union. “That helps us show the court that we have standing, that we’re not doing it in a self-interested way and that we are trying to be representative of concerned citizens,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Friends of the Irish Environment, a company set up by environmental activists, will argue in the case that the government’s approval of the National Mitigation Plan in 2017 violated national legislation on climate action, as well as its constitution and human rights obligations. It will also claim the plan falls far short of the steps required by the Paris Agreement. O Neill noted that Ireland’s emissions have risen since 2014, as its economy recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, and its dairy industry expanded. A spokesman for Ireland’s Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment said by email that the government would defend the case, but noted the National Mitigation Plan recognised a detailed roadmap would be required to decarbonise the economy. That is now being put in place, he added, and includes a government-wide climate action plan “intended to make Ireland a leader in responding to climate disruption”. The verdict in the Irish case, a judicial review, is expected to be issued in a few months, while the French legal process could last two to three years, Le Comte said. In the Netherlands, it took three years for an initial ruling to be confirmed by the appeals court, and the government said in November it would request a review of the judgement. Khan said one key advantage of pursuing states in court was judicial scrutiny of the evidence on climate change. ""Just by putting the facts on the record - that in itself is a really important communication tool, and helps to mobilise the public around climate change,"" she said.

Forecasters expect the bitter weather to push eastwards into the Rockies and U.S. Midwest through the weekend, while the California Highway Patrol said rain-slicked highways led to two fatal accidents that killed four people. A family of three, including a one-year-old baby, died in El Dorado County on Tuesday, after their car spun across a rain-soaked freeway to hit another car, the San Francisco Chronicle said.  Another man died in a storm-related car wreck on Wednesday in Napa County, highway patrol dispatchers said, but no further details were immediately available. One man in Oakland was killed after being struck by a tree, uprooted by the wind and rain, that fell on a homeless encampment, media said. High winds could topple more trees as the soil gets wetter and more saturated, the National Weather Service warned.  Police in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties ordered evacuations on Tuesday from areas damaged by last year’s wildfires because of the risk that heavy rain could trigger mud and debris flows on charred hillsides. The snow and rain were brought by a one-two punch of weather, after one Pacific storm hit California on Monday and a second, larger storm arrived on Wednesday, forecasters said. Both are expected to sweep back-to-back through the Rockies and Midwest, gathering more strength from moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, forecasters said, before hitting the Ohio Valley and the Northeast early next week. Significant road closures and travel delays remain likely in the Los Angeles area through Friday as storm remnants linger, said Marc Chenard, a forecaster with the NWS’ Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.  The risk of flash flooding and rockslides persists, he said. “Some areas in the Sierras will get another 5 inches of rain after the 3 inches that already fell, with significant snow fall above 6,000 feet.” The weather is a boon for farmers and ski areas, however, as most of California is recovering from years of drought, the United States Drought Monitor said.

2019-01-17,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - The spot price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia has completely missed its usual winter peak, with much of the blame being laid at the door of milder-than-usual temperatures trimming demand. That sounds perfectly plausible, but doesn’t quite tally with the fact that delivered volumes into the major consuming region of Northeast Asia hit a record-high in December. A total of 20.25 million tonnes of the super-chilled fuel were delivered in December to the region, which includes the top three consumers of Japan, China and South Korea, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv. This was up 12.4 percent from the same month in 2017, adding to a 14-percent gain in shipments in November, 2018, from the same month a year earlier. It was also the most on record, eclipsing the 19.46 million tonnes from January, 2018. China was the main driver of the jump in imports, with 6.42 million tonnes arriving in December, up 27 percent from the same month in 2017. Top consumer Japan saw imports weaken, dropping by 9 percent to 7.72 million tonnes in December, whilst No.3 South Korea recorded an 11-percent increase to 4.81 million tonnes. The shipping data does show that LNG demand was strong for the first part of the northern winter, but it doesn’t yet give a picture of how the rest of the cold season will play out. It’s here that the spot pricing comes into play, and this is pointing to a weak back-end of winter. The spot price for cargoes delivered to Asia was $8.50 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) in the week ended Jan. 11. It has been trending down since a minor early winter peak of $10.90 per mmBtu in the week to Nov. 16, and is well below the summer-high of $11.60, reached in the week to June 15. The spot price is usually for deliveries of around four to eight weeks in advance, so the current price reflects cargoes that will arrive in February. It’s worth noting that the $10.90 reached in mid-November reflected cargoes delivered in December, when demand reached an all-time high in Northeast Asia. The fact that even this strong demand couldn’t spark a sustained rally in prices shows that it’s more likely ample supply is playing a greater role than demand. This view is supported by spot prices for March delivery, at around $8.30 per mmBtu, being weaker than those for February. There is usually a sharp drop in spot LNG prices as winter ends and the market enters the lower-demand shoulder season of spring, and the strength of any summer recovery is largely dependent on how hot the weather is, as this drives power demand for air-conditioning. The fact that the winter rally in LNG prices didn’t materialise, even in the face of solid demand growth, raises the possibility of a weaker-than-usual first-half. The market narrative of LNG has swung in recent months from one of an expected oversupply on the back of a raft of new projects mainly in Australia and the United States, to a consensus that strong demand growth in Asia will lead to a deficit in coming years, unless new ventures are sanctioned. However, while this view may well be correct from a longer-term perspective, it doesn’t preclude the possibility of short- to medium-term periods where supply exceeds demand. This may be the situation for the next few months as the spot market struggles to absorb the extra supply from projects that came online in 2018. These include two Australian projects in Inpex’s 8.9 million tonnes per annum Icythys venture and Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude floating plant, as well as Dominion’s Cove Point and Cheniere’s Corpus Christi projects in the United States. While the longer-term outlook for LNG demand growth appears to be rosy once again, the market may have little bouts of indigestion every now and again, as it has to absorb the lumpy nature of supply additions.

2019-01-17,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China put just over 43 gigawatts (GW) of new solar generation capacity into operation in 2018, down 18 percent from a year earlier, an industry group said on Thursday, after a government move to curb new capacity and ease a subsidy payment backlog. The new generation took the country’s total installed solar power capacity to more than 170 GW by the end of the year, the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA) said.  China announced last year that it would suspend new projects after a record 53 GW capacity increase in 2017 left it struggling to find spare grid capacity and pay a renewable subsidy backlog amounting to more than 140 billion yuan ($20.69 billion) last year. China is also aiming to gradually phase out direct financial support to the solar industry after a decline in costs, announcing last week that it would launch a series of new subsidy-free projects.     But solar manufacturers are already feeling the pinch, and warned last year they were facing closure after a surge in new production capacity in previous years sent component prices plummeting. “Facing a lot of complicated domestic and overseas trends, the sector as a whole is under big pressures and substandard producers are expected to promptly exit the market,” said Wang Bohua, CPIA vice-chairman, in a speech on Thursday.  Wang said output of solar equipment continued to increase in 2018 despite the decline in new domestic capacity, with solar module production up 14.3 percent to an equivalent of 85.7 GW. Much of the surplus production was diverted to overseas markets, with solar component export earnings rising 10.9 percent from a year earlier to $16.11 billion, Wang said, according to a transcript published on CPIA’s official WeChat social media account. China’s solar manufacturers have been accused of using subsidies to drive down prices and put foreign competitors out of business, but they claim they have been the beneficiary of a fierce competitive environment forcing them to reduce costs. The United States imposed tariffs on China’s solar products last year, and its share of China’s exports fell from 5.9 percent in 2017 to 0.24 percent in 2018. The bulk of China’s overseas shipments went to India, South East Asia and Europe.

Fresh news was thin on the ground leaving MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan up a slight 0.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was almost flat after dithering in both directions. Spreadbetters pointed to a softer start for the major European bourses, while E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 drifted down 0.26 percent. China’s blue chip index recouped early losses to gain 0.4 percent. It had been weighed by a fall in the country’s second largest home appliances maker, Gree Electric, after it warned of slower profit growth as the economy loses steam. China’s Premier Li Keqiang took to the radio to promise increased government investment this year. The country’s central bank did its part by injecting more cash into the financial system, bringing the amount for the week to a massive 1.14 trillion yuan ($168.74 billion). Stoking some caution was news that a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd or other Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws. That came shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from U.S. businesses. Such moves could inflame tensions between Beijing and Washington and make a trade deal yet harder. Separately, Handelsblatt reported the German government is actively considering stricter security requirements and other ways to exclude Huawei from a buildout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks. Also lurking in the background were worries the U.S. government shutdown was starting to take a toll on its economy. White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said the shutdown would shave 0.13 percent off quarterly economic growth for each week it goes on. As expected, British Prime Minister Theresa May narrowly won a confidence vote overnight and invited other party leaders for talks to try to break the impasse on a Brexit divorce deal. An outline for Plan ‘B’ is due by Monday and the market assumes there will have to be an extension of the Article 50 exit date past March 29. “Nothing has happened in the last 24 hours to dissuade us from the view that we are headed in the direction of an Article 50 delay, a softer Brexit or no Brexit,” said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at NAB. “But it remains too soon to be buying sterling with your ears pinned back,” he added, noting many uncertainties remained. All of which left the pound steady at $1.2872, though still short of Monday’s peak at $1.2929. It fared well on the euro, which hit a seven-week low before steadying at 88.42 pence . The U.S. dollar was otherwise mixed, easing a touch on the yen to 108.98, but firming on the euro to $1.1386. The dollar index was up a fraction at 96.162.

2019-01-17,"(Reuters) - Australia’s Woodside Petroleum Ltd on Thursday flagged higher than expected investment costs as it steps up early work on the two big gas developments that will drive its growth in the next decade.  Australia’s largest independent gas and oil producer said its investment expenditure for 2019 will be between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion, significantly higher than a UBS estimate of $1.2 billion.  Australia in December overtook Qatar as the world’s largest LNG producer by capacity, with the start-up of Inpex’s Ichthys and Royal Dutch Shell’s Prelude projects, the last two in a $200 billion LNG investment boom over the past decade.  The Perth-based firm is expected to lead the next leg of LNG investments in Australia with its Scarborough and Browse projects. Final investment decisions for both projects are scheduled in 2020. Meanwhile, the company said it expects 2019 annual production to grow by up to about 3 percent, and posted a 43 percent jump in quarterly revenue on rising output at its Wheatstone LNG project.  Revenue for the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2018 rose to $1.42 billion, compared to $990 million a year ago. UBS had estimated quarterly revenue of $1,349 million. Woodside said 2018 production rose 8.3 percent to 91.4 million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe). It expects annual production in 2019 between 88 mmboe and 94 mmboe.  “Base business turned in another strong performance in the fourth quarter, with Wheatstone’s production continuing to exceed expectations,” Woodside Chief Executive Officer Peter Coleman said in a statement. The Pluto LNG project achieved 99.7 percent reliability, he said. Total production across operations over the quarter was 24.1  million barrels of oil equivalent (mmboe), higher than 21.9 mmboe a year ago.

Summit Corp, a subsidiary of Singapore-based Summit Power International, and partner Mitsubishi Corp are expected to start operations at their floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU) off the country’s coast by the middle of March and ahead of schedule, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. A Summit Corp spokeswoman confirmed in an emailed response that the Summit LNG terminal is on schedule, but did not elaborate. However, construction delays on a pipeline that will carry regasifed gas from the coastal city of Chattogram, near where the FSRU will be anchored, to Dhaka means that the vessel will not be fully utilised, the source said. Until the pipeline is fully connected, the FSRU will handle about 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas which will be supplied to the Chattogram area, the source said. The ship can regasify up to 500 mmcfd of LNG, according Summit’s website. Once the pipeline is completed, state-owned energy company Petrobangla will be able to send up to 1,000 mmcfd from both the Summit FSRU and a vessel operated by U.S. company Excelerate that started up in August, the source said. “Our target is to complete all the connecting gas transmission pipelines by April,” Ali Al-Mamun, managing director of the Gas Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of state-owned Petrobangla, told Reuters. He added that the company has awarded a contract to Chinese oil and gas major CNOOC to build a 7-km (4.2 mile) pipeline that connects the Summit FSRU to the shore. Other pipelines that will connect the offshore pipeline to the country’s main gas grid near the city of Bakhrabad are still being built, he said. Summit LNG’s FSRU will anchor 6 km off the island of Moheshkali in the Cox’s Bazar district of the Chattogram division, where it will regasify LNG procured by Petrobangla. The planned LNG import volume of the project is about 3.5 million tonnes a year, which will double the country’s LNG import capacity to 7.5 mmtpa once fully operational. Bangladesh has scrapped plans to build additional floating LNG terminals in favour of land-based stations after the start-up of Excelerate’s vessel was delayed by several months due to technical problems and bad weather.

2019-01-17,"(Repeats JAN. 16 story. No change to text.) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2HfQKH5 By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Global growth is slowing and the world economy is headed for a recession in 2019 unless something happens to give it renewed momentum. The OECD’s composite leading indicator fell to just 99.3 points in November, its lowest since October 2012, and down from a peak of 100.5 at the end of 2017. Growth momentum has been easing for some time in Britain, Canada, France and Italy and there were tentative signs of slackening momentum in the United States and Germany in November. The composite indicator is likely to fall even further when data for December are published next month, given the weakness already revealed in equity markets and business surveys. The OECD composite leading indicator has been weakening consistently for the last year and now points unambiguously to a contraction ahead (tmsnrt.rs/2HfQKH5). In the last 50 years, whenever the index has fallen below 99.3, there has almost always been a recession in the United States (1970, 1974, 1980, 1981, 1990, 2001 and 2008). The one exception was the weakening of the index in 1998, when the United States continued to grow, despite the weakening global economy in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. Even in this case, however, the interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee noted “the economy has been holding up but is now showing clear signs of deterioration.” “When we feed this information into our various models, they inevitably, as we might expect, engender a quite considerable softening.” The observations are contained in the transcript of an unusual, out-of-cycle conference call held by the Federal Open Market Committee in September 1998. One week later, the Federal Reserve responded to signs of a weakening economy by cutting U.S. interest rates. Most of the world’s major economies outside the United States showed clear signs of slackening growth in the fourth quarter of 2018. Even in the United States, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index for December showed the sharpest deceleration in growth since the recessions of 2008 and 2001. Global trade volumes showed signs of slowing towards the end of 2018 after strong growth in 2017. Air freight through Hong Kong International Airport, the world’s busiest air cargo hub and a proxy for global trade, was down 1.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter. Air freight volumes in Hong Kong were down by a massive 5 percent in December compared with the same month a year earlier, according to the Civil Aviation Department. Most economists now forecast a period of slower growth in 2019 but policymakers have expressed hope for a soft landing rather than an outright recession. Policymakers almost always aim for a soft landing, in an effort to maintain business and consumer confidence, but there are good reasons to be sceptical about the scenario. Experience shows the economy is characterised by a significant number of positive feedback mechanisms which amplify booms and slumps. Expansions tend to accelerate as business investment, employment, incomes, consumer spending and equity prices reinforce each other. Once the economy starts to lose momentum, however, all these factors tend to interact with each other in the opposite direction to intensify the slowdown. A soft landing is still possible but a hard landing is more likely unless something happens to kickstart global growth. If policymakers want to avoid a recession, they have two principal options: (a) cut U.S. interest rates to ease global financial conditions; or (b) conclude a trade agreement between China and the United States to ease trade tensions and boost business confidence. But unless policymakers intervene with one of these alternatives, the global economy’s momentum will continue to slacken and push it towards recession.

Bank of America shares jumped 7.2 percent and Goldman 9.5 percent. The Dow ended Wednesday with gains of 0.59 percent, while the S&P 500 added 0.22 percent and the Nasdaq 0.15 percent. Investors in Asia might be less encouraged by a Wall Street Journal report that U.S. federal prosecutors were investigating Huawei Technologies, the world’s largest telecommunications equipment maker, for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. businesses and could soon issue an indictment. Such a move could inflame tensions between Beijing and Washington and make a trade deal yet harder. China’s central bank on Wednesday moved to avert a cash crunch in the economy by injecting a record $83 billion into the country’s financial system.

2019-01-17,"KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 17 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Whether buying a fish fillet at a supermarket or ordering steak in a restaurant, consumers will soon be able to use their phones to check instantly whether their food is green and ethical. Launched by environmental group WWF and investment firm BCG Digital Ventures, OpenSC opensc.com is a website that harnesses blockchain technology to allow users to scan a QR code on a product or menu that reveals the full history and supply chain before they buy. “For those catching and producing things in a very unsustainable way, it’s quite easy for them to hide behind the complexity of supply chains,” said Paul Hunyor, Asia region head at BCG Digital Ventures in Sydney. “There is a lack of carrots for those doing good at the production end because it is very hard for them to make the end consumer aware of all the good work they’re doing,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Globally, consumers and retailers are demanding more information about what they procure, buy and eat, to ascertain that its production and transportation does not damage the environment, or use illegal and unethical business practices. In response, large consumer goods companies, restaurants and other businesses are looking at ways to attract more customers by offering sustainable products that are guaranteed as free of deforestation or slave labour, for example. The OpenSC platform, conceived in 2017 when WWF was piloting a tuna fisheries traceability project in the Pacific Ocean, will initially focus on fish and beef. It plans to expand in the next two years to cover other commodities like palm oil and timber. OpenSC allows consumers to cut through the complexity and lack of transparency in supply chains, said Hunyor. The digital tool will cover environmental, social and human rights, and hopes to attract sustainability bodies and schemes, as well as corporations and major commodities producers, said Dermot O’Gorman, CEO of WWF-Australia. “There is ... growing momentum around the world with corporates who are doing and want to do the right thing because their customers are increasing demand,” he said. Austral Fisheries, which is part of the Maruha Nichiro Group, has committed to implement OpenSC this year across its fleet which catches Patagonian toothfish. Customers and staff of supermarkets and restaurants, as well as wholesalers, can use the tool to access instant information. For fish, that would include where it was caught, if the area is a verified sustainable fishing zone, and conditions along the supply chain. Fish tracked by OpenSC, set up as a social enterprise, will be served at a dinner for world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.
