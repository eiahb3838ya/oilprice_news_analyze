2018-10-30,"(Reuters) - U.S. solar company SunPower Corp (SPWR.O) on Tuesday lowered its 2018 forecast after some customers delayed equipment purchases due to a freefall in the market price of panels that was instigated by solar policy changes in top market China. China’s move in May to slash subsidies for domestic solar installations unleashed a flood of low-cost Chinese-made panels onto the global market - pushing prices down more than 10 percent in a matter of weeks. That has kept some project developers on the sidelines as they wait for prices to stabilize, SunPower said, adding that the situation would persist in the fourth quarter. The company expects those orders to happen in 2019, Chief Executive Tom Werner said on a conference call. The delays impacted SunPower’s business that supplies equipment to solar project builders. In its primary distributed generation business, which includes residential and commercial systems, the company saw only “a slight decrease” in prices between the second and third quarters.   SunPower lowered its forecast for solar products deployed to a range of 1.45 GW to 1.55 GW from a prior view of 1.5 to 1.9 GW.  The company forecast 2018 revenue of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion on a net basis, compared with a prior view of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are expected to be between $100 million and $120 million, compared with a prior view of $95 million to $125 million. SunPower is both a manufacturer of solar panels and an installer of solar power systems. The San Jose, California-based company makes its products primarily in the Philippines and Mexico but earlier this month closed on a deal to buy a panel factory in Hillsboro, Oregon. That move was intended to help the company sidestep tariffs on overseas-made panels imposed by the Trump administration earlier this year. SunPower in September received an exemption from those tariffs for its premium imported panels. That exemption will not benefit the company financially until 2019, Werner said, adding that the company would record $20 million in tariff costs in the fourth quarter. SunPower will begin production in Oregon in the first quarter of next year with a goal of manufacturing up to 150 MW of solar panels there in 2019. SunPower shares were down 5.9 percent at $6.04 in after-hours trade on the Nasdaq. The company is majority-owned by France’s Total SA (TOTF.PA).

2018-10-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices dropped more than 1 percent on Tuesday on signs of rising supply and concern that global economic growth and demand for fuel will fall victim to the U.S.-China trade war. Brent crude LCOc1 futures fell $1.43, or 1.9 percent, to settle at $75.91 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 86 cents to settle at $66.18 a barrel, a 1.3 percent drop. Earlier in the session, Brent reached a session low of $75.09 a barrel, the lowest since Aug. 24. WTI slumped to $65.33 a barrel, the weakest since Aug. 17. Prices were little changed in post-settlement trade after industry group the American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude inventories rose 5.7 million barrels last week, more than analysts’ forecast for a 4.1 million-barrel build. Investors will look to official government data on U.S. inventories due to be released Wednesday.     Both crude benchmarks have fallen about $10 a barrel from four-year highs reached in the first week of October and were on track to post their worst monthly performance since July 2016. Oil has been caught in the global financial market slump this month, with equities under pressure from the trade fight between the world’s two largest economies. The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he thinks there will be “a great deal” with China on trade but warned that he has billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to go if a deal is not possible. Trump said he would like to make a deal now but that China was not ready. He did not elaborate.  “One discussion that is developing is that (trade tensions) are hurting demand for crude oil. There’s probably an element of truth to that,” said Bob Yawger, director of futures at Mizuho in New York. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said high oil prices were hurting consumers and could dent fuel demand at a time of slowing global economic activity. Oil production from Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia reached 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in September, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. C-RU-OUT C-OUT-T-EIA PRODN-SA GRAPHIC: Russian, U.S. and Saudi crude oil output - tmsnrt.rs/2CRXg31 That is an increase of 10 million bpd since the start of the decade and means the three producers alone now meet a third of global crude demand. The United States is set to impose new sanctions on Iranian crude from next week, and exports from the Islamic Republic have already begun to fall. Saudi Arabia and Russia have said they will pump enough to meet demand once U.S. sanctions are imposed. “The fact that this price weakness is developing just ahead of the official kickoff of the Iranian oil sanctions suggests an amply supplied market in which additional supply was brought to market well in advance of a likely acceleration in Iranian export decline,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.

2018-10-30,"SANTIAGO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Argentina has begun exporting natural gas to Chile after a 12 year interlude, Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Tuesday, as the two South American neighbors seek to increasingly integrate their energy supply and electricity grids. The unconventional gas is being piped from Argentina’s oil- and gas-rich Vaca Muerta shale field in the Neuquen basin, then sent over the Andes mountain range to Chile’s southern province of Biobio. “We are working enthusiastically with (Argentine) President Mauricio Macri to integrate our energy supply,” Pinera said in a speech. The exports mark a turning point in energy trade in the region. Argentina, which sits atop the world’s No. 2 shale gas reserves, was once a major supplier of natural gas to Chile, but triggered a diplomatic crisis in the mid-2000s by cutting off shipments when its own supplies ran low. The move sent Chile, a global mining powerhouse that has few hydrocarbons of its own, scrambling to find new sources of supply. The spat also helped foster a move towards alternative energy sources like wind and solar in Chile. Pinera said the two countries had very different, but often complementary, energy needs, and that depending on the time of year and circumstance, could either export or import fuel and electricity across their shared border. “This will permit us to back one another up without having to spend excess money to do so,” he said.

2018-10-30,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Broad gains in the U.S. equity market boosted a measure of  global stock markets on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said a “great deal” could be struck with China that would relieve fears of a growing trade war between the world’s two largest economies.  MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1 percent. Still, the index is down nearly 9 percent for the month.  Investors remained cautious despite the modest gains.  “At this point, nobody can say the equity market is bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo.     Market participants also kept their hopes in check regarding trade. “We don’t see the trade war being resolved any time soon,” said Rabobank’s senior macroeconomic strategist Teeuwe Mevissen. “And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.” Trump said during an interview with Fox News late on Monday that he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade. But he also said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible.

The gains were broad, with all 11 sectors of the benchmark S&P index up for the day. The rally helped turn both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average once again positive for the year, though each is up less than 1 percent since the beginning of January. Both were up over 7 percent for the year at the start of October.  “This is a continuation of the recovery we saw yesterday,” said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer with Hugh Johnson Advisors in Albany, New York.  General Electric Co (GE.N), however, fell nearly 9 percent. GE slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share, promised to restructure its power unit and said it faced a deeper accounting probe. Meanwhile, data showed the Italian economy had ground to a halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade flows failed to spur growth. The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and renewed pressure on Italy’s government debt in the bond markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 0.01 percent.

2018-10-30,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two years after fending off a hostile takeover attempt, U.S. grain handler The Andersons Inc (ANDE.O) is expanding its commodity shipping and ethanol businesses and eyeing small- to mid-sized acquisitions to stay profitable during a global supply glut that has hurt U.S. farmers. The Andersons this month said it was purchasing the remaining 67.5 percent stake in Lansing Trade Group LLC that the company did not already own by paying $175 million in cash, assuming $166 million in long-term debt and issuing stock in its largest-ever acquisition. “We basically triple our grain business ... and take our company up to just under $10 billion (in annual revenue),” Andersons Chief Executive Officer Pat Bowe said in an interview at the Reuters Global Commodities Summit on Tuesday. The deal expands The Andersons’ footprint beyond the Midwestern crop belt. Lansing’s assets include grain elevators in Idaho and Louisiana, hydraulic fracturing sand hubs in Minnesota and Texas, and a former Louis Dreyfus Company grain port in Houston. Bowe said the deal would increase earnings-per-share within a year. That would be quite a comeback from two years ago, when the hedge fund HC2 Holdings Inc offered to buy the loss-making Andersons for $1.15 billion - an overture that was rejected. Bowe joined The Andersons shortly before the takeover attempt after a 30-year career at Cargill Inc [CARG.UL]. Andersons shares are up about 16 percent so far this year after slumping more than 30 percent in 2017. It is also building what it calls the greenest ethanol plant in the country in Kansas and expects it to start up in 2019, Bowe said.  It has diversified into making flour for pasta and pretzels from the ancient grain spelt at the Purity Foods Inc mill in Michigan, which it purchased for “a few million dollars” in 2017.  As primarily a domestic grain shipper, The Andersons has also been relatively insulated from the U.S.-China trade war that has hampered exports. U.S. soybean shipments to China, valued at $12 billion in 2017, have slowed to a virtual halt after China raised tariffs on the product in July. Bowe said the company would entertain small to mid-size M&A in the specialty crop nutrients and food space and “was always buying rail cars” but another large acquisition was unlikely in the next year.  “This is a big one for us,” Bowe said of the Lansing deal. “But that’s not precluding us to do other growth acquisitions.” Reporting by Michael Hirtzer and Karl Plume, editing by Caroline Stauffer and Marguerita Choy; Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits; For more summit stories, see [nL8N1X92DN]",https://uk.reuters.com/article/commodities-summit-andersons/reuters-summit-u-s-grain-handler-andersons-eyes-growth-after-lansing-deal-idUKL2N1XA1HI,30 Oct 2018,"* For other news from Reuters Global Commodities Summit,

2018-10-30,"(Adds details about DOJ probe, Montana deal between Zinke foundation and chairman of Halliburton) WASHINGTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department’s acting inspector general has referred a probe into Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department for further investigation, media reports said on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Referring a probe to the Justice Department means it will explore whether evidence warrants a criminal investigation. Mary Kendall, the acting inspector general of the Interior Department, is conducting at least three probes into Zinke’s conduct, but it was not clear which one had been sent to the Justice Department, the Washington Post said. Among other investigations, Kendall is probing Zinke’s involvement in a Montana land deal and a decision not to grant two tribes approval to run a casino in Connecticut. A senior White House official said the White House understands the DOJ investigation is looking into whether the secretary “used his office to help himself,” according to the Washington Post. The Interior Department’s inspector general said in a letter to lawmakers in July that the office was investigating a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Zinke and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton Co. The letter said the inspector general had launched the probe on July 16 to look into a development deal in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, between a group funded by David Lesar, Halliburton’s chairman, and the foundation. The deal was first reported by Politico. A Lesar spokeswoman said in July that his personal investment had nothing to do with Halliburton and that the company was confident the Interior Department would not be influenced by it. The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zinke told CNN that he had not been contacted by the Justice Department, that he follows the law, and that the DOJ investigation was “politically driven” and “has no merit.” Nancy DiPaolo, spokeswoman for the Interior Department’s inspector general office, said she could not comment on any ongoing investigation. The White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Nichola Groom, and Humeyra

2018-10-30,"(Corrects oil production to 1.25 million bpd in 5th paragraph) * Libyan oil workers complain about work conditions * State oil firm NOC asking for pay increases TRIPOLI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The chairman of Libya’s state oil firm National Oil Corp (NOC) has asked the central bank to increase salaries of oil workers by 67 percent in 2019, a statement said on Tuesday. The North African country approved in 2013 such a pay rise which was never implemented as Libya’s chaos accelerated then with the country splitting in two government the following year and blockages and protests hampering production. NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla “called for the implementation of a 67 percent salary increase for all oil workers as per the 2019 budget,” the oil company said in a statement. He also called for the central bank, which manages Libya’s oil and gas revenues in the absence of a government and parliament with national reach, to make additional budget allocations for NOC to repair facilities. Sanalla said the wage increase was justified based on the recent rise of oil production to 1.25 million barrels per day, the highest level since mid-2013 when a wave of protests and blockades by armed groups and staff kicked off. There have been small protests over wages and work conditions on several facilities in recent weeks. The most volatile situation is at the El Sharara oilfield in the south where a small group of Libyan tribesmen staged a protest last week, the latest in a series of incidents. Workers, like many Libyans, have been suffering from high inflation driven by the falling value of the Libyan dinar that has made food imports more expensive.

We have always had an expectation that high prices would dent demand,” Hardy said in his first in-depth interview since becoming CEO in March. “Crude markets are not that tight in the immediate term ... and a fair price of oil going into next year is probably closer to the $70 or $65 per barrel mark than the $85-$90 area that some people are talking about.” Oil prices jumped above $85 per barrel earlier this month on fears of a steep decline in Iranian supply as U.S. sanctions on Tehran come into force on Nov. 4. Hardy said he saw Iranian oil exports declining, but not as sharply as previously feared - probably sticking above 1 million bpd because China, India and Turkey were likely to continue buying crude from Tehran. Combined with softer demand, this should help keep the oil market in balance for the first half of next year, provided Saudi Arabia pumped near record-high volumes and the world avoided another major supply disruption, Hardy said. “There’s not much room for things to go wrong in any supply sense, because there is pretty much no spare capacity at the moment,” he said. A potential worsening of the macro-economic environment represents a risk to the downside. If demand worsened further, it could add downward pressure on prices because it would come just as the United States adds more oil to the market in the second half of 2019. However, the second part of 2019 would also see the market switching focus to tighter marine fuel rules coming into force in 2020, which are expected to give a major boost to diesel demand, said Hardy. “The market is going to forgive short-term oversupply based on a view of increased demand for distillates in 2020,” he said. Hardy also said he thought OPEC was unlikely to add supply to the market at its next meeting in December, despite calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to help bring prices down. “In the end, OPEC produces 32 million bpd and they don’t have a great deal more supply to give the market ... Some parties (within OPEC) are beginning to think they need to be a little bit more conservative about 2019 because of the amount of non-OPEC increasing production”. The United States is expected to add a new wall of supply next year and those volumes would be a major driver behind Vitol’s own expansion in crude, refined products and liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets, Hardy said. “We’re trying to position ourselves to make sure that we’re getting some of that (U.S.) flow and that we’re participating in those exports ... because the U.S. is about to embark on another massive expansion of its crude oil export capacity,” said Hardy. Vitol traded over 7 million bpd of crude and products in 2017 and Hardy said the figure would edge up in 2018. LNG traded volumes for this year are expected to be around 9 million tonnes from 7.4 million in 2017.

2018-10-30,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - A high-stakes competition is emerging among energy exporters proposing multi-million-dollar crude terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast to handle a gusher of shale oil coming from West Texas oilfields. On Monday, private equity firm Carlyle Group became the latest to place a bet, proposing with the Port of Corpus Christi what it said would be the first onshore U.S. export facility able to load the world’s largest crude tankers. The winners of the export terminal race likely will be those best able to navigate a regulatory process that includes multiple government approvals and overcome labor and supply shortages that have already frustrating some early projects to expand export infrastructure. The contest comes as the shale revolution is expected to send the nation’s oil production to 11.8 million barrels per day by the end of 2019, from 9.35 million bpd in 2017, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Existing coastal terminals could be overwhelmed by late next year as a flurry of new pipelines come into operation and move 2 million barrels of oil landlocked in West Texas to the Gulf Coast, say oil companies and analysts. Carlyle’s facility, which aims to begin operations by late 2020, will compete with other Texas and Louisiana projects proposed by Swiss-trader Trafigura AG and pipeline operators’ Enterprise Products Partners LP and Tallgrass Energy LP. Enterprise and Trafigura have not provided timelines, noting permits must be secured first. Tallgrass says it hopes to provide an offshore crude loading terminal off the Lousiana coast by the third quarter of 2021, roughly a year behind Carlyle’s estimate. Each aims to fully load very large crude carriers (VLCCs)tankers able to carry up to 2 million barrels of oil to markets in Asia, Latin America and Europe. Most would require running pipelines away from ports and into the deeper parts of the ocean to allow loading of the larger ships. All of these proposals face significant licensing and other hurdles. Like others, the Carlyle-Port of Corpus Christi project, must pass lengthy state and federal approvals. It also must await completion of an Army Corps of Engineers project that has been delayed about a year, said Sean Strawbridge, chief executive officer of the Port of Corpus Christi Authority. “One of the challenges is there more dredging demand than there is capacity in the United States right now,” he said. For the project to hit its 2020 target date, it would have to secure permits by next spring and find dredging contractors to work immediately after finishing the Army Corps’ project, he said. Although shale production is expected to rise substantially, it will not fill all the proposed projects, said John Coleman, an oil market analyst at research firm Wood Mackenzie. “Everyone is racing to throw their hat in the ring and get their project done before everyone else,” he said. Only one or two of the five proposed offshore ports likely will be needed. “There’s simply not enough oil volumes to go around.” Total U.S. crude exports hit a record 3 million bpd in June, and analysts say the ceiling is around 5 million bpd, which is less than the capacity of the export terminals beings considered. “You can’t build all these terminals, so there is an advantage to being among the first,” Sarah Emerson, managing principal at consultancy ESAI Energy LLC, said on Monday. Today, more than 60 percent of U.S. crude exports move through Corpus Christi’s port. Its exports this year rose about 94,000 bpd in the first nine months from 518,000 bpd in 2017. Oil producer ConocoPhillips, which has exported about 10 million barrels of crude from its South Texas operations from Corpus Christi this year, expects port facilities to be strained when coming pipelines open. “There is probably going to be some tightness, particularly at Corpus probably in late ‘19 when these pipes start up,” said Don Wallette, Conoco’s finance chief. However, port expansion from Houston to Corpus Christi will resolve the problem, he said. The danger for oil producers is the pipeline congestion that has landlocked crude in West Texas becomes a Gulf Coast port congestion by 2020. The U.S. refining industry cannot consume all of the projected oil production. The nation began an export-infrastructure building spree after former President Barack Obama in 2015 lifted a 1970s-era ban on U.S. crude exports. But as Corpus Christi’s experience shows, that building boom has driven up prices for needed dredging. Its initial project to deepen a shipping channel to 54-feet (16.5-m), enough to accommodate tankers carrying 1 million barrels of oil, is being renegotiated after bids were more than 125 percent of the budget for the work. With Carlyle, it aims to take a portion of the channel to 75-feet deep. “These projects aren’t going to get any cheaper and the longer they take, the more expensive they’re going to be,” said the Port of Corpus Christi’s Strawbridge.

2018-10-30,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CQDDYT By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Global economic momentum is decelerating, according to a broad range of financial and real-economy indicators, which is weighing on worldwide equity markets and oil prices. The depth and duration of the slowdown is impossible to gauge at this point, whether it turns out to be simply a mild and short-lived “soft patch”, a longer but still positive “growth recession” with output falling relative to trend, or an “outright recession” with activity falling in absolute terms. Recent declines in equity markets and softness in freight indicators may turn out to be a false alarm or a pause within an extended cycle rather than mark a cyclical turning point. Most commentary about the economic cycle is still influenced by the last deep and wrenching recession which accompanied the global financial crisis in 2008/09. But severe recessions have not been common since the end of the Second World War and most downturns have proved milder, which therefore seems a more likely prediction for the next cyclical slowdown. In the United States, post-1945 recessions have tended to be short, lasting less than a year in most instances, and in some cases have seen business activity level off rather than decline (tmsnrt.rs/2CQDDYT). If the economy is nearing a cyclical peak, however, the next stage in the cyclical sequence is likely to involve some combination of: * Fiscal expansion * Financial easing * Lower trade tensions * Lower oil prices Further tax cuts or an increase in government spending, possibly on highways and other infrastructure, would be one way to ameliorate the slowdown and get the economy growing again. The U.S. federal government is already on course to run an annual budget deficit of more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade but the prospect of even higher deficits is unlikely to forestall demands for fiscal stimulus. If the expansion slows or tips into recession, the Federal Reserve will also come under pressure to cancel planned interest rate increases and rescind some of the rises that have already happened. With the target federal funds rate currently at 2.00-2.25 percent, up from a post-crisis low of 0.00-0.25 percent, the central bank has scope to ease financial conditions by conventional interest rate reductions. In the event of a mild slowdown, interest rate reductions on their own are likely to prove sufficient, but if more aggressive measures are required, the central bank could start expanding its balance sheet again. Slower growth will lead to pressure on policymakers to reconsider trade policies that have disrupted global supply chains and damaged market access. The Trump administration has argued the strength of the U.S. economy makes now an opportune time to tackle what it calls China’s unfair trade and investment practices. A strong domestic economy can weather the short-term pain of a trade war to protect long-term strategic advantages, according to this argument. But if the economic expansion falters, the administration is likely to come under pressure to reconsider the costs and benefits of its aggressive trade policies. At a minimum, the administration is likely to come under pressure not to worsen the downturn by escalating the trade war and to find ways to reduce tensions. If there is a downturn, the administration will want it to be over well before the next presidential election in November 2020. Any slowdown in global growth is likely to see oil prices hit a plateau or even fall, as consumption growth moderates while production continues to accelerate. Lower oil prices would avoid another period of oversupply by curbing the projected expansion in output and stimulating faster growth in oil consumption. Modestly lower oil prices would also provide some economic stimulus and form part of the natural cyclical progression (a sharp fall in prices would worsen the economic outlook by curbing oil and gas investment). OPEC members could try to support oil prices by cutting their own output, perhaps in conjunction with invited non-OPEC producers, but only at the risk of losing market share (again). Attempting to support oil prices during an economic slowdown is unlikely to be successful, so the most OPEC may be able to achieve is to avoid a rise in inventories and averting a price collapse. The precise mix of fiscal expansion, financial easing, reduced trade tensions and lower oil prices in the next stage of the cycle is impossible to predict in advance. But the potential for a cyclical slowdown and flat or lower oil prices is one reason hedge funds and other money managers have been cutting bullish bets on oil and refined fuels sharply since the end of August.

2018-10-30,"(Adds details on payment, context on PDVSA) CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Investors have begun receiving payment on Venezuelan state oil company Petróleos de Venezuela SA’s 2020 bond, two bondholders said on Tuesday, even though the company remains in default on most of its outstanding debt during a hyperinflationary economic crisis. The government of President Nicolas Maduro has halted payment on nearly all of Venezuela and the company’s $60 billion in outstanding debt, but has stayed current on the 2020 issue that  is backed by shares in U.S. refining subsidiary Citgo. Investors had broadly expected PDVSA, as the company is known, to make the $950 million interest and principal payment to avoid losing control of Citgo, which is already the target of a dispute by other creditors seeking to collect from the OPEC nation. PDVSA did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Two bondholders contacted by Reuters said they had seen the funds in their accounts. Three others said they had not yet received the funds, but had received word that clearing agents, financial institutions that intermediate bond payments, had gotten the money. “Yes they are paying, but at PDVSA speed,” said one investor, in reference to the company’s tendency to settle bills well after their due date. The investors requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Two PDVSA sources said the company had sent the payment, which had been approved by management two weeks ago, and attributed the delays to compliance procedures by international banks. Venezuelan and PDVSA are behind on bond payments by some $8 billion. The government of President Nicolas Maduro blames the problem on U.S. financial sanctions imposed last year. Critics say selective payment of certain bonds illustrates that the government can pay when it has an incentive to do so but uses sanctions as an excuse when it does not. Failing to pay the 2020 bond would allow bondholders to seize half the shares of Citgo Petroleum Corp. Canadian miner Crystallex has already won approval from a U.S. judge to auction shares of a PDVSA holding company that indirectly controls Citgo, in order to collect $1.4 billion in compensation for the nationalization of its assets a decade ago.

2018-10-30,"NEW YORK, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Broad gains in the U.S. equity market turned global stocks higher on Tuesday after President Donald Trump said a “great deal” could be struck with China that would relieve fears of a growing trade war between the world’s two largest economies. The euro wallowed near a 10-week low of 1.1352 as the dollar climbed to a 2 1/2-month peak against a basket of the world’s top six currencies. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.31 percent. Still, the index is down nearly 10 percent for the month. Investors remained cautious despite the modest global gains. “At this point, nobody can say the equity market is bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo. Market participants also kept hopes in check regarding trade. “We don’t see the trade war being resolved any time soon,” said Rabobank’s senior macroeconomic strategist Teeuwe Mevissen. “And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.” Trump said during an interview with Fox News he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade, but said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 192.43 points, or 0.79 percent, to 24,635.35, the S&P 500 gained 13.94 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,655.19 and the Nasdaq Composite added 37.58 points, or 0.53 percent, to 7,087.87. The gains were broad in the U.S., with all 11 sectors of the benchmark S&P index up for the day. Trade-sensitive industrial shares rose nearly 1.2 percent in mid-morning trading. Meanwhile, data showed the Italian economy had ground to a halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade flows failed to spur growth. The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and renewed pressure on Italy’s government debt in the bond markets. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.14 percent. The chill around China and global trade left emerging- market stocks at an 18-month low, with MSCI’s index down for a sixth day in a row. Oil prices fell more than 1 percent in choppy trading on signs of rising supply and concern global economic growth and fuel demand would be hit by a deepening of the U.S.-China trade dispute. U.S. crude fell 1.06 percent to $66.33 per barrel and Brent was last at $76.30, down 1.34 percent. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 4/32 in price to yield 3.1 percent, from 3.087 percent late on Monday.

2018-10-30,"NEW DELHI, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Global trader Trafigura has applied for a license for its downstream arm Puma Energy to start retail sales of gasoline and gasoil in India, an oil ministry spokesman and Trafigura said on Tuesday. Global oil majors including BP, Total and Saudi Aramco want to enter India’s fuel retail market, attracted by growing demand for gasoil and gasoline in the world’s fastest growing major economy. “A license has been applied for on behalf of Puma Energy, a downstream distribution company in which Trafigura is the largest shareholder, and that application is still pending,” Trafigura said in an email. Puma Energy, in which Trafigura has a 49.6 percent stake, operates in 49 countries. Last year it expanded into Pakistan by buying a stake in a fuel retail network. According to Indian rules, a company can get marketing rights for transport fuels if it has invested or proposes to invest 20 billion rupees ($272 million) in the country’s oil and gas sector over a 10 year period. Last year, a consortium led by Russia’s state-controlled Rosneft and including Trafigura and Russian fund UCP paid about $13 billion to buy 98.26 percent of India’s Essar Oil, now known as Nayara Energy Ltd. Nayara operates a 400,000 barrels per day oil refinery at Vadinar in western Gujarat state and controls 4,756 fuel stations in India. Trafigura, which has about a 24.5 percent stake in Nayara, applied for a fuel retail license for Puma Energy about two months ago, an oil ministry source said. The payment made by Trafigura for the Essar Oil stake cannot be considered an investment in India’s oil and gas sector, this source said. An Indian oil ministry spokesman said the government was examining Trafigura’s request for a retail sales license. “It is being examined and some information has been sought on their investment plans in the country’s oil and gas sector. Once they reply, it will be looked into,” the spokesman said. The oil ministry source, however, said it would not be difficult for Trafigura to get the license, as Nayara has plans to expand its Vadinar refinery, set up a petchem plant and increase its number of fuel retail stations to 7,000 in three years. “We gave a license for retail sales of petrol and diesel to BP after it made a commitment to make fresh investment in exploration after buying a stake in Indian oil and gas blocks from Reliance Industries,” the oil ministry source said. $1 = 73.6150 Indian rupees

2018-10-30,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Asia could reap massive benefits in health, environment, agriculture and economic growth if governments implement 25 policies such as banning the burning of household waste and cutting industrial emissions, according to a U.N. report. Air pollution is a health risk for 4 billion people in Asia, killing about 4 million of them annually, and efforts to tackle the problem are already on track to ensure air pollution is no worse in 2030, but huge advances could be made, the report said. The report’s 25 recommendations would cost an estimated $300 billion-$600 billion annually, a big investment but loose change compared with a projected $12 trillion economic growth increase. The publication of the report, “Air Pollution in Asia and the Pacific: Science based solutions”, on Tuesday coincides with the World Health Organization holding its first global air pollution conference in Geneva this week. The recommendations also included post-combustion controls to cut emissions from power stations, higher standards for shipping fuels, ending routine flaring of gas from oil wells, and energy efficiency standards for industry and households. The biggest gains would come from clean cooking, reducing emissions from industry, using renewable fuels for power generation and more efficient use of fertilisers.  Huge improvements in post-combustion controls and emission standards for road vehicles were already anticipated because of recent legislation, although both could be improved further. Indeed, India may halt the use of private vehicles in the capital New Delhi if air pollution, which has reached severe levels in recent days, gets worse, a senior environmental official said on Tuesday. Authorities in the capital have already advised residents to keep outdoor activity to a minimum from the beginning of next month until at least the end of the Hindu festival of Diwali on Nov. 7, when firecrackers typically further taint air choked by the burning of crop stubble in neighboring states. Helena Molin Valdés, head of Climate and Clean Air Coalition Secretariat at U.N. Environment, said there was increasing political openness to taking action on air pollution and the report reflected three years of discussions with governments.   “What the governments were saying in the region was: ‘Don’t tell us we have a problem, we know there is a problem, how can we deal with it and what will it take to do it?’,” she said.  The report estimates its recommendations would cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent compared to a baseline scenario, potentially decreasing global warming by one-third of a degree Celsius by 2050, which would also be a contribution in the fight against climate change.  One billion people would enjoy high air quality, while the number exposed to the worst pollution would be cut by 80 percent to 430 million. Premature deaths would fall by a third. Crop yields would benefit because of a reduction in ozone, which is estimated to have cut 2015 harvests by 10 percent for maize, 4 percent for rice, 22 percent for soy and 9 percent across Asia, a total of 51 million tonnes.

The euro wallowed near a 10-week low of 1.1352 too as the dollar climbed to its 2 1/2-month high against a basket of the world’s top six currencies. It was the 10-year low for China’s yuan in Asia that grabbed most attention, though, as it weakened to 6.9696 per dollar, stirring speculation over whether Beijing will tolerate a slide beyond 7 per dollar. That had came on top of reports that Washington will impose tariffs on all Chinese imports by the end of the year without progress at next month’s meeting of Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, though Trump then said in an interview that a “great deal” was still possible with China. “We don’t see the trade war being resolved any time soon,” said Rabobank’s senior macro strategist Teeuwe Mevissen. “And it comes at a time when we see all the sentiment indicators in the euro zone but also in the U.S., too, cooling down.” There was more negative news out of Italy, the other major concern for Europe at the moment, as its coalition government faces off with the European Commission over spending. Data showed the Italian economy had ground to a halt in the third quarter as both domestic demand and trade flows failed to spur any growth. The flat reading was the weakest since the fourth quarter of 2014 and renewed the pressure on Italy’s government debt in the bond markets. Italy’s 10-year government bond yield was up 2.5 basis points at 3.36 percent, having been as low as 3.32 percent earlier in the session. The closely watched spread over German government debt was back up to 300 bps. Traders were also still digesting the news on Monday that Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel will step down as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU), heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics. Friedrich Merz, a former parliamentary leader of Merkel’s conservative alliance, became the first candidate to officially throw their hat into the ring to succeed her on Tuesday. Asia’s choppy rise had come as China made a fresh attempt to stabilise its stock markets. Beijing’s securities regulator said it would encourage share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions by listed firms and would enhance market liquidity. Mainland China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 gained to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, having initially fallen after Trump’s administration had hit state-backed Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua with U.S. restrictions on Monday. Japan’s Nikkei average also erased early losses and rose 1.5 percent as traders went shopping for bargains among beaten-down stocks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares has lost 12 percent this month and is on track for its biggest October decline since 2008, during the global financial crisis. “At this point, nobody can say the equity market is bottoming out. Global investor sentiment remains shaky,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo. The speed with which a brief rally in U.S. stocks faded on Monday underscored that jittery mood. Wall Street was pointing to 0.4-0.5 percent gains later, but the S&P 500 will be starting near a six-month low, having dropped almost 10 percent from last month’s record highs. The chill around China and global trade means emerging- market stocks are at an 18-month low. MSCI’s index is down for a sixth day in a row and Monday’s post-election rally in Brazil was already in the rear-view mirror. The CBOE Global Markets volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, was down a touch, but it had jumped as high as 27.86 points, its second highest level since a worldwide volatility shock in early February. “The probability of global stocks turning to a bear market is increasing,” said Masanari Takada, cross-assets strategist at Nomura Securities. In the main commodity markets, oil prices were down after easing overnight as Russia signalled that output will remain high and as concern over the global economy led to worries about demand for crude. West Texas Intermediate crude futures dropped 1.4 percent to $66.13 per barrel. Brent crude futures fell 1.8 percent to just under $76. Zinc and copper prices also buckled, along with other base metals, after U.S. President Trump’s warning of new tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump has said during an interview with Fox News that he thinks there will be “a great deal” with China on trade, but said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to go if a deal is not possible.

2018-10-30,"BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Chinese oil and gas major Sinopec’s net profit rose to 18.38 billion yuan ($2.64 billion) in the third quarter, up 60 percent from a year earlier, on robust refining margins and improving earnings from crude oil and gas production. The figure was down, however, from a record high of 22.83 billion yuan in the second quarter, company filings to the Hong Kong stock exchange showed on Tuesday night. The quarter-on-quarter decline came after Sinopec’s profit grew for five consecutive quarters. It could increase concerns that a glut in fuel markets and the higher cost of crude oil, amid looming sanctions on Iran and U.S-China trade tensions, is hurting the performance of Asia’s largest refiner. In the first nine months of 2018, net profit was up 56 percent at 59.98 billion yuan, Sinopec said in its filing. Its third-quarter revenue was 772.7 billion yuan, a 33 percent increase from a year earlier. Revenue for the first three quarters reached 2.07 trillion yuan, up 18 percent from the year earlier period. The company’s crude production continued to drop despite higher crude prices. Sinopec produced 216 million barrels of crude between January and September, down 1.7 percent from the year earlier period.

The move left commodities companies that are part of Nasdaq’s clearing house, and the exchange itself, to plug a 114 million euro ($133 million) hole in a contingency fund. After the default, which was triggered by strong fluctuations in regional power market spreads, Nasdaq said it had organised an auction to sell the portfolio. The exchange said it had invited four clearing participants to join in the auction but declined to identify them. “We confirm that it was a one-firm winner. Who the participants were we still can’t comment on,” Nasdaq told Reuters. Finland’s Fortum, Norway’s Statkraft and Germany’s Uniper confirmed to Reuters that they took part in the auction but were outbid. Asked by Reuters on Tuesday whether Vattenfall was among the firms Nasdaq had asked to participate in the auction, the company’s chief executive, Magnus Hall, said: “We were asked ...

2018-10-30,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Union should prepare for its companies to be targeted by American sanctions in a worsening trade dispute between the United States and China, former World Trade Organisation (WTO) director general Pascal Lamy said on Tuesday. As they weigh up a response to renewed U.S. sanctions against Iran, which have forced an exodus of European companies, EU governments should consider the prospect of similar extraterritorial measures penalising China trade, Lamy told an international investment conference in Paris. “If the U.S. were to step further in not only hitting China with trade measures but with sanctions, if they were to deal with China the way they did with Iran, then we would all have a big problem,” he said. “That’s why we need to have a careful look at what will happen in the case of Iran.” A surge in global protectionism from Brexit to the U.S.-China trade war has done little to dent foreign direct investment flows overall, according to data presented to the XBMA conference on cross-border mergers and acquisitions. The global volume of M&A deals is projected to rise 26 percent this year to $4.34 trillion, its second-highest annual total since 2007, the eve of the last major financial crisis. Chinese investors accounted for a record 20 percent of European inbound deal volume last year as some turned their attention away from the United States. Europe-China trade is also expected to benefit from increased U.S.-China tariffs and other barriers.    The Trump administration in May withdrew Washington from an international agreement to curb Tehran’s nuclear activities, and imposed new sanctions against Iran. That triggered the mass withdrawal of European companies from carmakers to oil majors, in order to avoid crippling U.S. penalties reintroduced in stages on Aug. 6 and Nov. 4. European governments have pledged in response to establish new financing channels that shield companies from U.S. sanctions, but a viable programme has yet to emerge.    The comments by Lamy, who served as EU Trade Commissioner before heading the WTO, expanded on recommendations published in a policy paper here last week by the Jacques Delors institute, a European think-tank.  Europe could create its own extraterritorial mechanisms to sanction breaches of environmental, data protection, tax and anti-corruption laws, according to the paper co-authored by Lamy and four others including Louis Schweitzer, honorary chairman of carmaker Renault (RENA.PA). Failing that, Brussels could use existing directives to halt the EU activities of foreign banks “from a third country that imposes extraterritorial provisions on EU companies”, it said. “It cannot be ruled out that the United States will impose future sanctions on China that go beyond the current trade measures initiated by the American president, which could then be applied extraterritorially,” the paper added. “Perhaps it would be wise to take decisions for the Iranian case by considering this wider economic and political context.” Reporting by Laurence Frost, editing by Ed Osmond",https://uk.reuters.com/article/eu-us-trade/eu-should-brace-for-u-s-standoff-over-china-ex-wto-chief-warns-idUKL8N1XA57G,30 Oct 2018,"The European Union should prepare

2018-10-30,"ANTALYA, Turkey (Reuters) - A Turkish ship will start drilling for oil and gas in the Mediterranean on Wednesday, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez said, a move that could create tensions with neighbouring Cyprus and Greece over jurisdiction. Attempts to tap gas and oil in the eastern Mediterranean, along with a dispute over Greece’s maritime borders, have recently caused friction between Athens and Ankara. Turkey and the internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government in Cyprus have overlapping claims of jurisdiction for offshore oil and gas research in the eastern Mediterranean, a region thought to be rich in natural gas. Speaking at a ceremony for the launch of the drilling ship “Fatih”, Donmez said it would begin drilling at the Alanya-1 borehole, located 100 kilometres (60 miles) off the southern province of Antalya and 60 kilometres off Antalya’s Alanya district. “Turkey has set its main goal as independence in energy,” Donmez said. “We don’t have an eye on others’ resources, our only issue is to present to our people the riches within our territory.” The first borehole will be some distance from the disputed territory, which lies further south and around Cyprus. Turkey is almost completely reliant on imports to meet its energy needs and the lira’s tumble against the dollar this year has driven up that cost, putting pressure on energy companies to raise prices for consumers. To meet more of its needs domestically, Turkey recently announced a tender for operation rights of three new solar power plants and privatised seven coal fields. It also opened a new refinery to reduce dependence on imported oil products. Donmez said on Tuesday that Turkey was also very close to buying another drilling ship. Turkey warned Greece last week to stay out of its activities in the eastern Mediterranean, heralding a potential showdown with Cyprus. Breakaway north Cyprus, which is supported by Turkey, says any offshore wealth also belongs to them, as partners in the establishment of the Cyprus republic in 1960. Greek Cypriots, who run the island’s internationally recognised government, say any future benefits of gas finds will eventually be shared by all Cypriots. The island was split in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Countless peacemaking endeavours have failed, and offshore wealth has increasingly complicated peace negotiations even though Greek Cypriots say that matter is not up for discussion.

PKN Orlen and smaller rival Lotos rely mostly on Russian oil delivered via pipelines built in the 1960s, but both have increased purchases from other sources. Earlier in October, PKN bought its first oil from Nigeria. “The United Arab Emirates is a new source of supplies for PKN Orlen,” the company said in a statement. PKN also said the Murban crude from the UAE had a lower sulphur content than Russian REBCO (Russian Export Blend Crude Oil). Murban crude has properties that allow for the production of a relatively large amount of products, such as diesel and gasoline, the company added.

2018-10-30,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India may halt the use of private vehicles in the capital New Delhi if air pollution, which has reached severe levels in recent days, gets worse, a senior environmental official said on Tuesday. Toxic smog has started to envelope vast swathes of northern India, including New Delhi, as it does each year when winter approaches and farmers burn off the residue of crops. “Let us hope the air pollution situation in Delhi doesn’t deteriorate but if it turns out to be an emergency, we will have to stop the use of private transport,” said Bhure Lal, chairman of the Environment Pollution Control Authority (EPCA). “There is a committee which will advise me on this. EPCA, appointed by India’s Supreme Court, has already proposed halting construction, the use of diesel-run power generators, brick kilns and the burning of garbage between Nov. 1 and Nov. 10 when pollution levels are expected to rise. Data from the Central Pollution Control Board showed the air quality index, which measures the concentration of poisonous particulate matter, hit 469 in parts of Delhi on Tuesday, up from 299.4 a week ago.  Crop stubble burning, a major source of pollution, vehicular exhaust and a drop-off in wind speeds have aggravated the smog that is likely to worsen around Nov. 7, when fireworks will set off to celebrate the major Hindu festival of Diwali.  As a blanket of haze settled over the area, the provincial leaders of New Delhi and a federal government minister sparred over what to do. “Every year Delhi suffers because of the ineptness of the federal government and the state governments of neighbouring Punjab and Haryana states,” Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a tweet. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana states, India’s bread basket, start burning the residue of the previous crop to prepare for new plantings in November. Defending the federal government, Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan said his ministry and the state governments of Punjab and Haryana have tried to reduce stubble burning and the Delhi government must intensify its own efforts to help curb pollution.

2018-10-30,"* PM Babis: Dukovany could be extended by 10 years * Extension cost CZK 20 bln, fraction of new unit * CEZ: future regulatory, economic conditions part of assessment * Govt may decide this year on massive nuclear power expansion (Adds CEZ comment, shares, details) PRAGUE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The lifespan of Czech utility CEZ’s Dukovany nuclear power plant could be extended by 10 years at a cost of 20 billion crowns ($878 million), a fraction of the price of a new unit, Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday. The government has been considering how to fund a multi-billion dollar expansion of CEZ’s nuclear power plants, before some units reach the end of their lifetime. It had aimed to make a decision this year. The government however, has also raised the option of extending Dukovany’s life beyond 2035 which would relieve it of the pressure of having to decide now, and give it more time. CEZ has balked at starting a tender without receiving state guarantees for the massive investment while Babis has said the company, central Europe’s largest listed utility that is 70 percent state-owned, can handle the project itself. CEZ’s Dukovany and Temelin plants met 38 percent of the country’s energy needs last year. Babis, as quoted by CTK news agency, said on Tuesday the government committee debating the issue had discussed an extension at its last meeting. CEZ said it was possible to extend Dukovany’s lifespan but that any assessment should take future regulatory and economic conditions into account, not just technical aspects. “We can imagine an extension to (Dukovany’s) operation,” a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. Some minority shareholders are afraid a nuclear power expansion through the construction of new reactors would dent dividend payouts if CEZ, were pushed to finance it on its own. The company could face shareholder lawsuits. Earlier in October, Industry Minister Marta Novakova told Reuters the state’s preferred option remained CEZ guaranteeing the project. CEZ had scrapped its previous nuclear tender in 2014 after failing to receive state guarantees on power prices it had sought to minimise risks. CEZ shares were down 0.7 percent on Tuesday at 537.50 crowns after gains of over 3 percent in the previous session.

2018-10-30,"* 2019 budget is $161.7 billion with 1.84 pct of GDP deficit * Opposition party accuses political interest in social programmes (Adds details, quotes) JAKARTA, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Indonesian parliament’s budgetary committee on Tuesday approved President Joko Widodo’s 2019 budget without many changes from his August proposal, but an opposition party criticised an expansion of the president’s social programmes. The committee approved a slightly larger budget of 2,461.1 trillion rupiah ($161.65 billion) than Widodo had proposed, but the fiscal deficit target was kept at 1.84 percent of GDP, the chairman of the committee Aziz Syamsuddin said. The deficit target is the lowest in years and Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said it will provide room for the government to deal with global uncertainty next year. The 2019 budget is Widodo’s last in his first term. He is running for reelection next year and is facing former military general Prabowo Subianto in the contest. Prabowo’s camp has criticised a 3 trillion rupiah budget for the country’s first ever “District Fund” in 2019, an extension of Widodo’s flagship “Village Fund” where the central government transfers money directly for projects at village levels, managed by community leaders. The total allocation for the Village Fund in 2019 was approved at 70 trillion rupiah, up 16.7 percent from 2018. “If it’s disbursed in a political year, 2019, the public can judge for themselves whether there is a motive behind this,” Prabowo’s vice presidential candidate, Sandiaga Uno, said in a televised remark ealier this month. On Tuesday, Willgo Zainar, a parliament member from opposition Gerindra party doubled down on the criticism. “The social protection programmes in a political year are very biased and are considered to have political interest,” he said, reading his party’s statement on the budget. Widodo has defended his policy, saying the fund is for the good of the people. Indrawati on Tuesday said programmes to reduce the poverty rate should not be politicised. Analysts had described the budget, which assumes economic growth of 5.3 percent in 2019, inflation at 3.5 percent and the rupiah averaging 15,000 a dollar, as conservative and realistic when it was first laid out. A smaller deficit also means lower issuance of bonds, which could help support sovereign bond prices if global market turbulance triggers another round of capital outflows. The parliament, which usually approves the committee’s endorsement, will vote on the budget on Wednesday. $1 = 15,225.0000 rupiah

Growth in September alone was 5.6 percent year-on-year, up from  2 percent in August and from 5 percent a year earlier. The highest growth in September was registered in the processing industry, financial sector, trade, transport and real estate operations.

2018-10-30,"KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait needs to push through economic reforms despite higher oil prices, the Gulf state’s ruler said on Tuesday, urging parliament to work with the government to implement measures aimed at diversifying revenues and developing the economy. Kuwait, whose state finances are among the strongest in the region, has been trying to introduce new taxes and reform a lavish welfare system to curb state spending.  “I hope that the recent temporary improvement in oil prices does not obstruct this important path, which aims to protect future generations,” Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber al-Sabah told parliament in a speech at the start of its new session. Critics say parliament has long hindered attempts at fiscal discipline. The current parliament, elected in late 2016, has yet to pass any major elements of government reforms introduced after oil prices plunged in 2014.  Parliament’s budget committee said last May that Kuwait would not implement a  value-added tax before 2021, but would push ahead this year with excise taxes on selected products, such as tobacco and sugary drinks. The Gulf’s six oil-exporting countries originally agreed to introduce a 5 percent VAT at the start of 2018, and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates did so. The other states have delayed because of  political opposition, potential damage to consumer spending, and the technical challenges of a new tax. The Gulf economies, including Kuwait’s, are likely to accelerate in coming years as governments boost spending, but growth will not return to the levels enjoyed before oil prices fell in 2014, a quarterly Reuters poll of economists found. [nL8N1WW5P2] Kuwait has the most powerful parliament in the region, but a series of assemblies have been dissolved in recent years amid power struggles between the opposition and the cabinet, which is  dominated by the ruling family. “I will not allow us to stray from the blessing of democracy ... to a curse that threatens stability in our country,” the emir said, criticising what he described as a “feverish race” by some MPs to question ministers. The assembly can pass legislation and question ministers, but the emir has the final say in state matters. He picks a prime minister, who selects a cabinet.

2018-10-30,"* Greenland to offer onshore oil and gas blocks in 2021 * Island’s licensing strategy shifts from offshore to onshore * CNPC, CNOOC “very interested” in bidding - deputy minister (Updates throughout) By Tom Daly BEIJING, Oct 30 (Reuters) - China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) have expressed interest in bidding for onshore oil and gas blocks in Greenland to be offered in 2021, officials from the island said on Tuesday. The Arctic island, a self-ruling part of Denmark, is shifting its oil and gas licensing strategy from offshore to onshore in an effort to generate revenues faster, they said. The next blocks to be tendered will be on the Disko Island and Nuussuaq Peninsula area of West Greenland, industry and energy minister Aqqalu Jerimiassen told Reuters on the sidelines of a Greenland Day event at the Danish embassy in Beijing. Jerimiassen, who took office in May, said he met with the two Chinese oil majors, as well as China’s National Energy Administration, on Monday. The Chinese asked for follow-up meetings to discuss technical issues, said Jorn Skov Nielsen, Jerimiassen’s deputy. “They have not been active in Greenland earlier. It’s a new approach,” he added. “We are moving the short-term strategy of licensing onshore”. CNPC and CNOOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In neighbouring Iceland, CNOOC has been exploring the offshore Dreki area but has not reported any finds. Nielsen said it was too early to say how many blocks would be tendered, or to give an estimate for the resources in the “highly prospective” area. The U.S. Geogological Survey puts Greenland’s offshore oil and gas resources at about 50 billion barrels of oil equivalent, he said. Greenland’s domestic energy goal is to be powered 100 percent by clean energy by 2030, Jerimiassen later told a press conference, up from the current 70 percent, which is mostly from hydropower. Greenland will set up a representative office in Beijing “within a year,” to boost trade ties with China, Nielsen said. Denmark and the United States have been concerned about China’s interest in Greenland, notably over potential Chinese involvement in the financing and construction of airports. Greenland last month picked Denmark as a partner in the planned upgrade of two airports, having earlier shortlisted a Chinese firm for the job.

2018-10-30,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - High oil prices are hurting consumers and could also have adverse implications for producers, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Major emerging Asian economies such as India and Indonesia have been hit hard this year by rising crude oil prices, which despite declining this month are still up by about 15 percent since the start of 2018. Fuel import costs have been pushed up further by a slide in emerging market currencies against the dollar, denting growth and even triggering protests and government fuel price controls in India. “Many countries’ current account deficits have been affected by high oil prices,” IEA chief Fatih Birol said at an energy conference in Singapore. “There are two downward pressures on global oil demand growth. One is high oil prices, and in many countries they’re directly related to consumer prices. The second one is global economic growth momentum slowing down.” The effect of high oil prices will be compounded in Southeast Asia as demand is rising fast but production is falling, resulting in the region becoming a net importer of oil, gas and coal, Birol said. Despite the possibility of a slowdown, Birol said the general outlook for fuel consumption was for continued growth. While the rise of electric vehicles is expected to result in peak demand for products like diesel and gasoline within coming years, a consumption boom in products such as plastic as well as fuel demand growth from aviation have triggered large-scale refinery investment into petrochemical products and high quality products like jet fuel. “Global oil demand will continue to grow even amid the rise of electric vehicles as they are governed by petrochemicals, aviation, among others,” he said. BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, which has oil and gas assets but also hopes to benefit from the demand for raw materials coming from batteries for electric vehicles (EV), also said oil demand would still grow despite the rise of EVs. BHP’s Chief Commercial Officer, Arnoud Balhuizen, said on Tuesday during a conference in Melbourne that oil demand will increase by 1 percent a year on average over the next 10 to 15 years. “There will be substitution coming... on the back of an increased pickup of electric vehicles. But even if we plug in the most ambitious electric vehicle trends... in our forecasting, we continue to see oil demand on the back of other sectors,” he said. To meet the 1 percent per year consumption growth, Balhuizen said “quite a bit of new capital needs to be allocated to the oil industry in the next five to ten years to be able to meet that demand.” More so than oil, Birol said demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) would boom. He said that global LNG trade could pass 500 billion cubic meters per day (bcm) by 2023, growing by a third in the coming five years. BHP’s Balhuizen echoed this in Melbourne, saying “LNG is a commodity with very strong demand outlook.” Birol said just three countries, Qatar, Australia and the United States, would supply 60 percent of global LNG by 2023. LNG demand is primarily driven by growth in China, where an anti-pollution program is driving a massive shift from coal to natural gas. But demand is also expected to grow fast in Southeast Asia, where Birol said the power sector needed $50 billion of investment by 2040, more than twice the current level, to keep up with consumption. Despite this growth potential, the LNG sector faces increasing competition from renewables and storage technology, which are cleaner than fossil fuels and becoming much cheaper.  In many countries, Birol said solar power was on track to become the cheapest source of new electricity.

2018-10-30,"* Manila’s PNOC, Tokyo Gas, CNOOC in the running - energy min * PNOC seeking partner for project * Philippines wants LNG terminal to become trade hub (Adds no comment from Tokyo Gas) By Florence Tan SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - The Philippines has short-listed three different groups to build and operate its first liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal and hopes to nominate one by November, its energy minister said on Tuesday. Short-listed companies were chosen from 18 groups that submitted proposals for the project, Alfonso Cusi told Reuters on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week. They include state-owned Philippines National Oil Company (PNOC), which is seeking a partner for the project, Cusi said, while Tokyo Gas has partnered with the Philippines’ First Gen Corp. China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) is also in the running, although it has yet to firm up a local partner, Cusi said. CNOOC has been in talks with the Philippines’ Phoenix Petroleum as a partner, he added. “Hopefully we can have a conclusion on which proposal to accept by the end of November,” Cusi said. The Philippines is expected to start importing LNG to feed gas-fired power plants in Batangas province, south of the capital Manila, as domestic gas supplies from its Malampaya field are set to run out in 2024. Besides meeting local demand, the Philippines also hopes the terminal would become an LNG trading hub for the region, Cusi said. “We are already the de-facto transhipment port for LNG to China,” Cusi said, adding that large cargoes are often broken up into smaller parcels for deliveries to China via ship-to-ship transfers off the Philippines. “We should institutionalize this before someone else does.” PNOC last week formally announced it was seeking a joint-venture partner to design, build, finance, operate and maintain an LNG hub in Batangas Bay, near the gas-fired power plants supplying electricity to the country’s main Luzon island. Bidders have until Dec. 21 to submit eligibility documents to PNOC. A First Gen spokeswoman said the company has been open to taking in a partner for the LNG project, but she was not aware of any joint venture agreement or talks between First Gen and Tokyo Gas. First Gen operates four of the country’s five gas-fired power plants. Tokyo Gas declined to comment. Phoenix Petroleum, owned by local businessman Dennis Uy who helped fund President Rodrigo Duterte’s 2016 election campaign, in June signed a memorandum of understanding with CNOOC Gas and Power Group Co Ltd to “study, plan and develop” an LNG project in the Philippines. Last week, Phoenix said Philippine oil and gas exploration firm PXP Energy Corp may be granted “preferential rights” to acquire up to 49 percent of Phoenix’s interest in the planned LNG joint venture with CNOOC.

2018-10-30,"(Adds comment on growth, China) By Geert De Clercq PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French waste and water group Suez said strong European recycling revenue helped it book its best quarterly growth in seven years, even though cardboard prices had fallen due to a Chinese import ban. Suez said that on an organic basis - excluding scope and currency effects - revenue had grown 3.8 percent in the first nine months after growing 3 percent in the first half. Its quarter-on-quarter organic growth was 5.4 percent, the strongest quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2011. “In terms of growth, this was our best quarter in seven years,” said Suez chief financial officer Jean-Marc Boursier. On a gross basis, nine-month revenue rose 13 percent to 12.7 billion euros, including a 12 percent or 1.34 billion euro ($1.52 billion) effect due to the first-time consolidation of Suez’s GE Water acquisition. Core earnings in the first nine months of the year rose 6.7 percent to 2.05 billion euros, boosted by a strong performance at its key European recycling division, whose revenue rose two percent to 4.64 billion euros. Boursier said a Chinese import ban on low-quality paper and plastics had mainly hit its paper recycling business, as the price of cardboard had fallen from 112 euros per tonne at the end of 2017 to 77 euros per tonne at the end of September 2018. He estimated the impact at about 25 million euros on a full-year basis, but this was compensated by strength in other areas of the business as well as strong synergies from GE Water. The price of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) plastic film had fallen slightly following the halt of Chinese imports, but the price of other recycled plastics, such as PET for water bottles, had increased due to higher oil prices, Boursier said. Suez confirmed its 2018 earnings guidance for revenue growth of about nine percent and growth in EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) of about 10 percent, both at constant exchange rates. Nine-month EBIT stood at 963 million euros, up 4.4 percent gross and up 9.7 percent at constant exchange rates. $1 = 0.8797 euros

Global investor sentiment remains shaky,” said Yasuo Sakuma, chief investment officer at Libra Investments in Tokyo. Mainland China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite and the blue-chip CSI 300 gained to 1.0 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively, winning back earlier losses in a volatile session. China’s securities regulator said it would encourage share buybacks and mergers and acquisitions by listed firms, and would enhance market liquidity, in the latest attempt to put a floor under the country’s skidding equity markets. Japan’s Nikkei average also erased early losses and climbed 1.5 percent. Traders said investors were looking for bargains among beaten-down stocks. Other market participants said market sentiment found some support from comments by U.S. President Donald Trump suggesting the possibility of “a great deal” with China on trade. Major U.S. indexes fell sharply on Monday after a Bloomberg report that the United States is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping falter.

South Korea, a U.S. ally and one of Asia’s biggest buyers of Iranian oil, has already stopped crude imports from Iran. South Korean building firms have also cancelled energy-related contracts in Iran due to financing difficulties. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha asked for the exemption in a telephone call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo late on Monday, the ministry said in a statement.  “Minister Kang requested the U.S. side exert maximum flexibility so that South Korea can secure an exemption to minimise the damage to our companies,” the ministry said. Pompeo said he noted Seoul’s position and would continue discussions on the matter, the ministry said.  The exemption issue is the latest sign of strain between Seoul and Washington over a range of issues, especially the enforcement of sanctions aimed at limiting North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes. South Korea and Japan have been in talks with the United States in a bid to avoid adverse impacts from the reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran. Both countries won waivers during the previous round of sanctions that ended in 2016, but Washington has adopted a more aggressive stance this time. South Korean buyers of Iranian oil have cut their purchases in recent months due to expensive Middle East grades and uncertainty over trade with Iran. Imports of Iranian oil fell to zero in September for the first time since 2012. [O/KOREA1] Another risk for South Korean companies is that sanctions will make it difficult to receive and make payments in dollars for projects linked to Iran.   On Monday, Hyundai Engineering & Construction (000720.KS) said it scrapped a 595 billion won (407.29 million pounds)deal to build a petrochemicals complex in Iran due to lack of financing.  In June, Daelim Industrial (000210.KS) said a 2.23 trillion won contract to build a refinery project in Iran was cancelled due to financing problems.

2018-10-30,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Monday it will switch another 1.18 million residential households in 11 cities located in three central provinces to natural gas heating this winter as part of the country’s anti-air pollution campaign.  The 11 cities are located in the Fenwei Plain, made up of the provinces of Shanxi and Shaanxi, two of China’s biggest coal producing regions, as well as Henan. The area was included by Beijing as a “key battlefield” in the war against air pollution in July on top of 28 other cities in northern China. The switch from coal is due by the end of October, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) said in a statement, after local authorities submitted their clean energy heating plans to the central government earlier this year. Under the plan, coal burning heaters will be replaced by equipment running on gas or electricity. Air pollution in the Fenwei Plain is a concern. The city of Linfen in Shanxi, which has been called the most polluted city on Earth by other media, was identified as having the worst air quality among 169 cities monitored by the MEE in the first nine months of this year, the MEE said. Moving from coal to gas is aimed at reducing the amount of pollution from particulate matter measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5), pollution that is considered the most hazardous since it can lodge deep in the lungs. The Fenwei Plain region must cut its average concentration of PM2.5 by 4 percent between October and March next year from same period last year, the MEE said. Local governments will need to promote consolidation in the coke and steel industry to eliminate small and outdated capacity and improve the emission standards of the sectors. The MEE also asked the region to accelerate switching from road to railroad transportation by accelerating construction of rail lines connecting ports with coal mines, utilities, steel mills and coke plants. Heavy industry in the Fenwei Plain will need to implement production restrictions during the heating season, typically from mid-November until mid-March, or shut down if they fail to meet certain emission standards, the MEE said. Detailed output cutting plans will be set by individual cities by the end of October, it said. Luliang city in Shanxi province issued its winter anti-pollution plan on Monday night, ordering heavy industry to cut output by up to 50 percent from Nov. 1 to Mar. 31, 2019, according to a document from the environment bureau of Luliang. The households switched to gas in the Fenwei plain are in addition to the 3.62 million that need to be switched in the 28 other northern Chinese cities, the MEE said.  China’s total natural gas supply will increase by 25 billion cubic metres in 2018 compared to last year, focussing on Beijing and its nearby regions and Fenwei Plain, the National Energy Administration said in a news briefing on Tuesday.

2018-10-30,"AMMAN, Oct 30 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Poking above the bright pink bougainvillea that spills into the street, the lone minaret of the Ta’la Al-Ali mosque towers over the Khalda neighbourhood of Amman. Aside from its colourful stain-glassed windows and ornate calligraphy, this mosque stands out for another reason: its roof is covered with shining solar panels that make the building’s carbon emissions close to zero. The structure is part of a wider effort by mosques - and many other buildings in the city - to capitalise on Jordan’s plentiful sunshine and shift towards renewable energy, in a bid to achieve Amman’s goal of becoming a carbon neutral city by 2050. “Almost all the mosques here in Jordan now cover 100 percent of their energy needs” with renewable power, said Yazan Ismail, an energy auditor at ETA-max Energy and Environmental Solutions, a green consultancy in Jordan. Amman is one of more than 70 cities worldwide that are aiming to become “carbon neutral” by 2050, meaning they will produce no more climate-changing emissions than they can offset, such as by planting carbon-absorbing trees. Each is going about achieving the goal in its own way. But because cities account for about three-quarters of carbon dioxide emissions, according to the United Nations, and consume more than two-thirds of the world’s energy, whether they succeed or fail will have a huge impact on if the world’s climate goals are met. In Amman, the push to make mosques greener - which began in 2014, with backing from the Ministry of Religious Affairs - has been so successful that many are now selling excess energy back to the national grid, Ismail said. For the Ta’la Al-Ali mosque’s imam, who speaks to the faithful in his Friday sermons about protecting the climate, the decision to adopt clean energy coincides with wider religious values. “The main reason for the use of solar energy is religious duty,” said Ahmad Al Rawashdeh. Islam urges conservation of nature’s resources, he said, and “warns against extravagance”. But the use of solar energy, and power-saving LED lightbulbs, also is helping the mosque financially, he admitted. Amman, where temperatures already soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in the summer, has clear incentives to try to hold the line on global warming. But renewables are far from the norm in most of the country. Jordan still imports close to 96 percent of its energy, most of it polluting fossil fuels, from its Middle Eastern neighbours, according to the World Bank. Government officials say they are going to change that. “We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent by 2030,” Minister of Environment Nayef Hmeidi Al-Fayez told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The country aims to generate 20 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2022, Al-Fayez said. It’s a target he thinks will be met early, in part as solar panels go up on the city’s homes, businesses and government buildings. Earlier this year the Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) put in place $188 million in financing to develop Jordan’s largest solar power plant for the state National Electric Power Company. The project is scheduled to go online in the first half of 2020, and will supply power to about 110,000 homes while displacing 360,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, a statement from Masdar said. On the other side of the city, the Al-Hoffaz international academy - one of the first schools to go solar in Amman, in 2013 - now gets almost 95 percent of its energy from renewable sources, said Khaled Al Salaymah, assistant general manager of the school. At Al Hoffaz, children in orange and black uniforms chant their times-tables as they file down the stairs of the academy, one of about 100 schools in Amman seeking to lower carbon emissions. “Based on our community and public responsibilities we want to reduce our emissions and carbon contribution urgently,” said Al Salaymah. “Also, there’s an economic dimension: we’ve reduced our energy consumption costs too,” he said. Along with glimmering solar electrical panels covering the basketball court, the teachers’ car park and much of the roof, the school uses solar water heaters and recycles its waste while also prioritising environmental education, he said. “We hold awareness sessions for students, parents and teachers here to ensure they know the benefits of going green and using renewable energy,” Al Salaymah told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “It’s not just installing solar panels. We want to be green in every way.” He said he had noticed a rise in social awareness of the risks of climate change, particularly among young Jordanians. “The mentality has changed,” he said. Jordan is also trying to cut emissions from tourism. The country hopes to market itself as a haven for ecotourists keen to stay in zero-carbon resorts along the salty Dead Sea or near the UNESCO World Heritage site of Petra. The Feynan Ecolodge sits on the edge of the Dana Biosphere Reserve, on the road to the ancient crimson carved city of Petra. With solar appliances serving its 26 rooms and candle-lit corridors, the lodge is entirely off grid, and offers visitors the chance to feast on vegetarian food, stargaze or learn to bake bread beneath the hot sand. Manager Nabil Tarazi said the lodge’s daily energy consumption was less than that of a two-bedroom apartment in Amman. The lodge is part of a string of buildings backed by Jordan’s Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN), including a similar resort north of Amman in the protected forest reserve of Ajloun. Nestled among evergreen oaks, that lodge harvests rainwater and uses geothermal heating and cooling to keep its emissions at net zero. Despite Jordan’s efforts to cut carbon emissions, Amman faces big challenges, including a booming population, swollen by the arrival of more than half a million refugees fleeing conflict in neighbouring Syria. Arid Amman is also among the most water-stressed cities in the world - enough that Jordan is now looking into desalination plants to keep the taps running. But the push for solar power may also help. A May report by the World Resources Institute found that thirsty Middle Eastern and North African countries, including Jordan, could cut water demand by switching to solar power, which uses less water to produce than fossil fuel electricity generation. Jordan’s Environment Minister Al-Fayez said he has confidence Amman - and the country - will continue pushing to meet their ambitious carbon-cutting goals. ""We're always optimistic in Jordan. That's the way that we survive,"" he said. (Reporting by Adela Suliman; editing by Laurie Goering.

2018-10-30,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers continued to liquidate former bullish positions in oil last week and for the first time in more than a year clear signs of fresh short-selling emerged. Rising oil production from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Russia has eased concerns about the availability of supplies once U.S. sanctions on Iran are re-imposed in November. At the same time, intensifying fears about a possible global economic slowdown have hit oil prices and equity markets hard over the last three weeks. The bullish wave of hedge fund position-building in oil and refined products that started in July 2017 and crested in January 2018 has now largely broken. Portfolio managers’ combined positions in crude and refined products climbed from a low of 310 million barrels at the end of June 2017 to almost 1.5 billion barrels in late January but have since fallen back to just over half that level. Fund managers have not yet turned bearish on the outlook for oil prices; U.S. sanctions on Iran are deterring all but the most aggressive sellers. But the hedge fund community is no longer significantly bullish, with most managers opting to realise their profits after a year-long rally and await further developments. BAILING OUT Hedge funds and other money managers cut their combined net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 111 million barrels in the week to Oct. 23. Portfolio managers have cut their combined net long position by the equivalent of 298 million barrels over the last four weeks to just 801 million barrels, the lowest level for more than a year. Bullish long positions were cut to just 965 million barrels, the lowest level for 65 weeks, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. The ratio of long to short positions sank to less than 6:1, down from a recent peak of more than 12:1 at the end of September (tmsnrt.rs/2CMzx3Y). Hedge funds cut net length in Brent (-48 million barrels), NYMEX and ICE WTI (-43 million), U.S. gasoline (-11 million), U.S. heating oil (-7 million) and European gasoil (-2 million). Once again, the sell-off was driven mostly by the liquidation of former bullish long positions, which declined by a combined 81 million barrels. But clear evidence of fresh short selling emerged, with short positions up by 30 million barrels to 164 million barrels, the highest level since the end of June. In the NYMEX WTI contract, fund managers have boosted outright short positions by a total of 42 million barrels since the end of August, initiating the first new cycle of short-selling for almost a year.

2018-10-30,"(Adds comments, context on new policy) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Oct 29 (Reuters) - President-elect Jair Bolsonaro backed Brazil’s ethanol industry and pledged to be a partner of the biofuel sector, according to remarks aired on Monday during an international sugar conference in Sao Paulo. Right-wing Bolsonaro, who beat leftist Fernando Haddad in a run-off vote on Sunday, said in a video that he would like to see Brazil retake global leadership in ethanol production, which it lost to the United States some years ago. “In the past, we were leaders on this front and we will once again lead, certainly,” he said in the video presented by congressman Evandro Gussi, who authored the bill passed in Congress this year that implements Brazil’s new policy to boost consumption of renewable fuels called RenovaBio. This industry “is very important. It reduces carbon emissions, and from something that is ours, gives energy to Brazil. You can count on us, we are partners on this issue,” Bolsonaro said. Gussi said he recorded the video some days ago, before the run-off vote. The RenovaBio program is seen by many in Brazil’s sugar and ethanol industry as a lifeline to mills that are in a difficult financial situation after several years of low prices for the biofuel and the sweetener. The new policy, which has yet to be fully regulated by the federal government that will take power on Jan. 1, gives fuel distributors growing targets for annual traded volumes of biofuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. There were doubts in the ethanol industry if Bolsonaro, who at one point threatened to pull out of the Paris climate treaty, would back the policy and go ahead with its implementation. Some days before the second round of the election, he did a U-turn, saying that Brazil would honor the treaty it has signed.

2018-10-30,"* U.S. plans more China tariffs if Trump-Xi meeting fails -report * Asian shares follow Wall St down, on track for worst Oct since 08 * Euro drops as Merkel decides to give up party chair job * Investors nervously watch Chinese markets By Tomo Uetake TOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Asian shares came under pressure on Tuesday after Wall Street peers finished weaker, hurt by fresh worries about the U.S.-China trade war and were on track for their biggest October decline since the 2008 financial crisis. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slid 0.1 percent, tracking falls in U.S. stocks. The index has fallen more than 12 percent this month. Japan’s Nikkei average rose 0.9 percent and the Australian benchmark shed 0.2 percent in early morning trade. Major U.S. indices fell steeply in volatile trade after a Bloomberg report that the United States is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping falter. The CBOE Global Markets volatility index, known as Wall Street’s “fear gauge”, jumped to as high as 27.86 points, its highest since Oct. 11 and the second highest since volatility shock in early February. “The probability of global stocks turning to a bear market is increasing,” said Masanari Takada, cross-assets strategist at Nomura Securities. “While some investors who look at fundamentals buy stocks on dips, there are other players who keep selling automatically in response to heightened volatility. Buyers will be overwhelmed if we have negative headlines on tariffs at time like this.” China’s major stock indices fell sharply on Monday as earnings reports from industrial and consumer firms raised concerns about the slowdown in economic growth and the impact of policy support so far. The Shanghai Composite Index shed 2.2 percent to finish at 2,542, well below the key 2,600 points while the blue-chip CSI300 index closed 3.0 percent lower. China’s yuan closed at its weakest in over a decade on Monday, losing 0.16 percent to end the domestic session at 6.9560 per dollar, stirring speculation over whether the central bank will tolerate a slide beyond the key level of 7 per dollar. Prior to the spot market’s open, the offshore yuan was little changed at 6.9730 after falling on Friday to as low as 6.9760 to the dollar, its weakest since January 2017. The dollar index edged higher and was just below its a 10-week high it hit on Friday. The index gained on a decline in the euro after news German Chancellor Angela Merkel would not seek re-election as head of her CDU party. Merkel said she would not seek re-election as party chairwoman, heralding the end of a 13-year era in which she has dominated European politics. Oil prices edged lower overnight after Russia signaled that output will remain high and as concern over the global economy fueled worries about demand for crude. The West Texas Intermediate crude futures and Brent crude futures last traded at $66.81 and $76.77 a barrel, respectively.

2018-10-30,"* Stock markets hit by threat of new tariffs * Russia, US, Saudi crude output: tmsnrt.rs/2PsoB2b * Iran seaborne crude exports: tmsnrt.rs/2PkSYHU By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Tuesday, dragged down by ongoing weakness in global stock markets and by signs of rising global supply despite looming sanctions on Iran’s crude exports. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $76.78 a barrel at 0040 GMT, down 56 cents, or 0.8 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $66.78 a barrel, down 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement. Oil has been caught up by broad financial market slumps this month, with stocks falling again on Monday after reports the U.S. is planning an additional $257 billion worth of tariffs on Chinese goods if upcoming talks between Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to end a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Oil was also being weighed down by signs of rising supply from top producers. “A Saudi pledge to produce as much oil as possible, and the stock market rout, have sharply reduced concerns about the Nov. 4 implementation of U.S. sanctions against Iran,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank. Russia has also indicated that it will provide enough oil to meet demand once U.S. sanctions hit Iran from next week. In a sign that oil supply remains ample despite the looming U.S. sanctions against Iran’s petroleum exports, crude output from the world’s top 3 producers, Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia, reached 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in September, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. C-RU-OUT C-OUT-T-EIA PRODN-SA That’s an increase of 10 million bpd since the start of the decade and means that these three producers alone now meet a third of global crude demand. Despite that, Hansen said “given the yet unknown impact on Iran’s ability to produce and export (amid sanctions) ... we could see some speculative buying emerge ahead of Nov. 4.” Iran’s seaborne crude exports, by contrast, have fallen from a 2018-peak of just over 2.5 million bpd in May to around 1.5 million bpd in September and October, Eikon data showed.
