2018-12-12,"(Adds comment and context) By Jennifer Hiller HOUSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Hess Corp said on Wednesday it expects oil and gas output to grow more than 10 percent a year compounded through 2025, touting development of its Bakken shale and offshore Guyana projects. The company projects higher margins will drive compound annual cash flow growth of 20 percent through 2025, it said ahead of a meeting with Wall Street investors. Hess shrugged off a recent dip in oil prices and said it was moving from growth and investment mode to where its major assets will start producing free cash flow. “We are at a transformative inflection point,” Chief Executive John Hess said during the investor meeting, broadcast over the internet. Hess boosted the production forecast for its Bakken shale field in North Dakota to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2021, from 175,000 boepd. The shale acreage, the jewel in the crown of the company’s onshore production, will produce $5 billion in free cash flow between 2019 and 2025. Hess expects the first production from the offshore Guyana discovery to be tapped in 2020, and said the region had the potential to produce more than 750,000 boepd by 2025. Hess is working with Exxon Mobil Corp on fields projected to hold up to 5 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas. Guyana through 2025 will generate $4 billion free cash flow for Hess, said Greg Hill, president and chief operating officer. The New York-based company earlier this week set a 2019 capital budget of $2.9 billion, up 38 percent from this year’s projected spending plan. The budget reflects “peak” spending for the first phase of offshore Guyana oil discoveries. Hess plans to keep capital spending flat around $3 billion annually through 2025 and will be able to return money to shareholders in, “any type of price environment,” said Chief Financial Officer John Rielly. Investors for a year have pressured oil and gas producers to rein in spending and instead focus on profits. Companies are starting to disclose their 2019 budgets, which generally are released in December and January. Hess will complete a $1.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of the year. It does not plan additional share buybacks now, but if profits exceed expectations, a “priority would be more share buybacks,” Hess said. Hess stock was down a fraction at $51.74 a share on Wednesday. The stock is up about 12 percent year to date.

2018-12-12,"ZHOUSHAN, China/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China’s port city of Zhoushan is planning to challenge Singapore’s dominance of the multi-billion dollar shipping fuel industry, relying on proximity to some of the world’s biggest ports and Beijing’s support to give it an edge.  It will be steep going. The port facilities in the cluster of islands around Zhoushan have annual marine fuel sales of 3.6 million tonnes, less than a tenth of the record 50.6 million tonnes of shipping or bunker fuel Singapore sold in 2017.  Zhoushan, though, was ranked fourth in global container traffic in 2016, according to the World Shipping Council, and it sits 150 km (90 miles) from the world’s biggest container port at Shanghai, and within a day’s voyage of other major ports including Ningbo and Nanjing.  Zhoushan wants to go after the fuelling business represented by this traffic, and many shippers and analysts expect it to mount the first serious challenge to Singapore in decades.  It’s not just bunkers. A thriving bunker market attracts valuable secondary businesses - shipping supplies, maintenance and repairs, insurance and other maritime financial services - worth billions of dollars more a year.  “With over 3 billion-tonnage freight handled by Zhoushan and nearby ports, that exceeds Singapore ... We shall not miss the vast market in front of our door,” said Ying Zhongmin, head of policy and regulations at Zhoushan Free Trade Zone.  Singapore handled almost 630 million tonnes of cargo in 2017, with vessel arrivals totaling 2.8 billion tonnes, according to government data.  Zhang Haichao, chairman and general manager of Sinopec Corp (600028.SS) unit Sinopec Sales Co, said at an industry event in October that by 2030 Zhoushan’s bunkering volumes will have risen to 30 million tonnes a year, in keeping with targets set by port authorities.      Nearby, there are a half-dozen fuel producers, including the 400,000 barrels-per-day (bpd) Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp plant to be launched at year-end. Zhoushan could lure in oil and LNG tankers, dry-bulk carriers bringing raw materials from Australia, and container ships heading to the U.S. West Coast.  “Vessels calling on China close to Zhoushan and north of it, as well as Japan and (South) Korea, will definitely give it a close look,” said Ashok Sharma, managing director of shipbroker BRS Baxi in Singapore.  Chinese vessels would find it particularly attractive, he said.  GRAPHIC: Top 20 Container Ports - tmsnrt.rs/2RwkEY0 Zhoushan plans to take advantage of marine fuel regulations that will cap sulfur content in shipping fuel at 0.5 percent from 2020, down from 3.5 percent.  The new International Maritime Organization (IMO) rules mean three-quarters of the 4 million barrels per day (bpd) of high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) now consumed by global shippers will shift to low-sulfur fuels like marine gasoil (MGO) and low-sulfur fuel oil (LSFO).  While Singapore has three major refineries - owned by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS), Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and the joint-venture Singapore Refining Company - they are geared for high-value product exports and not marine fuels. Under the IMO rules, Singapore will have to import these fuels, including from producers in China and the Middle East, inflating costs.  “Chinese ports like Zhoushan will be closer to the source of production of the new compliant fuel,” said Ralph Leszczynski, head of research at ship broker Banchero Costa in Singapore. “The pricing could potentially turn to Zhoushan’s advantage.”  Sinopec, Asia’s biggest oil refiner, moved its global bunker fuel center to Zhoushan from Beijing in May and is preparing to pump IMO-compliant fuel from 2019.  Top global independent oil merchant Vitol has also set up a trade office in Zhoushan for bunkers and other oil products in a joint operation with Zhejiang Seaport Group, said Zhoushan government officials and industry sources.  Vitol declined to comment.  While Zhoushan may chip away at some of Singapore’s bunker market share, its success depends on factors such as the cost and efficiency of its fuelling infrastructure, where Singapore is unrivalled, BRS Baxi’s Sharma said.  “Zhoushan will find it challenging to achieve the same standards and ease of doing business.”   GRAPHIC: Major Bunker Ports - tmsnrt.rs/2RpRyK4 China has 11 licensed bunker suppliers, including state-run Sinopec and Chimbusco, and independents such as Herun Group and Zhoushan Seaport Group, all operating in Zhoushan.  They are up against more than 50 outfits in Singapore, alongside the world’s busiest shipping lane and supplying some of the cheapest marine fuel available.  “Zhoushan is gaining some traction in competition to South Korea on bunker prices, but it still is quite a distance behind Singapore in terms of efficiency and infrastructure,” said an executive with China’s Nanjing Tanker Corp, which refuels some of its 65 vessels at the port.  A ship can refuel in around six hours in Singapore, while in Zhoushan it can take much longer due to greater bureaucracy, according to industry participants.  Ships take bunkers in Singapore because of its efficiency, transparency and strict standards, which translate into saved costs and time.  “The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore ... continues to implement and uphold high standards,” said an MPA spokeswoman, citing the required use of mass flow meters for fuel oil deliveries from 2017, and the extension of that requirement to gasoil in mid-2019.  GRAPHIC: China challenges Singapore's bunker fuel dominance - tmsnrt.rs/2RwlILu Zhoushan was approved as a free trade zone in early 2017, and was the first Chinese city allowed to grant marine fuel licenses. In October this year, it announced a new import regulation on marine blending fuels, a move to serve a broader range of shippers’ needs.  Zhoushan has also asked the Ministry of Finance for a waiver on a consumption tax on bunker sales, and a rebate on value-added taxes for locally produced marine fuels, officials said.

2018-12-12,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s government on Wednesday flagged state oil giant Pemex’s ‘delicate’ finances as it prepared to present the 2019 budget, seeking to reassure markets by saying that the company should not be saddled with more debt to fund upcoming projects.  Plans by new leftist president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador for a refinery in southern Mexico have fanned investor concerns about potential new burdens on Pemex, which is weighed down with some $106 billion in financial debt. Addressing lawmakers in a congressional hearing, deputy finance minister Arturo Herrera acknowledged concerns that Pemex risks a credit rating downgrade and said the company would need to be looked after very carefully. “There isn’t much room to maneuver. What puts the Pemex rating in risk aren’t the projects that have been announced,” he said. “What puts (it) at risk is the financial situation.” If the government wanted to push projects in Pemex that went beyond its financial means, it would need to find new capital, Herrera said. “It can’t be via taking on more debt.” Lopez Obrador has not detailed how upcoming projects would be financed, but said government spending on Pemex would increase by around $3.7 billion in the next budget. Savings made elsewhere would pay for oil sector plans, he says.    Earlier, Finance Minister Carlos Urzua told lawmakers in the lower house of Congress that he was targeting a primary budget surplus, which excludes interest payments on past debt, of around 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for 2019. The government is due to present the budget on Saturday. Urzua said it was vital Mexico retained the confidence of financial markets and international investors. “I think it will be a great signal for the country and for the world,” Urzua said of the planned primary surplus. “We’re a completely open economy, for better or worse, we have to pay attention to how the rest of the world perceives us, especially in the financial sector,” he added. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, has pledged to increase pensions and cut taxes along the northern border. That has set a considerable challenge for Urzua, and markets are following the budget discussions closely. The previous administration targeted a 2018 primary budget surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP, the first such surplus in a decade. Markets have been skeptical of the Lopez Obrador administration since the former Mexico City mayor said on Oct. 29 he would cancel a partly built $13 billion airport for the capital, arguing the project was tainted by corruption. That led to a dispute with investors holding some of the $6 billion in bonds issued to finance the hub’s construction. The government last week offered to buy back $1.8 billion of the debt, before sweetening its offer on Tuesday. Urzua said that what he called a restructuring of the airport debt would not have any negative impact on the budget. Nevertheless, he said Mexico needed to respect foreign investment, as well as attract it to fuel stronger growth.

2018-12-12,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 12 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Top officials and advocates are pushing at U.N. talks in Poland to ensure governments and businesses respect human rights when working to build a green future under the Paris climate pact. The climate change conference, due to end on Friday, is struggling to agree rules for efforts to keep global temperature rise “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris accord. One sticking point is how obligations on human rights should be incorporated into the “rule book” for implementing the Paris deal. “Climate change already has affected the lives of so many people - the right to food because of terrible droughts, the right to live in proper ways,” U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said at the talks. Most references to human rights have been stripped out of the text now under negotiation in Katowice, experts said. However, it remains in clauses relating to carbon markets, although Egypt, on behalf of the Arab Group of nations, and Saudi Arabia have opposed its inclusion, they added. The wording is key to avoid a repeat of previous rights abuses linked to carbon credits for renewable energy projects under the Kyoto Protocol, said Sebastien Duyck, a senior attorney at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL). The Kyoto Protocol is a treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which expires in 2020 when the Paris Agreement takes off. In Panama, the construction of a hydroelectric dam had been eligible to receive carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a scheme for rich nations to offset their emissions under the Kyoto Protocol, despite displacing indigenous people, CIEL said. The Barro Blanco Dam had forced from their homes indigenous Ngabe who lived on the site of its reservoir, said Duyck. In 2016, builders of Barro Blanco finally withdrew the dam from the CDM, he said. Similar problems with other CDM projects have been reported in countries including Honduras, Guatemala and Kenya. Bachelet said her organisation had collected reports of such abuses, but relied on national human rights watchdogs for that information. It was important to strengthen the independence of those national agencies, typically funded by governments, to ensure human rights and green development go hand in hand, she said. It is “a political issue”, she emphasised. Sachs lamented that links between human rights and climate change were not more central in the Paris “rule book” draft. Wild weather - from record-breaking hurricanes to punishing floods and drought - has grown stronger around the world as the planet warms, with dramatic humanitarian consequences. “I think the bigger issue with climate change is millions are being displaced - not because of projects but because of climate change - and so we should focus on climate change as a violation of rights,” he said. Bringing to court those most responsible for global warming - including fossil fuel companies, a growing trend in the United States - was a large part of respecting human rights, he said. Activists said they were running out of patience. Standing in front of a banner reading “Protect our rights”, New Zealand climate activist Kera Sherwood-O’Regan urged negotiators gathered in a corridor to call their ministers and “tell them right now that we need our rights in the text”. If the inclusion of human rights in relation to the CDM’s successor mechanism remains in the rule book, it could help safeguard groups like forest dwellers from abuses, said Duyck. But should those references be scrapped, ""the risks are very clear"", he added. (Reporting by Sebastien Malo @sebastienmalo, Editing by Megan Rowling.

2018-12-12,"(Adds company comment, paragraphs 7-8, 13-14) By Erwin Seba HOUSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - An “ineffective” safeguard failed to prevent an explosive mixing of air and fuel at a Husky Energy refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, leading to a blast and fire in the plant’s gasoline-producing unit in April, a U.S. industrial safety group said on Wednesday. Air seeped through a hole in a valve within a fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) said, causing an April 26 explosion that led to a massive fire and a 24-hour-long evacuation of residents living within miles of the plant. The board said 36 people sought medical treatment after the blast, including 11 working at the refinery. The plant was undergoing maintenance at the time. Husky, according to the CSB, had only considered a failure of the valve when locked open, not a failure when it was closed, according to an updated report the board presented of its months-long investigation at a meeting in Superior. The failures leading to the Superior refinery explosion were similar to those that caused a 2015 explosion in an FCCU at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp . Exxon sold the refinery to PBF Energy in 2016. “Prior to both incidents, the process hazard analyses identified scenarios in which hydrocarbons flowed into the air side of the FCCU and vice versa due to a failure of the spent catalyst slide valve (SCSV), but the safeguards listed to protect against those scenarios were ineffective,” the board said. Husky did not dispute the CSB’s finding, and will continue to work with the board while it conducts its own investigation into the explosion, said spokesman Mel Duvall. The CSB’s “investigation is important to understanding what happened,” Duvall said. “We are also continuing with our own investigation.” The CSB, created by the U.S. Clean Air Act, has no regulatory or enforcement authority but is charged with determining the causes of chemical plant explosions and fires and making recommendations to government and industry. “Given the similarities between these two incidents, the CSB will be examining areas of further improvement that need to be taken by industry,” the board said. FCCUs use a fine, silica catalyst in high heat to make gasoline from gas oil and the passage of the sand-like catalyst over the slide valve at the Superior refinery wore a hole in it. A mixture of air and hydrocarbon within the unit can easily find an ignition source in the 1,300 degree Fahrenheit (715 Celsius) operating temperature of the FCCU. “While we don’t expect to resume normal operations at the refinery until 2020, we remain committed to our employees and the community,” Duvall said. Duvall said the company is reviewing alternatives to hydrogen flouride as it prepares to rebuild the refinery for restart in 2020.

2018-12-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil ended lower on Wednesday after reports that Iran’s oil minister said divisions exist within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, leading futures to give up earlier gains on OPEC-led production curbs and export cuts from Libya.  Crude pared gains late in the session after reports that Iran’s Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh told state television that the cartel had been unfriendly toward OPEC’s third largest producer.  OPEC last week agreed to production cuts only after Iran, whose crude exports have been depleted by U.S. sanctions since early November, greenlighted the deal.  OPEC said on Wednesday it had offset a drop in sanctions-hit exports from Iran. Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani also said on state TV on Tuesday that export have improved since early November.  Earlier in the trading day, prices rose, bolstered by export cuts from Libya and planned OPEC-led production cuts  Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled at $60.15 a barrel, down 5 cents on the day, while U.S. crude CLc1 was down 50 cents at $51.15 a barrel.  Oil prices have fallen by a third since the start of October, when it hit a four-year high above $87. It is set for its biggest quarterly slide since the fourth quarter of 2014. The market also shrugged off government data that showed U.S. crude stockpiles fell 1.2 million barrels last week, a much smaller drawdown than the 10 million-barrel decline reported by industry group the American Petroleum Institute and less than half the draw of 3 million barrels analysts had forecast. “The divergence from the large inventory decline reported by the API makes the report appear more negative than it actually was,” said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital Management in New York.  Concerns about global oversupply of crude, driven largely by U.S. output from shale formations has driven the market lower in recent weeks, and prompted OPEC and some non-OPEC producers including Russia to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) for six months from Jan. 1. “The OPEC+ deal from last week will allow more of a bullish position to be taken up by some market participants from this point,” analysts at JBC Energy said in a report. “The crude picture at least looks somewhat firmer for the next six months than it did previously.” Prices drew support this week after Libya declared force majeure on exports from its largest oilfield on Sunday after tribesmen and state security guards seized the facility. Still, a weaker economic outlook and higher production elsewhere have weighed down the market. Crude output has surged in the United States, set to end 2018 as the world’s top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia. “We are quite confident that OPEC+ will be successful in tightening up the front end of the oil market thus keeping the Brent crude oil one-month contract in $60+ a barrel territory over the next six months,” SEB commodities strategist Bjarne Schieldrop said. “Investors and producers however fear a tsunami of additional U.S. shale oil supply in late 2019 and 2020 as new pipelines are installed from the Permian to the U.S. Gulf.” Additional reporting by Alex Lawler and Henning Gloystein; Editing by Marguerita Choy and David Gregorio",https://uk.reuters.com/article/global-oil/update-9-oil-ends-lower-on-iran-comments-despite-libya-opec-supply-cuts-idUKL3N1YH1DS,12 Dec 2018,"* OPEC offsets Iran oil loss, sees lower 2019 demand

2018-12-12,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets rallied along with U.S. Treasury yields on Wednesday as optimism abounded for a trade thaw between the United States and China while sterling bounced on indications UK Prime Minister Theresa May would survive a no-confidence vote.  U.S. Treasury yields advanced in tandem with Wall Street’s gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were progressing with discussions under way by telephone and more meetings likely among officials of both countries. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd if it served national security interests or helped to close a trade deal. China made its first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months on Wednesday, two U.S. traders said, and its first since Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping struck a trade war truce in early December. But after a spate of dizzying volatility in the past few days, there was some wariness about whether gains would hold. “The market just kind of gets whipsawed every time you get a headline,” said Tom Hainlin, global investment strategist at Ascent Private Capital Management in Minneapolis. “These are policies and concerns that don’t have a lot of informational arbitrage - it is hard to know exactly where the U.S.-China trade is going to go.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 158.8 points, or 0.65 percent, to 24,529.04, the S&P 500 gained 14.45 points, or 0.55 percent, to 2,651.23 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.48 points, or 0.95 percent, to 7,098.31. Still, U.S. equities finished well off their session highs and traders were not convinced the market was ready for a sustained move upward after two-straight days of gains.  “The risk right now is to the downside still, even though we had this reversal,” said Gordon Charlop, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities in New York.  The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.69 percent to give the index its best two-day performance in two-and-1/2 years and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.10 percent.     The British pound sterling jumped off 20-month lows as Prime Minister May vowed to fight a challenge to her leadership, saying a change could jeopardize Britain’s divorce from the European Union.  May won a vote of confidence in her leadership right as U.S. markets closed for the session. Sterling was last trading at $1.261, up 1.01 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.33 percent, with the euro up 0.46 percent to $1.1366. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.9096 percent, from 2.881 percent late on Tuesday.

2018-12-12,"MILAN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A hack on Italian oil services firm Saipem (SPMI.MI) that crippled more than 300 of the company’s computers used a variant of the notorious Shamoon virus, Saipem said, a development that links the case to a massive attack in 2012 on Saudi Aramco. “The cyber attack hit servers based in the Middle East, India, Aberdeen and in a limited way Italy through a variant of Shamoon malware,” the company said in a statement on Wednesday.  Work is under way “in a gradual and controlled manner” to fully restore operations after the attack, it said.  The Shamoon virus was used in some of the most damaging cyber attacks in history, starting in 2012 when it crippled tens of thousands of computers at Saudi Aramco and RasGas Co Ltd in the Middle East - attacks that cybersecurity researchers said were conducted on behalf of Iran.  Saudi Aramco is Saipem’s biggest customer.  The attack crippled between 300 and 400 servers and up to 100 personal computers out of a total of about 4,000 Saipem machines, the company’s head of digital and innovation, Mauro Piasere, told Reuters. No data will be lost because the company had backed up the affected computers, he said. The company said it first identified the attack on Monday.  Piasere said the company does not know who was responsible for the attack.  However, Adam Meyers, vice president with U.S. cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, said he believed Iran was responsible because early technical analysis of the new Shamoon variant showed similarities to the 2012 campaign.  Shamoon disables computers by overwriting a file known as the master boot record, making it impossible for devices to start up. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the 2012 hack of Saudi Aramco was probably the most destructive cyber attack on a private business. Shamoon went dormant until it resurfaced in late 2016 in a series of Middle East attacks that continued through early 2017. “It went dark for a long time and it seems to be back,” said Eric Chien, senior researcher at cybersecurity firm Symantec. “The question is whether any others were affected by it.” Security researchers widely believe that people working on behalf of the Iranian government were behind previous Shamoon attacks, which Tehran strongly denies. Anti-U.S. imagery was found in the code, researchers have said.  Officials in Iran could not be reached for comment. Saipem, one of the world’s largest subsea engineering and construction firms, is controlled by Italian state lender CDP and oil firm Eni (ENI.MI).

2018-12-12,"* Trump says trade talks under way with China * Europe stocks close higher, Wall Street rallies * Pound rises off 20-month low * U.S. CPI in line with expectations (Updates with close of European markets, changes byline) By Chuck Mikolajczak NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - A gauge of global stock markets rallied along with U.S. Treasury yields on Wednesday as optimism abounded for a trade thaw between the U.S. and China while sterling bounced on bets that UK Prime Minister Theresa May would keep her job. U.S. Treasury yields advanced in tandem with Wall Street’s gains after U.S. President Donald Trump said trade talks with China were progressing with discussions under way by telephone and more meetings likely among officials of both countries. In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies if it served national security interests or helped to close a trade deal. China made its first major U.S. soybean purchases in more than six months on Wednesday, two U.S. traders said, and its first since Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping struck a trade war truce in early December. But after a spate of dizzying volatility in the past few days, there was some wariness about whether gains would hold. “You had the tax stimulus was very big this year and next year there is still some stimulus to come,” said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at Globalt Investments in Atlanta, Georgia. “Then the headwind is tariffs ... next year, depending on which scenario that plays out, we either have continued stimulus or it overwhelms that stimulus.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 265.64 points, or 1.09 percent, to 24,635.88, the S&P 500 gained 26.66 points, or 1.01 percent, to 2,663.44 and the Nasdaq Composite added 98.96 points, or 1.41 percent, to 7,130.79. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.69 percent to give the index its best two-day performance in two-and-1/2 years and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.39 percent. The British pound sterling jumped off 20-month lows as Prime Minister May vowed to fight a challenge to her leadership, saying a change could jeopardize Britain’s divorce from the European Union. May has secured indications of support from nearly 200 of her lawmakers, which would be enough to ensure she wins a no confidence vote on Wednesday, based on statements made to the media and on social media. The currency had tumbled on concerns about the vote of no confidence in the prime minister but traders bet she would survive after a number of colleagues backed her, isolating rivals who want a clean, sudden break from the EU. Sterling was last trading at $1.2645, up 1.29 percent on the day. The dollar index fell 0.37 percent, with the euro up 0.48 percent to $1.1368. Investors were also digesting U.S. consumer price data that showed unchanged headline inflation, causing U.S. Treasuries to initially pare gains. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 8/32 in price to yield 2.9078 percent, from 2.881 percent late on Tuesday. While markets still expect the Fed to tighten at its policy meeting next week, Trump said in a Reuters interview on Tuesday that the central bank would be “foolish” to do so. U.S. crude rose 1.24 percent to $52.29 per barrel as oil was supported by a drop in U.S. crude inventories, a cut in Libyan exports and an OPEC-led deal to trim output.

2018-12-12,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Climate change talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on limiting global warming are in their final week in Katowice, the capital of Poland’s Silesian coal mining district. The aim is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a look at the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue built on the site of the former Katowice coal mine. Subscribers to Eikon can find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: The Polish president of the talks said he hoped ministers would be able to unlock issues that technical negotiators have been unable to agree on. “A new text has been released today and ministers are engaged on a number of subjects in order to solve issues which could not have been solved at the technical level and require a political arbitrage,” said Michal Kurtyka. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres returned to Katowice on Wednesday for the talks and said failure would send a “disastrous message”. “To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal,” Guterres told delegates at the conference. Earlier, Vanuatu’s Foreign Minister Ralph Regenvanu told Reuters the technical negotiators were exhausted and had almost given up. Members of Gastivists, a network of grassroots movements against gas, disrupted a European Union side event organized by GasNaturally, an association of gas industry bodies. “At the same time that the European Union has corporate fossil fuel lobbyists talking on their stage, the European Parliament is voting to extend fossil fuel subsidies for another 10 years,” said Kevin Buckland, one of the activists. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will stop financing coal projects and nearly all oil projects, it said on Wednesday, as part of a global effort by government-owned development banks to reduce climate change. The bank was already prioritizing renewable energy and other “green economy” work but the move will now eliminate exceptions like Mongolia and Kazakhstan which get over 70 percent of their domestic energy from coal.

2018-12-12,"(Adds comments from Brazil’s cane industry group) By Marcelo Teixeira SAO PAULO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government approved consultations at the World Trade Organization regarding subsidies it says India gives to cane producers and sugar exporters, Brazil’s trade ministry said. Brazil said it has decided to start a formal action at the WTO after failing to receive enough information from India following letters it sent to the Indian government seeking clarifications on sugar policies. “The suspicion is that Indian domestic support (to farmers) and its subsidies to sugar exports caused significant impacts in the sugar market in a context of falling prices and decreasing production in the main centers Brazil, China and Thailand,” the Brazilian trade ministry said in a written statement late on Tuesday. India is expected to surpass Brazil as the world’s largest sugar producer in the current global sugar crop, with output around 33 million tonnes while Brazil’s production is expected to fall almost 10 million tonnes to below 30 million tonnes. Brazil said India’s government policy to guarantee a minimum price for cane to farmers has caused production to surge. It says this policy, combined with subsidies to sugar transportation, is allowing the country to ship excess sugar production abroad. Sugar prices in New York reached a 10-year low in September. Prices have recovered a bit since then, but are still barely covering production costs for most companies. As a result, Brazilian mills sharply reduced their sugar production in the current season, diverting cane to ethanol instead and leaving sugar equipment idle. Brazil’s cane industry group Unica said it hopes other sugar producing countries such as Australia would join the Brazilian government action at the WTO as interested parties. It said Indian policies led Brazilian mills to lose around $1.3 billion in revenue, considering lost sales and sugar price falls in the 2018/19 season alone. Unica estimates that losses worldwide reached around 3 billion dollars. This is the second WTO case related to sugar that Brazil starts this year. In October, it had opened consultations against anti-dumping tariffs implemented by China. Unica’s director Eduardo Leão told Reuters that a meeting between Brazilian and Chinese negotiators regarding that consultation is scheduled for Dec. 18-19 in Geneva.

2018-12-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a rare break with President Donald Trump, the Senate voted on Wednesday to move ahead with a resolution to end U.S. military support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition in the war in Yemen and lawmakers vowed to push for sanctions against the kingdom in the new year. Eleven of Trump’s fellow Republicans joined Democrats to provide the 60 votes needed to advance the war powers resolution in the Republican-led chamber. The vote paved the way for debate and a vote on U.S. involvement in a conflict that has led to the deaths of tens of thousands of civilians, many of them young children and left millions more at risk of starvation and death by disease.  The nearly unprecedented break the 11 Republicans made from Trump was largely symbolic because the House of Representatives is not expected to take the matter up this year. Trump has threatened a veto.  But backers of the resolution said it sent an important message that lawmakers are unhappy with the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and angry about the lack of a strong U.S. response to the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey. Republican and Democratic lawmakers also vowed to keep pushing after the new Congress take office in January for further tough action against Saudi Arabia, including legislation to impose human rights sanctions and opposition to weapons sales. “If you want to buy our weapons, there are certain things you have to accept. How you use them matters,” Republican Senator Lindsey Graham told a news conference. “The individual, the crown prince, is so toxic, so tainted, so flawed, that I can’t ever see myself doing business with Saudi Arabia unless there’s a change there,” said Graham, generally a close Trump ally in the Senate. Republicans will hold a slightly larger majority in the new Senate, but Democrats will take control of the House of Representatives, increasing the chances of sanctions legislation passing. The Trump administration had urged Congress not to oppose U.S. fuelling, targeting help and other support for the Saudi-led coalition as it battles the Houthis, Shi’ite Muslim fighters viewed by Yemen’s neighbours as agents of Iran. Earlier on Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo defended the administration’s handling of Khashoggi’s killing. Pompeo repeated his assertion there was no direct evidence linking Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the Oct. 2 killing of Khashoggi in Istanbul, despite a CIA assessment it was likely he ordered the killing. Riyadh initially denied knowledge of Khashoggi’s disappearance, then offered contradictory explanations, including that he was killed in a rogue operation. Trump condemned the murder but has stood by the Saudi crown prince. “He’s the leader of Saudi Arabia. They’ve been a very good ally,” Trump told Reuters on Tuesday in an Oval Office interview. Central Intelligence Agency Director Gina Haspel briefed leaders of the House of Representatives behind closed doors about the killing. After the classified meeting, House members said they had not heard anything to change their minds about Khashoggi’s death. Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, likely the next chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee when Democrats take control of the House in January, said he intended to hold hearings starting early next year on all aspects of Saudi behaviour and the U.S.-Saudi relationship. “Saudi Arabia’s an important ... partner, but I don’t think we can simply look the other way when things happen and talk about business as usual,” Engel said. Pompeo and Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, who held a separate briefing for the entire Senate, are due to discuss Saudi Arabia with the entire House on Thursday. But several lawmakers have urged that Congress keep the Yemen conflict separate from anger over the killing of Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist. They view Saudi Arabia as an essential counterweight in the Middle East to Iran, arch-enemy of close U.S. ally Israel. White House officials see Saudi support as a linchpin for an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan yet to be unveiled by the Trump administration. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters on Wednesday in Jerusalem that Saudi Arabia’s role in the Middle East must be taken into account in responding to Khashoggi’s “horrific” fate. “If Saudi Arabia were to be destabilised, the world would be destabilised,” Netanyahu told foreign reporters, speaking in English.

2018-12-12,"MILAN/NEW YORK, Dec 12 (Reuters) - A hack on Italian oil services firm Saipem that crippled more than 300 computers was likely caused by a variant of a notorious destructive virus known as Shamoon, the company and two cybersecurity firms said. Saipem’s head of digital and innovation, Mauro Piasere, told Reuters on Wednesday that the firm suspects that a Shamoon variant caused between 300 to 400 computers to stop working in an attack that was disclosed by the company on Monday and primarily affected its servers in the Middle East. Piasere said the company does not know who was behind the attack. Use of a Shamoon variant would be significant because related viruses have been used in some of the most damaging attacks in history, beginning in 2012 when it crippled tens of thousands of computers at Middle Eastern energy firms Saudi Aramco and RasGas Co Ltd. Shamoon resurfaced again in late 2016 in a series of attacks in the Middle East that continued through early 2017, and then went dormant. “It went dark for a long time and it seems to be back,” said Symantec senior researcher Eric Chien. “The question is whether any others were affected by it.” Security researchers widely believe that people working on behalf of the Iranian government were behind the previous Shamoon attacks, something that Tehran strongly denies. Anti-U.S. imagery was found in the code, researchers have said. CrowdStrike Vice President of Intelligence Adam Meyers said early technical analysis of the Saipem hack showed similarities with Shamoon and that it was likely Iran was also responsible, though the specific motive was not immediately apparent. Officials in Iran could not be reached for comment. Shamoon disables computers by overwriting a crucial file known as the master boot record, making it impossible for devices to start up. Former U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta has said the 2012 Shamoon hack on Saudi Aramco was probably the most destructive cyber attack to date on a private business. Saudi Aramco is the biggest client of Saipem, one of the world’s largest subsea engineering and construction firms, which is controlled by Italian state lender CDP and oil firm Eni . The Saipem attack knocked out more than 300 servers and dozens of personal computers in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, India and Scotland, Piasere said. No data will be lost because the company had backed up the computers that were affected, he said. Servers are slowly being brought back on line, though the company is proceeding carefully to prevent further infections, he added.

2018-12-12,"FRANKFURT, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Germany’s cabinet backed plans on Wednesday to increase compensation paid to land owners affected by the construction of new electricity grids needed to carry green power produced in the remote north to industrial areas in the south. The law, expected to be approved by both houses of parliament in late April, aims to speed up construction work by adding 108 million euros to the 711 million euros ($807.77 million) agreed. “This is an important milestone for improving the chances of success for the energy transition and network expansion,” said Economy Minister Peter Altmaier. The construction of new networks mainly carrying power from north to south, is years behind schedule because of Germany’s federal structure and citizens’ opposition to new infrastructure on their doorsteps. Altmaier has campaigned hard to persuade citizens the grids are necessary to ensure the large-scale deployment of wind and solar power meets with the equivalent transport set-up. Without new and stronger cables power produced by wind is often wasted because it cannot yet be stored. Networks that have served local purposes need revamping and new point-to-point cables over long distances must be laid. An increase in German offshore wind power is turning supply routes upside down as will a rise in electric mobility. Previously, power was generated near industry in large plants for example nuclear reactors. Power produced from North Sea wind farms that is needed in Bavaria requires thousands of kilometres of new cross-country power lines, while localised feed-in and increased use from electric vehicles will also change power flows. Germany aims to produce 65 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2030 - up from just over a third currently - cutting out carbon emissions from fossil fuels burning. The advancement of high-voltage transmission of power and the digitisation of lower voltage local grids will be financed via fees that are shared by consumers.

2018-12-12,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Governments attending climate talks in Poland are working to ensure economies and jobs are preserved in the shift away from coal-fired power generation, Canada’s environment minister said. The debate about coal use has threatened to overshadow discussions on developing renewable and low-carbon energy at U.N. climate talks in Katowice, a city that lies in the heart of Poland’s Silesia coal mining region. Delegates from nations that rely heavily on coal power have called for a “just transition” from fossil fuels to ensure the shift to cleaner energy does not hurt jobs and economies. “The issue of a ‘just transition’ - how you support jobs - is top of the minds of governments,” Catherine McKenna, Canada’s minister for environment and climate change, told Reuters. “Coal, practically, isn’t coming back but it is important we all look at opportunities and recognize we need to talk about workers and communities. That’s a big issue here in Poland but it is also an issue in Germany,” she said. A U.N. report said in October that renewable energy would need to supply the bulk of world electricity by 2050 to keep global warming within a 1.5 degrees limit. Coal would have to fall to under 2 percent from almost 30 percent now. Two weeks of talks in Poland among about 190 countries end this week. Last year, Canada and Britain launched the Powering Past Coal Alliance, a coalition of 28 countries, as well as cities, provinces, states and businesses. It aims to encourage developed nations to phase out coal-fired power by 2030. But several countries have been promoting fossil fuel use at talks in Poland, jarring with environmental campaigners and nations pushing for alternative power sources. Polish President Andrzej Duda said last week that Poland’s coal industry had a long future and vowed not to let anyone “murder coal mining”. The country relies on coal for around 80 percent of its power and more than 82,000 mining jobs. While calling for coal to be phased out, Canada has been criticized as one of the world’s top oil and gas producers. McKenna said Canada was addressing such concerns. “We are in a transition and transitions are not going to happen from one day to the next. People are still driving cars and even in a 1.5C scenario we are still going to be using oil and gas but moving as quickly as we all can towards cleaner sources,” she said. She said Canada was investing in renewables and cited efforts in the Canadian province of Alberta, which relies heavily on oil and gas but has introduced a carbon tax and aims to impose a limit on emissions from oil sands.

2018-12-12,"(Adds Odfjell Drilling comment) OSLO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Norway’s Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) has told Transocean , Maersk Drilling and Odfjell Drilling to beef up emergency evacuation equipment and procedures on 22 offshore oil rigs, it said on Wednesday. Drilling rigs are equipped with enclosed lifeboats that can be dropped into the ocean in an emergency and owners must meet a series of technical and operational requirements for how to plan and carry out evacuations. “All the audits identified a non-conformity from the regulations. This was the same for Maersk, Transocean and Odfjell,” PSA said, adding the firms had been asked to explain how they would fix the shortcomings. “The PSA has now received a response from (each) company, but this does not describe how the breach of the regulations is to be corrected,” it said in a statement. The audits comprised nine rigs each at Maersk and Transocean and four at Odfjell. Maersk Drilling, a subsidiary of the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group, said it needed more consultations with the PSA before deciding on the measures, which might require additional investments. “We are going to continue the dialogue to understand their reasoning… and to clarify what solutions have to be implemented,” Jakob Korsgaard, head of Maersk Drilling operations in Norway, told Reuters. “Depending on the outcome, it might require modifications or upgrades of our rigs, but it’s too early to say,” he added. Odfjell Drilling said they disagreed with the PSA’s conclusion. “Our opinion has been that we operate in accordance with current regulations,” Eirik Knudsen, the company’s vice president for corporate finance and investor relations, said in an email to Reuters. “We are now working to understand PSA’s basis for notification of order,” he added. To operate on the Norwegian continental shelf, each drilling rig must have so-called Acknowledgement of Compliance (AoC), which is awarded by the PSA. While the regulator could ultimately revoke an AoC if technical conditions and safety management systems don’t meet requirements, it was premature to discuss such measures, a PSA spokesman said. Transocean did not immediately respond to Reuters requests by phone and email for comment. The PSA gave the companies a March 31 deadline to fix the shortcomings.

2018-12-12,"(Adds details, oil prices, quotes) Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil stockpiles last week fell less than expected, while gasoline inventories increased and distillates stocks fell, the Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.2 million barrels in the week to Dec. 7, compared with analysts’ expectations for a decrease of 3 million barrels. The crude drawdown was also short of an over 10 million-barrel decline reported late Tuesday by industry group The American Petroleum Institute. “The market is disappointed that the EIA did not confirm the 10 million-barrel crude oil inventory draw we saw in the API statistics yesterday and as a result the crude oil price has come off,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. After the EIA data release, U.S. crude futures fell from earlier highs and were up 24 cents to $51.89 a barrel as of 10:49 a.m. EST (1549 GMT). Brent were 59 cents higher at $60.78 a barrel. Gasoline stocks rose by 2.1 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.5 million-barrel gain. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell by 1.5 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.8 million-barrel increase, the EIA data showed. “Overall, demand is still strong in the U.S., which should be supportive. The crude oil build and the gasoline build was one of the negative factors, but looking at the overall report, there’s nothing really bearish in here,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.

In the week to Nov. 30, the United States became a net exporter of oil for the first time in decades, shipping out a net 211,000 bpd when looking at combined totals for crude and fuel. That reversed this week, as the U.S. imported a net 1.3 million bpd of crude and fuel, largely due to a rebound in U.S. imports. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose by 1.1 million barrels, EIA said. U.S. crude production dipped 100,000 bpd to 11.6 million bpd lat week, the EIA said.

2018-12-12,"HOUSTON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - An “ineffective” safeguard failed to prevent an explosive mixing of air and fuel at a Husky Energy refinery in Superior, Wisconsin, leading to a blast and fire in the plant’s gasoline-producing unit in April, a U.S. industrial safety group said on Wednesday. Air seeped through a hole in a valve within a fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU), the U.S. Chemical Safety Board (CSB) said, causing an April 26 explosion that led to a massive fire and a 24-hour-long evacuation of residents living within miles of the plant. The board said 36 people sought medical treatment after the blast, including 11 working at the refinery. The plant was undergoing maintenance at the time. Husky, according to the CSB, had only considered a failure of the valve when locked open, not a failure when it was closed, according to an updated report the board presented of its months-long investigation at a meeting Wednesday in Superior. The failures leading to the Superior refinery explosion were similar to those that caused a 2015 explosion in an FCCU at a Torrance, California, refinery then owned by Exxon Mobil Corp . Exxon sold the refinery to PBF Energy in 2016. “Prior to both incidents, the process hazard analyses identified scenarios in which hydrocarbons flowed into the air side of the FCCU and vice versa due to a failure of the spent catalyst slide valve (SCSV), but the safeguards listed to protect against those scenarios were ineffective,” the board said. The CSB, created by the U.S. Clean Air Act, has no regulatory or enforcement authority but is charged with determining the causes of chemical plant explosions and fires and making recommendations to government and industry. “Given the similarities between these two incidents, the CSB will be examining areas of further improvement that need to be taken by industry,” the board said. FCCUs use a fine, silica catalyst in high heat to make gasoline from gas oil and the passage of the sand-like catalyst over the slide valve at the Superior refinery wore a hole in it. A mixture of air and hydrocarbon within the unit can easily find an ignition source in the 1,300 degree Fahrenheit (715 Celsius) operating temperature of the FCCU. The Husky refinery was shut after the April explosion. Husky expects to restart production at the plant in 2020. Most CSB investigations take up to a year to complete.

2018-12-12,"(Reuters) - ABB (ABBN.S) is in talks with Japan’s Hitachi (6501.T) about the  Swiss engineering group’s (ABBN.S) power grid business, which it may sell to focus on more profitable divisions. ABB has been in talks with Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric Corp (6503.T) and State Grid of China [STGRD.UL] to sell all or part of the business, which makes power transformers and electricity substations, Reuters reported in November. “ABB confirms that it is currently in discussions with Hitachi to expand and re-define the existing strategic power grid partnership between the two companies announced in December 2014,” the Swiss company said in a statement. Hitachi said in a statement it was discussing the power business with ABB but nothing had been decided. ABB, which also makes industrial robots, wants to offload its least profitable division, allowing it to focus on areas such as automation, while Hitachi is keen to expand abroad. “There can be no certainty that any transaction will occur, or as to the timing, structure or terms of any transaction,” ABB said. Its shares rose as much as 4.3 percent and were up 4 percent at 1515 GMT. One source familiar with the situation valued the power grid business - in which sources have said ABB could keep a stake via a joint venture - at between $10 billion (7.97 billion pounds) and $12 billion.  Japan’s Nikkei newspaper reported the companies were nearing a deal in which Hitachi would pay between 600 billion and 800 billion yen ($5.29-7.05 billion) for an initial 50 percent stake in the business. One source said the main sticking points were valuation and the shares that ABB and Hitachi would take in a joint venture.  ABB expected Hitachi to take a clear majority, while Hitachi would prefer a more balanced structure, this source said, adding a deal could still emerge by the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday. Hitachi's board confirmed a plan to go ahead with the deal, which would be the Japanese industrial conglomerate's largest-ever acquisition, the Nikkei reported here ABB’s power grid business employs 36,000 people and had sales of $10.4 billion last year. It had an operating profit margin of 10.0 percent in the third quarter, down 60 basis points from a year earlier. The decision to sell it marks a U-turn for ABB Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer, who decided to keep the business two years ago despite calls from some shareholders to sell. Power Grids’ weak performance has weighed on ABB’s stock price, although the unit has fared better in the last two years. ABB could return the sale proceeds to shareholders through a new share buyback programme and also accelerate acquisitions in automation.

Addition of LNG ships are part of Carnival’s ongoing fleet enhancement strategy and 20 new vessels are scheduled for delivery between 2018 and 2025. The shipping industry have been forced to look for cleaner options such as LNG after the International Maritime Organization introduced tough new rules on use of marine fuel. Strategically important ports such as Gibraltar are already preparing to offer upgraded facilities to meet the fuel demand for LNG-powered vessels.

2018-12-12,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - Failure by countries to agree rules on implementing the 2015 Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing global warming would be suicidal, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday. Guterres told delegates from over 130 countries meeting in the Polish city of Katowice that they had less than three days to find the political will to reach difficult compromises, sacrifices and common ground needed for a deal. “Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy,” he said. “To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal.” Three years to the day after the Paris climate accord was adopted by over 190 countries, delegates in the Polish coal-mining city are still grappling with how the accord will be implemented. This slow progress after more than a week of negotiations prompted Michal Kurtyka, the Polish president of the talks, to tell delegates time was precious and they needed to find wordings which were acceptable to all. Environmental activists and some developing countries have also raised concern that the rule book could fall short of pushing countries towards curbing their emissions to meet the Paris targets. “The clock is ticking. While we spend time debating texts and demanding their implementation, the planet outside is deteriorating. Species are becoming extinct. Habitats disappearing. Emissions piling up,” Brazilian Environment Minister Edson Duarte said. Guterres said a recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change acknowledged what global warming beyond 1.5 degrees will mean for billions of people, especially those who live in small island states.  The report outlined a catastrophic future if no action was taken by countries immediately, he said, adding that the window of opportunity was closing. The Paris Agreement aims to restrict warming to “well below” two degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. “This may sound like a dramatic appeal, but it is exactly this: a dramatic appeal,” Guterres said.

2018-12-12,"* Trump says trade talks underway with China, could act on Huawei * Asia, Europe stocks push higher, Wall Street futures up * Pound rises off 20-mth low as British PM faces party challenge * U.S. CPI in line with expectations * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Stock markets rallied on Wednesday as U.S. President Donald Trump sounded upbeat about doing a trade deal with China, while sterling jumped off 20-month lows as Prime Minister Theresa May vowed to fight a challenge to her leadership. Reports that Italy’s government had bowed to pressure to scale back its spending plans put a spring in the euro’s step and Wall Street was expected to open strongly due to the trade signals. In an interview with Reuters, Trump said talks were taking place with Beijing by phone and he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he knew whether the two sides would reach a deal. Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies if it served national security interests or helped to close a trade deal. A Canadian court granted bail on Tuesday to Huawei’s chief financial officer in a move that could help placate Chinese officials angered by her arrest. The news was enough to prompt a global bounce in sentiment and MSCI’s broadest index of world stocks advanced nearly 0.7 percent. Japan’s Nikkei had led Asia with a jump of 2 percent, and while Shanghai trailed with just 0.2 percent, Europe then rose 1.3 percent and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.9 percent. “We are seeing risk sentiment stabilising a bit,” said Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan. “Firstly we had news that China was considering reducing tariffs on U.S. cars, then the Huawei CFO was released on bail and then Trump said he could intervene in the case if it helped secure a trade deal.” The euro rose 0.4 percent on the day to $1.1365 after the news. Having been repeatedly disappointed before, analysts were still careful not to get too optimistic. ING said the Huawei case had made it increasingly obvious that the trade war was about technology as much as anything else, and there were also reports that the United States would release new evidence this week on Chinese hacking and economic espionage. Markets had also been jolted when Trump threatened to shut down the government over funding for a wall he has promised to build on the U.S. border with Mexico. The pound had fallen to 20-month lows overnight as lawmakers in May’s Conservative party gathered enough support to trigger a no-confidence vote in her leadership. But it bounced back 0.8 percent as a number of heavyweight colleagues backed May and traders started wagering that she would survive, isolating opponents who want a clean, sudden break from the EU. Nevertheless, uncertainty over what will be a secret ballot on Wednesday evening capped gains, keeping the pound around $1.26, having shed 1.9 percent in the previous two sessions to a trough of $1.2483. The dollar stayed at 97.411 on a basket of currencies while the euro climbed to $1.1353 on reports that Italy would scale down its budget deficit target to 2 percent. That would be well below the previous target of 2.4 percent and likely to ease tensions the spending plans had created with the European Commission. Italian government bonds also rallied, with two-year yields down 18 basis points on the day at 0.49 percent. . Investors were also digesting U.S consumer price data that showed unchanged headline inflation, reinforcing speculation of fewer rate increases by the Federal Reserve. While markets still expect the Fed to tighten at its policy meeting next week, Trump said the central bank would be “foolish” to do so. Wagers on a more restrained Fed helped gold stay near a five-month peak around $1,244 an ounce. Oil bounced after industry data showed a surprisingly large draw on stockpiles and amid talk that a recent OPEC-led supply cut could support prices in 2019. Brent futures added another 85 cents to $61.06, while U.S. crude rose a full dollar to $52.66 a barrel. Oil has also been supported this week by a drop in supply from Libya, which declared force majeure on exports from its largest field on Sunday after tribesmen and state security guards seized the facility.

2018-12-12,"SAO PAULO, Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Brazilian government approved consultations at the World Trade Organization regarding subsidies it says India gives to cane producers and sugar exporters, Brazil’s trade ministry said. Brazil said it has decided to start a formal action at the WTO after failing to receive enough information from India following letters it sent to the Indian government seeking clarifications on sugar policies. “The suspicion is that Indian domestic support (to farmers) and its subsidies to sugar exports caused significant impacts in the sugar market in a context of falling prices and decreasing production in the main centers Brazil, China and Thailand,” the Brazilian trade ministry said in a written statement late Tuesday. India is expected to surpass Brazil as the world’s largest sugar producer in the current global sugar crop, with output around 33 million tonnes while Brazil’s production is expected to fall almost 10 million tonnes to below 30 million tonnes. Brazil said India’s government policy to guarantee a minimum price for cane to farmers has caused production to surge. It says this policy, combined with subsidies to sugar transportation, is allowing the country to ship excess sugar production abroad. Sugar prices in New York reached a 10-year low in September. Prices have recovered a bit since then, but are still barely covering production costs for most companies. As a result, Brazilian mills sharply reduced their sugar production in the current season, diverting cane to ethanol instead and leaving sugar equipment idle.

2018-12-12,"(Recasts, adds construction timeline) DAR ES SALAAM, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Tanzania will build a $3 billion hydroelectric plant in a UNESCO world heritage site under a contract announced on Wednesday involving Egyptian companies despite concerns raised about the impact on wildlife. Tanzanian President John Magufuli, nicknamed “the bulldozer” for his forceful leadership style, has pushed for the project to start despite concerns raised about the impact on the Selous Game Reserve. Known for its elephants, black rhinos and giraffes, the reserve covers 50,000 square km and is one of the largest protected areas in Africa, according to UNESCO. The planned hydropower dam “puts protected areas of global importance, as well as the livelihoods of over 200,000 people who depend upon the environment, at risk,” the World Wildlife Fund conservation group said in a report in July 2017. Officials at the WWF Tanzania office were not immediately available to comment on Wednesday. Tanzania announced it had signed deals with Egypt’s El Sewedy Electric Co and Arab Contractors to build the hydroelectric plant, a project that will more than double Tanzania’s power generation capacity. Energy Minister Medard Kalemani told state television the plant will have an installed capacity of 2,115 megawatts, calling it “a very huge dam project”. Representatives of state-run Tanzania Electric Supply Co, El Sewedy and Arab Contractors signed the agreement in the presence of President Magufuli and Egyptian Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly, TV broadcasts showed. “When we asked for financing for this project, the lenders refused to give us money but thanks to improved tax collection, we are able to finance this project using our own resources,” Magufuli said. Monthly tax revenue has increased to an average of 1.3 trillion shillings ($566 million) per month under his administration from 850 billion before he came to power in late 2015, Magufuli said. He rejected the environmental concerns, saying Tanzania had allocated 32.5 percent of its land mass to conservation. “The dam will become a major source of water and the cheap electricity to be produced from the dam will reduce the number of people who cut trees for firewood,” he said. Arab Contractors will hold a 55 percent stake in the project and El Sewedy 45 percent, El Sewedy said. It expects the project to take 42 months and production to start by April 2022. Magufuli has introduced anti-corruption measures and tough economic reforms and pushed for swift completion of big infrastructure projects including roads, railways and airports. $1 = 2,295 Tanzanian shillings

2018-12-12,"Dec 12 (Reuters) - Oil producer cartel OPEC and its partners will need to keep production lower than their agreed target through 2019 for benchmark Brent crude to come back to $70 a barrel, oil and gas consultancy Rystad Energy said. Last week, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its Russia-led allies agreed to slash oil production by a bigger-than-expected 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd). The producer group needs to stay 700,000 bpd below its agreed target of 31.8 million bpd through 2019 in order to bring a recovery in benchmark Brent crude prices to the $70 per barrel level, Rystad analyst Bjornar Tonhaugen said in a note. “The agreed production cuts will not be enough to ensure sustained and immediate recovery in oil prices,” Tonhaugen said. Crude prices have see-sawed of late on worries of a global economic slowdown on one hand, and a boost from production cuts on the other.

2018-12-12,"* Demand for OPEC crude in 2019 trimmed by 100,000 bpd * Developed economies’ oil stocks back above five-year average * Saudi Arabia pumps at record rate in November (Adds further details) By Alex Lawler LONDON, Dec 12 (Reuters) - OPEC said on Wednesday it had offset a drop in sanctions-hit Iranian oil exports and lowered the 2019 forecast of demand for its crude, underlining the challenge the producer group faces to prevent a glut even after last week’s decision to trim output. In a monthly report, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said 2019 demand for its crude would fall to 31.44 million barrels per day, 100,000 bpd less than predicted last month and 1.53 million less than it currently produces. Worried by a drop in oil prices and rising supplies, OPEC and its allies including Russia last week agreed to return to supply cuts next year. They pledged to lower output by 1.2 million bpd, of which OPEC’s share is 800,000 bpd. OPEC expects global oil demand to slow next year and sees little support from the economic backdrop. “Rising trade tensions, monetary tightening and geopolitical challenges are among the issues that skew economic risks even further to the downside in 2019,” OPEC said in the report. “The upside appears limited.” The supply cut was a policy U-turn after the producer alliance known as OPEC+ had agreed in June to boost supply amid pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to lower prices and cover an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. OPEC changed course after prices dropped steeply from a four-year high above $86 a barrel in October on concern that demand was weakening amid adequate supply. Crude rose on Wednesday to trade above $61 a barrel. In another sign of excess supply, OPEC’s report on Wednesday said oil inventories in developed economies had risen back above the five-year average in October. Supply cuts that began in 2017 by OPEC and its allies had previously erased an inventory overhang that weighed on prices. In the report, OPEC said its oil output fell by only 11,000 bpd month-on-month to 32.97 million bpd in November, despite the reimposition of sanctions on Iran. Iranian output posted the biggest decline, of 380,000 bpd. This was offset by increases of 377,000 bpd from top exporter Saudi Arabia and an extra 71,000 bpd from the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped at a record rate of 11.093 million bpd. The figures suggest there will still be a surplus in the market next year should OPEC fully deliver the 800,000-bpd cut and other things remain equal, although this could be eroded by a further decline in Iran or unplanned outages in other nations. Qatar plans to leave OPEC in 2019 but, for now, remains in the OPEC group in the forecasts.

2018-12-12,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Talks billed as the most important U.N. conference since the Paris 2015 deal on climate change are in their crucial final week in Katowice, the capital of Poland’s Silesian coal mining district. The aim is to meet an end-of-year deadline for agreeing a rule book on how to enforce action to limit further warming of the planet. Below is a look at the mood around the event, held in a sprawl of temporary passageways and meeting rooms next to the Spodek, a flying-saucer-shaped sports and concert venue built on the site of the former Katowice coal mine. Subscribers to Eikon can find a Take-A-Look summary of Reuters coverage here: Negotiating teams have been asked to produce a more concise draft text on the rules for implementing the Paris Agreement this morning, but work continues. Last night, Michal Kurtyka, the Polish president of the talks, said time was precious and delegates needed to find language which was acceptable to all. “So I urge you - look at the big picture and avoid micro issues. Do not add text, subtract text. Don’t add brackets, subtract (words like) ‘the’,” he said. Grappling over the language used in texts usually occurs at such talks, but time is running out to get a draft in a more concise format for ministers to work with in their high-level negotiations. “We are concerned that the environmental integrity of the Paris rule book has been weakened gradually... We want to make it very clear that a Swiss cheese rule book is unacceptable,” said Greenpeace’s Li Shuo. THREE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY Today marks the three-year anniversary of the adoption of the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement. Around 190 countries overcame political differences to agree to limit global warming to “well below 2 degrees” Celsius and as close to 1.5C as possible to prevent dangerous effects of climate change such as extreme weather and rising sea levels. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres returned to Katowice on Wednesday for the high-level talks and is expected to try to fill a leadership void and urge countries to strengthen their national targets by 2020. “Failing here in Katowice would send a disastrous message to those who stand ready to shift to a green economy ... so I urge you to find common ground that will allow us to show the world that we are listening, that we care,” Guterres told delegates at the conference. “To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change. It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal,” he said. Conference participants, including many ministers, are starting to bet on when this conference will end. None is optimistic an agreement will be reached by Friday evening, when the conference is formally scheduled to close. Most COPs have continued overnight and into the weekend in previous years. Last year’s COP in Bonn, Germany, reached an agreement early on Sunday morning. Many delegates have told Reuters they are hopeful of an outcome by Saturday or early Sunday so they can go home to be with their families in the run-up to Christmas. At the back of many participants’ minds is that there are only two weekends left until Christmas. Shopping at the malls near the conference venue is a popular activity in the evening - if the conference-goers manage to get there before they close around 2000 GMT.

2018-12-12,"(Repeats Tuesday story with no changes to text) By Stefanie  Eschenbacher MEXICO CITY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s declaration of war on “neo-liberal” economics has shaken investors holding Petroleos Mexicanos bonds, fueling concern about the future of the highly-indebted state oil company he has pledged to revive. Ratings agencies and three managers spoken to by Reuters at funds that either hold Pemex paper or recently sold it said proposals floated by the government to build a new refinery and give the state a bigger role in the oil industry could put fresh strain on the company, which must pay back almost a third of its debt in the next three years. Fitch and Moody’s have in recent weeks flagged concerns about Pemex’s $106 billion of financial debt - the highest of any state oil company in Latin America. Under threat, said Shamaila Khan, director of emerging market debt at AllianceBernstein, which manages $550 billion in assets and invests in Pemex, is the company’s investment grade rating. “They are moving in that direction,” Khan said, citing the plans to build a new refinery and to make Pemex do more exploration as risks. If the rating goes, investors, including many pension and sovereign wealth funds whose mandates stipulate they must hold assets of investment grade quality, may have to dump Pemex debt, making it harder for the firm to raise capital. Pemex did not respond to request for comment for this story. The finance ministry declined to comment. The company, which also has $70 billion in pension obligations, said in its last quarterly report to end-September that its negative cashflow could affect its ability to operate and pay off debts. It acknowledged a downgrade was a possibility and said external auditors raised doubts about the ability of the company to continue as a business, citing recurrent net losses, negative working capital and negative equity. Energy Minister Rocio Nahle said Pemex had been driven into the ground by the policies of previous governments, and that it would be saved by a new administration focused on increasing output. “How do we think we will pay the debt? By increasing production,” she said in an interview with Aristegui Noticias on Tuesday, saying predecessors had sold assets but kept on increasing Pemex borrowing. Lopez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, is already entangled in a dispute with bondholders behind a new $13 billion Mexico City airport that the leftist said he would cancel on the grounds it was tainted by corruption. The move sent tremors through Mexican financial markets, hitting the peso and prompting warnings by ratings agency Fitch about Pemex. “I sold my last holdings in Pemex a couple of weeks ago due to the whole populistic approach he had to the airport,” said Dorthe Nielsen, an emerging market debt manager in Zurich at GAM, which manages assets worth 146 billion Swiss francs. Created in 1938 with the expropriation of foreign oil assets, Pemex became a symbol of Mexican ingenuity at the outset of a golden age of economic growth and stability that lasted into the 1970s. Corruption, mismanagement and declining output have all since taken a heavy toll on the company. Lopez Obrador, who harked back to the era known as the “Mexican Miracle” in his inaugural speech, has threatened to undo what he calls a neo-liberal 2013-14 energy overhaul that opened the oil and gas industry to private capital. Pitched by the last government as a fix for falling production, the reform also made it easier for Pemex to team up with other firms. However, output is still declining. On Sunday, Lopez Obrador announced tenders in March for the new refinery in the southern state of Tabasco. He also plans to upgrade existing refineries and expand drilling commissioned by Pemex. He did not give details of how the projects would be financed, but said government spending on Pemex would increase by $3.7 billion in the 2019 national budget, due to be presented on Dec. 15. Deputy finance minister Arturo Herrera has said Pemex would have to reassign funds if it were to pay for the new refinery. Nielsen at GAM said if Pemex did not start selling assets, balance sheet pressure would intensify. A loss of investment grade, she added, would be “a disaster.” Fitch and Standard & Poor’s rate Pemex’s foreign currency debt BBB+, while Moody’s puts it at Baa3, one notch above junk. Nymia Almeida, senior vice president for corporate ratings at Moody’s in Mexico, said support from the Mexican government was helping the “already very low rating” by six notches. “The rating would not be that great, if it weren’t for the consideration of the implicit support from the government,” she said, adding that the company owed $7-$8 billion in 2020, and another $10 billion in 2021. “On top of this, they are going to spend more money with the new investments.” The yield on Pemex’s September 2047 dollar-denominated issue has spiked more than 100 basis points since just before the July 1 election to bid at around 8.23 percent. While falling oil prices have contributed, investors say Lopez Obrador’s policies have aggravated the sell-off. Audra Stundziaite, a senior credit analyst at Hermes Investment Management, said Pemex was facing many of the same challenges as Brazil’s state-run Petroleo Brasileiro did three years ago when it lost investment grade. Nielsen said: “Unless Lopez Obrador comes up with something much more business-friendly that’s allowing the company to do joint ventures or bring in partners, there’s no bright future.” (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; additional reporting by Marianna Parraga, Ana Isabel Martinez and Michael O’Boyle Editing by Dave Graham and Rosalba O’Brien)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mexico-pemex/rpt-mexico-presidents-pemex-plans-rattle-faith-of-debt-holders-idUKL1N1YG21O,12 Dec 2018,"Mexican President Andres

2018-12-12,"(Adds details, quote) By Tom Miles GENEVA, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Global airlines will see rising profit growth and record carbon dioxide emissions next year as strong demand offsets cost pressures that trimmed profitability in 2018, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Wednesday. Industry profits are expected to rise to $35.5 billion in 2019 from $32.3 billion in 2018, IATA said. “The aviation industry is on a more solid financial footing than at any time in its history,” IATA director general and CEO Alexandre de Juniac told reporters at IATA’s annual media day in Geneva. IATA chief economist Brian Pearce said IATA did not expect a recession ahead but there was a lot to worry about, with trade protectionism and uncertainty around Brexit, although even the most chaotic outcome of Britain’s exit from the European Union was expected merely to slow, not stop, long-term growth. “The tariff wars are a worry for us. It’s actually though really just the latter stages of a decade of protectionism, actually since the global financial crisis we’ve seen cross border trade growing at a much slower pace than we saw in the years of globalisation,” Pearce said. “We’ve seen a lot of governments effectively restricting cross border trade by soft protectionism. We’re now seeing it more explicitly with tariff wars. We would certainly hope that governments would see sense, that it’s a zero-sum game, that it doesn’t benefit anybody to restrict global trade.” Margins would continue to be under pressure from wage pressures and non-oil costs, although fuel prices had fallen, and airlines around the world had seen dollar-denominated costs rising, he said. Investors’ return on capital was expected to stabilise at 8.6 percent this year and next. Although that would be the lowest since 2014, it would be above the cost of capital - the returns that investors could earn by putting their money elsewhere. Governments needed to do better and support competitiveness and business-friendly policies, de Juniac said. The industry was approaching an infrastructure crisis and recovering from “a European air traffic management mess of epic proportions”. Carbon dioxide emissions, which were consistently below 700 million tonnes until 2013, will hit 895 million tonnes in 2018 and 927 million tonnes in 2018, IATA said. The U.N. says relentless rises in carbon dioxide emissions are the most important factor in causing catastrophic climate change. IATA originally forecast 2018 profits of more than $38 billion but cut that back to $33.8 billion in June.

In an interview with Reuters, Trump said talks were taking place with Beijing by phone and he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he was sure about a deal. Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal. A Canadian court on Tuesday granted bail to the executive in a move that could help placate Chinese officials angered by her arrest. The news was enough to prompt a bounce after days of struggle and MSCI’s broadest index of world stocks advanced nearly 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei had led the way in Asia with a jump of 2 percent, while Shanghai blue chips trailed with just 0.2 percent. London, Frankfurt and Paris then gained between 0.4 and 0.8 percent to push Europe higher and E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.5 percent. “We are seeing risk sentiment stabilising a bit,” said Societe Generale strategist Alvin Tan. “Firstly we had news that China was considering reducing tariffs on us car, then the Huawei CFO was released on bail and then Trump said could he intervene in the case if it helped secure a trade deal.” Having been repeatedly disappointed before, analysts were still being careful to not get too optimistic about prospects of a trade agreement. ING said the Huawei case made it increasingly obvious that the China-US trade war is about the exchange of technology, and there were also reports the United States would release evidence this week detailing Chinese hacking and economic espionage. “Even if this (auto) step is taken it just removes what was a retaliatory measure to begin with,” noted ANZ economist David Plank. “Whatever the case, market price action is somewhat of a chop-fest, right now, as it swings around on each new headline.” Markets had also been jolted when Trump threatened to shut down the government over funding for a wall he has promised to build on the southern border with Mexico. The pound had fallen to 20-month lows overnight after lawmakers in May’s Conservative party gathered enough support to trigger a no-confidence vote in her leadership. But it stabilised as some investors bet that May would win Wednesday’s vote and in the process isolate opponents in her party who want a clean, sudden break from the EU. Neverthless, uncertainty over the secret ballot capped gains, keeping the pound only just above $1.25, having shed 1.9 percent in the previous two sessions to a trough of $1.2483. The euro softened slightly 90.56 pence, but was flat on the dollar at $1.1324. The dollar was still being viewed as the best of a bad bunch and stayed at 97.411 on a basket of currencies. “The market is concerned that May could be replaced by a Brexit-supporter, increasing the chance of a no-deal scenario,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. Investors were also looking ahead to the U.S consumer price report later on Wednesday where an expected slowdown in headline inflation would only reinforce speculation of fewer rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. While market still expect the Fed will tighten at its policy meeting next week, Trump said the central bank would be “foolish” to do so. Wagers on a more restrained Fed helped gold stay near a five-month peak around $1,244.17 an ounce. Oil bounced after industry data showed a surprisingly large draw on stockpiles and amid talk a recent OPEC-led supply cut could support prices in 2019. Brent futures added another 65 cents to $60.85, while U.S. crude rose 60 cents to $52.25 a barrel.

2018-12-12,"(Corrects dateline to Halfaya oilfield from Zubair) By Aref Mohammed HALFAYA OILFIELD, Iraq, Dec 12 (Reuters) - Iraq has increased production at its southern Halfaya oilfield by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a total of 370,000 bpd, an oil official told Reuters on Wednesday. Halfaya, operated by PetroChina, is Maysan province’s largest field. Production rose after the completion of a new oil processing facility, Adnan Noshi, head of Maysan Oil Co which oversees oilfields in Maysan province, told Reuters on the sidelines of a ceremony to launch a new installation in Halfaya. Noshi said increasing production from Halfaya had raised the company’s overall output to around 510,000 bpd. The new crude facility, which has a capacity to process 200,000 bpd of crude oil, will help further boost output from Halfaya to reach 470,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2019, Noshi said. The expansion at Halfaya also includes launching a gas project to process around 300 million standard cubic feet of natural gas extracted alongside crude oil at the field. Iraq’s oil ministry is studying offers submitted by several foreign energy companies for the Halfaya gas project, including China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC) which is the frontrunner to win the deal, Noshi said. “CPECC submitted the best offer comparing to other companies,” said Noshi “We will pick up the best offer in two months and the work at the Halfaya gas project should start in April 2019,”. Iraq said last year it planned to increase its oil output capacity to 5 million bpd. The country is the second largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), after Saudi Arabia, with a total output of about 4.55 million bpd.

Neste, 44.75 percent owned by the state of Finland, has in recent years emerged as one of the leading players in the renewable diesel market thanks to its global sales and wide range of feedstock including waste and residues like animal fats. The investment will boost Neste’s renewable production capacity to 4.5 million tonnes annually by 2022 from a current 2.7 million tonnes.

In an interview with Reuters, Trump said talks were taking place with Beijing by phone and he would not raise tariffs on Chinese imports until he was sure about a deal. Trump also said he would intervene in the Justice Department’s case against a top executive at China’s Huawei Technologies if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal. A Canadian court on Tuesday granted bail to the executive in a move that could help placate Chinese officials angered by her arrest. The news was enough to prompt a bounce after days of losses, and MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 1.2 percent. Japan’s Nikkei led the way with a jump of 2 percent, while Shanghai blue chips trailed with just 0.2 percent. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 added 0.5 percent and spreadbetters pointed to gains for European bourses. Having been repeatedly disappointed before, analysts were careful to not get too optimistic about prospects of a trade agreement. “From the Huawei case, it is increasingly obvious that the China-US trade war is about the exchange of technology, and the development of advanced technologies by Chinese companies,” said analysts at ING in a note. “The truce will not address these issues. And therefore tension between China and U.S. will continue.” Sentiment had got a lift on Tuesday from reports China was considering cutting import tariffs on American-made cars to 15 percent from the current 40 percent. Yet there were also reports the U.S. would release evidence this week detailing Chinese hacking and economic espionage. “Even if this (auto) step is taken it just removes what was a retaliatory measure to begin with,” noted ANZ economist David Plank. “Whatever the case, market price action is somewhat of a chop-fest, right now, as it swings around on each new headline.” Markets had also been jolted when Trump threatened to shut down the government over funding for a wall he has promised to build on the southern border with Mexico. In currency markets, sterling was pinned near 20-month lows amid reports Conservative lawmakers could vote on a no confidence motion in May’s leadership as soon as Wednesday night. The political ructions come a day after her decision to delay a vote in parliament on her Brexit deal for fear of a loss angered many in her party. The risk kept the pound at $1.2505, having shed 1.9 percent in the previous two sessions to a trough of $1.2483. The euro held firm at 90.56 pence, but was flat on the dollar at $1.1324. The dollar was still being viewed as the best of a bad bunch and stayed at 97.411 on a basket of currencies. “The market is concerned that May could be replaced by a Brexit-supporter, increasing the chance of a no-deal scenario,” said Rodrigo Catril, a senior FX strategist at NAB. “Bottom line: there is great uncertainty about whether Theresa May can survive as PM and what the prospects are for a general election, new referendum or a hard Brexit.” Investors were also looking ahead to the U.S consumer price report later on Wednesday where an expected slowdown in headline inflation would only reinforce speculation of fewer rate hikes from the Federal Reserve.

2018-12-12,"SINGAPORE, Dec 12 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices climbed on Wednesday, supported by expectations that an OPEC-led supply cut announced last week for 2019 would stabilise markets. Disruptions to Libyan oil exports after local militia seized the country’s biggest oilfield, El Sharara, were also buoying prices, traders said. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.15 per barrel at 0023 GMT, up 1 percent from their last settlement. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Analysts said a decision by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some non-OPEC producers including Russia to cut supply by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) would likely stabilise prices, although several said they did not expect the agreement to push markets much higher. “OPEC production curbs will stabilise the market,” ANZ bank said on Wednesday. Crude prices had lost a third of their value between early October and the announcement of the cuts. Fereidun Fesharaki of energy consultancy FGE said in a note that the OPEC-led cuts would likely be “insufficient to mop up the inventories in the targeted three-month period till the end of the first quarter of 2019”. As a result, FGE said prices were “likely to hover in the $55-60 per barrel range for Brent, with WTI sitting some $5-10 per barrel below this given current fundamentals”. Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at futures brokerage Forex.com, said “additional doubts were raised after the decision to reduce output was made on Friday, when ... OPEC refused to specify which country would cut how much”. Undermining the supply cuts is soaring output in the United States, where crude production C-OUT-T-EIA has hit a record 11.7 million bpd. The United States is set to end 2018 as the world’s top oil producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia, with the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) saying on Tuesday that the nation’s annualised average output would be 10.88 million bpd over the year. The 2018 output increase would be 1.53 million bpd, the EIA said, adding that it expected production to average an unprecedented 12.06 million bpd in 2019. “U.S. oil production growth continues relentlessly and will probably continue for the foreseeable future to offset any supply-side adjustments from the OPEC+ group,” Razaqzada said.

2018-12-12,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Tuesday he planned to introduce this week a joint resolution condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which could force President Donald Trump’s hand on the issue. Republican Senator Bob Corker said he expected the measure to pass the Senate, noting that its co-sponsors include Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. If it passes the House of Representatives, it would go to the White House for Trump to sign or veto. Corker said he hoped to introduce the legislation as soon as  Tuesday, but a spokeswoman said later it would not be before Wednesday. “Hopefully, we’ll have a very, very strong vote on a resolution condemning the crown prince,” Corker said. Aides to Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether the House planned to vote on the measure if it passed the Senate. Separately, a House aide said that CIA Director Gina Haspel would hold a classified briefing on the Khashoggi case for House leaders and the heads of national security committees on Wednesday. Two Democratic senators, Ed Markey and Jeff Merkley, said they sent a letter on Tuesday asking Energy Secretary Rick Perry to brief Congress on any talks he had with Saudi Arabia on a civilian nuclear agreement on a recent trip to the kingdom.   Department of Energy officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Joint congressional resolutions must be signed by the president and have the force of law. The resolution’s content has not been released, so it was not clear whether the joint resolution would prompt any specific punishment against the crown prince or the kingdom beyond a statement of condemnation.  Corker said it was largely similar to a resolution introduced last week by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and other Republicans and Democrats that condemned Khashoggi’s death and said the Senate “has a high level of confidence” that the Saudi crown prince was complicit in his murder. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident who was a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.
