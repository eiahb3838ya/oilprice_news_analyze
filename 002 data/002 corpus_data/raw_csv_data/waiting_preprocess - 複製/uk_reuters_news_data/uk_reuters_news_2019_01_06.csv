2019-01-06,"* Asian stock markets : tmsnrt.rs/2zpUAr4 * Nikkei futures signal strong start after Wall St rally * Fed stresses patience on policy, market leans toward rate cut * Safe-haven yen eases back, dollar otherwise lower * Investors eye Sino-U.S. trade talks in Beijing By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Asian shares were set for a rousing start on Monday as a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve and startlingly strong U.S. jobs data soothed some of the market’s worst fears about the global outlook. Investors are keen to see how Chinese markets react to the central bank’s policy easing announced late on Friday, which frees up around $116 billion for new lending. Chinese officials also meet their U.S. counterparts for trade negotiations starting later Monday, the first face-to-face talks of the year. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the talks were going very well and that weakness in the Chinese economy gave Beijing a reason to work toward a deal. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.4 percent in early trade, led by a 1.1 percent jump in Australia. Nikkei futures  pointed to opening gains of around 500 points for the cash index. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 edged up another 0.14 percent. Risk appetite got a huge boost on Friday when the U.S. payrolls report showed 312,000 net new jobs were created in December, while wages rose at a brisk annual pace of 3.2 percent. Despite the strength, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell sought to ease market concerns about the risk of a slowdown, saying the central bank would be patient and flexible in policy decisions this year. Markets had already gone much further to price in a major chance of a cut in rates this year, and some of that exuberance was tempered by Powell’s emphasis on the word “patient” in his speech on Friday. Yet, Fed fund futures still implied a rate of 2.33 percent by December, compared to the current effective rate of 2.40 percent. Yields on two-year Treasuries rose to 2.49 percent, from a trough of 2.37 percent, but were still below those on one-year paper. Powell has another speech on Thursday to expand on his thinking, while there are at least eight other Fed officials scheduled to speak this week. The combination of a strong jobs report and a dovish Fed helped the Dow end Friday with gains of 3.29 percent, while the S&P 500 jumped 3.43 percent and the Nasdaq 4.26 percent. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted global equity markets had lost $19.9 trillion since January last year, and a record $84 billion had flowed out of stocks in just the past six weeks. With 2,055 of 2,767 U.S. and global companies in a bear market, it might be time to buy. “Our Bull & Bear Indicator has fallen to an ‘extreme bear’ reading, triggering the first ‘buy’ signal for risk assets since June 2016,” they wrote in a note. BofAML saw upside in Chinese and German stocks; U.S. small cap stocks; semi-government debt; energy stocks; U.S. dollar and euro high-yielding bonds and emerging market currencies. The latter had already received a boost from news Sino-U.S. trade talks were back on, as well as a natural bounce from the wild “flash crash” that rocked markets last week. The effect was apparent in the Australian dollar, which is often used as a liquid proxy for emerging markets and China risk. The Aussie was up at $0.7117 on Monday, having briefly dived as deep as $0.6715 last Thursday. The safe-haven yen gave up much of its recent gains to stand at 108.40 per dollar, having gotten as a far as 105.25 last week. The euro was firmer $1.1409, while the dollar index eased a touch to 96.114. Gold benefited from the diminished risk of U.S. rate hikes and held at $1,284.83, just off a six-month top. Oil prices started firmer after Brent bounced about 9.3 percent last week, while WTI rose 5.8 percent. The crude benchmark rose 25 cents to $57.31 a barrel, while U.S. crude futures gained 24 cents to $48.20.

2019-01-06,"(Repeats story from Jan. 4; no changes to text) By Ju-min Park and Jane Chung SEOUL, Jan 4 (Reuters) - When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un used his New Year speech to highlight coal as a “primary front” in developing the economy, he was making a case for what analysts see as a flawed but key resource on which his country increasingly relies. Coal has long been a major resource for North Korea, and Kim’s call for self sufficiency in the face of international pressure is a recurring theme. But as international sanctions have increased over the past year, coal is one of the few local resources to which Kim can turn as he tries to make good on promises to improve life in a country notorious for limited electricity, analysts and defectors say. Last year Kim declared that his nuclear arsenal was “complete” and vowed to focus on building the economy. South Korea-based analysts and North Korean defectors report that with sanctions still blocking most coal exports, the North has put more of its stockpile to use domestically. “My acquaintances in North Hamgyong province told me... they got power for 14-15 hours a day in 2018, versus 8-10 hours in 2017,” said Kim Young Hui, a defector who now works as an economist at South Korea’s state-run Korea Development Bank. A “highly noticeable” increase in electricity in 2018 compared to the year before has increased power availability for many homes and boosted the operations of factories and trains, said Kang Mi-jin, a defector who now writes about North Korea for the website Daily NK and speaks to sources inside the North. “As Kim Jong Un said in the New Year speech, North Korea will focus on the domestic economy,” she said. “Instead of finding another route to sell coal, they will continue to use it domestically.” But the aging technology is limited in how much it can contribute to the broader economy, analysts said. “Focusing on coal and electricity is a way to survive, and Kim Jong Un is trying hard to make the country a bit more self-sufficient, but (coal is) not enough to turn around the whole economy as long as exports are capped,” economist Kim Young Hui said. In the New Year speech, Kim Jong Un called for the coal industry to focus on helping power stations “normalise electricity generation without letup.” He noted that output at the country’s largest coal power plant in Pukchang had increased “remarkably” and called for more progress on a “far-reaching plan” to develop tidal, wind and atomic power. Politically and economically isolated and repressed under Kim’s authoritarian regime, North Korea has long suffered from electricity shortages. In recent years, the lack of a reliable power supply led many North Koreans to install cheap household solar panels to charge mobile phones and light their homes. During a reporting trip to Pyongyang in September, multiple North Korean sources told Reuters that more electricity could help make some of Kim’s most prized building projects usable. At some recently constructed high-rise apartment buildings, for example, potential residents fear facing dozens of flights of stairs during power outages. Electricity in North Korea is prioritised for factories or areas of political importance, but people with money or connections are often able to tap power lines illegally. A source who regularly speaks to Pyongyang residents told Reuters that pre-ordering coal for boilers was no longer necessary because it had become more abundant. “People had to book coal early, about two months before running boilers when the weather gets chilly. But thanks to reduced coal exports, it is not hard to buy it anymore after last year. Sanctions have been tougher, but North Koreans can buy coal whenever they want if they have money,” the source said. North Korea generates nearly 50 percent of its electricity from seven coal power plants and one oil-fired plant, and the rest from hydroelectric facilities. Many of its decades-old coal plants were built by the former Soviet Union and China, according to South Korean data. Since 2015 North Korea has been working to convert the oil power plant to coal, according to U.S.-based monitoring group 38 North. In the last year it has added generators to the biggest coal power complex and built a new hydro power plant. A 1994 deal for an international consortium to provide two light-water reactors to North Korea in exchange for its ending some of its weapons-related operations fell through. Since then, the country has been working on an experimental light water reactor. Coal exports to China fell to 4.83 million tonnes in 2017, from more than 20 million tonnes in 2016, according to Chinese data. China says it imported no North Korean coal from January to March 2018. North Korea’s coal production rose from 2013 to 2016, but fell 30 percent to 21.66 million tonnes in 2017 from 2016, according to South Korean government data. Reliable data on North Korea’s reserves is hard to come by, but 2015 BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy reported that North Korea has 600 million tonnes of coal as proven reserves, while South Korea says the North has 20.5 billion tonnes in reserve. North Korea is known to have 4.5 billion tonnes of anthracite, a higher quality of coal, and the rest is lignite, which is mainly suitable for power plants. The North mostly exports anthracite, according to South Korean government data. North Korea has tried unsuccessfully to circumvent sanctions by smuggling coal into China and South Korea, monitors say. “Smuggling coal into China is not easy these days as even bribes for Chinese traders have become more expensive,” said Choi Kyung-soo, head of the North Korea Resources Institute.

2019-01-06,"GUADALAJARA, Mexico (Reuters) - An offensive by Mexico’s new government against fuel theft at one of the country’s main refineries has led to days of shortages at gas stations in several central states, as authorities move more fuel by tankers and less by vulnerable pipelines. A Reuters witness said many gas stations in the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco state were closed on Sunday, including those operated by state oil firm Pemex, Spain’s Repsol and BP. There were long lines of motorists at those that were operating. “I’ve gone to 10 gas stations and nothing, there’s none at any of them,” said Alan Delgado, trying to fill his Buick truck at a BP gas station in Guadalajara. “This is a serious and critical situation because it complicates work and businesses.”   The shortages followed the closure of a pipeline from the Salamanca refinery in the central state of Guanajuato, and as Pemex started using more tankers to transport fuel. Theft by gangs and oil industry workers from Mexico’s state-controlled refineries is a major drain on government resources, but the measures taken to tackle the crime could also weigh on the economy if shortages drag on. Violent criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income, bleeding money from state coffers and driving bloodshed as they fight rivals and extort oil workers. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, confirmed on Friday that less fuel was being sent through pipelines. “I ask citizens for understanding and support, because we need to solve this problem together. We are trying to get it resolved soon,” Lopez Obrador said in a televised speech. Obrador has vowed to tackle theft “outside and inside” Pemex, or Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], which estimates that fuel worth more than 146 billion pesos ($7.40 billion) has been stolen since 2016 alone. The president said last month that Mexico’s armed forces would take part in security at Pemex installations around the country, including its refinery in Salamanca. Fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence, according to Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue. The Mexican Association of Gasoline Station business owners warned its members on Jan. 3 that no fuel was being transported via the pipeline from the Salamanca refinery. “You are free to take measures that benefit your customers, to limit the sale (of fuel) to 10 liters per car or whatever you consider necessary to serve the public,” the association said. Guanajuato governor Sinhue took to Twitter on Sunday, saying that Pemex’s chief executive Octavio Romero “confirmed that after reopening the Salamanca-Leon pipeline, he expects to reestablish service to 100 percent of the gasoline stations during the day.”  It was not immediately clear whether opening that pipeline would reduce shortages in other regions. Pemex said on Saturday that it is “preferring the use of safer means of transport, which means changes in the logistics for delivery to service stations,” leading to delays in the states of Hidalgo, Mexico, Jalisco, Michoacan, Guanajuato and Queretaro. Pemex said it is aiming to boost distribution in the affected states by up to 20 percent, transporting fuel by tanker trucks and trains. A May 2017 study commissioned by the national energy regulator found that thieves, between 2009 and 2016, had tapped pipelines roughly every 1.4 kms (0.86 miles) along Pemex’s approximately 14,000 km pipeline network. The government has not made clear if they see road and rail transport as a long term solution for fuel distribution. Transporting fuel by road and rail is 12 to 16 times more expensive than by pipeline, said Gonzalo Monroy, a Mexico City-based oil analyst. “If this keeps happening and expanding to other parts of the country, the Mexican economy is going to have a very tough first quarter,” said Monroy.

2019-01-06,"(Adds details, background) By Ayman al-Warfalli BENGHAZI, Libya, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Libya aims to more than double its oil production to 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2021 provided security and stability are strengthened in the conflict-stricken country, the chairman of state oil company NOC said on Sunday in Benghazi. Currently, Libya produces 953,000 bpd, less than its pre-civil war capacity of 1.6 million bpd, Mustafa Sanalla said at a news conference. He reiterated calls for workers’ security to be improved to allow production to resume at the 315,000 bpd El Sharara oil field, which was taken over on Dec. 8 by tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. Production is expected to be up to 11,000 bpd lower when it restarts after the seizure due to looting, NOC said last week. “What happened in Sharara discourages foreign companies,” said Sanalla, who announced a visit to China in the first quarter of this year to discuss oil investment opportunities. He also confirmed the upcoming return of BP to Libya along with Russian companies, without giving further details. Improved security conditions in the Sirte Basin in central Libya will enable the launch of production at the Farigh gas field at 24 million cubic feet per day in three months, with an eventual output goal of 270 million cubic feet per day, Sanalla said. Despite security problems, NOC expects full-year revenue to surge by 76 percent to $24.2 billion in 2018.

2019-01-06,"YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - A Nigerian militant group said on Sunday it had carried out an as yet unconfirmed warning strike on an oil facility owned by local energy firm Conoil on Friday in the southern state of Bayelsa.  Koluama Seven Brothers, a little-known militant organisation, is threatening a production shut-down as it demands action from Conoil and a traditional ruler called King Solomon Eddy on issues such as job creation.  The strike, which the group said took place at 12:20 a.m. on Jan. 4 at Conoil’s Angle 2 Field, “is just a warning”, it said in a statement.  The organisation said it had “no other option than to launch a strike to shut down Conoil” if demands were not met. Conoil could not immediately be reached by telephone or email. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps said a blast was heard on Friday around a Conoil pipeline in the Koluama community of Bayelsa, but a patrol check had not revealed any leaks.  Attacks on pipelines and other facilities in the Niger Delta reached a peak in 2016, cutting Nigeria’s crude production from as much as 2.2 million barrels per day (mbpd) to near 1 mbpd - the lowest level seen in Africa’s top oil producer in at least 30 years. That, combined with low oil prices, pushed the OPEC member into its first recession in 25 years - crude sales make up two-thirds of government revenue and most of its foreign exchange. Nigeria emerged from recession in 2017 but growth remains sluggish ahead of a Feb. 16 presidential election.

2019-01-06,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A rainy spell early on Sunday brought better air to residents of New Delhi, giving them a brief respite from thick gray smog that has shrouded the Indian capital for the last two months, although air quality continued to be “very poor”. A measure of tiny, hazardous breathable particles known as PM 2.5 reached an average of 182 by 12 p.m., the Central  Pollution Control Board said, its lowest since Nov. 4. But pollution was still five times more than a U.S. government recommended level of 35 to stand at “unhealthy” levels, according to the U.S. embassy.      “Change in weather conditions by rain or higher wind speed helps dissipate peak pollution, but we continue to need strong emergency actions such as shutting power plants,” said Anumita Roychowdhury of the Center for Science and Environment think-tank.         The federal government air quality index rated Delhi’s air quality “very poor” on Sunday and had a similar forecast for Monday, urging people with respiratory and cardiac problems to avoid polluted areas and limit outdoor movement. A sharp drop in temperatures and wind speed over the last two weeks, combined with vehicle and industrial emissions, dust from building sites and smoke from garbage burning has stoked pollution over much of north India. Levels of PM 2.5, or particles smaller than 2.5 microns in diameter, hit their highest last year at 450 on Dec. 23. Despite the pollution, there is little sign Delhi’s 20 million residents are taking steps to protect themselves. Activists say the apparent lack of concern gives politicians the cover they need for not tackling the issue adequately.
