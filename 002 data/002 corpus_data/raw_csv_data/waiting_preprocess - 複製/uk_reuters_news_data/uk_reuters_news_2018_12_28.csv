2018-12-28,"Uyo, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigeria’s ruling party held a rally to mark the launch of President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election bid on Friday in the southern city of Uyo, hours after naming a campaign team which includes Africa’s richest man.  A presidential election is scheduled to take place on Feb. 16 to determine who will lead Africa’s biggest crude oil producer and the continent’s most populous country. At the launch of the campaign, Buhari told an audience in the southern city - capital of Akwa Ibom state - that his government was winning the fight against Islamists who have stepped up attacks in the northeast aimed at creating a state adhering to a strict interpretation of Sharia law. Buhari addressed his audience in the wake of an attack by militants in the town of Baga, in eastern Borno state - the latest in a string of strikes in the last few months by militants allied with Islamic State that has turned security into a campaign issue in the run-up to the poll. “Many local governments were held by the Boko Haram insurgents when we assumed office but none, presently, is physically controlled by the group,” said Buhari.  “We are going to secure this country, we are going to manage it properly. We will continue to improve the situation, security, economy and fighting corruption,” said Buhari, a 76-year-old former military ruler who took office in 2015. Buhari, a Muslim from the predominantly Muslim north, typically has not had support from voters in the largely Christian southern states.  Earlier, Buhari’s ruling party - the All Progressives Congress (APC) - named members of the “presidential campaign council”, members of Buhari’s core re-election team.  Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man who primarily made his money through a cement business, was named as a member of Buhari’s special advisory committee. Billionaire oil magnate Femi Otedola was also named as a member of the committee.

2018-12-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global investors gravitated toward safe-haven assets on Friday as worries about the world economy persisted, cutting short a two-day rebound in Wall Street stocks. U.S. stock indexes seesawed, making it difficult to end one of the most brutal December selloffs in memory on a high note. “Markets will likely remain treacherous in the New Year,” Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex LLC, told clients. After flirting with strong gains in the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 76.42 points, or 0.33 percent, to 23,062.4, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 3.09 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,485.74 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 5.03 points, or 0.08 percent, to end at 6,584.52.  MSCI’s index of global equities .MIWD00000PUS gained 0.57 percent to bring the global benchmark to a weekly advance near 2 percent. Markets swung wildly in a week shortened by the Christmas holiday, starting with Wall Street’s worst-ever Christmas Eve drop, pushing the S&P 500 to within a whisker of bear market territory. But efforts at a late Santa Claus rally failed to salve investors after a year that brought gains for very few categories of financial assets, from stocks to bonds and commodities. The global MSCI index, the S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq are each headed for their worst years since the 2008 financial crisis. GRAPHIC - Global markets in 2018: tmsnrt.rs/2R8CUd7 The dollar index .DXY dipped 0.14 percent, with the euro EUR= up 0.14 percent to $1.1445 and Japanese yen JPY= strengthening 0.75 percent against the greenback at 110.17 per dollar. The greenback is down 1 percent this month against a basket of major currencies.  That has boosted gold, a traditional safe haven whose appeal this year was hit by a stronger dollar, which makes the yellow metal more expensive to buyers with other currencies. Gold XAU= is perched at six-month highs of $1,280.11 an ounce.  The steady drumbeat of disappointing economic data reinforced caution, including Japan’s slowing industrial output and retail sales, declining German inflation and U.S. data for November showing contracts to buy previously owned homes fell unexpectedly in the latest sign of housing market weakness. Breaking with the bad news, the Chicago Purchasing Management Index came in ahead of consensus. Chris Bailey, a strategist at brokerage Raymond James Financial Inc, said dollar weakness was good news for non-U.S. assets. “If we get the transmission mechanism of a lower dollar, stocks outside the U.S. are set up for a good 2019,” Bailey said. “Once people get their heads around the fact the U.S. is not going to have yet another double-digit return year in 2019, you can look elsewhere.” That would be a relief to world markets that largely underperformed the United States in 2018. Bonds have also been helped in recent weeks by risk aversion.

2018-12-28,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday said limits on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants were unnecessary as they were too costly, sparking an outcry from environmentalists who feared the next step would be looser rules favouring the coal industry at the expense of public health. Under the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS, enacted under former President Barack Obama, coal-burning power plants were required to install expensive equipment to cut output of mercury, which can harm pregnant women and put infants and children at risk of developmental problems. The Environmental Protection Agency left the 2011 emission standards in place but proposed using a different cost analysis to evaluate whether the regulation is needed, a move that paves the way for looser rules going forward. Its statement was issued on Friday during a partial government shutdown. Since August, the Environmental Protection Agency has been reconsidering the justification for the rule. A coalition of electric utilities had said the looser rules were not needed since they have already invested billions of dollars in technology to cut emissions of the pollutant and comply. EPA said it was “proposing that it is not ‘appropriate and necessary’ to regulate HAP (Hazardous Air Pollution) emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants... because the costs of such regulation grossly outweigh the quantified HAP benefits.” It said its reassessment showed the cost of compliance with MATS was between $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion annually, while the monetized benefits were between $4 million to $6 million.  It also said the identification of unquantified benefits was not enough to support the standards. Among such benefits, environmentalists say are reduced healthcare costs, breathing cleaner air and drinking cleaner water. “The policy (Acting EPA Administrator) Andrew Wheeler and (President) Donald Trump proposed today means more pregnant women, young children, and the elderly will be exposed to deadly neurotoxins and poisons, just so wealthy coal and oil barons can make a few extra bucks,” Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Mary Anne Hitt said in a statement. Wheeler is a former coal industry lobbyist. “Virtually every coal plant in the U.S. has already met this lifesaving standard, and now Trump is recklessly trying to roll it back,” she said. A study published this month by Harvard University’s School of Public Health said coal-fired power plants are the top source of mercury in the United States, accounting for nearly half of mercury emissions in 2015. It said the standards have markedly reduced mercury in the environment and improved public health. Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has targeted rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, including crude oil. U.S. oil production is the highest in the world, above Saudi Arabia and Russia, after a boom that was triggered more than a decade ago by improved drilling technology. The coal industry had challenged a 2016 conclusion by Obama’s EPA that the rule was justified because savings to U.S. consumers on healthcare costs would exceed compliance costs. The calculations accounted for how pollution-control equipment would reduce emissions of other harmful substances in addition to mercury. Trump’s industry allies, including Robert Murray, CEO of private coal mining giant Murray Energy Corp, had complained that the MATS rule contributed to the demise of the coal business by triggering hundreds of coal-fired power plant shutdowns and driving coal demand to its lowest in decades.  U.S. coal-fired power generation has fallen more than 40percent since a peak in 2007, while natural gas-fired  generation soared by about the same amount, according to the Energy Information Administration. Utilities’ demand for U.S. coal is projected to fall further this year, by around 2.5 percent to 648.2 million short tons, the lowest in 35 years, according to the EIA. In July, electric utilities and utility groups favouring the rule asked the administration to keep it in place. They noted that billions of dollars in investments for anti-pollution equipment have already been made, and costs are being recovered from electricity customers through regulated pricing. “This is like when your four-year-old kid tries to clean up your kitchen – it actually makes things worse. Please stop helping,” said a utility industry lobbyist based in Washington, who asked not to be named. “The rule itself forced coal plant shutdowns, but they aren’t coming back.” EPA said it will take comment for the proposal for 60 days and will hold at least one public hearing.

2018-12-28,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices steadied on Friday after a week of volatile trading ahead of the New Year holiday, supported by a rise in U.S. equity markets but pressured by worries about a global glut of crude. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 4 cents to settle at $52.20 a barrel, off the session high of $53.80 a barrel.  U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 72 cents to settle at $45.33 a barrel, after earlier reaching $46.22 a barrel. Both benchmarks posted third straight weekly declines, with Brent losing about 3 percent and WTI nearly 0.4 percent. Crude prices were pushed higher by a rally in the U.S. equities market on Friday, markets participants said. Oil prices have tracked closely with Wall Street, and both asset classes saw volatile sessions throughout the week. Oil prices fell to their lowest in a year and a half earlier this week and are down more than 20 percent for 2018, depressed in part by rising supply. U.S. crude inventories USOILC=ECI were down by 46,000 barrels in the week to Dec. 21, the Energy Information Administration said, a smaller draw than the 2.9 million barrels analysts polled by Reuters had expected. Gasoline stocks USOILG=ECI rose by 3 million barrels, trouncing analysts’ expectations for a gain of 28,000 barrels. The crude draw “failed to spur much buying interest,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. “Nonetheless, we viewed the data as price supportive with the exception of the 3 million barrel gasoline supply build.” U.S. energy firms added two oil rigs in the week to Dec. 28, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The data was seen as an indication of future production. The United States has emerged as the world’s biggest crude producer this year, pumping 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd), more than Saudi Arabia or Russia. Oil production has been at or near record highs in the three countries.  This month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia agreed to cut output by 1.2 million bpd, or more than 1 percent of global consumption, starting in January. Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that Russia would cut its crude output by between 3 million and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019 as part of the deal. Novak also told reporters the U.S. decision to allow some countries to trade Iranian oil after putting Tehran under sanctions was one of the key factors behind the OPEC deal. Imports of Iranian crude oil by major buyers in Asia hit their lowest level in more than five years in November as the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports took effect, government and ship-tracking data showed.

2018-12-28,"DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi king’s government reshuffle was expected because the cabinet must be replaced and reappointed every four years, the government said on Friday, giving a technocratic explanation to a move seen by critics as an attempt at crisis management. The assertion was issued by the government communications office after the king elevated veteran government figures to key cabinet positions on Thursday, including installing a former finance minister to head the foreign ministry. The position of national security adviser went to a Harvard-educated son of Saudi Arabia’s first intelligence chief who has also long been a fixture in the royal court. Most other ministers remained in their roles and some allies of King Salman’s son and heir, Crown Prince Mohammed, 33, were also promoted. Analysts said the moves were aimed at reversing the damage done to the image of the government by the murder of U.S.-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. A statement by the communications office cited the Saudi official as saying the reshuffle reflected routine technocratic considerations and came at the end of the cabinet’s four-year term, as required by law. “The reshuffle is designed to ensure that the Cabinet has the best combination of the experience and know-how to meet the needs of the Kingdom over the coming four years and strengthen our relations with friendly countries around the world,” the official was cited as saying in the statement.

2018-12-28,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s energy secretary resigned on Friday, the government said in a statement, less than 24 hours after news leaked that the administration of President Mauricio Macri plans to increase electricity prices by an average 35 percent next year. Higher power bills are sure to be unpopular as they would hit families already struggling with 47 percent inflation and a shrinking economy that has caused job losses and an increase in poverty. The statement announcing Energy Secretary Javier Iguacel was stepping down gave no reason for his resignation.

2018-12-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany on Friday cleared away legal hurdles for carmakers to upgrade exhaust emissions filtering systems on older diesel cars as a way to avoid vehicle bans, but failed to quell doubts among manufacturers and suppliers over the effectiveness of retrofits. Carmakers have been forced to consider upgrading exhaust treatment systems on older cars after German cities started banning heavily polluting diesel vehicles to cut pollution from fine particulate matter and toxic nitrogen oxides. The fight over refits is the latest fallout from an emissions cheating scandal triggered by Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) in 2015 after it admitted systematically hiding illegal pollution levels from regulators. An environmental and regulatory backlash ensued and lawmakers and the auto industry are now at odds over how to clean up dirty air in inner cities. Carmakers want customers to buy new cars with cleaner engines, while environmentalists and consumer groups argue that retrofitting older vehicles may be more cost-effective. The transport ministry on Friday released a 30-page document setting out guidelines for getting regulatory approval to install upgraded exhaust filtering systems on older cars. “Now it is the turn of the retrofit industry to develop effective systems to meet all limits and regulations,” transport minister Andreas Scheuer said in a statement.  The Federal Motor Transport Authority would grant approval quickly so that the retrofit systems could be offered on the market as soon as possible, he added. Baumot Group, which makes exhaust filtering upgrade kits, welcomed the guidelines. “Under a normal vehicle certification process, we believe we can deliver our system in 2019 in a timely fashion,” said Marcus Hausser, the company’s chief executive. German auto lobby group VDA, however, said that customers should buy new cars rather than spend money on installing new exhaust filtering mechanisms on older vehicles. “We cannot give a guarantee for a vehicle in which third-party exhaust purification systems have been retrofitted,” VDA president Bernhard Mattes told Die Welt newspaper. “If a customer has his vehicle modified, then he and the retrofitter are responsible for any consequential damage.” German environmental lobby group Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) won a landmark ruling in February to force diesel bans after it sued cities that failed to meet clean air rules. Cities have considered banning older vehicles which do not conform to the latest Euro 6d engine emissions standards. Hamburg has banned older diesel cars from the city center, and other cities, including Berlin and Stuttgart, the home of Germany’s car industry, are set to introduce similar bans. Of the 15 million diesel cars on Germany’s roads, only 2.7 million have Euro-6 technology. Evercore ISI has estimated that upgrading the exhaust cleaning of just the Euro-5 fleet could cost up to 14.5 billion euros ($17.9 billion). German carmakers have already agreed to spend up to 3,000 euros ($3,431) per vehicle to upgrade engine management software to make exhaust filtering systems more effective, but environmentalists say these measures are insufficient. Carmakers are divided over who will pay the retrofit costs, given that most older diesel cars met clean air rules at the time when they were sold. Volkswagen and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) announced they would cover some retrofit costs, while rival BMW (BMWG.DE) has refused, only proposing incentives to trade in old vehicles for new ones. Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said on Friday that customers may not benefit from installing new exhaust systems on older cars.  “All concepts known to us to date have disadvantages for our customers, such as increased fuel consumption and thus increased CO2 emissions and, in some cases, reduced performance,” VW research and development head Frank Welsch said in a statement.  BMW said exhaust system upgrades that would not penalize fuel consumption or cause additional wear and tear could take up to three years to develop and certify. Selling newer cars through incentives combined with the ramp-up of electric car charging infrastructure would bring down pollution levels in inner cities much faster than trying to retrofit older vehicles, BMW said on Friday.  Supplier Continental (CONG.DE) supported the carmakers’ critical stance. A spokesman said developing retrofits for each model would be extremely costly and time-consuming.  Paris, Madrid, Mexico City and Athens have said they plan to ban diesel vehicles from city centers by 2025, while the mayor of Copenhagen wants to ban new diesel cars from entering the city as soon as next year. France and Britain will ban new petrol and diesel cars by 2040.

2018-12-28,"* World stocks rise 0.6 pct; pan-European index up 1.7 pct * Safe-haven assets still in demand as caution persists * US equity futures up half a percent * Brent reverses gains, turns negative (Updates throughout) By Julien Ponthus LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - World stocks rose to one-week highs on Friday and looked set to snap a three-week losing streak after a late-session bounce overnight on Wall Street filtered into Asian and European markets. Safe-haven assets were also in demand amid broader doubts about the market stability that in turn eroded the dollar’s appeal. U.S. shares appeared poised for another rise, with futures for the S&P500, Dow Jones and Nasdaq indices all up around half a percent   while a pan-European benchmark rose 1.7 percent, reversing Thursday’s retreat. That took MSCI’s all-country equity index 0.6 percent higher, for a weekly gain so far of almost 2 percent . Non-U.S. equities have however not matched a two-day surge on Wall Street that saw the S&P 500 gain 5.9 percent, its best performance since August 2015. While Wall Street’s resilience has fuelled hope that some of the market pressure may be easing, investors remain wary. “The volatility here at year-end is unlikely to be sustained, but without more encouraging signals from Washington, the markets will likely remain treacherous in the New Year,” Marc Chandler at Bannockburn securities told clients. Volatility in Europe and in the United States spiked to highs not seen since a global stock market correction in February, but the main volatility gauge has since subsided to one-week lows. Among currencies, the dollar slipped 0.55 percent to 110.40 yen and was on track to lose more than 2 percent against the Japanese currency this month. Against the Swiss franc, it declined 0.3 percent to 0.9853 francs. Another safe-haven asset, gold, inched up to touch a six-month high of $1,282 an ounce. The steady drumbeat of disappointing data continued to reinforce caution, with Japan’s industrial output contracting in November and retail sales showing sharply. In Europe,  German annual inflation slowed sharply in December. The euro and sterling both firmed 0.3 percent against the soft dollar , while an index of emerging market currencies touched three-week highs. Chris Bailey, a strategist at brokerage Raymond James, said dollar weakness was good news for non-U.S. assets. “My feeling is... if we get the transmission mechanism of a lower dollar, stocks outside the U.S. are set up for a good 2019,” Bailey said. “Once people get their heads around the fact the U.S. is not going to have yet another double-digit return year in 2019, you can look elsewhere.” This year though, the annual picture for most assets remains grim, with world stocks for instance losing close to 12 percent so far in 2018 and oil prices falling 30 percent. Brent crude futures, which had rebounded after Thursday’s 4.2 percent fall, eased back half a percent to $51.9 a barrel as rising U.S. inventories and concern over global economic growth weighed On bond markets, yields on safer debt from Germany and the United States rose slightly, though they remained near multi-month lows . In Italy, 10-year yields are set for their biggest monthly drop since July 2015. The last auction of the year there saw investors willing to buy 10-year government bonds at 2.70 percent, down from 3.24 percent last month. The auction could be a sign Italy has turned a corner after months of volatile trading amid fractious talks over its spending plans with Brussels.

2018-12-28,"BERLIN (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s criticism of the Russian-backed Nord Stream 2 pipeline is no reason to stop the project and any attempt to do so would be difficult now that it is being built, European Commissioner Guenther Oettinger said. Trump has attacked Berlin for supporting the $11 billion gas pipeline spanning the Baltic Sea, accusing Germany in July of being a “captive” of Russia due to its reliance on Russian energy. U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said last month that Washington retained the option of imposing sanctions on companies working on the pipeline, which would bring Russian gas directly to Germany.  Berlin and Moscow have been at odds since Russia annexed Crimea four years ago, but they have a common interest in the Nord Stream 2 project, which will double the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 route from next year. “I was never a great supporter of Nord Stream 2,” Oettinger, the EU’s budget commissioner, told German magazine Der Spiegel. “But the truth is the pipeline has long been under construction and can no longer so easily be stopped.” He added: “Trump’s threats are no reason for that.” Germany refuses to join opposition to the project from many EU states and - thus far - from the EU executive, describing it as a private enterprise. Washington is concerned that the pipeline, which will bypass Ukraine by running under the Baltic Sea, will strip Ukraine of important transit revenue and says Moscow is using the project to divide Europe. Ukraine derives up to 3 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) from transit charges. Construction of the project is progressing. Oettinger, a German, pressed Russian gas giant Gazprom (GAZP.MM), which is leading the project, to agree “a fair deal on the further use of the existing pipelines through Ukraine”. Gazprom is the sole shareholder in Nord Stream 2, shouldering half of the 9.5 billion euro ($10.89 billion) construction cost. Gazprom’s European partners are Germany’s Uniper (UN01.DE) and Wintershall (BASFn.DE), Anglo-Dutch group Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), France’s Engie (ENGIE.PA) and Austria’s OMV (OMVV.VI).

2018-12-28,"VILLABLINO, Spain, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Coal miners in Spain are working their last shifts before all unprofitable mines shut down under a European Union directive in which deposits that no longer make money and receive public funds must stop production by Jan. 1, 2019. Spain announced in 2016 a 2.13 billion euro ($2.44 billion)plan, backed by Brussels, to ease the closure of 26 uncompetitive coal mines by the end of this year. Mines must return funds if they do not close by the end of 2018. Coal accounts for under 10 percent of Spain’s energy needs, and the majority used in Spain is imported. High extraction costs have led to the gradual closure of mines in Spain, mostly concentrated in the northern regions of Asturias, Castile and Leon and Aragon. The industry employed around 100,000 people in the 1950s but this has since dwindled to around 2,000. “La Escondida” is the only functioning coal mine left in the northwestern province of Leon, employs 70 workers and produces 7,000 tonnes of coal per month, owner Grupo Lamelas Viloria said by email. The group is fighting against closure, saying that it has presented a project to exploit adjoining concessions that are not receiving state aid, it said, estimating there were reserves of several million tonnes in the deposit. At the deep-shaft “Santiago” mine in Caborara in Asturias, workers dressed in overalls and white helments, their faces smeared with coal dust, pour out of the mining complex after their shift. Spain’s Socialist government agreed a deal in October with unions to smooth workers’ access to benefits such as early retirement and earmarked a 250 million euro fund for aiding business ventures and re-purposing disused mines. The government expects around 60 percent of workers to opt for early retirement. The closure of coal mines is a thorny issue for the minority Socialist government as it has made environmental issues a keystone of its administration, creating a ministry to oversee the transition to more environmentally-friendly policies. However, the coal mining communities most affected by these closures are traditionally Socialist voters.

2018-12-28,"* European stocks rise 1.4 pct * Volatility on the rise * Safe-haven currencies in demand * Oil prices rebound By Julien Ponthus LONDON, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Stocks in Europe and Asia rose cautiously on Friday after Wall Street ended a volatile session with big gains, but fears of further price swings and worries about U.S. politics kept safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc in demand. European shares opened in positive territory after Thursday’s 1.7 percent retreat and were up about 1.4 percent at 0920 GMT, with most bourses and sectors in the black. They have not matched a two-day surge on U.S. indexes that saw the benchmark S&P 500 index gain 5.9 percent, its best performance since late August 2015 when the market was in the midst of a downturn over a slowing Chinese economy. Asian stock markets also posted modest gains, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rising 0.8 percent. While Wall Street’s capacity to shake off an initial selloff and post one of its highest daily percentage increases has fuelled hope that some of the selling pressure is easing, investors in Europe remained wary. “The volatility here at year-end is unlikely to be sustained, but without more encouraging signals from Washington, the markets will likely remain treacherous in the New Year,” Marc Chandler at Bannockburn securities told clients. Volatility in Europe and in the United States has spiked to highs not seen since the sharp global correction in stock markets in February. The yearly picture for world stocks remains grim, with the MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, losing close to 12 percent so far in 2018. While stocks showed signs they might recoup more losses in the year’s final days, lingering doubts about the stability of the market sustained demand for safe-haven currencies. “Markets are a bit more cautious on risk appetite, with the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc gaining,” said Lee Hardman, an FX strategist at MUFG in London. “The dollar continues to be soft across the board as volatile stock markets are reducing the relative safe haven appeal for U.S. assets.” The dollar extended overnight losses and was down 0.55 percent at 110.40 yen and was on track to lose more than 2 percent this month. Against the Swiss franc, it declined 0.3 percent to 0.9853 francs per dollar after slumping more than 0.8 percent the previous day. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1444. Oil prices rebounded and took back some of the ground lost this week, but remained close to their lowest levels in more than a year as rising U.S. inventories and concern over global economic growth kept markets under pressure. Brent crude oil was up $1.10, or 2.1 percent, at $53.26 a barrel by 0906 GMT, having earlier risen more than 3 percent. It had dropped 4.2 percent on Thursday. Spot gold, which has benefited this week from the global market turmoil, was just slightly higher at $1,276.33 an ounce following an ascent to a six-month high of $1,279.06 on Wednesday. In fixed income, Italian yields rose as investors made space for the last auction of the year. A strong auction of zero coupon bonds on Thursday led to a mini-rally in Italian government debt as investors saw this is a good omen for today’s up to 5 billion euro bond sale, which caps one of the largest borrowing programmes. The Treasury is hoping the auction will decisively show that Italy has turned a corner after months of volatile trading on the back of fractious talks between Rome and Brussels over its spending plans.

2018-12-28,"(Adds details) DUBAI, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Libya’s oil and gas revenue dipped to $2.4 billion in November from $2.87 billion in October, but full-year revenue is expected to surge by 76 percent to $24.2 billion, state oil firm NOC said on Friday. Although lower than the previous month, November revenue was the third highest monthly figure in 2018, NOC said. Despite recurrent security problems that have affected output from Libyan oilfields, NOC’s revenue has been boosted this year by higher oil prices and production. Libya currently produces about 1.15 million barrels per day of oil. “NOC will continue to drive the economic recovery and provide the funds necessary to ensure a fair distribution of wealth and economic justice across the country,” NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement. Last week, NOC declared force majeure at its biggest oil field after it was taken over on Dec. 8 by tribesmen, armed protesters and state guards demanding salary payments and development funds. NOC and the internationally recognised government agreed on a security plan this week to protect the 315,000 barrel per day El Sharara field including setting up green zones inside the site to stop anyone entering without a permit and removing all unauthorised people. “We are also working hard to implement agreed security measures at Sharara so operations and production can resume as soon as possible,” Sanalla said. The reopening of the field hinges on “the implementation of key reforms by the government to the local Petroleum Facilities Guard,” he added.

2018-12-28,"SINGAPORE/TOKYO (Reuters) - Imports of Iranian crude oil by major buyers in Asia hit their lowest in more than five years in November as U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil exports took effect last month, government and ship-tracking data showed. China, India, Japan and South Korea last month imported about 664,800 barrels per day (bpd) from Iran, according to the data, down 12.7 percent from the same month a year earlier. South Korea cut imports to zero for a third month in November while Japan followed suit. India’s November imports are down about 40 percent from October, the data showed. Asia’s Iranian oil imports are set to rise from December after the United States granted eight countries waivers from sanctions against Iran’s oil exports for 180 days. China’s Iranian oil imports rebounded to close to 390,000 bpd in November, up from about 247,000 bpd in October, the lowest in more than five years. Sinopec, Tehran’s biggest crude buyer, resumed Iran oil imports shortly after China received its waiver in November while China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) will restart lifting its own Iranian oil production in December. Japan and South Korea are preparing to resume Iranian oil imports in early 2019. India is expected to restrict its monthly purchases of Iranian oil to 1.25 million tonnes, or 9 million barrels, during the waiver period from November.

2018-12-28,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A third prototype of China’s home-built C919 narrowbody passenger jet completed its first test flight on Friday, its manufacturer said, in another step forward in the nation’s push to become a global civil aerospace player. The C919, which will compete with Boeing Co’s (BA.N) 737 and the Airbus SE (AIR.PA) A320, is widely regarded as a symbol of China’s civil aerospace ambition and President Xi Jinping’s policy of upgrading manufacturing capabilities. In a statement on its official microblog, Commercial Aircraft Corp of China Ltd (COMAC) [CMAFC.UL] said the plane landed safely at Shanghai Pudong International Airport at 12:45 p.m. (0445 GMT), having flown for 1 hour and 38 minutes.  The jet will next fly to the city of Xian in central China for more test flights with a focus on aircraft flutter and airspeed calibration, the company said. The second prototype of the C919 jet conducted its first flight in December 2017, seven months after the maiden flight of the first C919. COMAC said it is assembling a further three prototypes, and that all six will be scheduled to conduct flight tests next year. The C919 has dozens of customers that have placed orders and commitments for 815 jets. COMAC is aiming to obtain certification for the plane from Chinese regulators by the end of 2020, as well as Europe’s aviation safety regulator, which agreed in April to start the certification process.

2018-12-28,"(Adds NY Fire Dept, power company quotes throughout, normal service resumed; changes date; adds PIX tag to media slug) Dec 28 (Reuters) - A transformer explosion at an electric power substation in the New York City borough of Queens lit up the night sky with a bright blue light on Thursday, mystifying some residents, but officials said no one was injured in the incident. “There was a boom and a bang and a flash of light,” said Jim Long, a spokesman for Fire Department New York. “It’s all under control but we’re still getting calls from residents wondering what happened,” he said early on Friday. The blue flashes that briefly lit up the night sky in the Astoria area of Queens, New York, shortly after 9 p.m. (0200 GMT) were caused by a power surge and electrical “arching” and sparked a transformer explosion and a small fire, said Con Edison spokesman Bob McGee. There were no injuries, he said. Social media lit up with videos and photos of the bright light in the night sky over New York City. The chatter continued into Friday morning. “Why is the sky lit up bright blue in Queens New York City right now? Is it fireworks?” Louis Santoro, a New York City resident, wrote on Twitter. One resident, Joe Calderone, told the New York Post: “Damn, I thought a UFO hit Con Ed.” Con Edison’s McGee reassured residents after internet speculation that aliens or the villain Thanos from the recent Avengers’ movie “Infinity War” had invaded. “No, it wasn’t space aliens,” he said. “All power has been restored to normal. “But the videos online of the blue lights in the sky are still flying all over the internet,” McGee said. The fire caused scattered outages, stalled some city trains and briefly blacked out LaGuardia Airport, which is located in Queens, because of a transmission dip, he said. It also caused some flight cancellations and delays but all power and services were restored before midnight, McGee said. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in a message on Twitter that Con Edison was evaluating the extent of power outages in the area. He said that travelers could expect delays through early Friday. The cause of the incident was being investigated.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.8 percent. It has fallen 3 percent so far in December. The Shanghai Composite Index moved up 0.35 percent. Australian stocks added 1 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 0.3 percent, losing some steam after surging nearly 4 percent on Thursday. U.S. stocks roared back to end in positive territory on Thursday, with the Dow adding 1.14 percent, after suffering steep losses for much of the session. The gains come a day after Wall Street indexes posted their biggest daily percentage increases in nearly a decade following a sharp plunge at the week’s start. However, all three U.S. major indexes remain down more than 9 percent for December following losses earlier in the month, when factors including concerns over the U.S.-China trade war, slowing global growth and wariness towards the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle took a heavy toll. “Selling pressure on U.S. equities is beginning to dissipate, but the VIX index is still around 29 with investor risk sentiment still recovering. A renewed market slide remains a risk,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. The CBOE Volatility Index rose midweek to 36, its highest level since early February. It has since pulled back below 30 but remains well above a recent low of 15 at the beginning of December. Focus turned to the Fed’s stance and whether the equity markets can sustain their recovery at the start of the new year. “If Fed officials - notably Chairman (Jerome) Powell and New York Fed Governor Williams - show a cautious stance towards further rate hikes given recent instability in the stocks markets, that would lead to a rise in U.S. equities and Treasury yields, and a firmer dollar,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. Fed Chairman Powell is due to give a speech on Jan. 4. While stocks showed signs of recovery, lingering market volatility helped keep safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc in demand. The dollar extended overnight losses and was down 0.3 percent at 110.64 yen. It was on track to lose more than 2 percent this month. The greenback declined 0.3 percent to 0.9851 francs per dollar after slumping more than 0.8 percent the previous day. The U.S. currency has fallen 1.1 percent against its Swiss peer on the month. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1450 after gaining 0.7 percent overnight. The common currency was headed for a 1 percent gain in December. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was up 3 basis points at 2.773 percent, pulling back from a nine-month low of 2.720 percent brushed earlier in the week. The yield had climbed to a seven-year peak of 3.26 percent in October when the debt market had braced for potentially faster pace of Fed rate hikes in 2019. Oil prices remained choppy, with U.S. crude futures up 2.2 percent at $45.60 per barrel after sliding 3.5 percent the previous day. U.S. crude had rallied 8 percent midweek after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of $42.36 at the week’s start. Crude has lost more than one-third of its value since the beginning of October and is heading for declines of more than 20 percent in 2018. In addition to oversupply concerns, worries about slowing global economic growth have dampened investor demand for riskier asset classes and pressured crude. Brent crude climbed 1.8 percent to $53.11 per barrel after losing more than 4 percent the previous day. Spot gold, which has benefited this week from the global market turmoil was slightly higher at $1,278.71 an ounce following an ascent to a six-month high of $1,279.06 on Wednesday.

2018-12-28,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s government unveiled a plan on Thursday to step up use of the armed forces to combat fuel theft, vowing to root out corrupt officials it says are largely responsible for a problem that has cost the country billions of dollars. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference his government would fight the theft “outside and inside” state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), saying  authorities were complicit in the bulk of the crimes. “This is the theft of national assets, of public funds, of money that belongs to all Mexicans,” he said. Guanajuato state governor Diego Sinhue said later on Thursday government officials told him the armed forces were “intervening” at Pemex installations around Mexico.  That included facilities in Guanajuato, where Pemex runs a refinery in the city of Salamanca. Fuel theft there has been linked to a surge in violence and killings, he said in a video published by Mexican media. The operations were conducted in accordance with Lopez Obrador’s order to put an end to fuel theft, Sinhue said.  Criminal gangs have for years used fuel theft as a way to supplement their income, hurting Mexico’s refineries and bleeding money from state coffers.  Speaking alongside the president, Defence Minister Luis Cresencio Sandoval said the security presence would be increased at key oil installations to better monitor distribution of fuel.  Security forces would also receive additional training for the task, Sandoval said. Pemex’s new Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero told the news conference more than 146 billion pesos (5.86 billion pounds) worth of fuel had been stolen in Mexico since 2016, with theft soaring to new heights this year. Asked whether the Pemex workers’ union had been involved in the theft of fuel, Lopez Obrador said there had been reports that the union had been restricting access to parts of the company’s operations. That issue had been addressed with the union’s leaders and access would not be restricted in future, he said.

2018-12-28,"(Adds comparison vs year earlier) SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China is set to issue its first batch of refined fuel export quotas for 2019, set at a total of 18.36 million tonnes or 13 percent more than the first issue for this year, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. China, which authorises annual fuel exports progressively, is expected to ship out more refined products next year as two large new refineries add to on an already over-supplied domestic fuel market. The quotas, which are issued by the Ministry of Commerce, comprise 8.7 million tonnes of diesel, 5.19 million tonnes of gasoline and 4.47 million tonnes of kerosene, said one source. Calls to the Ministry’s press office were not answered. The Ministry did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment. The first batch of quotas will be shared between four state-run firms - Sinopec, CNPC, CNOOC and Sinochem, the two sources said. Top refiner Sinopec will receive 8.3 million tonnes, China’s second-largest refiner CNPC will get 6.09 million tonnes, Sinochem 2.13 million tonnes and CNOOC 1.84 million tonnes.

2018-12-28,"* Vitol seeks 4 cargoes for 2019-2020 for South Korea - trader * LNG imports into Northeast Asia at monthly record high - data * Australia’s Prelude FLNG starts production By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) slipped this week amid thin trade, though monthly deliveries into Northeast Asia climbed to a record in December as colder-than-normal temperatures are expected this week. Spot prices for February delivery to Asia LNG-AS dropped to $9.10 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), with bids and offers remaining wide apart from $8.70 to $9.50 per mmBtu, industry sources said. Trade was largely quiet with many traders on Christmas holidays. Commodities trader Vitol Asia bid in S&P Global Platts’ pricing process on Thursday for a series of four LNG cargoes to be delivered over 2019 to 2020, according to one trader. The cargoes were for delivery over May 10 to 20, August 10 to 20, November 10 to 20 in 2019 and Feb. 10-20 in 2020 into Port of Gwangyang, South Korea. Meanwhile LNG imports into China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have climbed to 20.5 million tonnes so far in December, already 5 percent more than the previous monthly record of 19.5 million tonnes back in January, data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. December shipments were nearly 15 percent higher than November, the data showed. Temperatures across Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai and Seoul are expected to be colder than normal this week, with a widespread chill likely to cover China over the next 10 days, weather forecasts from Refinitiv Eikon show. Lower shipping rates could also be aiding flows into the region, industry sources said. Rates dropped to about $85,000 to $100,000 per day this week from $110,000 to $120,000 the previous week. The rates have dropped as several vessels which were at sea with LNG cargoes for Asia have been released after discharging their loads, one of the industry sources said. Elsewhere, Australia’s Ichthys LNG plant and Malaysia’s Petronas may have offered cargoes for January, sources said, though details were not immediately clear. Royal Dutch Shell said earlier this week that it has begun output at its Prelude floating liquefied natural gas (FLNG) facility in Australia, the world’s largest floating production structure and the last of a wave of eight LNG projects built in the country over the last decade. Shell did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on when first LNG will be exported from the facility, but analysts estimate exports to start by first half of next year, with condensates likely to start first.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.3 percent. It has fallen almost 4 percent so far in December. The Shanghai Composite Index edged up 0.3 percent. Australian stocks added 0.6 percent and South Korea’s KOSPI climbed 0.5 percent. Japan’s Nikkei bucked the trend and slipped 0.5 percent, losing some steam after surging nearly 4 percent the previous session. U.S. stocks roared back to end in positive territory on Thursday, with the Dow adding 1.14 percent, after suffering steep losses for much of the session. The gains come a day after Wall Street indexes posted their biggest daily percentage increases in nearly a decade following a sharp plunge at the week’s start. However, all three U.S. major indexes remain down more than 9 percent for December following losses earlier in the month, when factors including concerns over the U.S.-China trade war, slowing global growth and wariness towards the Federal Reserve’s tightening cycle took a heavy toll. “Selling pressure on U.S. equities is beginning to dissipate, but the VIX index is still around 29 with investor risk sentiment still recovering. A renewed market slide remains a risk,” said Junichi Ishikawa, senior FX strategist at IG Securities in Tokyo. The CBOE Volatility Index rose midweek to 36, its highest level since early February. It has since pulled back below 30 but remains well above a recent low of 15 marked at the beginning of December. Focus turned to the Fed’s stance and whether the equity markets can sustain their recovery at the start of the new year. “If Fed officials - notably Chairman (Jerome) Powell and New York Fed Governor Williams - show a cautious stance towards further rate hikes given recent instability in the stocks markets, that would lead to a rise in U.S. equities and Treasury yields, and a firmer dollar,” said Masafumi Yamamoto, chief forex strategist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. Fed Chairman Powell is due to speak on Jan. 4. While stocks showed signs of recovery, lingering market volatility helped keep safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc in demand. The dollar extended overnight losses and was down 0.2 percent at 110.74 yen. It was on track to lose more than 2 percent this month. The greenback declined 0.25 percent to 0.9852 francs per dollar after slumping more than 0.8 percent the previous day. The U.S. currency has fallen 1.1 percent against its Swiss peer on the month. The euro was a shade higher at $1.1447 after gaining 0.7 percent overnight. The common currency was headed for a 1 percent gain in December. The 10-year U.S. Treasury note yield was up 3 basis points at 2.773 percent, pulling back from a nine-month low of 2.720 percent brushed earlier in the week. The yield had climbed to a seven-year peak of 3.26 percent in October as the debt market braced for potentially faster pace of Fed rate hikes in 2019. Oil prices remained choppy, with U.S. crude futures up 2.5 percent at $45.73 per barrel after sliding 3.5 percent the previous day. U.S. crude had rallied 8 percent midweek after dropping to a 1-1/2-year low of $42.36 at the week’s start. Crude has lost more than a third of its value since the beginning of October and is heading for declines of more than 20 percent in 2018. In addition to oversupply concerns, worries about slowing global economic growth have dampened investor demand for riskier asset classes and pressured crude. Brent crude climbed 2 percent to $53.23 per barrel after losing more than 4 percent the previous day. Spot gold, which has benefited this week from the global market turmoil stood little changed at $1,277.43 an ounce following an ascent to a six-month high of $1,279.06 on Wednesday.

2018-12-28,"SEOUL, Dec 28 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices rose on Friday to claw back some of the ground they lost in the previous session, but growth in U.S. crude stockpiles and ongoing concerns about the global economy kept markets under pressure. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were up $1.37, or 3.07 percent, at $45.98 per barrel at 0042 GMT, having earlier rising as high as $46.05 per barrel. They ended Thursday down 3.48 percent, or $1.61, at $44.61 a barrel. Brent crude had yet to trade. It dropped 4.24 percent, or $2.31, the day before to settle at $52.16 per barrel. Oil prices fell to their lowest in more than a year on Thursday, a day after their biggest one-day rally in two years, pulled down by worries about the global economy and a supply glut. Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia-Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore, said crude prices had been pressured by slowing economic growth “coupled with the expectation of strong U.S. production in the new year”. U.S. crude inventories for the week to Dec. 21 rose by 6.9 million barrels to 448.2 million barrels on increased refinery output, according to data released on Thursday by industry group the American Petroleum Institute. Official U.S. government data is due on Friday. The United States has emerged as the world’s biggest crude producer, pumping 11.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude, more than both Saudi Arabia and Russia. Meanwhile, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday that rising protectionism and the unpredictability of the U.S. administration had greatly contributed to global oil price volatility over the past two years. Novak also said Russia would cut its crude output by between 3 and 5 million tonnes in the first half of 2019 as part of a deal between producers Earlier this month, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies including Russia, agreed to curb output by 1.2 million bpd starting in January in a bid to clear a supply overhang and prop up prices.
