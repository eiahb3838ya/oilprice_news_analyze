2018-12-03,"* Suncor, Husky, Imperial push against Canada move * CNRL, Cenovus, CNOOC-Nexen support the move * Canadian oil discount narrows after weekend announcement * Oil deliveries constrained by full pipelines (Adds comments from Cenovus CEO, industry background) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Julie Gordon NEW YORK/VANCOUVER, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Several oil companies in Canada pushed back on Monday against Alberta’s mandated cuts in crude production, warning about excessive government intervention even as the discount on Canadian crudes narrowed sharply on the curtailment plan. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said on Sunday the government would force producers to cut output by 8.7 percent, or 325,000 barrels per day (bpd), until excess crude in storage is reduced. The move is unusual for a market economy like Canada, in comparison with members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries whose oil companies are often state-owned. Prices for Canadian grades of crude oil moved sharply upward Monday, narrowing the deep discounts they had been trading at, relative to their U.S. counterparts. While producers said they would comply with the mandatory cuts, executives from Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc, Husky Energy Inc and Imperial Oil, integrated producers with domestic refinery and upgrading capacity, expressed disappointment. “We believe the market is working and view government-ordered curtailment or other interventions as possibly having serious negative investment, economic and trade consequences,” said Husky in a statement. However, major producers like Cenovus Energy Inc and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd were vocal with their support. “At $35 or $45 differentials - the lion’s share of companies in this industry are barely breaking even or actually losing money,” Cenovus Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix said in an interview. Canada is one of the world’s largest oil producers, supplying more than 4.2 million barrels a day, but WCS prices slumped in October to a discount of more than $52 a barrel below WTI due to the transportation constraints and storage glut. Heavy Western Canadian Select oil traded at a $25 a barrel discount to U.S. crude on Monday, compared with a $32 discount on Friday. Light synthetic crude from the oil sands settled at $17 below the benchmark, $8 narrower than Friday. Following the cuts, Pourbaix said Cenovus expects discounts closer to $20 a barrel in 2019, supporting investment of C$1.5 billion ($1.1 billion) in 2019, in line with 2018 capital spending. “That would not have been the case if the government hadn’t take action,” Pourbaix said. Suncor is assessing the impact of the government’s announcement, it said, noting that the market is the most effective means to balance supply and demand and normalize differentials. “Less economic production was being curtailed and differentials were narrowing as a result of market forces,” Suncor said in a statement, adding that specific effects from the cuts will be discussed in its upcoming 2019 outlook. Imperial Oil CEO Rich Kruger said the company was reviewing the impact on its investments. But CNRL cheered the Alberta government’s move, noting “these are unprecedented times and they call for urgent action.” Nexen, a subsidiary of CNOOC Ltd, said the actions would help strengthen the Alberta economy. Canada’s production has steadily increased over the last year and is set to grow some 17.8 percent through 2020, according to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, but shipments have been constrained by the lack of pipelines out of Alberta to the United States and overseas markets. Several projects, including TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL to the United States, and the expansion of the government-owned Trans Mountain pipeline to the West Coast, have been hamstrung by battles with opponents. “The heavy-handed action is a short-term remedy but not long-term solution,” said Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets. “Rail cars aside, there’s no long-term solution that does not involve building a pipeline.” The mandated cuts are controversial because heavily integrated producers, like Suncor and Husky, benefit from the low crude prices to feed their refineries. They also tend to have more secure pipeline access. “Producers that don’t have refineries and were having to place their barrels on the spot market without pipeline capacity are the ones that are really benefitting from this,” said Kurt Barrow, vice president of oil markets and downstream at IHSMarkit. Shares of companies like Cenovus and Canadian Natural Resources that lack refining capacity rose, while shares of some companies with refineries, like Imperial Oil, fell.

2018-12-03,"LIMA, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Canadian oil company Frontera Energy said on Monday it had stopped production at Peru’s largest oilfield after a Peruvian-owned pipeline was severed last week by indigenous protesters. Frontera Energy said in a statement that production at the oilfield, located 200 kilometers (124 miles) from the pipeline rupture, would stop while authorities worked to resolve the dispute with the community. State-owned oil company Petroperu, which operates the pipeline, flagged on Friday that Frontera may be forced to halt production, and estimated that losses could amount to around $200,000 per day. Last week, a group of residents in an Amazon region inhabited by the indigenous Mayuriaga community severed the pipeline and then prevented technicians from repairing it, according to Petroperu. Frontera said that the company expects to restart operations “shortly” after the pipeline is repaired. Recent net production at the oilfield has averaged 8,950 barrels per day. Petroperu estimates that the rupture may have caused some 8,000 barrels of oil to spill, although the company said that oil has not contaminated water sources in the area. The company has shut off crude oil from flowing through the pipeline. Frontera Energy temporarily operates lot 192, a production site which is located in the Amazon region of Loreto and has around 100 million barrels in reserves. The company’s contract expires in March 2019. The 1,100 kilometer pipeline that transports crude from the oil fields of the Peruvian jungle to the Petroperu refinery on the Pacific coast has suffered dozens of attacks since it began operating four decades ago. Since 2016, nearly 20,000 barrels of oil have been spilled from the pipeline in at least 15 attacks, and another 5,600 barrels have leaked due to corrosion of mechanical failures, according to official estimates.

2018-12-03,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Monday the Trump administration wants to end subsidies for electric cars and other items, including renewable energy sources. Asked about plans after General Motors Co (GM.N) announced U.S. plant closings and layoffs last week, Kudlow pointed to the $2,500-to-$7,500 tax credit for consumers who buy plug-in electric vehicles, including those made by GM, under federal law. “As a matter of our policy, we want to end all of those subsidies,” Kudlow said. “And by the way, other subsidies that were imposed during the Obama administration, we are ending, whether it’s for renewables and so forth.” Asked about a timeline, he said: “It’s just all going to end in the near future. I don’t know whether it will end in 2020 or 2021.” The tax credits are capped by Congress at 200,000 vehicles per manufacturer, after which the subsidy phases out. GM has said it expects to hit the threshold by the end of 2018, which means under the current law, its tax credit scheme would end in 2020. Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) said in July it had hit the threshold. Other automakers may not hit the cap for several years.  Experts say the White House cannot change the cap unilaterally. U.S. President Donald Trump last week threatened to eliminate subsidies for GM in retaliation for the company’s decision. Kudlow made clear any changes in subsidies would not just affect GM. “I think legally you just can’t,” he said. Democrats will take control of the U.S. House in January and are unlikely to agree to end subsidies for electric cars and many have been pushing for additional incentives. Tesla and GM have lobbied Congress for months to lift the cap on electric vehicles or make other changes, but face an uphill battle make changes before the current Congress expires. In October, Senator Dean Heller proposed lifting the current cap on electric vehicles eligible for tax credits but phase out the credit for the entire industry in 2022. Two other senators in September proposed lifting the per manufacturer credit and extending the benefit for 10 years. Also in October, Senator John Barrasso a Republican who chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, proposed legislation to end the EV tax credit entirely.

2018-12-03,"(Adds World Bank CEO comment, reaction) By Megan Rowling KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The World Bank will give equal weight to curbing emissions and helping poor countries deal with the “disastrous effects” of a warming world as it steps up investments to tackle climate change in the first half of the 2020s, it said on Monday. The bank and its two sister organisations plan to double their investments in climate action to about $200 billion from 2021-2025, with a boost in support for efforts to adapt to higher temperatures, wilder weather and rising seas. The latest figures on international climate funding for developing nations show barely a quarter has been going to adaptation, with the bulk backing clean energy adoption and more efficient energy use, aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions. “We live in a new normal in which disasters are more severe and more frequent,” World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva told the Thomson Reuters Foundation at U.N. climate talks in Poland. “We have to prioritise adaptation everywhere, but especially in the most vulnerable parts of the world,” she said, pointing to the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, coastal regions and small island states. Of the $100 billion the World Bank plans to make available in the five years from mid-2020, half would go to adaptation measures, it said. Those include building more robust homes, schools and infrastructure, preparing farmers for climate shifts, managing water wisely and protecting people’s incomes through social safety nets, Georgieva added. The World Bank said the money would also improve weather forecasts, and provide early warning and climate information services for 250 million people in 30 developing countries. “Climate change is an existential threat to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. These new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement. From 2014-2018, the World Bank spent nearly $21 billion on adaptation, which accounted for just over 40 percent of the climate benefits generated by the institution’s funding overall. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the bank’s pledge to use half its climate finance to find solutions to deal with changing weather patterns was “important”. “Climate change is already having a disastrous impact on people right around the world and we are nearing the point of no return,” said Ban. “So we must take bold action to adapt to the reality of the threat facing us all.” A recently launched Global Commission on Adaptation, which Ban chairs with Georgieva and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, aims to put political muscle behind efforts to keep people safer in a hotter world. The remaining $100 billion in promised World Bank Group funding will come from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which works with the private sector, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as private capital the group raises. “There are literally trillions of dollars of opportunities for the private sector to invest in projects that will help save the planet,” said IFC chief Philippe Le Houérou. The IFC will identify opportunities, use tools to make investments less risky, and attract private-sector cash in areas including renewable energy, green buildings, clean transport in cities and urban waste management, he added. Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said her low-lying Pacific island state was struggling with fiercer storms and increasing seawater flooding that is contaminating fresh water with salt. The new World Bank funds would “help to build resilience, make us safer, and improve lives”, she said. “Global action needs to accelerate before it is too late,” she added. The “Big Shift Global” coalition of aid agencies and climate justice campaigners said the World Bank Group’s new commitment signalled that developing countries should receive far more support to tackle climate change. But it overlooked ""the desperate need to radically scale up financing for off-grid renewable energy"" to help the poorest gain access to electricity, they added.

2018-12-03,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices jumped nearly four percent on Monday after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade dispute and Canada’s Alberta province ordered a production cut, while exporter group OPEC looked set to reduce supply. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $2.23 to settle at $61.69 a barrel, a 3.75 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures gained $2.02 to settle at $52.95 a barrel, a 3.97 percent increase. Both benchmarks surged more than 5 percent earlier in the session.  China and the United States agreed during a weekend meeting in Argentina of the Group of 20 leading economies not to impose additional trade tariffs for at least 90 days while they hold talks to resolve existing disputes.  The trade war between the world’s two biggest economies has weighed heavily on global trade and sparked concerns of an economic slowdown.  Crude oil has not been included in the list of products facing import tariffs, but traders said the positive sentiment was supporting crude markets. “Initial signs of the U.S.-China trade relation on the mend have provided a boost to oil prices in today’s trading session. Nevertheless, whether the momentum will sustain hinges on tangible outcomes from the negotiations,” said Abhishek Kumar, senior energy analyst at Interfax Energy in London. Oil also received support from an announcement by Alberta that the Western Canadian province will force producers to cut output by 8.7 percent, or 325,000 barrels per day (bpd), to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to crude building up in storage. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meets on Thursday to decide output. The group, along with non-OPEC member Russia, is expected to announce cuts aimed at reining in a glut that has pulled down crude prices by around a third since October. “We feel that a decline of about 1.1-1.2 million barrels per day will be required if fresh price lows are to be precluded,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note.  Within OPEC, Qatar said it will leave the producer club in January. Qatar’s oil production is only around 600,000 bpd, but it is the world’s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG). Qatar’s decision to quit OPEC shows the frustration of small producers at the dominant role of a Saudi and Russia-led panel, Iran’s OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Reuters, adding that any supply cuts should come only from countries that had increased output. Outside OPEC, Russian oil output stood at 11.37 million bpd in November, down from a post-Soviet record of 11.41 million bpd it reached in October, Energy Ministry data showed on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he had no concrete figures on possible oil output cuts, though his country would continue its contribution to reducing global production. Meanwhile, oil producers in the United States continue to churn out record amounts of oil, with crude output at about 11.5 million bpd.

2018-12-03,"PARIS (Reuters) - The European Commission has proposed reinstating anti-subsidy duties on imports of Argentine biodiesel after massive shipments of cheap biodiesel from Latin America into the European Union threatened its industry, an EU document seen by Reuters shows. The plan follows an investigation requested by EU producers of fuels made from vegetable and recycled oil, which have been hit hard by cheap imports since the EU slashed duties last year in response to a ruling by the World Trade Organization. The proposal needs to be approved by EU member states. The European Commission decided not to reinstate provisional import tariffs on Argentine biodiesel in September, though it considered imports were subsidised and a threat to the EU industry, saying it needed to collect further information. “On the basis of the conclusions reached by the Commission...a definitive countervailing duty should be imposed to prevent the materialisation of the imminent threat of material injury caused to the Union industry by the subsidised imports,” the Commission said in its proposal. Proposed duties range from 25.0 percent to 33.4 percent depending on companies, the document showed. The EU’s removal of duties on low-price biodiesel from Argentina, as well as from Indonesia, last September and subsequent surge in imports has forced European producers to cut production. “Even if this still needs to be confirmed by member states it is good news for the industry,” European Biodiesel Board Chairwoman Kristell Guizouarn told Reuters.

2018-12-03,"Dec 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan crude sales to the United States declined in November for the second consecutive month to 482,517 barrels per day (bpd) as exports of upgraded grades from the nation’s largest oil region slipped, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Venezuela’s state-run Petróleos de Venezuela SA, known as PDVSA, its joint ventures and partners sent 30 crude cargoes to the United States last month, according to the data seen by Reuters on Monday. The volume of crude exported was 1.4 percent lower than in October, but 1.5 percent more than 12 months earlier. The South American country’s overall crude exports have declined 21 percent this year with falling production, infrastructure mishaps, asset seizure attempts by creditors in the Caribbean and payment problems linked to sanctions on the country and PDVSA. Valero Energy Corp was the largest U.S. recipient of Venezuelan crude in November, followed by PDVSA’s U.S. refining arm Citgo Petroleum and Chevron Corp, the data show. Refiner PBF Energy, which in 2017 suspended direct purchases from PDVSA over contract disagreements following U.S. sanctions on the South American country, in November bought two cargoes of Venezuelan crude from trading firm Vitol. PDVSA in mid-November resumed work at one of the docks of the OPEC-member country’s biggest oil port, Jose, but crude flowing from the nation’s Orinoco Belt extra-heavy oil region declined last month as some upgraders were under maintenance . PDVSA’s sales of diluted crude oil (DCO), made with Venezuelan extra-heavy oil and imported naphtha, increased again last month but exports of crude from the Petromonagas and the Petro San Felix upgraders in the Orinoco Belt were halted as the facilities were still under maintenance, the data showed. In October, Venezuela’s oil output fell to 1.17 million bpd, according to secondary sources quoted by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The nation did not report its own numbers. Crude flow to the United States has decreased 18.5 percent this year compared with the same period in 2017. Other destinations for Venezuelan crude, including India and China, have also received less oil from PDVSA in 2018.

2018-12-03,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Older generations have “messed up the planet”, letting down younger people, who are “angry” about it and want it to stop, British naturalist David Attenborough said on Monday. The 92-year-old, who has fronted wildly popular television series documenting nature and the environment, said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland that betrayal of the young generation left him with a sense of “misery”. “I have done my best to speak the truth as I see it, but (young people) ... know that the world is warming, and science is making it perfectly clear, and they know who is responsible - and that’s me and my predecessors, and going back even further than that,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Even though most world leaders have backed the Paris Agreement to tackle climate change, damage to coral reefs, glaciers and forests is still occurring, he added. “This great machine is tumbling on, and we’ve got to stop it somehow,” he said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks. The talks, held on the site of a former mine in Poland’s main coal-producing region of Silesia, is tasked with hammering out rules to put the 2015 Paris climate accord into practice. In the three years since governments adopted the Paris Agreement, the political will to fight climate change has faded, and countries are not delivering on their commitments, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres told reporters in the city of Katowice. What is happening on the ground is “worse than predictions”, he said, with seas rising faster, ice melting more rapidly, and disasters becoming more dramatic with “terrible consequences”, as seen in hurricanes that hit the Caribbean last year. Greta Thunberg, a Swedish 15-year-old who has inspired a global movement of children skipping school to call for action on climate change, met Guterres, telling him world leaders had ignored “countless people” standing up at U.N. climate summits for 25 years urging them to curb planet-warming emissions. “I will not beg world leaders to care for our future,” she told reporters. “I will instead let them know that change is coming whether they like it or not.” “Our political leaders have failed us,” she added. Kristalina Georgieva, chief executive officer of the World Bank, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation conference delegates should keep pictures of their children and grandchildren in front of them when negotiating. At the official opening ceremony of the talks on Monday, Attenborough presented a video combining clips uploaded to social media by people from all over the world in the past two weeks, using the Twitter hashtag #TakeYourSeat. The video shows the effects people are suffering due to climate change, from worsening wildfires to storms and pollution. “If we don’t take action, the collapse of our civilisations and the extinction of much of the natural world is on the horizon,” Attenborough warned in the first “People’s Seat Address” at U.N. climate talks. The aim was to ensure the views of ordinary people were heard at such a conference that can seem “remote” to many, the broadcaster said afterwards. Alongside his speech, the United Nations launched Facebook Messenger software that will help people learn what they can do to reduce their carbon footprint, and share with their friends how they are making a difference. The ActNow.bot uses artificial intelligence to engage with users and help answer their questions on climate change issues. While many people take small actions to fight climate change, “they know perfectly well that in the end it has to go through governments, and governments need to hear”, Attenborough said. Thunberg said young people should use all means at their disposal - whether social media, or direct protests such as school strikes - to raise awareness about the “mess” created by older people. “We have to make our voices heard, and make them try to clean it up after them,” she said. ""We are all in this together, and together we are strong, and we will not give up,"" she added in a message of solidarity with Australian students who also went on strike last week.

2018-12-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) caved in to growing investor pressure over climate change on Monday, setting out plans to introduce industry-leading carbon emissions targets linked to executive pay. Rivals BP (BP.L) and Total (TOTF.PA) have already set short-term targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions, but these are limited to their own operations.  Shell’s targets, which will be introduced in 2020, will be more extensive with inclusion of the so-called Scope 3 emissions from the burning of fuels sold to millions of customers around the world, the company said.  Monday’s move marks a change of tack for Shell Chief Executive Ben van Beurden, who had previously resisted setting hard goals, saying it would be “foolhardy” to expose Shell to legal challenges. Shareholders have criticised Shell for previously setting long-term “ambitions” to halve carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, which lacked binding targets for implementation. But after discussions with investors, the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas giant said that from 2020 it will set three-year or five-year targets every year. Sacha Sadan, director of corporate governance at Shell investor Legal and General (LGEN.L), said: “It is a very strong message from the world’s second-largest oil company. As investors, we will go to other companies about what they can do. Shell are showing that it is hard but doable.” Shell, which did not specify any targets on Monday, plans to link targets and other measures to its executive remuneration policy. The revised policy will be put to shareholders for approval at its annual meeting in 2020. The company has already linked 10 percent of executives’ remuneration to reducing carbon emissions from the company’s operations. The new targets will include Scope 3 emissions, a Shell spokeswoman said. “We are taking important steps towards turning our Net Carbon Footprint ambition into reality by setting shorter-term targets,” CEO Van Beurden said in a statement.  The move comes as governments meet in Poland for a United Nations-hosted conference to lay out a “rule book” to implement the 2015 Paris climate accord that set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help to limit global warming.

2018-12-03,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika was unable to receive the Saudi crown prince during his visit as planned due to acute flu, the Algerian presidency said on Monday. The Saudi heir, Mohammed bin Salman, had arrived late on Sunday for a two-day visit to Algeria. He wished Bouteflika a speedy recovery, the presidency said in statement carried by the official APS news agency. The cancellation of the meeting is likely to fuel speculation over whether Bouteflika will run for a fifth next in presidential elections next year. Bouteflika, in office since 1999, has rarely appeared in public since suffering a stroke in 2013 which has bound him to a wheelchair. His last meeting with a senior foreign official was during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sept. 17. An earlier meeting with Merkel and a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte were cancelled earlier this year. The ruling party and trade unions have urged Bouteflika to run again, but intellectuals and the opposition have said his health makes him unfit for another term. The Saudi heir met Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, who had also received him at the airport. Prince Mohammed was visiting Algeria as part of a tour of Arab countries he has resumed after attending the G20 summit in Argentina on the weekend. The crown prince is on his first trip abroad since the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, which has strained Saudi Arabia’s ties with the West and battered the prince’s image abroad. Saudi Arabia has said the prince had no prior knowledge of the murder. After offering numerous contradictory explanations, Riyadh said last month that Khashoggi had been killed and his body dismembered when negotiations to persuade him to return to Saudi Arabia failed. So far during Prince Mohammed’s tour of Arab states there has been little or no sign of discontent with his leadership of Saudi Arabia, with the exception of Tunisia, one of the few Arab democracies, where there were demonstrations against him. In Algeria, opposition newspaper Liberte published rare criticism, running a cartoon showing a ghost telling the prince: “This is Bouteflika”. The anxious heir responded: “You frightened me. I had thought this was Khashoggi.” Reporting by Lamine Chikhi; Writing by Ulf Laessing; Editing by Alison Williams and Peter Graff",https://uk.reuters.com/article/mideast-saudi-algeria/update-2-bouteflika-unable-to-receive-saudi-crown-prince-due-to-flu-presidency-idUKL8N1Y84H4,03 Dec 2018,"Algerian President Abdelaziz

The rally in equities follows an agreement reached between Washington and Beijing at the G20 summit in Argentina on Saturday that calls for a 90-day trade tariff truce. “Most of us were hoping that we would come out of these discussions with no new tariffs and a pause, which is ultimately what we got,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 225.51 points, or 0.88 percent, to 25,763.97, the S&P 500 gained 19.73 points, or 0.71 percent, to 2,779.9 and the Nasdaq Composite added 87.31 points, or 1.19 percent, to 7,417.85. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.98 percent. U.S. President Donald Trump said China has agreed to “reduce and remove” tariffs below the 40 percent level that is currently being charged on U.S.-made vehicles. That helped boost shares of European automakers more than 3 percent. The White House also said that the existing 10 percent tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would be increased to 25 percent if no deal was reached within 90 days. MSCI’s all-country world index climbed 0.25 percent, marking its sixth consecutive day of gains. In currency markets, the U.S. dollar fell broadly as currencies battered by trade tensions staged a comeback. China’s yuan and several trade-dependent currencies made strong advances against the greenback as investors sold the safe-haven U.S. currency and bought up riskier assets. “It’s pretty much a sigh of relief across the board,” said Brad Bechtel, global head of FX at Jefferies in New York. The offshore yuan gained about 1 percent, while the Aussie - viewed as a barometer of Chinese growth - was 0.7 percent higher against the greenback. The New Zealand dollar gained 0.8 percent, while the U.S. dollar lost 0.8 percent against the Canadian dollar. Meanwhile, the sterling gave up all of its early gains and dived to its lowest level since the end of October as growing concerns about British parliamentary approval for a proposed Brexit deal prompted investors to sell the currency. “Until the British parliament votes on the deal next week we are going to see a steady drum beat of Brexit headlines, which is going to keep the pound weak,” Danske Bank strategist Morten Helt said, referring to a Dec. 11 lawmakers’ vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s agreement on leaving the European Union. U.S. Treasury yields rose after the U.S.-China deal to hold off on new tariffs reduced demand for safe-haven U.S. debt, but they reversed course in midday trading. Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, initially rose four basis points to 0.347 percent , but eased back to 0.3 percent. Yields on riskier southern European bonds were down across the board, while Italian bonds trimmed some gains after the European Central Bank revealed Italy’s share of ECB capital would be cut slightly. In oil, prices jumped by more than 5 percent after the United States and China agreed the 90-day trade dispute truce, Canada’s Alberta province ordered a production cut, and as exporter group OPEC looked set to reduce supply.

2018-12-03,"DOHA (Reuters) - Qatar said it will quit OPEC to focus on gas in a swipe at Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of the oil exporting group which is trying to show unity in tackling an oil price slide. Doha, one of OPEC’s smallest oil producers but the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter, is embroiled in a row with OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It said the surprise decision to exit OPEC, which has 15 members including Qatar, in January was not driven by politics and it did not name Saudi Arabia, but Minister of State for Energy Affairs Saad al-Kaabi said: “We are not saying we are going to get out of the oil business but it is controlled by an organisation managed by a country,” al-Kaabi said. Qatar would attend an OPEC meeting scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Vienna and would abide by its commitments, he said, adding that Doha would focus on its gas potential. This was because it was not practical “to put efforts and resources and time in an organisation that we are a very small player in and I don’t have a say in what happens,” he added. For a graphic on Qatar's LNG and oil exports, see - tmsnrt.rs/2QbsLNg OPEC members Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and fellow Arab states Bahrain and Egypt, have imposed a political and economic boycott on Qatar since June 2017, accusing it of supporting terrorism, which Doha denies. Qatar’s former prime minister, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, said on Twitter that OPEC “is only used for purposes that hurt our national interests”. The United Arab Emirates said Doha’s decision was a reflection of its declining influence. “The political aspect of Qatar’s decision to quit OPEC is an admission of the decline of its role and influence in light of its political isolation,” Anwar Gargash, UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, said on Twitter. OPEC’s loss of a long-standing member undermines a bid to show a united front before a meeting that is expected to back a supply cut to shore up prices. Benchmark Brent is trading at around $62 a barrel, down from more than $86 in October. “They are not a big producer, but have played a big part in (OPEC’s) history,” one OPEC source said. It highlights the growing dominance over policy making in the oil market of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the world’s top three oil producers which together account for more than a third of global output. Riyadh and Moscow have been increasingly deciding output policies together, under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump on OPEC to bring down prices.  “It could signal a historic turning point of the organisation towards Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States,” said Algeria’s former energy minister and OPEC chairman, Chakib Khelil, commenting on Qatar’s move. For a graphic on Who produces what within OPEC?, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RxkhwC He said Doha’s exit would have a “psychological impact” because of the row with Riyadh and could prove “an example to be followed by other members in the wake of unilateral decisions of Saudi Arabia in the recent past.” Qatar, which Al-Kaabi said had been a member of OPEC for 57 years, has oil output of just 600,000 barrels per day (bpd), compared with Saudi Arabia’s 11 million bpd. But Doha is an influential player in the global LNG market with annual production of 77 million tonnes per year, based on its huge reserves in the Gulf. For a graphic on The world's biggest LNG exporters, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RvFB5z Al-Kaabi, who is heading Qatar’s OPEC delegation, said the decision was part of a long-term strategy and the country’s plans to develop its gas industry and increase LNG output to 110 million tonnes by 2024. “I assure you this purely was a decision on what’s right for Qatar long term. It’s a strategy decision,” Al-Kaabi said.   The exit is the latest example of Qatar charting a course away from its Gulf neighbours since the rift began last year. It comes before an annual summit of Gulf Arab states expected to grapple with the roughly 18-month standoff. Once close partners with Saudi Arabia and the UAE on trade and security, Qatar has struck scores of new trade deals with countries further afield while investing heavily to scale up local food production and ramp up military power. “There is a sentiment in Qatar that Saudi Arabia’s dominance in the region and the region’s many institutions has been counterproductive to Qatar,” said Andreas Krieg, a political risk analyst at King’s College London. “It is about Qatar breaking free as an independent market and state from external interference.” Oil surged about 5 percent on Monday after the United States and China agreed to a 90-day truce in their trade war, but prices remain well off October’s peak. Asked if Qatar’s withdrawal would complicate OPEC’s decision on output this week, a non-Gulf OPEC source said: “Not really, even if it’s a regrettable and sad decision.” Al-Kaabi said state oil company Qatar Petroleum planned to raise its production capability from 4.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to 6.5 million barrels in the next decade. Doha also plans to build the largest ethane cracker in the Middle East and it would still look to expand its oil investments abroad, Al-Kaabi added.

2018-12-03,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany is doubling the funds to help municipalities avoid driving bans for old diesel vehicles to around 2 billion euros ($2.3 billion), Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday. The government had previously pledged 1 billion euros to help improve air quality, but after meeting with municipal representatives on Monday, Merkel said this program would be increased to 1.5 billion euros by 2020. She said the federal government would also set aside an additional 432 million euros for hardware retrofits of small trucks with older diesel engines. The government has been pushing carmakers to shoulder more of the burden of retrofitting cars with insufficient exhaust filtering systems following scandals involving schemes to conceal the true levels of polluting emissions from diesel cars. Environmental activists have sued municipalities and cities to force bans of heavily polluting vehicles in areas where levels of toxic nitrogen oxide violate European clean air standards.  One way to clean up older diesel cars is to fit more effective exhaust filters to cars. The issue of hardware retrofits, which municipalities want, was not resolved at Monday’s meeting. German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer said his ministry would, by the end of 2018, present guidelines on manufacturing improvements that would help curtail nitrogen oxide emissions. He said he expected it to take around six months after that to develop hardware retrofits and those would then need to be approved by the Federal Motor Transport Authority too. Last month, a German court ruled the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia must ban older diesel vehicles in Gelsenkirchen and Essen. Other German cities also face the risk of diesel driving bans imposed by judges, including Aachen, Berlin, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Duesseldorf and Mainz. Merkel said 249 German cities had nitrogen oxide concentrations below the EU limit of 40 micrograms per cubic meter, while 65 cities had higher concentrations than that. Of those 65 cities, 40 had a reading between 40 and 50 micograms and should therefore not have driving bans because the measures already agreed are expected reduce the concentrations quickly, Merkel said.

2018-12-03,"(Adds quotes, details) AMSTERDAM, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Gas production at the earthquake-prone Groningen field will drop by at least 75 percent in the next five years, ahead of schedule towards the projected end of extraction. The Dutch government decided this year to shut down in 2030 what was once Europe’s largest natural gas field because decades of extraction had caused dozens of earthquakes each year, damaging thousands of homes and buildings. Production will drop below 5 billion cubic metres (bcm) per year from 2023, the Dutch government said on Monday, as measures to reduce demand for Groningen gas are working better than planned. “We are ahead of schedule,” Economy Minister Eric Wiebes said. “The end of gas production in Groningen is in sight.” Output is set to drop to 19.4 bcm in the year that began in October, already down 65 percent from its peak of 54 bcm in 2013. In order to drive down output, the nine largest industrial users of low-caloric Groningen gas, who each use at least 100 million cubic metres per year, will be forced to switch to other sources of energy by 2022, Wiebes said. Demand for Groningen gas will also be reduced by building extra capacity to convert high-caloric foreign gas to the low-caloric gas needed for the Dutch network, and by cutting exports to Germany.

Chinese buyers have largely avoided U.S. oil during the two countries’ trade war, fearing the imposition of tariffs. China had risen to become the largest importer of U.S. crude oil in 2018 before cutting off shipments as the trade war escalated. The world’s two largest economies agreed over the weekend to stop imposing new tariffs on each other’s goods for 90 days, though Chinese oil traders said they were still wary and looking for direction from Beijing. Independent refiner Shandong Yuhuang Petrochemicals received its first-ever U.S. crude shipment last week, a company executive said. “We decided to buy this U.S. cargo as it has good value for money,” said the executive, who declined to be named due to company policy. For the first seven months of 2018, China imported an average of 377,700 barrels of U.S. crude per day (bpd), according to U.S. Energy Department figures, surpassing Canada as the biggest foreign buyer of U.S. barrels. But crude imports from the United States slumped to the lowest in more than two years after Beijing threatened to impose tariffs in August - even though it later took U.S. crude off its sanctions list. Chinese customs data last recorded imports from the United States in September and a search in its database did not show any imports in October. The White House said in a statement on Sunday that Beijing had now agreed to buy an unspecified but “very substantial” amount of agricultural, energy, industrial and other products. Still, Chinese buyers remained wary, waiting for further instructions from Beijing. “We’re still gauging the policies... It’s only a 90-day window,” a Chinese oil buyer said, adding that the oil could arrive between January and March. Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) New Courage discharged about 1 million barrels of Southern Green Canyon crude at Lanshan in Shandong province on Nov. 28, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Unipec had chartered the super tanker to ship American oil to China. New Courage first called at Cezi Island in Zhoushan, Zhejiang province, where it offloaded on Nov. 23 about 260,000 barrels of Latin American crude, according to the data. Sinopec, the parent company of Unipec, declined comment. The Chinese oil buyer added that U.S. Mars crude which has been offered at about $2 a barrel above Dubai quotes for delivery to north Asia remained uncompetitive with Middle East oil. But West Texas Intermediate (WTI) Midland which was recently sold at about $2 a barrel above dated Brent could work, he said. Unipec and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are seeking to book supertankers to load crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast in late December for China, traders said, but added that these ships have options to be diverted elsewhere in Asia.

2018-12-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Qatar’s decision to quit OPEC shows the frustration of small producers at the dominant role of a Saudi and Russia-led panel, a top Iranian official said, adding that any supply cuts should come only from countries that had increased output.   The comments underline tensions within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ahead of this week’s meeting to discuss curbing output and prolonging a supply-limiting pact with Russia and other non-members into 2019. Iran has been angered by higher production from Saudi Arabia and Russia, which chair a panel called the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), after calls from U.S. President Donald Trump to pump more oil to offset a drop in Iranian exports hit by U.S. sanctions. “This is very regrettable and we understand their frustration,” Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, told Reuters, referring to Doha’s announcement on Monday. “There are many other OPEC members frustrated that the JMMC is deciding on production unilaterally and without the required prior consensus of OPEC.” Oil prices LCOc1 have fallen from a four-year high above $86 a barrel in early October on concerns over excess supply. OPEC and its allies, which have had a supply pact since 2017, meet in Vienna on Thursday and Friday to discuss supply cuts.  “Since May, they have inflicted a $30 loss on all members,” Kazempour said in reference to the JMMC, “flooded the market and created a huge glut, which is building stocks.  “With this behavior, for small producers there is no merit to stay in OPEC.” Iran believes that any supply reduction should come from those who pumped more - Saudi Arabia and Russia have provided the largest increases - rather than all 25 OPEC and non-OPEC countries involved in the current accord. “Now they are asking others to share in the cut. Whoever increased, they should cut,” Kazempour said. “The pilot and co-pilot crashed the plane and all 25 passengers are now in critical condition. “With this record of failure, I doubt that the declaration of cooperation will be extended.” Russia and Saudi Arabia, by contrast, want to renew and institutionalize the cooperation deal.

2018-12-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss-headquartered MSC expects to pay over $2 billion (1.57 billion pounds) a year in fuel costs due to tougher global marine fuel rules and will introduce a bunker charge next year to recoup expenses, the world’s number two container line said.  UN agency the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) will prohibit ships from using fuels with sulphur content above 0.5 percent from Jan. 1, 2020, compared with 3.5 percent today, unless they are equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems,  known as scrubbers, to clean up sulphur emissions. For shipping companies struggling from years of weaker earnings, the new regulations are expected to mean more cost pressure.  “MSC has estimated that the cost of the various changes we are making to our fleet and its fuel supply is in excess of two billion dollars (USD) per year. We have already had to start incurring these costs to be ready for 2020,” the group said in a Dec. 1 note.      MSC said it would levy a bunker recovery charge from Jan. 1, 2019 “as a result of the regulatory changes we all support”. The privately-owned group has a fleet of 510 vessels with a total capacity of 3.3 million TEUs, which includes both owned and chartered vessels, an MSC spokesman said on Monday.  “Clearly, MSC will need to use a large amount of low-sulphur fuels to propel the fleet, in order to meet the 2020 low-sulphur cap,” the spokesman said.  “At the same time, a significant portion of MSC’s owned ships will be equipped with exhaust gas cleaning systems. For a shipping line of our size, with a global network, it makes sense to have a combination of these solutions.” In September, Denmark’s Maersk Line (MAERSKb.CO) - the world’s number one container shipping carrier - said it would introduce a new bunker adjustment factor surcharge from Jan. 1 2019. Maersk has said it expected extra fuel costs of at least $2 billion annually.      Apart from scrubbers and low sulphur fuel, shipping companies can also use LNG as an alternative marine fuel, although its usage is still at an early stage.

2018-12-03,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iran’s oil industry is on the frontline of the fight against “the enemy”, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh was quoted as saying on Monday, adding that Tehran would do its utmost to counter U.S.-led efforts to put economic pressure on the country. Zanganeh, in comments reported by SHANA, the oil ministry’s news agency, did not specify who he saw as the enemy but Iran is locked in confrontation with the United States, which has applied sanctions and has said that its goal is to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. “The oil, gas and petrochemical sectors are the frontline in the battle against the enemy,” Zanganeh said. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a multilateral nuclear deal with Iran in May and reimposed sanctions on Iran’s oil industry last month. The Iranian government’s most important role is to reduce the economic difficulties of ordinary Iranians brought about by American pressure, Zanganeh said. “The goal of America and its regional allies is, through exerting pressure and economic shortages, to say we have hit a dead end on the threshold of the 40th anniversary of the Islamic revolution,” Zanganeh said, according to SHANA.  He added: “We have a legal and religious duty to reduce the income pressure on the people.

2018-12-03,"KATOWICE, Poland (Reuters) - British broadcaster and environmentalist David Attenborough on Monday urged world leaders, meeting in Poland to agree ways to limit global warming, to get on and tackle “our greatest threat in thousands of years”. Known for countless nature films, Attenborough has gained prominence recently with his “Blue Planet II” series, which highlighted the devastating effect of pollution on the oceans. “Leaders of the world, you must lead,” said the naturalist, given a “People’s seat” at the two-week U.N. climate conference in the Polish coal city of Katowice alongside two dozen heads of state and government. “The continuation of our civilisations and the natural world upon which we depend, is in your hands,” he said. The world is currently on course to overshoot by far the limits for global warming agreed in the landmark 2015 Paris accord on climate change, which were intended to prevent more extreme weather, rising sea levels and the loss of plant and animal species. The Katowice talks are billed as the most important U.N. conference since Paris, coming ahead of an end-of-year deadline to agree a “rule book” on enforcing action. Yet political and U.N. leaders have been struggling to inject urgency into two weeks of haggling on how to move on from fossil fuels to give practical effect to the Paris accord. Representatives of some of the most powerful countries and biggest polluters were conspicuous by their absence, and the United States is quitting the U.N. climate process. To maximise the chances of success in Poland, technical talks began on Sunday, a day early, with delegates from nearly 200 nations debating how to meet the Paris target of limiting global warming to between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees Celsius (2.7 and 3.6 Fahrenheit).  Michal Kurtyka, Poland’s deputy environment minister and president of the talks, said that without success in Katowice, Paris would not be a success, as it had only decided what was needed, not how it could be done. Moreover, the wider political environment had changed. “The wave of optimism and global cooperation that carried us to and through Paris has now crested, broken and is now tumbling,” he told delegates. He nevertheless took heart from a G20 statement at the weekend when the leading industrialised nations - except the United States - reaffirmed their commitment to implementing the Paris deal. A series of reports in the run-up to the Katowice conference have made clear the widening gap between high-level rhetoric and actual work to cut emissions, which have continued to rise. “It is hard to overstate the urgency of our situation,” U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres said. “Climate change is running faster than we are and we must catch up sooner rather than later before it is too late.” Attenborough told the delegates: “Right now, we are facing a man-made disaster of global scale. Our greatest threat in thousands of years. Climate Change.” Yet expectations for Katowice are low. The host nation Poland is committed to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels. It is calling for a “just transition” to provide help for communities dependent on fossil fuels. Riots in Paris at the weekend, partly in protest at fuel taxes, also illustrate the conundrum: how do politicians introduce long-term environmental policies without inflicting costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election? To contain warming at 1.5C, man-made global net carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will need to fall by about 45 percent by 2030 from 2010 levels and reach “net zero” by mid-century, according to the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Delegates at the talks said sticking points were likely to include finance and the level of scrutiny associated with monitoring individual nations’ emissions. The U.N. has a goal of raising $100 billion every year from 2020 for climate action. To inject momentum, the World Bank Group on Monday said it would provide a further $200 billion over five years from the start of the next decade.

2018-12-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund managers had largely completed the recent wave of selling in crude oil futures and options by the middle of last week but there were heavy sales of derivatives linked to middle distillates. Hedge funds and other money managers were net sellers of 41 million barrels in the six most important futures and options contracts linked to petroleum prices in the week to Nov. 27. (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Rxg24a) Funds have been net sellers of 649 million barrels in the last nine weeks, the largest reduction over a comparable period since at least 2013, when the current data series began. But there were clear signs the wave of selling was ending, at least in crude, with combined sales in Brent and WTI of just 12 million barrels last week, the lowest weekly total since September. Portfolio managers sold 14 million barrels of Brent, but for the second week running they bought NYMEX and ICE WTI, boosting holdings by 2 million barrels. Managers who shorted NYMEX WTI between late August and early November covered some open positions, with shorts down to 78 million barrels from a recent peak of 94 million on Nov. 13. As the selling pressure has eased, oil prices have stabilised, suggesting the market may have found a temporary floor around $50 for WTI and $60 for Brent. But there were continued heavy sales of futures and options contracts linked to middle distillates such as gasoil and diesel, in a worrying sign for the global economy. Portfolio managers were net sellers of 10 million barrels of U.S. heating oil and 19 million barrels of European gasoil in the week to Nov. 27. Net length in U.S. heating oil has been cut to just 15 million barrels from a recent high of 63 million barrels at the start of October, while net length in European gasoil has been cut to 50 million from 112 million. Middle distillates, which are mostly consumed in freight transportation, manufacturing, mining and farming, are normally the tightest part of the oil market at this late stage of the economic cycle. Distillate supplies were expected to become especially tight this time with the introduction of new regulations that will force many ship owners to switch from heavy fuel oil to cleaner distillate fuel oil from the start of 2020. But concerns about distillate availability have evaporated in recent weeks - which may reflect greater confidence about the smooth introduction of the new rules but could also reflect fears about a global economic slowdown.

2018-12-03,"* Germany’s DAX up 2.5 pct * Wall Street futures up as much as 2 pct * Emerging equities rise two pct, set for strongest day in a month * Dollar last down 0.2 pct, pulls back from low of 0.4 pct * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Updates throughout, adds quotes, adds chart) By Virginia Furness LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - A truce between U.S. and Chinese leaders on trade tariffs boosted global markets on Monday, fuelling an advance of nearly one percent by world stocks, setting up gains on Wall Street and pushing emerging-market currencies higher against the dollar. Equity futures showed all three New York indexes set for a strong session, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq seen opening 2.3 percent higher while futures for Dow Jones and S&P500 rose 1.6 to 1.9 percent  . European benchmarks rallied almost across the board. Germany’s DAX - the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - led the way with a 2.5 percent rise to its highest since Nov. 14. The gains came after China and the United States agreed at the weekend to halt additional tariffs. The deal should keep their trade war from escalating as they try to bridge differences with talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. U.S. President Donald Trump also said “China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40 percent”. That helped boost European autos more than 4 percent. The trade truce was the latest “circuit breaker” needed to trigger a return to risk appetite, said Guillermo Felices, head of research and strategy in the Multi-Asset, Quantitative and Solutions team at BNP Paribas Asset Management, “The first was markets pricing in a more dovish Fed, the second, more aggressive policy stimulus by the Chinese authorities and the third, easing trade tensions,” he said. Felices cautioned, however, that negotiations had reached a “ceasefire” rather than lasting peace. “China can deliver on the easy things like buying more agriculture as they need those goods, but when you go into the territory of intellectual property, and industrial and technology policy, you are clashing with China’s long-term aims,” he said. MSCI’s all-country world index climbed 0.8 percent in its sixth straight day of gains and hit its highest since Nov. 9. Emerging-market equities rose two percent and were set for their strongest day in a month. Asian shares kicked off the rally, with Chinese markets rising more than 2.5 percent and Japan’s Nikkei soaring to six-week highs. The risk-on mood saw MSCI’s index of emerging-market currencies rise 0.7 percent, led by China’s yuan, which saw its biggest daily gain since Februeary 2016 . However, the dollar started to recover after slumping as much as half a percent earlier against a basket of currencies . By 1145 GMT, it was just 0.2 percent lower, knocking the euro off the day’s highs. Sterling, meanwhile, dropped as Brexit nerves returned. Against the dollar, the pound fell to its lowest since October at $1.2708, down nearly 0.7 percent from the day’s highs. Against the euro, it slipped 0.3 percent to 89.05 pence. “Until the British parliament votes on the deal next week, we are going to see a steady drumbeat of Brexit headlines, which is going to keep the pound weak,” Danske Bank strategist Morten Helt said, referring to a Dec. 11 lawmakers’ vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s agreement on leaving the European Union. However, the dollar has already come under some pressure from a recent shift by the U.S. Federal Reserve to a slightly more dovish stance. Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate increases. Powell was scheduled to testify later this week to a congressional Joint Economic Committee. The latest market rally would not bring a return to a more hawkish Fed stance, Berenberg economist Florian Hense said. “We would need to see some rebound in economic activity to lift expectations of more rate hikes,” Hense said. U.S. Treasury yields pulled back from Friday’s over-two-month lows. Ten-year yields traded around 3.03 percent . Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, initially rose four basis points to 0.347 percent , but eased back to 0.32 percent. Yields on riskier southern European bonds were down across the board, though Italian bonds trimmed some gains after the European Central Bank revealed Italy’s share of ECB capital would be cut slightly. Ten-year yields stayed close to two-month lows, however . Elsewhere, oil soared more than five percent after posting its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand.

2018-12-03,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Perhaps the most interesting thing to try and calculate after the seeming trade ceasefire between the United States and China is the level of cynicism that will greet the new detente. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to halt imposing additional tariffs on each other’s imports while they try to reach a deal to end their trade dispute within 90 days. The agreement, reached at a meeting between the two leaders at the weekend G20 summit in Buenos Aires, certainly appears to be a de-escalation of trade tensions. And it does provide yet another opportunity for some sort of lasting deal. However, it also appears long on rhetoric and short on substance - largely in keeping with much of Trump’s pattern of dealing with foreign trade policies. The mercurial U.S. leader was effusive on the meeting with Xi, telling reporters on Air Force One that China has agreed to immediately buy “tremendous amounts of agricultural and other product” and this will have an “incredibly positive impact on farming”. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, was somewhat more circumspect in its reporting of the meeting. It didn’t mention the 90-day deadline, nor any agreement to step up agricultural or other commodity imports. Instead, Xinhua stressed the two leaders had agreed not to escalate the tariff war and to “take immediate efforts to address issues of mutual concern based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit”. The more sceptical and jaded of observers may conclude that it seemed Trump and China were once again talking past each other, and in 90 days time Washington and Beijing will find themselves more or less back where they are now. Still, the market could take a positive view of the development. Certainly crude oil’s initial reaction was bullish, with Brent rising as high as $61.22 a barrel in early Asian trade on Monday, up 4.3 percent from the close on Nov. 30. However, there will be some interesting concrete signals within that period. Perhaps the most obvious impact of the trade dispute so far has been China’s decision to almost totally cut out imports of U.S. soybeans and energy commodities such as crude oil, coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). There is something of an irony in this. One of Trump’s stated aims was reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, but the dispute has widened it, partly because China stopped buying commodities. China’s imports of U.S. commodities had shown strong growth prior to the imposition of tariffs in the middle of this year. Imports of U.S. crude peaked in June this year, when almost 14 million barrels, or about 466,000 barrels per day (bpd), arrived. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States - about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. But this dropped to zero in October, and in November one cargo of U.S. crude was discharged, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. No cargoes are currently booked to arrive in December, or beyond, according to the data. Similar to crude, no U.S. cargoes of LNG - which is subject to Chinese tariffs - arrived in China in October, although two were discharged in November. However, no cargoes are slated for arrival in December or beyond. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. China imported zero U.S. coal - subject to tariffs - in October, two cargoes totalling about 211,000 tonnes in November, and none are scheduled to arrive in December or January. In the first nine months of the year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, the majority of this being higher-value metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. China’s imports of U.S. soybeans fell to just 66,955 tonnes in October, down from 1.33 million tonnes for the same month in 2017. While these have collapsed since May, imports from Brazil have been ramped up to well above 2017 levels. However, China has in the past boosted its purchases of U.S. soybeans in the fourth and first quarters of each year - this is when the U.S. crop is ready and Brazil’s has yet to be harvested. What this means in terms of the Trump-Xi meeting at the G20 is that it’s going to be apparent fairly quickly if China is going to switch tactics and resume buying U.S. commodities. It will be relatively simple for China’s buyers of crude oil, LNG, coal and soybeans to re-enter the market and fix cargoes from the United States. It will still take several months for cargoes to reach China and show up in import figures, but the ship-tracking and port data should show quite quickly if cargoes are being arranged. Given the seeming gap in the expectations of Washington and Beijing, the track record of Trump in flip-flopping his positions and the Chinese need to preserve “face” in any eventual deal, the safest option is probably to be sceptical about the real-world implications of the G20 meeting.

2018-12-03,"(Reuters) - Champions of coal say the superabundant fossil fuel can be made environmentally friendlier by refining it with chemicals – a “clean coal” technology backed by a billion dollars in U.S. government tax subsidies annually. But refined coal has a dirty secret. It regularly fails to deliver on its environmental promises, as electric giant Duke Energy Corp found. Duke began using refined coal at two of its North Carolina power plants in August 2012. The decision let the company tap a lucrative federal subsidy designed to help the American coal industry reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides – also known as NOx, the main contributor to smog and acid rain – along with other pollutants. In nearly three years of burning the treated coal, the Duke power plants collected several million dollars in federal subsidies. But the plants also pumped out more NOx, not less, according to data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency analysed by Reuters. The NOx emission rate at Duke’s Marshall Steam Station power plant in Sherrills Ford, North Carolina, for example, was between 33 percent and 76 percent higher in the three years from 2012 to 2014 than in 2011, the year before Marshall started burning refined coal, the EPA data shows. The utility also discovered that one of the chemicals used to refine the coal, calcium bromide, had reached a nearby river and lakes – raising levels of carcinogens in the water supply for more than a million people in greater Charlotte.Duke stopped using refined coal at the plants in May 2015 because of the water pollution problems, said spokeswoman Erin Culbert. Bromide levels in the region’s drinking water dropped sharply several months later, said Barry Gullett, the city’s water director, in a 2015 memo. Duke’s experience reflects a fundamental problem with the U.S. clean coal incentive programme, a Reuters examination has found. Refined coal shows few signs of reducing NOx emissions as lawmakers intended, according to regulatory documents, a Reuters analysis of EPA emissions data, and interviews with power plant owners, scientists and state environmental regulators. Consumption figures compiled by the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that American power plants are on track to burn about 160 million tons of clean coal in 2018 – a fifth of the U.S. coal market. That amount would generate about $1.1 billion in incentives at the current tax credit amount of $7.03 per ton. But most of the plants receiving the subsidy failed to reduce NOx emissions by 20 percent – the threshold required under the policy – in 2017 compared to 2009, the last year before they started burning refined coal, according to a Reuters analysis of EPA data on power plant emissions. Reuters identified 56 plants that burned refined coal in 2017 using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and disclosures from energy companies and refined-coal developers. Only 18 of that group reduced NOx emissions by more than 20 percent in 2017 compared to 2009. And 15 of those 18 only reported the improvements after installing or upgrading pollution control equipment or switching a portion of power production to cleaner-burning fuel, complicating the question of whether their pollution reductions are attributable to refined coal. At 22 of the 56 plants, NOx emissions were higher in 2017 while burning refined coal than they were when using raw coal in 2009. As a group, the fleet of U.S. power plants that burn refined coal also underperformed the rest of the industry in cutting emissions of NOx, the Reuters analysis found. NOx emissions rates declined 19 percent among the 56 power plants that reported burning refined coal in 2017. That compares with a 29 percent reduction by 214 other coal-fired power plants over the same period. The analysis included U.S. coal-fired power plants with at least 100 tons in annual NOx emissions in 2017. Investors in plants that failed to show substantial NOx emission cuts collected the tax credit anyway because the Internal Revenue Service allows them to prove emissions reductions with laboratory tests. The results of those tests – conducted for several hours a couple of times a year – often do not translate to real-world improvements at plants that burn millions of tons of coal annually. The IRS, which approves applications for the tax credit, declined to comment on the design or effectiveness of the testing regimen. “It’s hard to hang your hat on refined coal as the way to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions,” said Ron Sahu, an environmental engineer who has consulted with utility companies, the EPA and the U.S. Justice Department on power plant emissions.  Sahu, who reviewed the data and methodology used by Reuters, said the analysis shows refined coal has little to no impact in reducing NOx emissions at actual power plants. “It’s clear that any benefit from refined coal can easily be overwhelmed by modest changes in combustion conditions” at power plants, Sahu said. “It’s debatable that a tax credit should be given for NOx reduction.” Reuters sent its analysis of EPA emissions data to every major utility operating power plants that burn clean coal, along with the leading U.S. investors who finance clean coal facilities in partnerships designed to take advantage of the subsidy. Most companies declined to comment or did not respond. The handful that did respond did not contest the findings of the analysis. “We do agree with the overall assessment that emission controls have a more measurable impact on emissions reductions over refined coal,” DTE Energy, a Detroit-based utility that uses refined coal, told Reuters. The Edison Electric Institute, which represents the U.S. electric utility industry, did not respond to requests for comment. The law requires all refined coal producers seeking the subsidy to show that burning their product can lead to a 20 percent cut in NOx emissions. The producers also must show a 40 percent reduction in either mercury or sulphur dioxide. They are given the choice of which of those two pollutants to target. Refined coal investors tend to target mercury as the second pollutant for cuts, according to disclosures by the corporations involved in the programme. That’s because reducing mercury emissions with refined coal is a cost-effective way for plants to comply with other, relatively new EPA regulations governing the pollutant. Utilities already have spent tens of billions of dollars on equipment to filter out sulphur dioxide, making additional reductions of that gas more difficult. The subsidy programme has been more successful at combating mercury than NOx, the analysis found. The mercury emission rate at power plants burning refined coal product, for example, fell 75 percent between 2009 and 2017, more than the 40 percent cut required to qualify for the subsidy. Some of those cuts can also be attributed to other pollution control measures, such as the installation of scrubbers that filter coal plant exhaust, according to the EPA. High exposure to mercury can damage the intestines, kidney and nervous system, according to the EPA. Sulphur dioxide and NOx can cause lung damage. The refined coal subsidy was adopted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, alongside credits for generating renewable energy from solar and wind. The legislation had broad bipartisan support and generated little public debate. The subsidy is set to expire in 2021, and coal-state lawmakers, including North Dakota Republican Congressman Kevin Cramer, are moving to extend it for another decade. “The tax-credit programme is bridging the divide to make coal clean and beautiful,” said Cramer, borrowing President Donald Trump’s two favourite adjectives to describe coal. Trump has promised to advance the interests of the coal industry to support blue-collar energy jobs. His administration has argued coal provides a more reliable fuel for power generation than natural gas, solar and wind, which can be more easily interrupted by pipeline problems or uncooperative weather. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. In one of the industry’s first refined coal ventures, power plant operator Associated Electric Cooperative Inc in 2010 signed a 10-year deal with affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group Inc to burn refined coal at the New Madrid and Thomas Hill power plants in Missouri. As a tax credit investor, Goldman worked with Advanced Emissions Solutions Inc to build refined coal facilities next to the cooperative’s power plants. A refined coal operation typically costs about $6 million to develop, featuring new conveyor belts and sprayers to move and treat the coal with chemicals, according to presentations to investors by Advanced Emissions. Silos also are installed to store the refined coal chemicals. The deal called for the utility to sell raw coal to the Goldman-led investment group at cost, and then buy it back at a discount after it was treated, saving the utility millions of dollars, disclosures show.  Goldman and its investment partners collected about $63 million in gross tax credits from the program in 2017, based on an estimate in Associated’s annual report that its plants used 9 million tons of coal that year. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Associated had no upfront cost for the refined coal facility and contributes nothing to its annual operating costs. It forecast the arrangement would bring in $7 million to $9 million in annual revenue through at least 2018. “The project at first was questioned as simply too good to be true,” the utility wrote in its 50th anniversary report released in 2011. The money-making deal also illustrates how the potential benefits of refined coal on air quality can be erased by a variety of complex factors. The New Madrid plant in southeast Missouri, for example, has seen its production of NOx soar to a higher rate than any other U.S. coal plant while burning refined coal. In 2017, the plant’s NOx emission rate was 298 percent higher than it recorded in 2009, before New Madrid started burning clean coal, according to the EPA. During the first quarter of 2018, the rate jumped even further, to seven times the 2009 level. Associated Electric said the increase in NOx emissions at New Madrid was due in part to the cooperative’s purchasing tradable pollution credits through the U.S. cap-and-trade system. The market-based system sets an overall limit on pollution, and allows power plants that cut their pollution to earn credits that can be stockpiled or sold to other polluters. When large volumes of credits are generated, the cost of buying them can be lower than the cost of running pollution control equipment. “At times during the last seven years Associated has met compliance with emissions rules by purchasing NOx credits from the cap-and-trade markets, rather than running the control equipment all year,” the electric cooperative said in a statement, which it issued through Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally. The National Mining Association, which represents the U.S. coal industry, supports extending the tax credit. It said the cap-and-trade system was the primary reason NOx emissions went up at many power plants in the Reuters analysis. The association said clean coal lowers emissions, but provided no data to support the claim. Duke Energy said in a statement that routine changes in electricity demand can also make clean coal ineffective in reducing NOx by changing boiler temperatures and catalyst conditions in pollution control devices. Sahu, the environmental consultant, said refined coal is most effective at reducing NOx emissions when a utility burns the fuel at a relatively low temperature, something that typically occurs when electricity demands on the plant are low. But using low temperatures over an extended period can also damage power plant boilers by causing corrosion and soot buildup, he said. Conversely, burning the coal at a relatively high temperature – more common during high-demand periods – can reduce the risk of damage but limit the effectiveness of smog reductions. The Grand River Dam Authority stopped burning refined coal at its Oklahoma power plant last year because corrosion and other problems outweighed any upside, said John Wiscaver, head of GRDA’s corporate communications. “We had too many problems with refined coal,” he said. Refined coal has also led to contamination of water supplies for more than a million people, according to regulators and utility officials. In 2012, the South Carolina Department of Health & Environmental Control noticed elevated levels of bromides, the chemicals used to treat refined coal, in the Santee Cooper-Lake Moultrie public water system, said Tommy Crosby, a spokesman for the agency. The South Carolina plant’s refined coal operation stopped spraying bromide on the coal burned at the Cross Generating Station out of concern for the elevated levels of cancer-causing trihalomethanes, Crosby said, and the levels decreased within six months. Trihalomethanes are created when bromide mixes with the chlorine in treated drinking water. The plant’s refined coal facility was financed by global insurance firm AJ Gallagher, Boston-based mutual fund giant Fidelity and a U.S. subsidiary of France’s Schneider Electric SE. Fidelity declined to comment on the elevated TTHM levels and pointed out that federal limits were not exceeded. Schneider Electric and AJ Gallagher declined to comment. The North Carolina town of Mooresville, downstream of Duke’s Marshall power plant, saw its trihalomethanes surge as high as 127 parts per billion at times in 2015, after the facility discharged bromide used to treat coal into a nearby lake, according to the town’s drinking water quality report. That did not trigger a violation of federal clean water rules because the town’s annual average of 54 parts per billion that year was below the maximum trihalomethane contaminant level of 80 parts per billion. The same was true of the South Carolina plant, where trihalomethane levels in 2012 rose to 67 parts per billion. Over the past decade, however, many studies have shown that exposure to trihalomethanes at much lower levels than the federal limit raises the risk of cancer and of problems during pregnancy. Some people who drink water containing TTHMs in excess of the maximum standard over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer, according to the EPA. In 2016, the EPA included bromide in the Safe Water Drinking Act as an unregulated contaminant to be monitored by public water systems. Research by Jeanne VanBriesen, director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Center for Water Quality in Urban Environmental Systems, found that bromide additives used to reduce mercury could significantly boost trihalomethanes in drinking water supplies downstream of coal plants. Her 2017 study focussed on 22 drinking water systems serving 2.5 million people in Pennsylvania. Once Duke Energy halted refined coal operations at the North Carolina plant, bromide dropped about 75 percent in the nearby Catawba River, Zachary Hall, director of environmental science at Duke, said in a February 2017 deposition given to the Southern Environmental Law Center. Duke officials concede that bromide applications contributed to the elevated trihalomethane levels. “While bromides from our facilities were not the sole cause,” Duke’s Culbert said, “we felt it was important to partner with downstream water utilities and suspend the programme.” Reporting by Tim McLaughlin; Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-coal-pollution/special-report-u-s-clean-coal-program-fails-to-deliver-on-smog-cuts-idUKL2N1Y5154,03 Dec 2018,"Champions of coal say the superabundant

2018-12-03,"(Repeats with no change in text) By Julie Gordon Dec 2 (Reuters) - Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said on Sunday that the Western Canadian province would mandate temporary oil output cuts to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to a glut of crude in storage and driven down Canadian crude prices. The production caps are the latest effort by the province’s left-leaning New Democratic Party government to deal with historically low crude prices that are hurting producers and dragging on government revenues. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend crude typically trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark, with the lower price reflecting the cost of transport and the quality of the product. The discount has typically been around $15, but has widened in the past few months to trade at $40 to $50 below WTI, hitting a record at $52.50 below WTI in October, according to data from Shorcan. Crude production in Alberta’s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity, creating a bottleneck and leading to a buildup of product in storage. More crude is now moving across the border by rail and by truck, but it is not enough to clear the glut. The stranded barrels are putting pressure on prices. Adding to the woes, refinery maintenance has taken some buyers temporarily offline. The steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the Canadian economy by some estimates. New pipeline capacity is Alberta’s preferred solution, but projects face fierce opposition from environmentalists and some Aboriginal groups. Construction is under way on Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline replacement, from Alberta to the United States, with the project expected to be in service by the end of 2019. TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL pipeline, from Alberta to the United States, is facing a supplementary environmental assessment after a federal judge in Montana halted construction last month. The impact on timing remains unclear. The near tripling of capacity on the Trans Mountain pipeline, from Alberta to a port in the Vancouver area, is undergoing a new regulatory review. It is unclear when construction on the federal government-owned pipeline will begin. Crude by rail has ramped up sharply this year, hitting nearly 270,000 bpd in September. Alberta said last week that it would buy locomotives and rail cars to add an additional 120,000 bpd of crude by rail capacity. It expects the first trains to be running by December 2019, with all online by August 2020. Crude by rail will narrow the differential, but not as much as pipelines. The most effective short-term solution is production cuts, but they are not universally popular with producers. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy Inc have voluntarily curtailed production in recent weeks. But other majors like Suncor Energy Inc and Husky Energy Inc , which have refineries and are therefore sheltered from the worst of the price impact, do not want to cut output. Dealing with the low crude prices is essential for Notley, who faces an election no later than the end of May 2019. Her party faces a tough challenge from the United Conservative Party, led by Jason Kenney, a former Cabinet Minister with the federal Conservatives.

2018-12-03,"* Eskom cuts power for five days in a row * Utility battling coal shortages, plant breakdowns * Economists expect power cuts to hit economic growth By Olivia Kumwenda-Mtambo JOHANNESBURG, Dec 3 (Reuters) - South Africa faces more power cuts, electricity utility Eskom warned on Monday as it sought to prevent the collapse of its power grid in a test for President Cyril Ramaphosa’s reforms. Eskom implemented a fifth day of controlled power cuts on Monday, putting more strain on an economy already mired in recession only months before a national election. “The entire week could be severely constrained if we are unable to replenish the diesel and water reserves, and reduce the high unplanned outages,” Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said. Eskom, which is battling a severe financial crisis, coal shortages and breakdowns of its power plants, said it would cut up to 2,000 megawatts of power from the grid on Monday. The utility, which last week called for a bailout or debt relief, began the controlled cuts, known as load-shedding, on Thursday as demand for power outstripped available capacity. “Eskom teams are working hard to salvage the situation but the process is going to be hard, long and costly,” Phasiwe said. Ramaphosa has made reforming Eskom a priority, but he has been hampered by fiscal constraints in a blow to his plan to woo investors who can help grow the economy ahead of an election likely to be held in May next year. nL8N1X61GL] “Eskom as an institution and its ability to provide stable power supply is the single biggest risk to @CyrilRamaphosa’s investment drive and the South Africa fiscus,” Isaah Mhlanga, executive chief economist at Alexander Forbes Investments said on Twitter. BNP Paribas South Africa senior economist Jeff Schultz said prolonged power cuts would likely hurt economic growth in the first quarter of 2019, although a slowdown in manufacturing over the Christmas period will buy Eskom some time. “But come mid-January, if we are still facing load-shedding, that is when it is going to be a much more pressing issue for the economy,” Schultz said. South Africa entered recession in the second quarter for the first time since 2009. Third-quarter gross domestic product numbers are due out on Tuesday, with analysts polled by Reuters predicting quarter-on-quarter GDP growth of 1.6 percent.

2018-12-03,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 3 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The World Bank will give equal weight to curbing emissions and helping poor countries deal with the “disastrous effects” of a warming world as it steps up investments to tackle climate change in the first half of the 2020s, it said on Monday. The bank and its two sister organisations plan to double their investments in climate action to about $200 billion from 2021-2025, with a boost in support for efforts to adapt to higher temperatures, wilder weather and rising seas. The latest figures on climate funding for developing countries show barely a quarter has been going to adaptation, with the bulk backing adoption of clean energy and more efficient energy use, aimed at cutting planet-warming emissions. “We must fight the causes, but also adapt to the consequences that are often most dramatic for the world’s poorest people,” said World Bank CEO Kristalina Georgieva, as leaders flagged rising needs at U.N. climate talks in Poland. Of the $100 billion the World Bank plans to make available in the five years from mid-2020, half would go to adaptation measures, it said. Those include building more robust homes, schools and infrastructure, preparing farmers for climate shifts, managing water wisely and protecting people’s incomes through social safety nets, Georgieva added. The World Bank said the money would also improve weather forecasts, and provide early warning and climate information services for 250 million people in 30 developing countries. “Climate change is an existential threat to the world’s poorest and most vulnerable. These new targets demonstrate how seriously we are taking this issue,” World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said in a statement. From 2014-2018, the World Bank spent nearly $21 billion on adaptation, which accounted for just over 40 percent of the climate benefits generated by the institution’s funding overall. Former U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the bank’s pledge to use half its climate finance to find solutions to deal with changing weather patterns was “important”. “Climate change is already having a disastrous impact on people right around the world and we are nearing the point of no return,” said Ban. “So we must take bold action to adapt to the reality of the threat facing us all.” A recently launched Global Commission on Adaptation, which Ban chairs with Georgieva and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, aims to put political muscle behind efforts to keep people safer in a hotter world. The remaining $100 billion in promised World Bank Group funding will come from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which works with the private sector, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, as well as private capital the group raises. “There are literally trillions of dollars of opportunities for the private sector to invest in projects that will help save the planet,” said IFC chief Philippe Le Houérou. The IFC will identify opportunities, use tools to make investments less risky, and attract private-sector cash in areas including renewable energy, green buildings, clean transport in cities and urban waste management, he added. Marshall Islands President Hilda Heine said her low-lying Pacific island state was struggling fiercer storms and increasing seawater flooding that is contaminating fresh water with salt. The new World Bank funds would “help to build resilience, make us safer, and improve lives”, she said. ""Global action needs to accelerate before it is too late,"" she added.

2018-12-03,"LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - French stocks sensitive to the economy and to tourism fell in an otherwise buoyant market on Monday after the worst riots in decades swept Paris, stirring concerns about the possible damage from visitors steering clear of the capital.  Supermarket Carrefour (CARR.PA) and highway operator Vinci (SGEF.PA) were the worst-performing, down 2.1 and 2.6 percent respectively. Shares in hotel chain Accor (ACCP.PA) and airline Air France (AIRF.PA) fell by 1.6 and 2.7 percent.  Nationwide protests against fuel taxes and living costs, known as the “yellow vest” movement after fluorescent jackets kept in all vehicles in France, escalated on Saturday as rioters ran amok across central Paris, torching cars and looting shops. Investors and traders connected the stock falls to investors’ unease over the potential impact riots could have on the economy and on tourists’ appetite to visit the capital. “Accor is falling, and it is fair to say that investors are wondering if there will be cancellations at their hotels,” said Jerome Schupp, a fund manager at Geneva-based firm Prime Partners. “It’s not good to see those images of a major capital,” said a trader. “It could hurt the economy.” Highway operator Vinci Autoroutes said the “yellow vest” protests were continuing to have a major impact, although it did not specify any figures in a press release on Monday morning.

European share benchmarks opened sharply higher, with Germany’s DAX - the most sensitive to China and trade war fears - leading the way with a 2.5 percent rise to its highest level since Nov. 14, and Wall Street too was set for a stronger session. The gains came after China and the United States agreed at the weekend to halt additional tariffs on each other. The deal prevents their trade war escalating as the two sides try to bridge differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. U.S. President Donald Trump also said “China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40 percent”. That helped boost European autos more than 4 percent. “We have a deal. That’s wonderful news for global financial markets and signalling the start for a year-end rally in risky assets,” said Bernd Berg global macro strategist at Woodman Asset Management. “We are going to see a rally in emerging market and U.S equities, EM currencies and China-related assets like Australia. I expect the rally to last until year-end.” MSCI’s all-country world index climbed 0.9 percent in its sixth straight day of gains and hit its highest level since Nov. 9. Emerging equities rose 2.1 percent and were set for their strongest day in a month. Asian shares kicked off the gains, with Chinese mainland markets  rising more than 2.5 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained as much as 1.3 percent to a six-week high. The risk-on mood drove the U.S. dollar 0.4 percent lower against a basket of currencies while against the euro it slumped 0.6 percent. The greenback has already come under some pressure from the recent subtle shift in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s policy communication to a slightly more dovish stance. Comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes. Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee but his hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday. Florian Hense, economist at Berenberg, said the market rally would not bring a return to a more hawkish Fed stance. “We would need to see some rebound in economic activity to lift expectations of more rate hikes,” he said. The Powell comments had sent U.S. Treasury yields lower but they pulled back from the over two-month lows hit on Friday as 10-year yields rose three basis points to 3.04 percent . Germany’s 10-year government bond, the benchmark for the euro area, was set for its biggest one-day yield jump in a month, rising four basis points to a high of 0.347 percent . Yields on riskier southern European bonds fell across the board, with Italian yields down around 10 bps to new two-month lows.,. Emerging currencies were among the main beneficiaries of dollar weakness, with an MSCI index up 0.6 percent . It was led by China’s yuan which rose one percent for its biggest daily gain since Feb. 2016. “Such positive sentiment won’t fade very soon ... (the 90-day) period is not short, it’s long enough to soothe market sentiment,” said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. Elsewhere, oil soared more than five percent, a positive start after it had posted its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand.

2018-12-03,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Albert Frere, a veteran dealmaker whose impeccable business timing made him Belgium’s richest man, died on Monday at the age of 92, the firm he built, Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), said. Frere had stepped down as a director of GBL and GBL’s Swiss-based shareholder Pargesa three years ago, though he remained one of the controlling shareholders of the group run since 2012 by his son-in-law, Ian Gallienne, who is co-CEO. Frere attained international prominence in the early 1980s, helping divest some of nationalized French bank Paribas’ foreign assets and setting up Pargesa with Canadian businessman Paul Desmarais, who died in 2013. Both speaking native French with non-French accents, the pair forged a bond working together on Paribas. “I guess the French asked themselves: ‘Who are those weirdos?’” Frere said in a rare newspaper interview in 2010. With Pargesa’s backing, Frere took control of GBL in 1982. It survived the collapse in 1990 of its U.S. investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert amid a scandal over its promotion of highly leveraged buyouts and “junk bonds”. His career started when he inherited his family business, trading in nails, and set out to acquire a string of steel businesses around his home city of Charleroi after World War Two. He left school to run the business aged 17. “Albert Frere, honorary chairman and co-controlling shareholder of the company, passed away today,” GBL said in a statement on its website on Monday. “For more than three decades, under his leadership, GBL became one of the largest holdings in Europe. His professional and human qualities have deeply marked our group.” Through the group, Frere held significant stakes in some of Europe’s biggest companies, including Adidas (ADSGn.DE), Pernod Ricard (PERP.PA), LafargeHolcim(LHN.S) and Total (TOTF.PA). Often Frere played a role as a consolidator, where he traded a large stake in a smaller company against a small stake in a larger company. This was the case in the sale of Belgian energy company PetroFina to Total, media group RTL to Bertelsmann, or in the giant cement merger between Lafarge and Holcim. Together with Bernard Arnaud of France’s LVMH luxury group, Frere, who was made a baron by the Belgian king, owned acclaimed French wine estate Chateau Cheval Blanc in Saint-Emilion near Bordeaux. But he himself never moved far from his birthplace near Charleroi, at the heart of Belgium’s coal and steel belt.

2018-12-03,"LONDON (Reuters) - British power producer Drax Group Plc (DRX.L) has revised the terms of its deal to buy UK generation assets from Spain’s Iberdrola (IBE.MC) to ensure it gets a rebate on lost capacity payments due to a pause in a government scheme. In October, Drax agreed to buy some UK hydro and pumped storage power plants from Iberdrola’s Scottish Power for 702 million pounds as it aims to exit coal-based production before a 2025 government deadline. Last month, Britain had to halt a back-up power scheme called the capacity market to avoid electricity shortages pending a further investigation by European Union regulators. The scheme pays providers for making energy supplies available at short notice to avoid shortages that might occur as coal plants close and low prices dissuade investors from building new power plants.  Even though Drax believes that the European Commission will reapprove the existing capacity market in its current or  similar form, the pause has put payments to plants it is buying in the Iberdrola deal at risk. Therefore, it has agreed a risk-sharing scheme with the Spanish firm as a result which could mean it receives a payment of up to 26 million pounds. Under the revised terms, if less than 100 percent of capacity payments from Jan. 1-Sept. 30, 2019 are received and gross profit of the portfolio for the full year is less than 155 million pounds, Iberdrola will pay Drax up to 26 million pounds.  Similarly, if 2019 gross profit is more than 165 million plunds, Drax will make a payment to Iberdrola of up to 26 million pounds. When the deal was originally announced, Drax expected Scottish Power’s portfolio of assets to contribute 2019 gross profit of 155-175 million pounds.  For a graphic on Drax's Iberdrola deal high doused by EU ruling, see - tmsnrt.rs/2RtNkAV “The capacity market is a central pillar of the UK’s energy policy and ensures security of supply while minimising costs to consumers,” Will Gardiner, chief executive of Drax Group said in a statement. “To mitigate the risk that capacity payments take time to be restored, we have agreed revised terms which provide protection in 2019,” he added. The judgement by the EU’s General Court in October annulled a decision by the European Commission, which had said Britain’s capacity market was compatible with EU state aid rules. It could take a year or more for the capacity market to be reinstated, analysts say. Shares in Drax (DRX.L) rose as high as 397 pence after the news but receded slightly to 392 pence by 0925 GMT.

2018-12-03,"KATOWICE, Poland, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Political leaders on Monday began arriving in the Polish coal city of Katowice where two weeks of talks have begun to revive the landmark Paris 2015 deal on climate change as dire warnings mount about a lack of action. Representatives of some of the most powerful countries and biggest polluters will be conspicuous by their absence as the United States has said it is leaving the U.N. process and China was not expected to send its top politicians. To maximise the chances of success, technical talks began on Sunday, a day earlier than planned, with delegates from nearly 200 nations haggling over how to implement the broad promises of the Paris deal on moving away from fossil fuel. The talks in Katowice have been billed as the most important U.N. conference since the landmark Paris accord as they precede an end-of-year deadline to agree a “rule book” on how to enforce action to limit global warming to between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius. Expectations for the Polish talks are low: the atmosphere of political unity built in Paris has been shattered by a wave of populist governments that place national agendas before collective action. The host nation Poland remains committed to coal, the most polluting of fossil fuels, calling for a “just transition” to allow communities dependent on fossil fuel help in changing their lifestyle. The riots in Paris at the weekend, partly in protest at higher fuel taxes, also illustrate the conundrum: How do political leaders introduce policies that will do long-term good for the environment without inflicting extra costs on voters that may damage their chances of re-election? Delegates at the talks said the biggest issues were likely to include finance and the level of scrutiny associated with monitoring individual nations’ emissions. The U.N. has a goal to raise $100 billion every year from 2020 for climate action. To inject momentum, the World Bank Group on Monday said it would provide a further $200 billion over five years from the start of the next decade. Other attempts to inject urgency into the Polish talks will include an intervention from British broadcaster and environmentalist David Attenborough, as well as the roughly 25 heads of state and government who are attending the talks.

2018-12-03,"* Shell, investors make joint statement on targets * Shell to link short-term targets to executive pay * CEO van Beurden had called targets ‘foolhardy’ By Ron Bousso LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell caved in to growing investor pressure over climate change on Monday with plans to set short-term targets for reducing its carbon footprint. BP and Total have already set short-term targets, but Shell Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden had previously resisted setting hard goals, saying it would be “foolhardy” to expose Shell to legal challenges. But following discussions with investors, the Anglo-Dutch oil and gas giant said that from 2020 it will set three- to five-year targets every year which will include specific net carbon footprint targets. Shareholders had criticised Shell for last year setting long-term “ambitions” to halve its emissions of carbon dioxide by 2050, which lacked binding targets for implementation. Shell, which did not specify any targets on Monday, plans to link these targets and other measures to its executive remuneration policy. The revised remuneration policy will be put to shareholders for approval at its annual meeting in 2020. “We are taking important steps towards turning our Net Carbon Footprint ambition into reality by setting shorter-term targets,” Ben van Beurden said in a statement. The move comes as governments meet in Poland for a conference hosted by the United Nations COP24 which will lay out a “rule book” to implement a 2015 climate accord. The Paris agreement set goals to phase out fossil fuel use this century, shift towards cleaner energies and help limit a rise in temperatures. Shell signed a joint statement with a group of 310 investors with over $32 trillion of assets under management, dubbed Climate Action 100+, outlining the targets and review process. “When it comes to meeting the demands of the Paris Agreement on climate change, we believe it is necessary to strengthen partnerships between investors and their investee companies to accelerate progress towards reaching such an ambitious common goal,” Peter Ferket, Chief Investment Officer of Robeco said in the joint statement.

2018-12-03,"LONDON/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian sugar companies are increasing their capacity to produce ethanol in the face of depressed global sugar prices and government policies expected to boost demand for the biofuel. A shift to ethanol in the 2018-19 season slashed Brazil’s sugar output by 9 million tonnes to a 12-year low and more switching to the biofuel next season could help to wipe out a global surplus weighing on sugar prices. Brazil could also lose its crown as the world’s biggest sugar producer to India for the first time in 16 years, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. For Brazilian sugar cane processors, switching to ethanol has proved an attractive trade-off as the increased focus on the biofuel partly shielded mills from a plunge in global sugar prices in September to their lowest since 2008. Executives at major Brazilian sugar firms Biosev (BSEV3.SA) and Usina Coruripe www.usinacoruripe.com.br/en, as well as smaller producers such as Usina Batatais us.usinabatatais.com.br and Usina Cerradao www.usinacerradao.com.br, told Reuters they were now investing in more ethanol capacity ahead of next season. Biosev, for example, Brazil’s second largest cane processor, said it was installing distillation columns at two plants in the Mato Grosso do Sul cluster to give the mills the option of using 90 percent of their cane for ethanol, up from 50 percent now. In another sign the industry is making a longer-term bet on ethanol in step with Brazil's biofuels policy, JW www.jw.ind.br/en, a leading Brazilian ethanol equipment maker, told Reuters it has hired 200 people to cope with a surge in orders. Brazil first rolled out policies to use more biofuels in 1975 after OPEC’s supply embargo drove up oil prices. So-called flex-fuel cars that run on pure ethanol or a gasoline-ethanol blend now make up 80 percent of Brazil’s light vehicle fleet. In a new push, the government this year approved a program called RenovaBio that mandates fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell from 2020. Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy expects RenovaBio to push demand to 47.1 billion liters in 2028 from 26.7 billion in 2018, helping Brazil’s ethanol industry recover from years of competition with subsidized gasoline prices. ""Investments are only made looking into the long term,"" said Plinio Nastari, chief analyst at Brazilian consultancy Datagro www.datagro.com/?lang=en. ""Part of these investments are being made because of the establishment of these targets."" (For a graphic of Brazil's ethanol production click here tmsnrt.rs/2QeaG03) The global market could also offer opportunities for Brazilian ethanol producers as countries look for ways to reduce their carbon footprint, including China, which is rolling out the use of ethanol in fuel nationwide by 2020. This season, Brazilian mills earmarked 64 percent of cane to ethanol as domestic sales surged by some 40 percent due to high gasoline prices in Brazil, the world’s fourth largest consumer of transportation fuel. Many mills can already churn out sugar or ethanol, with some flexibility on the mix. The firms investing in distillation columns hope the reconfigurations will give them the scope to produce even more ethanol if prices remain attractive.  Besides Biosev, which is controlled by commodities trader Louis Dreyfus, Usina Coruripe, a top 10 Brazilian cane processor, said it plans to invest about 300 million reais ($79 million) to crush more cane and increase its ethanol capacity. “Our mix is still very high on sugar due to the configuration of the plants, but we are seeking to change that,” Chief Executive Mario Lorencatto told Reuters.  Usina Batatais, a company that can crush 7 million tonnes of cane per crop at its two mills, said changes it made last season at one of its plants in Sao Paulo state meant it could allocate as much as 80 percent to ethanol. “We almost doubled hydrous ethanol production from last year to this,” Luiz Gustavo Junqueira, innovation manager at Usina Batatais, told Reuters. While investments vary, a mid-sized mill can spend about 20 million reais to add a distillation column that boosts ethanol output by 40 million liters, said Willian Hernandes, partner at financial advisors FG/A www.fga.com.br/eng, which helps mills raise capital.  Hernandes said three firms could start expanding capacity as soon as this month ahead of the next sugar cane crop in April. Mills are also investing in storage tanks so they can hold onto ethanol and sell it when prices are higher, said Alexandre Figliolino, a former investment banker now advising sugar and ethanol companies. Brazil’s dramatic switch to ethanol this season slashed its sugar production by 20 percent and, if ethanol remains attractive next season, mills could allocate more cane to the biofuel. “With all the plans we have heard about, mills could probably take another 2 million tonnes of sugar out of the market next season,” Hernandes said.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the International Sugar Organization both expect India to eclipse Brazil in 2018-19 as the world’s largest sugar producer. Ethanol’s appeal over sugar is influenced by several factors including gasoline prices and the Brazilian currency, so it’s still uncertain how much cane will go to ethanol in 2019-20. ""With no RenovaBio in place yet, I'd say we're looking at the same old situation,"" said Eder Vieito, senior commodity analyst at Green Pool greenpoolcommodities.com. ""If the world needs sugar, sugar prices will move to a price level that ethanol can't match - without losing significant demand to gasoline."" A weakening in the real and crude oil has dragged down the price at which sugar is on a par with ethanol to just above 13 cents/lb, analysts estimate. But that’s still above sugar prices now of about 12.4 cents SBc1. “Prices are still sending to producers the signal to maintain a strong ethanol focus next year,” said Datagro’s Nastari said. However, dwindling sugar stocks in Brazil have supported domestic prices, which could spur a short-term increase in production. It is also unclear whether Brazil’s incoming president, Jair Bolsonaro, will maintain the policy of aligning domestic fuel prices with global prices. While it has improved the competitiveness of ethanol by removing price caps on gasoline, higher prices at the pump have angered many Brazilians. Sugar also holds an appeal for mills because producers can hedge returns with futures contracts - a mechanism that doesn’t yet exist for the domestic ethanol market, said John Stansfield, analyst and trader at Group Sopex. Outside Brazil, the ethanol market looks set to expand as well thanks to policies designed to lower emissions. Ethanol and sugar consultancy F.O. Licht expects global demand to rise at least 2 percent a year over the next decade. And while Brazilian ethanol often cannot compete with low-cost U.S. supplies, Brazil’s cane-based ethanol has a lower carbon footprint that could appeal to governments striving to meet Paris climate agreement commitments. Colombia, for example, is one of several countries changing biofuel policies to prioritize the use of varieties with a lower carbon footprint. Brazilian ethanol has begun trickling into the U.S. state of California this year because fuel distributors can earn more credits under the state’s decarbonization scheme. “In comparison to local biofuels such as corn ethanol, cane ethanol from Brazil has a much lower carbon footprint,” said F.O. Licht managing director Christoph Berg. “It’s therefore a relatively attractive fuel.” High tariffs still pose a barrier in many countries, including China where Brazilian ethanol is subject to a 30 percent duty, though analysts say trade tensions between Washington and Beijing could provide an opportunity.  “At the moment, it does not seem to be around the corner that China would reduce the import tariff on Brazilian ethanol,” Berg said. “But they would be competitive if the tariff is removed.” Reporting by Ana Ionova and Marcelo Teixeira; editing by David Clarke",https://uk.reuters.com/article/brazil-ethanol/insight-betting-on-ethanol-brazilian-mills-turn-sour-on-sugar-idUKL8N1XB9WW,03 Dec 2018,* GRAPHIC-Brazil turns sour on sugar: https://tmsnrt.rs/2QeaG03,"INSIGHT-Betting on ethanol, Brazilian mills turn sour on sugar"

European shares are expected to follow suit, with futures for Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC, Germany’s DAX rising by 1.6 to 2.1 percent. “Markets are opening with a knee-jerk boost to risk appetite but time will tell how enduring the optimism proves to be,” said ANZ economist Jo Masters. “There are already very different official takes on what was achieved at the meeting.” “But for now, both sides can claim a win,” she added. “Perhaps not insignificantly, it provides a window to export the soybean crop from key Republican states, at least.” China and the United States agreed to halt additional tariffs in a deal that keeps their trade war from escalating as the two sides try again to bridge their differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. The White House said on Saturday that President Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping during high-stakes talks in Argentina that he would not boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Jan. 1 as previously announced. “Deeply contentious thornier structural issues such as forced technology transfer remain unresolved,” cautioned Westpac FX analyst Robert Rennie. “This U.S.-China agreement is thus better characterised as a ‘mini-breakthrough’ that puts a momentary pause on trade tensions rather than a comprehensive policy deal.” Indeed, many market players doubt the two countries can bridge their differences that cover a range of issues within three months. “Technology is becoming the main battle ground. It’s not just a trade war any more. It’s more like a technology war, in which we just found a temporary lull,” said Hiroshi Watanabe, economist at Sony Financial.

The Mexican peso jumped more than 1 percent to 20.185 , helped also by reports that newly sworn-in Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador may reverse his earlier plan to cancel construction of a new airport in the country’s capital. MSCI’s emerging currency index rose 0.4 percent to its highest levels in almost 4 months. The dollar had come under pressure last week when comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes. Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee. But the hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday at the age of 94. Treasuries rallied hard late on Friday to leave 10-year yields down at 2.99 percent before bouncing back to 3.035 percent early on Monday. The progress on Sino-U.S. trade and an easier dollar provided some support to commodity prices. Oil soared more than five percent, a positive start after it had posted its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand. Speculation is high the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia would agree some form of production cut at a meeting in Vienna on Thursday. Brent futures rose $2.40 to trade at $61.86 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained $2.28 to $53.21, both on course to make their biggest daily gains in over two years.

Trade-exposed currencies led the early gains, with the Australian dollar notching a four-month peak, while the dollar dropped to one-month lows against the yuan. E-Mini futures for the S&P 500 climbed as much as 1.9 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 1.8 percent. China’s CSI300 index of Shanghai and Shenzhen shares rose 2.6 percent. In Japan, Nikkei gained 1.3 percent to a six-week high. “Markets are opening with a knee-jerk boost to risk appetite but time will tell how enduring the optimism proves to be,” said ANZ economist Jo Masters. “There are already very different official takes on what was achieved at the meeting.” “But for now, both sides can claim a win,” she added. “Perhaps not insignificantly, it provides a window to export the soybean crop from key Republican states, at least.” China and the United States agreed to halt additional tariffs in a deal that keeps their trade war from escalating as the two sides try again to bridge their differences with fresh talks aimed at reaching a deal within 90 days. The White House said on Saturday that President Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping during high-stakes talks in Argentina that he would not boost tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25 percent on Jan. 1 as previously announced. “Deeply contentious thornier structural issues such as forced technology transfer remain unresolved,” cautioned Westpac FX analyst Robert Rennie. “This U.S.-China agreement is thus better characterised as a ‘mini-breakthrough’ that puts a momentary pause on trade tensions rather than a comprehensive policy deal.” Investors chose to see the glass as half full and lifted the Aussie dollar 0.75 percent to $0.7360. The greenback eased against a basket of currencies to 96.993 , but also firmed on the yen to 113.57. The euro added 0.3 percent to $1.1345. The Mexican peso jumped more than 1 percent to 20.185 , helped also by reports that newly sworn-in Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador may reverse his earlier plan to cancel construction of a new airport in the country’s capital. The dollar had come under pressure last week when comments by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell were interpreted by markets as hinting at a slower pace of rate hikes. Powell was scheduled to testify on Wednesday to a congressional Joint Economic Committee. But the hearing is expected to be postponed to Thursday because major exchanges will be closed on Wednesday in honour of former U.S. President George H.W. Bush, who died on Saturday at the age of 94. Treasuries rallied hard late on Friday to leave 10-year yields down at 2.99 percent before bouncing back to 3.035 percent early on Monday. The progress on Sino-U.S. trade and an easier dollar could provide some support to commodity prices. Oil posted its weakest month in more than 10 years in November, losing more than 20 percent as global supply outstripped demand. Speculation is high the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia would agree some form of production cut at a meeting in Vienna on Thursday.

2018-12-03,"(Reuters) - Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said on Sunday that the Western Canadian province would mandate temporary oil output cuts to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to a glut of crude in storage and driven down Canadian crude prices. The production caps are the latest effort by the province’s left-leaning New Democratic Party government to deal with historically low crude prices that are hurting producers and dragging on government revenues. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend crude typically trades at a discount to the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark, with the lower price reflecting the cost of transport and the quality of the product. The discount has typically been around $15 (11.8 pounds), but has widened in the past few months to trade at $40 to $50 below WTI, hitting a record at $52.50 below WTI in October, according to data from Shorcan.  Crude production in Alberta’s oil sands is expanding faster than pipeline capacity, creating a bottleneck and leading to a buildup of product in storage. More crude is now moving across the border by rail and by truck, but it is not enough to clear the glut. The stranded barrels are putting pressure on prices. Adding to the woes, refinery maintenance has taken some buyers temporarily offline. The steep discount has stripped billions of dollars from the Canadian economy by some estimates. New pipeline capacity is Alberta’s preferred solution, but projects face fierce opposition from environmentalists and some Aboriginal groups. Construction is under way on Enbridge Inc’s (ENB.TO) Line 3 pipeline replacement, from Alberta to the United States, with the project expected to be in service by the end of 2019.  TransCanada Corp’s (TRP.TO) Keystone XL pipeline, from Alberta to the United States, is facing a supplementary environmental assessment after a federal judge in Montana halted construction last month. The impact on timing remains unclear.  The near tripling of capacity on the Trans Mountain pipeline, from Alberta to a port in the Vancouver area, is undergoing a new regulatory review. It is unclear when construction on the federal government-owned pipeline will begin. Crude by rail has ramped up sharply this year, hitting nearly 270,000 bpd in September. Alberta said last week that it would buy locomotives and rail cars to add an additional 120,000 bpd of crude by rail capacity. It expects the first trains to be running by December 2019, with all online by August 2020. Crude by rail will narrow the differential, but not as much as pipelines. The most effective short-term solution is production cuts, but they are not universally popular with producers. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd (CNQ.TO) and Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) have voluntarily curtailed production in recent weeks. But other majors like Suncor Energy Inc (SU.TO) and Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO), which have refineries and are therefore sheltered from the worst of the price impact, do not want to cut output.  Dealing with the low crude prices is essential for Notley, who faces an election no later than the end of May 2019. Her party faces a tough challenge from the United Conservative Party, led by Jason Kenney, a former Cabinet Minister with the federal Conservatives.

2018-12-03,"(Adds details on current output, producer impact) By Julie Gordon VANCOUVER, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Alberta Premier Rachel Notley said on Sunday that the Western Canadian province would mandate temporary oil production cuts to deal with a pipeline bottleneck that has led to a glut of crude in storage and driven down Canadian crude prices. The left-leaning New Democratic Party government will force producers to cut output by 8.7 percent, or 325,000 barrels per day (bpd), until the excess crude in storage is drawn down. The cuts will then drop to 95,000 bpd until Dec. 31, 2019. There are some 35 million barrels of oil in storage in Alberta, which is twice the normal level, the province said. “When markets aren’t working, when companies are forced to sell our resources for pennies on the dollar, we must act,” Notley said in a live public address on Facebook. Alberta estimates that current production outstrips pipeline and rail capacity by 190,000 bpd. The production cuts, to be applied by producer rather than per project, will be implemented starting in January. The discount on Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy blend hit a record at $52.50 below the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmark last month, which meant producers were getting about $14 a barrel compared with about $67 for WTI. It has since narrowed slightly as the WTI benchmark price has fallen and crude by rail volumes has ramped up. The province said the curtailment would narrow the differential by at least $4 a barrel. There will be penalties for non-compliance, but no specifics were given. Notley said last week her government was moving ahead with plans to buy about 80 locomotives and 7,000 rail cars to boost crude by rail capacity by 120,000 bpd by mid-2020. The premier, who will face voters in an election that must be held by the end of May, noted that pipelines were preferred to all other options, but blamed successive federal governments for delays getting projects built. Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline replacement, which runs from Alberta to U.S. markets, is expected to be online by late 2019. Two other planned export pipelines are facing regulatory delays. Several heavy crude producers, including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Cenovus Energy Inc, have voluntarily curtailed production in recent weeks. Mandated cuts are controversial as producers that have their own refineries, like Suncor Energy Inc and Husky Energy Inc, do not face the same impact from the low prices. Notley’s political rivals have called for output caps. The province estimates some 25 producers will be affected by the measures, which will apply only to companies that produce more than 10,000 bpd.

2018-12-03,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Perhaps the most interesting thing to try and calculate after the seeming trade ceasefire between the United States and China is the level of cynicism that will greet the new detente. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping agreed to halt imposing additional tariffs on each other’s imports while they try to reach a deal to end their trade dispute within 90 days. The agreement, reached at a meeting between the two leaders at the weekend G20 summit in Buenos Aires, certainly appears to be a de-escalation of trade tensions. And it does provide yet another opportunity for some sort of lasting deal. However, it also appears long on rhetoric and short on substance - largely in keeping with much of Trump’s pattern of dealing with foreign trade policies. The mercurial U.S. leader was effusive on the meeting with Xi, telling reporters on Air Force One that China has agreed to immediately buy “tremendous amounts of agricultural and other product” and this will have an “incredibly positive impact on farming”. The official Chinese news agency, Xinhua, was somewhat more circumspect in its reporting of the meeting. It didn’t mention the 90-day deadline, nor any agreement to step up agricultural or other commodity imports. Instead, Xinhua stressed the two leaders had agreed not to escalate the tariff war and to “take immediate efforts to address issues of mutual concern based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit”. The more sceptical and jaded of observers may conclude that it seemed Trump and China were once again talking past each other, and in 90 days time Washington and Beijing will find themselves more or less back where they are now. Still, the market could take a positive view of the development. Certainly crude oil’s initial reaction was bullish, with Brent rising as high as $61.22 a barrel in early Asian trade on Monday, up 4.3 percent from the close on Nov. 30. However, there will be some interesting concrete signals within that period. Perhaps the most obvious impact of the trade dispute so far has been China’s decision to almost totally cut out imports of U.S. soybeans and energy commodities such as crude oil, coal and liquefied natural gas (LNG). There is something of an irony in this. One of Trump’s stated aims was reducing the U.S. trade deficit with China, but the dispute has widened it, partly because China stopped buying commodities. China’s imports of U.S. commodities had shown strong growth prior to the imposition of tariffs in the middle of this year. Imports of U.S. crude peaked in June this year, when almost 14 million barrels, or about 466,000 barrels per day (bpd), arrived. In the first nine months of this year, China imported about 328,000 bpd from the United States - about 3.6 percent of its total crude imports. But this dropped to zero in October, and in November one cargo of U.S. crude was discharged, according to ship-tracking data compiled by Refinitiv. No cargoes are currently booked to arrive in December, or beyond, according to the data. Similar to crude, no U.S. cargoes of LNG - which is subject to Chinese tariffs - arrived in China in October, although two were discharged in November. However, no cargoes are slated for arrival in December or beyond. In the first nine months of the year, 31 ships delivered a total of 2.2 million tonnes of LNG from the United States to China, representing about 6 percent of total imports, according to the vessel-tracking data. China imported zero U.S. coal - subject to tariffs - in October, two cargoes totalling about 211,000 tonnes in November, and none are scheduled to arrive in December or January. In the first nine months of the year, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, the majority of this being higher-value metallurgical coal used in steelmaking. China’s imports of U.S. soybeans fell to just 66,955 tonnes in October, down from 1.33 million tonnes for the same month in 2017. While these have collapsed since May, imports from Brazil have been ramped up to well above 2017 levels. However, China has in the past boosted its purchases of U.S. soybeans in the fourth and first quarters of each year - this is when the U.S. crop is ready and Brazil’s has yet to be harvested. What this means in terms of the Trump-Xi meeting at the G20 is that it’s going to be apparent fairly quickly if China is going to switch tactics and resume buying U.S. commodities. It will be relatively simple for China’s buyers of crude oil, LNG, coal and soybeans to re-enter the market and fix cargoes from the United States. It will still take several months for cargoes to reach China and show up in import figures, but the ship-tracking and port data should show quite quickly if cargoes are being arranged. Given the seeming gap in the expectations of Washington and Beijing, the track record of Trump in flip-flopping his positions and the Chinese need to preserve “face” in any eventual deal, the safest option is probably to be sceptical about the real-world implications of the G20 meeting.

2018-12-03,"* WTI crude futures up more than 3 pct after 90-day truce sealed * OPEC expected to agree supply cut this week * Cuts would be aimed at reining in emerging oversupply * U.S. crude output at record levels, above 11.5 mln bpd By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Oil prices surged in early trading on Monday after the United States and China agreed a truce in their trade conflict and ahead of a meeting by producer club OPEC this week that is expected to result in a supply cut. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.60 per barrel at 0032 GMT, up $1.67 per barrel, or 3.2 percent from their last close. International Brent crude oil futures were up $1.55 per barrel, or 2.6 percent, at $61.01 a barrel. China and the United States agreed during the meeting of the Group of 20 (G20) leading economies in Argentina over the weekend not to impose additional trade tariffs for at least 90 days while the pair hold talks to resolve existing disputes. Crude oil has not been included in the list of hundreds of products each side has slapped with import tariffs, but traders said the positive sentiment of the truce between the world’s two biggest economies was also driving crude markets. “Post G-20 sentiment is a bit more positive than expected,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading for Asia/Pacific at futures brokerage Oanda in Singapore. Looking ahead, Innes said this could be “a huge week” for oil markets because of a meeting by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Dec. 6. At the meeting, the producer group, as well as non-OPEC member Russia, is expected to announce supply cuts aimed at reining in a production overhang that has pulled down crude prices by around a third since October. No official announcements regarding supply cuts have yet been made, but most analysts expect a reduction of 1-1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) versus October levels, which was the highest by OPEC as a group since December 2016. Meanwhile, oil producers in the United States continue to churn out record amounts of oil, with crude output at an unprecedented level of more than 11.5 million bpd. Reporting by Henning Gloystein
