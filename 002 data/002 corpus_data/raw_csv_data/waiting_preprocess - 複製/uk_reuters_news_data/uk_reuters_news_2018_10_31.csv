2018-10-31,"(Adds details on Petrobras debt-reduction efforts) SAO PAULO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA will sell its 50 percent stake in a Nigerian oil and gas exploration venture to a consortium led by top oil trader Vitol for $1.53 billion, the latest step in the state-controlled oil company’s debt reduction drive, according to a securities filing on Wednesday. The other 50 percent stake in Petrobras Oil and Gas BV, also known as Petrobras Africa, is owned by Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual, which in a Wednesday filing confirmed a Reuters report that it would likely hang on to its portion after previously mulling a sale. Petrobras, one of the world’s most indebted oil majors, had targeted $21 billion in asset sales for 2017 and 2018, but only succeeded in unloading $9.5 billion worth by the end of the first half. The deal involves a stake in some of two deepwater exploration blocks that are among Nigeria’s largest and lowest-cost fields. Swiss-based Vitol is expected to shoulder the largest part of the investment, spending an estimated $1 billion, according to a Reuters report in June about the oil trader’s interest.. Vancouver-based Africa Oil Corp and Delonex Energy, an Africa-focused oil company, are members of the consortium. Petrobras earlier this year sold a 25 percent stake in Roncador, one of Brazil’s largest oil fields, to Norway’s Equinor ASA for about $2 billion. It is also in talks to sell its TAG gas pipeline unit, probably to a group led by France´s Engie SA, for more than $7 billion, although the process has been halted by a Brazilian Supreme Court injunction. A source with direct knowledge of Petrobras’ operations told Reuters on Tuesday that the oil company wished to obtain an additional $20 billion through asset sales through the end of next year.

2018-10-31,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc, Canada’s second-largest energy producer, reported a higher third-quarter profit on Wednesday on better oil prices and increased refinery margins, along with higher sales and output. The Calgary, Alberta-based company’s operating profit, which excludes one-time items, was C$1.6 billion, or 96 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from C$867 million, or 52 Canadian cents per share, in the year-ago period. That was slightly above the average analyst estimate of 95 Canadian cents per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. Suncor also said operations at its majority-owned Syncrude oil project in northern Alberta had returned to normal, after a June outage that led the company to cut its production outlook for the year. Total upstream production rose slightly to 743,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day, compared with 739,900 in the year-ago quarter. Refinery throughput was 457,200 barrels per day (bpd), compared to 466,800 in the year-prior quarter. In northern Alberta’s oil sands, where the company has the bulk of its operations, third-quarter output rose 1.4 percent to a quarterly record of 476,100 bpd while operating cash costs per barrel rose to C$22.00 from C$21.60 a year ago. Suncor said its newest oil sands project, Fort Hills, ramped up to its target operating rate of 90 percent of nameplate capacity, subsequent to the end of the third quarter. “The ramp up at Fort Hills has gone exceedingly well and the asset is now operating at target rates,” chief executive Steve Williams said in a statement. Suncor reduced it’s debt by C$1.2 billion in the quarter and spent nearly C$900 million on share repurchases. Net earnings were C$1.8 billion, or C$1.12 per share, in the third quarter, compared with net earnings of C$1.3 billion in the year-ago quarter, or 78 Canadian cents per share.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said on Wednesday the Trump administration wants sanctions on Iran’s crude exports to strain Tehran, but does not want to harm countries that depend on the oil. The United States is preparing to impose the new sanctions on Iran’s oil industry after Washington withdrew from a nuclear deal between Tehran and other global powers earlier this year, but is also considering offering waivers to some allies that rely on Iranian supplies. “We want to achieve maximum pressure but we don’t want to harm friends and allies either,” Bolton said in a talk at the Hamilton Society. Bolton said the administration understands that a number of countries, some close geographically to Iran which he visited last week, and others “may not be able to go all the way, all the way to zero immediately.” It was a more conciliatory tone about the sanctions from Bolton, a proponent of being tough on Iran and winding down its crude exports to zero. Still, Bolton said that consequences can already be seen in Iran including the collapse of the rial, its currency. “I think it’s important that we not relax in the effort,” he said. In a presidential memorandum addressed to secretaries of State, Treasury and Energy, Trump said he determined there was sufficient supply of petroleum and petroleum products elsewhere than Iran to permit a reduction in purchases from the Islamic Republic. Under the law, the U.S. president must periodically issue a “determination” on whether there is sufficient supply in the market from non-Iranian sources for countries to significantly cut their Iranian purchases. The administration’s renewed sanctions are set to come into effect on Nov. 5. Under U.S. law, Washington can sanction the financial institutions of foreign countries that fail to significantly reduce their purchases of Iranian oil and petroleum products. The purpose of the law, which came into effect during the Obama administration, was to put pressure on Iran to curtail its nuclear programme by forcing its major oil customers to reduce their purchases. Three of Iran’s five largest buyers of crude - China, India and Turkey - have resisted calls by Washington to end their oil purchases outright. This week South Korea asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for “maximum flexibility” on its request for a waiver to prevent companies there from being hit by the sanctions. Other countries, including Iraq and Afghanistan, depend on some imports from Iran. The administration has said it is considering waivers on a case-by-case basis.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s proposal to replace an Obama-era policy to fight climate change with a weaker plan allowing states to write their own rules on emissions from coal-fired power plants was criticized by coastal states, but applauded by coal interests on Wednesday. Under the proposed Affordable Clean Energy plan that acting Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) chief Andrew Wheeler issued in August, the federal government would set carbon emission guidelines, but states would have the leeway to set less stringent standards on coal plants, taking into account the age and upgrade costs of facilities.  The heads of environmental and energy agencies from 14 mostly coastal states, including California, New York and North Carolina, told the EPA in joint comments on the Trump plan that it would result in minimal reductions of greenhouse gases, and possibly result in increased emissions, relative to having no federal program on the pollution.   “We urge EPA to abandon this proposal and instead to maintain or update the (Obama era) Clean Power Plan,” which the states said would fulfill EPA’s obligations under federal clean air law and support the efforts of states to mitigate the effects of climate change. Some states including New York and Virginia have threatened to sue the EPA if the plan becomes law.  The comment period on the plan ends on Wednesday night and a final rule from the EPA is expected later this year.  Coal and some utility interests lauded the Trump plan. “The proposed ACE rule is a welcome return to federal restraint after years of punitive overreach,” said Hal Quinn, the president and CEO of the National Mining Association, an industry group.  The coal industry had said President Barack Obama’s climate regulations represented a “war on coal,” but Trump’s promises to reduce regulations have not led to a revival, as the industry struggles with competition from an abundance of cheap natural gas. Ongoing closings of coal-fired plants have pushed U.S. coal consumption by utilities this year to the lowest since 1983, according to the Energy Information Administration. In August, the EPA projected the plan would result in $400 million a year in economic benefits and reduce retail power prices by up to 0.5 percent by 2025. The EPA also forecast that under the rule, coal production would rise by up to 5.8 percent by 2025.  The Obama-era plan, which had been put on hold by the U.S. Supreme Court, set overall carbon-reduction goals for each state.

2018-10-31,"(Adds oil and refined product demand numbers) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Scott DiSavino NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil production surged by 416,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 11.346 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a monthly report on Wednesday as production in Texas and North Dakota climbed to fresh peaks. Texas output jumped by 126,000 bpd to a high of 4.58 million and production in North Dakota edged higher by 22,000 bpd to 1.28 million, the data showed. The agency revised its overall July production figure slightly lower to 10.93 million bpd. U.S. total oil demand in August was up 5.2 percent, or 1.1 million bpd, to 21.3 million bpd compared with last year, as strong distillate demand made up for flat growth in gasoline demand, EIA data showed. U.S. gasoline demand rose less than 1 percent, or 4,000 bpd, to 9.7 million bpd in August compared with last year, according to EIA data. U.S. distillate demand rose 4.2 percent, or 169,000 bpd, to 4.1 million bpd in August. Crude oil output from the United States has boomed due to a shale revolution, with production from the nation’s largest oilfield, the Permian basin that spans West Texas and New Mexico, leading the way. At more than 11 million bpd, the United States is now one of the world’s biggest producers, rivaling long-time leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia. Production from Texas alone tops several Middle Eastern OPEC members. Russian oil production has risen to a post-Soviet record high of 11.41 million bpd so far in October, up from 11.36 mln bpd in September, an industry source familiar with the output data told Reuters on Wednesday. Saudi Arabia, after opening the taps in June and then scaling back its plans to pump more, supplied 10.65 million bpd in October, more than in June and close to a record high, a Reuters survey found. The August rise in U.S. crude output of 416,000 bpd reported by EIA was the biggest monthly increase in crude production since October 2008, when output rose by 766,000 bpd. In the federal offshore Gulf of Mexico, output rose to a monthly record high 1.9 million bpd in August, according to EIA data going back to 1981. Meanwhile, natural gas production in the lower 48 U.S. states rose to an all-time high of 94.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in August, up from the prior record of 92.7 bcfd in July, according to EIA’s 914 production report. In Texas, the nation’s largest gas producer, production increased to a record high 24.9 bcfd in August, up 1.7 percent from July. That compares with output of 21.8 bcfd in August 2017. In Pennsylvania, the second biggest gas producing state, production rose to a record high 17.3 bcfd in August, up 1.8 percent from July. That compares with output of 14.5 bcfd in August 2017.

2018-10-31,"CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian oil producer Cenovus Energy Inc (CVE.TO) is considering further expansion of its agreements to move crude by rail on Canada’s two major railways, its chief executive said on Wednesday. Last month, Cenovus signed three-year deals with Canadian National Railway Co (CNR.TO) and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd (CP.TO) to transport roughly 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast, starting in the fourth quarter. The agreements come as discounts on Canadian oil to U.S. crude grew to record highs this month, due to rising production bumping against pipeline constraints. Cenovus could expand those agreements by a further 20,000 bpd for a total volume of 120,000 bpd and the equivalent of two unit trains, CEO Alex Pourbaix said in an interview at the Reuters Global Commodities Summit. Unit trains carry a single commodity. “We’re quite confident that if it makes sense to ramp up to 120, that we’ll be able to have arrangements in place to achieve that,” Pourbaix said. “We’re going to wait a little while. I want to see how the rest of rail (movement) is ramping up.” The Calgary, Alberta-based company, which operates a rail loading terminal in northern Alberta, currently moves less than 20,000 bpd of its own oil by rail, with the entire Canadian industry shipping about 250,000, a record high, Pourbaix said. Total shipments look to reach 300,000 bpd by year-end and 450,000 bpd by end of 2019, the company said. Cenovus said earlier on Wednesday that it was limiting output due to severe discounts and said it expected the price of domestic heavy crude to rise by mid-2019 as increased rail volumes ease transport bottlenecks. The company did not specify how much production it was restricting but said it has slowed output at both its Foster Creek and Christina Lake sites. Pourbaix said the entire industry needed to do its part to reduce excess supply. “We’re not going to carry the industry on our backs. We’re going to do this as long as we can justify that we’re creating value for our shareholders by deferring this production,” Pourbaix told analysts. Pourbaix said there has been no effort among producers to coordinate reductions. Cenovus faced investor ire following its deal to buy some of ConocoPhillips’ (COP.N) oil sands assets last year and took on a huge debt. The company has been since taking steps to turn around its business through layoffs and asset sales. Rival Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO) has made a hostile bid for MEG Energy Corp (MEG.TO), while other Canadian producers are expanding production. Pourbaix said he is not worried about losing market share, and that his focus remains on cutting debt and later, growth through its own projects. Alberta Premier Rachel Notley recently suggested that Ottawa buy rail cars or locomotives to ease the backlog. Pourbaix said while he supports government help, the bottlenecks require “quick solutions” but will ease late next year.  Total production rose 4 percent to 495,592 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the third quarter.  The company’s net loss was C$242 million ($184 million), compared with a profit of C$275 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, Cenovus lost 3 Canadian cents per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 21 Canadian cents per share, according to Refinitiv. The company’s shares closed up 0.45 percent at C$11.14 in Toronto.

2018-10-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Robust corporate results helped world stock markets surge on Wednesday, bringing some relief to jittery investors after a brutal October sank equities with one of their worst drops since the financial crisis 10 years ago.  Strong earnings reports in the United States and Europe spurred a broad rally, despite data showing that China’s factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years. Investors rushed into the U.S. dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan languished at a 22-month low.  The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 1.3 percent, but remains down 7.3 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline since 2012. The index has dropped approximately 11 percent from all-time highs hit in January. The recovery in global stocks, including gains overnight on Wall Street, pushed Treasury yields higher. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 11/32 in price to yield 3.1492 percent, from 3.109 percent late on Tuesday. “A lot of these high-growth names have really been in bear market territory because of the slump this month, but the valuation correction is allowing some of the bulls to be opportunistic and to jump in at the right moment,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 240.85 points, or 0.97 percent, to 25,115.49, the S&P 500 gained 29.04 points, or 1.08 percent, to 2,711.67 and the Nasdaq Composite added 144.25 points, or 2.01 percent, to 7,305.90. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.71 percent  Despite the broad rally, investors remained cautious.   “Ultimately I’m still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities.  “I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.” The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.02 percent, with the euro down 0.2 percent to $1.1321. “Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,” said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London.  The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly decline and its longest losing streak on record. Gold, set for its biggest monthly gain since January, dipped on the stronger dollar. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,212.64 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.92 percent to $1,214.00 an ounce.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Both Republican and Democratic senators asked U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday to suspend civilian nuclear energy talks with Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Five Republican U.S. lawmakers, led by Senator Marco Rubio, said in a letter to Trump they would use the Atomic Energy Act to block any U.S.-Saudi nuclear agreements if Trump did not cut off talks.  “The ongoing revelations about the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as certain Saudi actions related to Yemen and Lebanon, have raised further serious concerns about the transparency, accountability, and judgement of current decision makers in Saudi Arabia,” the senators wrote. “We therefore request that you suspend any related negotiations for a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear agreement for the foreseeable future,” said the lawmakers, who included senators Cory Gardner, Rand Paul, Dean Heller and Todd Young. In addition, Democratic Senator Edward Markey wrote another letter to Trump calling for a suspension of discussions on civilian nuclear cooperation with Saudi Arabia, and for the administration to revoke any approvals for the transfer of nuclear services, technology or assistance to the kingdom.  Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the Republican letter, first reported by NBC News, or Markey’s letter. Markey said in his letter that cooperation between nations, particularly on nuclear energy, must be based on trust and shared values, but Saudi Arabia’s actions “have made it clear that any nuclear cooperation with its government does not currently meet that bar.”  Washington has wanted Saudi Arabia to buy nuclear power technology from U.S. companies, including Westinghouse, which recently emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In July, Saudi Arabia put South Korea’s state-run utility KEPCO, the United States, France, China and Russia on a shortlist to bid for a nuclear power project and the winner would likely be selected in 2019, a South Korea official said. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The death of the Washington Post columnist, a U.S. resident who had American children, sparked global outrage and pitched the world’s top oil exporter into crisis.  The United States has called for transparency in the investigation of Khashoggi’s death and revoked the U.S. visas of some Saudis over the incident. Trump has said Prince Mohammed bore ultimate responsibility for what happened to Khashoggi but has also cited Riyadh as a strong ally.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis on Tuesday called for a cessation of hostilities in Yemen and urged the start of U.N.-led negotiations to end the civil war next month. Saudi Arabia’s official comments on Khashoggi’s death have shifted from initially denying any involvement to saying the killing was premeditated. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey are investigating Khashoggi’s death.

2018-10-31,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell on Wednesday and posted the worst monthly performance since mid-2016 on evidence of rising global crude supply, but losses were limited by signs of strong U.S. demand for fuel.  The Brent crude December LCOc1 futures contract, which expired Wednesday, fell 44 cents to settle at $75.47 a barrel. The more-active January contract LCOF9 fell 91 cents to settle at $75.04 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell 87 cents to settle at $65.31 a barrel. Both benchmarks were more than $10 a barrel below the four-year highs reached on Oct. 3. They both posted their worst monthly performance since July 2016, with Brent falling 8.8 percent for the month and WTI dropping 10.9 percent. Investor sentiment across risky asset classes, such as equities and energy, turned negative during the month as U.S.-China trade tensions sparked demand worries. Weighing on market sentiment on Wednesday were signs of rising global output. U.S. crude oil production surged by 416,000 barrels per day (bpd) to a record 11.346 million bpd in August, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said. The United States and other top producers Russia and Saudi Arabia pumped 33 million barrels per day in September, Refinitiv data showed, an increase of 10 million bpd since the start of the decade. Russian oil output has reached 11.41 million bpd in October, a level unseen since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, an industry source told Reuters. The increases in production comes just ahead of new U.S. sanctions on Iran, set to come into force Nov. 4, that are expected to cut supply.  “There’s this perception that there’s enough oil in the market right now to get through the Iranian sanctions,” said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. Washington has made it clear to Tehran’s customers that it expects them to stop buying any Iranian crude oil from that date.  However, on Wednesday U.S. national security adviser John Bolton said that while the United States wants to apply maximum pressure on Iran with sanctions on its crude exports, it does not want to harm countries that are friends and allies that depend on the oil. Imports of Iranian crude by major buyers in Asia hit a 32-month low in September as China, South Korea and Japan sharply cut their purchases ahead of the sanctions, government and ship-tracking data showed. Earlier in the session, oil prices gained after the U.S. Energy Information Administration said crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 3.2 million barrels last week, less than expected. Gasoline and distillate stockpiles fell as total product demand over the past four weeks rose 5.4 percent from a year ago. [EIA/S] “Bullish draws to the products have acted as a counterweight to bearish sentiment,” said Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. Oil market sentiment received some support from equity markets, which pulled back from 20-month lows after pledges by China to support its markets.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared unlikely to revive a lawsuit by villagers in India seeking to hold a Washington-based international financial institution responsible for environmental damage they blame on a power plant it financed. The justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by the villagers of a lower court ruling that the International Finance Corp, part of the World Bank Group, was immune from such lawsuits under U.S. law. Several justices expressed scepticism towards the villagers’ legal argument, signalling the court was likely to back the IFC. A ruling is due by the end of June. The IFC provided $450 million in loans in 2008 to help construct the coal-fired Tata Mundra Power Plant in Gujarat, India. IFC loans include provisions requiring that certain environmental standards are met. Lead plaintiff Budha Ismail Jam and other fisherman and farmers living near the plant sued in federal court in Washington in 2015, saying the IFC failed to meet its obligations. The legal question is whether there are limits to immunity for entities like the IFC under the 1945 International Organizations Immunity Act, as there are for foreign countries under a 1976 law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The IFC expressed concern that a ruling against the organisation could invite similar lawsuits targeting it and other international development banks. Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to sympathise, asking Justice Department lawyer Jonathan Ellis: “What is the assurance that the government can give us that this isn’t going to lead to a lot of lawsuits?” Fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan said the IFC’s interpretation of the scope of immunity appears to “make a lot more sense.” The villagers said the plant’s construction and operations did no comply with the environmental plan set out for the project. The local environment has been devastated, according to the plaintiffs, with marine life killed by water discharges from the plant’s cooling system and coal dust contaminating the air. Lower courts ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the IFC is immune from such litigation under the 1945 law. President Donald Trump’s administration backed the plaintiffs, saying international organizations should not be given anything more than the limited immunity foreign countries are accorded. One of the nine justices did not participate in the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed, was involved in the case in his prior role as a federal appeals court judge.

2018-10-31,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Bunge Ltd said it will add four directors to its board and create a strategic review committee to explore options for the global grains trader, including a sale of the company, bowing to pressure from activist investors D.E. Shaw and Continental Grain Co. The White Plains, New York-based agribusiness company also reported a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit, but lowered its 2018 earnings outlook by $100 million to $1.2 billion with cuts to guidance in two of its four business segments. Bunge shares tumbled 9.2 percent to $61.73 per share in the steepest drop in 1-1/2 years as the lower outlook and fears of future earnings volatility hammered the stock, even as the broader market rose. The plunge more than reversed a 3.4 percent jump the previous day on news that Bunge was finalizing a deal with the activist investors to expand its board and set up the committee. J.P. Morgan cut its price target for the company by $5 to $70 a share, citing possible earnings volatility in the coming quarters amid an ongoing U.S.-China trade war, according to analyst Ann Duignan. The board expansion after the company has fielded unsuccessful takeover bids by rival Archer Daniels Midland Co and commodities trader Glencore, while a prolonged global grain glut has hurt crop prices. “The strategic review committee formed by the board still leaves the door open for a possible sale of the company, but it also leaves the door open to sales of only portions of the company to give it a narrower focus,” said Christopher Muir, equity analyst at CFRA Research. Bunge said three new directors, joining immediately, are Continental Grain Chief Executive Officer Paul Fribourg, former Gavilon Group CEO Gregory Heckman and Henry Winship, president of Pacific Point Capital. A fourth mutually agreed upon director will join the board by the end of the year, bringing the total number of board members to 15. Bunge also said it would form a separate committee, chaired by new board member Fribourg, to conduct a “strategic review focused on enhancing long-term shareholder value.” The six-member strategic review committee will include the new directors named on Wednesday and three current directors, the company said. “This committee has been created as a good check on what it is we’ve been doing, whether we can do additional things, whether we can accelerate things ... There’s no preconceived notions of either direction or topic,” Bunge CEO Soren Schroder told Reuters. Although Schroder is not part of the committee, it will channel its findings through him and the rest of the board, he said. There is no deadline for its review. Bunge reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit, helped by higher margins from its agribusiness division. Net income available to shareholders rose to $365 million, or $2.39 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $92 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.52 per share, beating average analysts’ estimates of $2.39 per share, according to Refinitv data. Bunge held its 2018 agribusiness segment earnings outlook unchanged in the upper half of an $800 million to $1 billion range, supported by oilseeds operations in the Northern Hemisphere. Fertilizer segment guidance was raised by $10 million tom $35 million. But the company cut its food and ingredients unit guidance by $40 million to a range from $250 million to $270 million, and forecast a $20 million to $40 million loss in sugar and bioenergy, from a previously stated break-even outlook.

2018-10-31,"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) on Wednesday said it may shift some investment out of Colorado if voters in that state approve a ballot proposal that limits drilling in populated areas. The measure would put at least 85 percent of new oil and gas development on non-federal lands off limits to new drilling, the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission has said. Oil companies have raised tens of millions to oppose the measure.   Anadarko could shift focus to properties in the Delaware Basin, which spans West Texas and New Mexico, if Colorado voters on November 6 pass a law requiring up to 2,500-foot separations between new wells and homes, schools and parks, executives said during an earnings conference call.  “We are interested in what’s going to happen in Colorado. That will have some impact in terms of where we’ll allocate capital,” said Chief Executive Al Walker.    The company’s backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells and approved well permits in Colorado give it confidence in what it has scheduled in the state next year, regardless of the vote, executives added. Pressure pumper Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT.N), which is headquartered in Denver, also said on Wednesday that approval of the state’s Proposition 112 drilling rules could affect its operations. It does not expect passage of the law to immediately curtail activity in the state, Liberty Chief Executive Chris Wright said on a call.  “That [proposal] would render a lot of non-governmental lands undrillable. It’s having the effect of oil companies shifting rigs out of Colorado now, and looking at the Powder River Basin and Permian and Bakken,” said Gregory Reid, president of investment management firm Salient MLP Complex.   If the rule is struck down, shares of Colorado-focused oil companies that have been negatively impacted by Proposition 112 could rally, Reid added.

2018-10-31,"(Adds context, detail) By Julia Payne LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Gunvor Group named Muriel Schwab as its new chief financial officer on Wednesday as part of a wider leadership shake-up, making her one of the highest ranking women in oil trading. “Having conducted an extensive search across the industry, Muriel proved to be the best candidate, with broad experience in commodities finance and a wealth of commercial insight across all continents,” Gunvor Chief Executive Torbjorn Tornqvist said. The oil industry, and oil trading in particular, has come under scrutiny for some of the lowest representation of women. Panels made up only of men, dubbed “manels” in the media, are still the norm at oil, mining and other commodity events. Schwab was previously regional head of trade and commodity finance for the Americas at Rabobank in New York and a member of the trade commodity finance management team. She was previously at Gunvor between 2007 and 2014 and has held roles at Taurus Petroleum, Credit Suisse and ING. Her appointment is part of a wider revamp at the top of Gunvor following weaker profits last year. Schwab will replace Gunvor CFO Jacques Erni by May 1 next year and will also serve on its Executive Committee. Erni has worked for Gunvor since 2006 and been its CFO since 2013. Gunvor, which says 44 percent of its staff are women, widened its executive committee from seven to nine people at the start of the year. Erni will become an executive director on the company’s board after a transition period. The trading environment has been harsh for many tradng firms in 2018 after an already lacklustre 2017. Gunvor posted a sharp profit drop last year after investing heavily in building a North American presence. Schwab will join several other recent high profile top level female appointments this year, including Emma Fitzgerald as CEO of Trafigura’s Puma Energy and Mariam Almaszade as the new CEO of Azerbaijan’s Socar Trading.

2018-10-31,"(Adds details on SPR, trader comment) By Devika  Krishna Kumar NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil inventories climbed for a sixth straight week, but grew less than forecast last week, amid a drop in net imports and the government’s sale of barrels from its reserve, while gasoline and distillate stocks drew down. The Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday that crude inventories, excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, rose 3.2 million barrels in the week to Oct. 26, less than analyst forecasts for a 4.1 million-barrel build. Much of that increase was in the Midwest, where stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub rose 1.9 million barrels, the EIA said. That was also the sixth straight week of builds at the delivery point for U.S. crude futures. Net U.S. crude imports fell last week by 639,000 barrels per day, as exports rose 305,000 bpd. Oil prices  rose after the data, with U.S. heating oil prices leading the energy complex higher after a big decline in inventories. “Bullish draws to the products have acted as a counterweight to bearish sentiment ...  half of today’s crude build was contributed from another SPR release,” Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said in August it would offer 11 million barrels of oil for sale from the nation’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) ahead of sanctions on Iran that are expected to reduce global supplies of crude. The delivery period for the proposed sale of sour crudes is from Oct. 1 through Nov. 30. Winners for the sale include ExxonMobil, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66, according to a notice from the DOE in early September. Traders said the SPR barrels have been hitting the market this month and data showed stockpiles in the SPR fell by about 1.6 million barrels last week, the biggest weekly drop since December 2017. “PADD 3 stocks fell by 1 million barrels. It would’ve fallen by 2.5 million if not for the SPR,” one trader said. Inventories in the Gulf Coast, or PADD 3 region, fell by 1.1 million barrels to 218.5 million last week. Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, fell 4.1 million barrels, versus expectations for a 1.4 million-barrel drop, the EIA data showed. Gasoline stocks fell 3.2 million barrels, compared with analysts’ expectations in a Reuters poll for a 2.1 million barrel drop. Refinery crude runs rose by 149,000 bpd as utilization rates rose by 0.2 percentage point to 89.4 percent of total capacity.

2018-10-31,"(New throughout, updates prices and market activity through midday) By David Randall NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Robust corporate results helped world stock markets surge on Wednesday, bringing some relief to jittery investors after a brutal October sank equities with one of their worst drops since the financial crisis 10 years ago. Strong earnings reports in the United States and Europe spurred a broad rally, despite data showing that China’s factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years. Investors rushed into the U.S. dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan languished at a 22-month low. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose nearly 1.5 percent, but remains down 7.4 percent in October, its biggest monthly decline since 2012. The index has dropped approximately 11.5 percent from all-time highs hit in January. The recovery in global stocks, including gains overnight on Wall Street, pushed Treasury yields higher. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 9/32 in price to yield 3.1416 percent, from 3.109 percent late on Tuesday. “A lot of these high-growth names have really been in bear market territory because of the slump this month, but the valuation correction is allowing some of the bulls to be opportunistic and to jump in at the right moment,” said Ryan Nauman, market strategist at Informa Financial Intelligence in Zephyr Cove, Nevada. In midday trading, The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 314.26 points, or 1.26 percent, to 25,188.9, the S&P 500 gained 39.43 points, or 1.47 percent, to 2,722.06 and the Nasdaq Composite added 160.96 points, or 2.25 percent, to 7,322.61. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.71 percent Despite the broad rally, investors remained cautious. “Ultimately I’m still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. “I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.” The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.24 percent to $1.1317. “Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,” said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London. The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly decline and its longest losing streak on record. Gold, set for its biggest monthly gain since January, dipped on the stronger dollar. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,212.64 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.92 percent to $1,214.00 an ounce. Oil prices recovered as markets braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran next week.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA has shipped a crude cargo valued at $35 million as partial payment to Indian oil company ONGC Videsh Ltd for overdue dividends from a joint venture, according to two people familiar with the matter. The payment is based on an agreement signed in 2016 by PDVSA and ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of India’s Oil and Natural Gas Corp, to repatriate about $530 million in dividends due from their San Cristobal oil project in Venezuela. But Caracas-based PDVSA had not transferred any money to ONGC Videsh in over a year, the sources said, due to Venezuela’s economic meltdown and sanctions that complicate payments through U.S. banks that had made it difficult to pay in cash. That changed when some 500,000 barrels of Venezuelan crude left Venezuela’s main oil port of Jose earlier in October, according to one of the sources. “ONGC Videsh confirms that in October 2018 PDVSA has allocated Merey 16 crude oil parcel of 500,000 barrels to ONGC Videsh towards payment of outstanding dividend,” ONGC Videsh said in an email reply to Reuters. It was not immediately clear which tanker was carrying the crude. Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) Iwatesan and Kassab set sail from Jose several weeks ago with India’s Sikka port as their destination, according to Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. PDVSA, which faces U.S. and international court actions over pending debts, recently has begun paying some creditors, mostly in oil, to avoid further asset seizures. The company is also seeking to stimulate investment in Venezuela’s unraveling oil industry, where annual production is at its lowest in almost seven decades, by trying to meet some of its obligations to foreign partners. The payment to ONGC was arranged through India’s Reliance Industries, operator of the world’s biggest refining complex. Reliance will receive the Venezuelan crude and will ultimately pay the $35 million to ONGC, according to one of the sources. Venezuela depends on oil for almost all its export revenue. The combination of falling crude production and exports from a lack of investment, U.S. sanctions and hyperinflation have pushed the OPEC-member country’s economy to near-collapse. ONGC had previously received $89 million from PDVSA as part of the 2016 payment agreement, reducing the outstanding debt to about $440 million, but no other transfers had been received in more than a year. These payments were made by Russia’s state-run Gazprombank in January 2017 and by Reliance in April 2017. ONGC Videsh Managing Director N. K. Verma said in May that PDVSA had halted all payments to the firm for more than six months. “Since the (payment) process has again started, we hope to receive more such parcels in India to clear outstanding dues,” one of the sources said. Reliance and PDVSA did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. The Venezuelan state-run firm this week started transferring payments to holders of its 2020 bonds, which are backed by collateral in its Citgo Petroleum refining arm, after shifting its export logistics during the third quarter to raise more cash. Since late August, PDVSA also made partial payments in cash and crude to U.S. producer ConocoPhillips to honor a $2-billion arbitration award.

2018-10-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil product margins have been tossed around on a wild rollercoaster ride in October, as factors like impending Iran sanctions, the Sino-American trade war and upcoming new shipping regulations yank fuel profits up, down and back again. Some profit margins, known as crack spreads in the industry, including for Asian fuel oil and gasoil have boomed, while others, like Asian and European gasoline cracks, have plunged. Crack spreads are the difference between the price of crude oil and the price of the products such as diesel and gasoline refined from it. The term is derived from the cracking process sometimes used in petroleum refining to produce the fuels. Asia’s cracks for gasoil GOSGCKMc1 and fuel oil FO180SGCKMc1 have gained 16.3 percent and a whopping 124.3 percent, respectively, since the start of the year - with most of the jump happening this month. “These cracks are extraordinary,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian energy consultancy Trifecta. Vijayakar, a veteran of India’s refining industry, said such high gasoil and fuel oil cracks should move a refiner to maximise these products. “Keenly aware that these cracks are extraordinary, he (the refiner) should protect such production decisions by hedging the cracks...as an insurance to protect windfall gains,” Vijayakar said. The margin on fuel oil - a residue from crude processing - is typically negative. In the last week of October, however, it stood at around $1 per barrel, pushed up in part by tightening supply ahead of sanctions against Iran, a major supplier of fueloil, which the United States will impose from next week. Another strong performer has been distillate fuel, including gasoil. One of the biggest drivers here has been new regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This will force shippers to adopt cleaner fuel standards from 2020, and it pushing up demand for low-sulphur gasoil made from heavy crude. “In an IMO 2020 world, we expect distillate margins will increase,” Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday in a note to clients. “We expect refiners with...access to heavy crude barrels and high-distillate yields to benefit most from the regulations.” For graphic on Asian & European refinery margins, click tmsnrt.rs/2P3eG3V Not all has been rosy in refining. This year has been particularly painful for refiners specialised in churning out gasoline. Booming auto sales in emerging markets and especially China aCNDSLSAUT, which sells more than 2 million new cars every month, but also healthy demand from the United States, have in the past made gasoline a favourite among refiners, many of whom maximised its yield. That boom has turned into a bust as refiners now pump more than even this growing market can absorb, eroding profit margins. European refiners sent their excess fuel to Asia, hoping to find a home there for their surplus petrol. This came just as China’s massive refinery sector started exporting excess gasoline as even its thirsty domestic market couldn’t cope with the flood of fuel. Analysts say things may get worse, especially if an economic slowdown on the back of widespread emerging market currency weakness and the Sino-American trade war sucks demand out from under a sector already swamped by glut.  “Gasoline fundamentals continue to deteriorate and are a source of concern for us,” Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday appeared unlikely to revive a lawsuit by villagers in India seeking to hold a Washington-based international financial institution responsible for environmental damage they blame on a power plant it financed. The justices heard an hour of arguments in an appeal by the villagers of a lower court ruling that the International Finance Corp, part of the World Bank Group, was immune from such lawsuits under U.S. law. Several justices expressed skepticism toward the villagers’ legal argument, signaling the court was likely to back the IFC. A ruling is due by the end of June. The IFC provided $450 million in loans in 2008 to help construct the coal-fired Tata Mundra Power Plant in Gujarat, India. IFC loans include provisions requiring that certain environmental standards are met. Lead plaintiff Budha Ismail Jam and other fisherman and farmers living near the plant sued in federal court in Washington in 2015, saying the IFC failed to meet its obligations. The legal question is whether there are limits to immunity for entities like the IFC under the 1945 International Organizations Immunity Act, as there are for foreign countries under a 1976 law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. The IFC expressed concern that a ruling against the organization could invite similar lawsuits targeting it and other international development banks. Justice Stephen Breyer appeared to sympathize, asking Justice Department lawyer Jonathan Ellis: “What is the assurance that the government can give us that this isn’t going to lead to a lot of lawsuits?” Fellow liberal Justice Elena Kagan said the IFC’s interpretation of the scope of immunity appears to “make a lot more sense.” The villagers said the plant’s construction and operations did no comply with the environmental plan set out for the project. The local environment has been devastated, according to the plaintiffs, with marine life killed by water discharges from the plant’s cooling system and coal dust contaminating the air. Lower courts ruled that the lawsuit was barred because the IFC is immune from such litigation under the 1945 law. President Donald Trump’s administration backed the plaintiffs, saying international organizations should not be given anything more than the limited immunity foreign countries are accorded. One of the nine justices did not participate in the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who Trump appointed, was involved in the case in his prior role as a federal appeals court judge.

2018-10-31,"AMSTERDAM, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The Netherlands will issue its first green government bonds next year, expecting to be the first triple A-rated country to do so. Dutch Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra said on Wednesday 3.5 to 5 billion euros ($4 billion-$5.8 billion) of currently planned government expenses could qualify as green, citing those in railroads and sustainable energy. Details on the size and timing of the green bonds will follow on Dec. 14, Hoekstra said. “We want financial markets to take an important role in financing green projects. But until now, Dutch pension funds, insurers and banks had to look abroad for safe, green government bonds.” So far, France, Belgium and Ireland are the only euro zone countries to have issued government bonds with the specific aim of financing environmentally friendly projects. Though green bonds make up just a small fraction of the overall bond market, they are attracting more attention because meeting emissions-cut targets will require trillions of dollars of capital from public and private sectors. Global green bond issuance hit a record $155.5 billion in 2017 and could reach $250 billion-$300 billion this year, according to research from the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). In the Netherlands, around a dozen banks and companies have so far issued 15 billion euros worth of green bonds.

2018-10-31,"* Profitable exploration and production outweigh lower refining * Shares lead IBEX for most of trading day * Venezuela pays some dues in cargoes (Recasts, adds shares, detail on Venezuela) By Isla Binnie and Jose Elías Rodríguez MADRID, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Higher oil prices boosted third quarter profit at Spanish oil major Repsol, which also managed to recoup some of the money it had been unable to access due to a crisis in Venezuela. A more than 40 percent rise in the price of crude helped Repsol’s exploration and production business, outweighing a drop in refining income and contributing to an 11 percent rise in adjusted net profit, the company said on Wednesday. Oil companies including BP, Total and Austria’s OMV have posted bumper profits in the past quarter, energised by deep cost cuts since a 2014 downturn and a higher oil price. Repsol’s shares climbed more than 4 percent on the higher profit, while Chief Executive Josu Jon Imaz said the company saw some positive signs from Venezuela, whose oil-rich economy has sunk into crisis under President Nicolas Maduro. Some of the obligations state firm PDVSA has to Repsol were paid in the form of two cargoes in October, and a further two are expected to be delivered before the end of the year. “We were paid with two cargoes, we have already received them in our plants,” Imaz told a conference call. He did not say how much the two cargoes were worth, but added Repsol planned to maintain its current total exposure to Venezuela - 800 million euros ($905 million) in equity, loans and receivables - into the end of the year. A further two cargoes from a Venezuelan gas field Repsol runs with Italy’s Eni  are also expected, Imaz said. Repsol said its hydrocarbon production rose 4 percent in the first nine months to 713,000 barrels per day, while revenue from exploration and production doubled compared to the same period last year. Conversely, the refining and chemicals businesses took a hit from site maintenance in Spain and Portugal. Recurring net profit adjusted for one-off gains and inventory effects (CCS net profit) hit 588 million euros ($667 million), up from 528 million euros in the same quarter of 2017. Repsol bases its targets on a cost of at least $50 per barrel of oil, and has said that speeding up existing projects would be on its agenda if oil prices remain high. Elements of pressure on the price have built in recent days as Russia signalled output will remain high and worries about a global economic slowdown raised the prospect of falling demand. Five electricity plants Repsol bought from Spanish firm Viesgo in June, in line with an industry-wide push into low-emissions businesses, will be integrated into the company’s assets in the coming days, Imaz said. Net debt, a past headache for Repsol, fell to 2.3 billion euros by the end of the third quarter from 2.7 billion euros in the second.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is expected to give details about U.S. President Donald Trump’s Venezuela and Cuba policy on Thursday when national security adviser John Bolton travels to Miami to give an address on Latin America. Days ahead of high-stakes elections in Florida, home to many migrants from the region, Bolton will deliver his remarks at Freedom Tower, a building where Cuban refugees were welcomed in the 1960s after leaving the Communist-controlled island. Almost 2 million Venezuelans have fled since 2015, driven out by food and medicine shortages, hyperinflation, and violent crime. Thousands have made their way to south Florida. Bolton’s speech will come a day after Trump was due to campaign in Florida for Republican candidates in tight Senate and gubernatorial races in the Nov. 6 elections, and a day before former President Barack Obama was scheduled to rally Democrats in Miami. He is expected to be introduced by longtime Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is retiring from Congress. Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American elected to Congress, has been critical of Trump, but supported the hard line he has taken on Cuba. Trump has rolled back parts of Obama’s 2014 detente with Cuba, tightening rules on Americans travelling to the island and restricting U.S. companies from doing business there. But Trump has maintained diplomatic relations re-established under Obama with the former Cold War foe. Trump last month linked Venezuela’s economic collapse to “its Cuban sponsors” in a speech to the United Nations, and Bolton is expected to elaborate on that theme, a senior administration official told reporters earlier this month.  The Trump administration plans to ramp up economic pressure on Cuba’s military and intelligence services, the official said. The White House also wants to increase pressure on Venezuela. On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed working on the issue with Brazil’s new President-elect Jair Bolsonaro. The U.S. government has imposed several rounds of sanctions on Venezuelan military and political figures close to socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who it blames for trampling on human rights and triggering the country’s economic implosion. Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an “economic war” led by U.S.-backed adversaries. Earlier this year, the Trump administration had weighed escalating sanctions by targeting Venezuela’s oil sector, but now sees less immediate need to do so given sagging production by the OPEC member.

2018-10-31,"JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan rebel leader Riek Machar returned to the capital Juba on Wednesday to celebrate a peace deal, more than two years after fierce fighting erupted in the city and forced him to flee the country. To further reinforce the peace deal, President Salva Kiir ordered the release of a jailed advisor to Machar, and a spokesman to his rebel group. Machar flew in with his wife and a small retinue but none of his troops - then met Kiir, his long-time rival, and a line-up of regional leaders who have spent years pressing the two men to end their civil war. “We need peace,” Machar told thousands of people who gathered at a ceremony marking the accord that he, Kiir and other groups signed last month. “We really pray that this peace agreement holds this time,” said 27-year old Juma Khamis in the crowd. Regional and Western powers alike have been exasperated by a string of failed ceasefires and deals.  The world’s youngest nation plunged into conflict in 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. Troops loyal to both men clashed in the capital that December and ethnically charged fighting soon spread across the state, shutting down oil fields, forcing millions to flee and killing hundreds of thousands of people. Kiir said he had ordered the release of an advisor and a spokesman to rebel leader Machar on Thursday. Kiir said retired South African colonel William Endley, who was sentenced to death in February for trying to bring down the government, would be released. “I’ll release him tomorrow and he will be deported to his country,” he said, adding that rebel spokesman James Gatdet will also be released. Gatdet had also been sentenced to death in February on charges of treason and incitement against the government. There have been sporadic incidences of fighting since the latest agreement was signed, but violence has largely died down. Kiir hosted Wednesday’s ceremony near the mausoleum of national hero John Garang - the same spot where the country celebrated its independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of north-south war fuelled by oil, ethnicity and religion. Leaders from Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt and Somalia looked on as traditional dancers entertained the crowds. Machar fled to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fighting broke out again in the capital, wrecking an earlier peace deal and killing hundreds.  He later travelled to South Africa, where he was held under house arrest until earlier this year.  Under pressure from governments in East Africa and from United Nations and Western donors, Machar’s group, other rebel factions and the government last month signed a peace deal, under which he will again become vice president.

2018-10-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC has boosted oil production in October to the highest since 2016, a Reuters survey found, as higher output led by the United Arab Emirates and Libya more than offset a cut in Iranian shipments due to U.S. sanctions. The 15-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has pumped 33.31 million barrels per day this month, the survey on Wednesday found, up 390,000 bpd from September and the highest by OPEC as a group since December 2016. OPEC agreed in June to pump more oil after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb rising prices and make up for an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. Oil LCOc1 hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3 but has since eased to $76 as concerns over tight supplies faded. “Oil producers appear to be successfully offsetting the supply outages from Iran and Venezuela,” said Carsten Fritsch, analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The June pact involved OPEC, Russia and other non-members returning to 100 percent compliance with output cuts that began in January 2017, after months of underproduction in Venezuela, Angola and elsewhere had pushed adherence above 160 percent. In October, the 12 OPEC members bound by the supply-limiting agreement lowered compliance to 107 percent as production rose, from a revised 122 percent in September, the survey found. This is the closest OPEC has moved to 100 percent compliance since the June agreement. The biggest increase has come this month from the UAE. Output in October rose by 200,000 bpd to 3.25 million bpd, the survey found, and could in theory rise further as the UAE says its oil-production capacity will reach 3.5 million bpd by the year-end. The second-largest came from Libya where production averaged 1.22 million bpd, the survey found, a rise of 170,000 bpd. Libyan output remains volatile due to unrest, raising questions about the stability of current OPEC production. Saudi Arabia, after opening the taps in June and then scaling back its plans to pump more, supplied 10.65 million bpd in October, more than in June and close to a record high, the survey found.  The kingdom, OPEC’s top producer, has indicated it is concerned about potential oversupply, raising the prospect that its next production adjustment could be to rein in output. OPEC’s second-largest producer, Iraq, also raised output in October.  Iraqi supply could rise further if Iraq’s new government goes ahead with a deal reached by the outgoing administration and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to resume exporting Kirkuk crude to Turkey via the KRG. Angola, where natural declines at oilfields curbed production in recent years, boosted supply in October due to supply from a new field, Gindungo. Output is still far below its OPEC target. Supply in Nigeria rose by 30,000 bpd. Like Libya, Nigeria is not part of the OPEC supply-cutting pact because it often faces unplanned outages stemming from unrest.  Output in Kuwait edged lower, the survey found. The country had raised production in July following the OPEC deal, and kept it steady in August and September. Among countries with lower output, the biggest drop - 100,000 bpd - occurred in Iran. Exports fell as returning U.S. sanctions discouraged companies from buying the country’s oil, although the decline was lower than some analysts expected. “Iran is going to come in above expectations,” said an industry source who tracks OPEC output, referring to Iranian supply in October. Production also slipped further in Venezuela, where a lack of funds for the oil industry because of the country’s economic crisis is cutting refinery operations and crude exports.  Despite these decreases, OPEC output in October has risen to the highest since December 2016, the month before the supply-cutting pact took effect, according to Reuters surveys.  Some of the extra oil has come from Congo Republic and Equatorial Guinea, which joined OPEC in 2018 and 2017 respectively. Before Congo joined, OPEC had an implied production target for 2018 of 32.78 million bpd, based on cutbacks detailed in late 2016 and Nigeria and Libya’s expectations of 2018 output.  According to the survey, OPEC excluding Congo pumped about 530,000 bpd above this implied target in October. The survey aims to track supply to the market and is based on shipping data provided by external sources, Thomson Reuters flows data and information provided by sources at oil companies, OPEC and consulting firms.

2018-10-31,"NEW YORK, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Robust corporate results helped world stock markets surge on Wednesday, bringing some relief to jittery investors after a brutal October that saw equities suffer one of their worst drops since the financial crisis ten years ago. Strong earnings reports in the U.S. and Europe spurred a broad rally, despite data showing that China’s factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years. Investors rushed into the U.S. dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan languished at a 22-month low. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.6 percent, but remains down 8.2 percent in October, its worst month since 2012. The index has dropped 13 percent from all-time highs hit in January. Still, despite the broad rally, investors remained cautious. “Ultimately I’m still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. “I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 314.71 points, or 1.27 percent, to 25,189.35, the S&P 500 gained 38.95 points, or 1.45 percent, to 2,721.58 and the Nasdaq Composite added 175.69 points, or 2.45 percent, to 7,337.34. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 1.82 percent. The dollar index, tracking it against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.09 percent, with the euro down 0.22 percent to $1.1319. “Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,” said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London. The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly decline and its longest losing streak on record. Gold, set for its best month since January, dipped on the stronger dollar. Spot gold dropped 0.8 percent to $1,212.64 an ounce. U.S. gold futures fell 0.92 percent to $1,214.00 an ounce. The recovery in global stocks, including gains overnight on Wall Street, pushed Treasury yields higher. Benchmark 10-year notes last fell 13/32 in price to yield 3.1586 percent, from 3.109 percent late on Tuesday. Oil prices recovered as markets braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran next week.

2018-10-31,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq’s new oil minister Thamer Ghadhban said on Wednesday the current price of crude was “fair” and that the country, OPEC’s second-largest producer, would act responsibly in providing ample supplies to the market. Ghadhban also said the oil ministry aimed to increase output capacity and support foreign energy companies by helping them overcome any bureaucratic hurdles. OPEC agreed in June to pump more oil after pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb rising prices and to make up for an expected shortfall in Iranian exports. Oil LCOc1 hit a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel on Oct. 3 but has since eased to $76 as concern of tight supplies faded. Iraq, which relies on vast oil wealth as its most important source of income, is seeking to increase crude production capacity to 7 million barrels per day (bdp) by 2022 from 5 million bdp now. Iraq currently pumps around 4.6 million bpd, second only to Saudi Arabia in OPEC.  The country is trying to recover from years of violence including a war with Islamic State militants that wrecked infrastructure and is seeking to reduce corruption and manage rivalries with Kurdish authorities that run oil-rich areas in the north. “We will do our best to stabilize the market,” Ghadhban told reporters after officially taking over the oil portfolio from Jabar al-Luaibi.  “The oil price at the moment is at a fair price,” he said in response to a question about an upcoming OPEC meeting in December. “It’s not too high, it’s not 100 dollars per barrel and it’s not 30 dollars‮”‬. “We will look after our country as a first priority but will not put aside the interests of the consumers.” The International Energy Agency estimates the maximum that Iraq can sustainably pump is 4.8 million bpd, leaving little room to increase output significantly in the short term. The majority of its crude exports go to Asia. Ghadhban, nominated by Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi and confirmed as minister in a parliamentary vote last week, said he would look at ways to reform the oil ministry, including by eliminating nepotism. Ghadhban said he would seek to develop oil refineries by increasing their production capacity and reducing gas flaring. Iraq has continued to flare some of the gas extracted alongside oil at its fields because it lacks the facilities to process it into fuel. Iraq has said it hopes to end gas flaring by 2021. Immediate challenges for Ghadhban and the rest of Iraq’s new government will include how to contend with imminent U.S. sanctions on Iraqi neighbor Iran. Ghadhban said that Iraq would prioritize its own national interests and “review” current exports of oil to Iran, which are estimated at less than 30,000 barrels a day. He said this was a minor issue given the amount. On the subject of resuming oil exports through semi-autonomous Kurdish areas of northern Iraq, he said: “We don’t have any previous issues with the region ... we will work to overcome all obstacles.” Exports from Kirkuk’s oilfields were halted after an Iraqi military offensive to retake the disputed territories which had come under Kurdish control in 2014 following a failed Kurdish independence referendum opposed by Baghdad. The bulk of Iraq’s oil is exported via its southern terminals, which account for more than 95 percent of the OPEC producer’s state revenue. Iraq’s southern oil exports averaged 3.488 million barrels per day (bpd) in October, two oil executives told Reuters on Wednesday.  Exports were down from the September average of 3.560 million bpd owing to bad weather, which slowed shipments on some days, the executives said.

2018-10-31,"(Adds Reuters poll on Bank of Canada interest rate policy) By David Ljunggren OTTAWA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Canada’s economy grew for a seventh month in a row in August, its longest stretch of expansion for more than a year, but analysts said the Bank of Canada was under little pressure to raise interest rates again next month. Statistics Canada said on Wednesday that GDP in August edged up by 0.1 percent. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted no change from July. The last time the country enjoyed such a long, unbroken streak of growth was during the nine months from November 2016 to July 2017. If GDP is flat in September, annualized third-quarter growth should be about 1.8 percent, matching the central bank’s latest forecast. The central bank, which last week raised rates for a fifth time since July 2017, reiterated Tuesday that more hikes would be needed to handle an economy operating near full capacity, with jobless levels hovering around 40-year lows. The bank is due to announce rate decisions in both December and January. “So as long we keep getting growth around that 2 percent rate, it still means the Bank of Canada is probably going to continue hiking interest rates gradually,” said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. Market expectations of an interest rate hike on Dec 5, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, dipped slightly to 33.88 percent from 34.21 percent. In a Reuters poll released on Wednesday, analysts forecast that the Bank of Canada would raise interest rates three times next year, but would do nothing in December. Statscan said the oil and gas extraction sub-sector increased by 1.9 percent in August as total crude output in the oil-rich province of Alberta hit a record high. The finance and insurance sector posted a 1.0 percent gain. The manufacturing sector contracted 0.6 percent, in part because of a 1.9 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly after atypical shutdowns at some auto plants. Overall, 12 of the 20 industrial sectors posted declines. “Rates will eventually need to (rise) ... all in good time of course. No urgency is required on that front, as this so-so growth report suggests,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in September from August on higher prices for chemicals and energy and petroleum products. Analysts had predicted no change. Raw materials prices fell 0.9 percent on less demand for conventional fuel oils. Additonal reporting by Fergal Smith in Toronto, Ross Finley in

2018-10-31,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A 2014 oil spill by a secretive state-run company that flooded an Israeli nature reserve caused 281 million shekels ($76 million) worth of damage, Israel’s Environmental Protection Ministry said on Wednesday.

Worried about national security, the government maintains tight control over EAPC, and much of its business dealings are under military censorship. There is also a criminal investigation into EAPC over what experts called the worst spill in Israel’s history. In December 2014, a pipe burst in southern Israel, pouring millions of liters of oil into a desert nature reserve.

Statistics Canada said on Wednesday that GDP in August edged up by 0.1 percent. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted no change from July. The last time the country enjoyed such a long, unbroken streak of growth was during the nine months from November 2016 to July 2017. If GDP is flat in September, annualized third-quarter growth should be about 1.8 percent, matching the central bank’s latest forecast. The central bank, which last week raised rates for a fifth time since July 2017, reiterated Tuesday that more hikes would be needed to handle an economy operating near full capacity, with jobless levels hovering around 40-year lows. The bank is due to announce rate decisions in both December and January. “So as long we keep getting growth around that 2 percent rate, it still means the Bank of Canada is probably going to continue hiking interest rates gradually,” said Nathan Janzen, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada. Market expectations of an interest rate hike on Dec 5, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, dipped slightly to 33.88 percent from 34.21 percent. Statscan said the oil and gas extraction sub-sector increased by 1.9 percent in August as total crude output in the oil-rich province of Alberta hit a record high. The finance and insurance sector posted a 1.0 percent gain. The manufacturing sector contracted 0.6 percent, in part because of a 1.9 percent drop in motor vehicle assembly after atypical shutdowns at some auto plants. Overall, 12 of the 20 industrial sectors posted declines. “Rates will eventually need to (rise) ... all in good time of course. No urgency is required on that front, as this so-so growth report suggests,” said Doug Porter, chief economist at BMO Financial Group. Separately, Statscan said Canadian producer prices edged up 0.1 percent in September from August on higher prices for chemicals and energy and petroleum products. Analysts had predicted no change. Raw materials prices fell 0.9 percent on less demand for conventional fuel oils.

2018-10-31,"(Changes date of peace deal to last month in par 3) * Machar flies in two years after fleeing country * Man in crowd prays that peace “holds this time” * World powers exasperated by string of failed deals By Denis Dumo JUBA, Oct 31 (Reuters) - South Sudan rebel leader Riek Machar returned to the capital Juba on Wednesday to celebrate a peace deal, more than two years after fierce fighting erupted in the city and forced him to flee the country. Machar flew in with his wife and a small retinue but none of his troops - then met his long-time rival, President Salva Kiir, and a line-up of regional leaders who have spent years pressing the two men to end their civil war. “We need peace,” Machar told thousands of people who gathered at a ceremony marking the accord that he, Kiir and other groups signed last month. “We really pray that this peace agreement holds this time,” said 27-year old Juma Khamis in the crowd. Regional and Western powers alike have been exasperated by a string of failed ceasefires and deals. The world’s youngest nation plunged into conflict in 2013 after Kiir sacked Machar as vice president. Troops loyal to both men clashed in the capital that December and ethnically charged fighting soon spread across the state, shutting down oil fields, forcing millions to flee and killing hundreds of thousands of people. There have been sporadic incidences of fighting since the latest agreement was signed, but violence has largely died down. Kiir hosted Wednesday’s ceremony near the mausoleum of national hero John Garang - the same spot where the country celebrated its independence from Sudan in 2011 after decades of north-south war fuelled by oil, ethnicity and religion. Leaders from Uganda, Ethiopia, Sudan, Egypt and Somalia looked on as traditional dancers entertained the crowds. Machar fled to neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 after fighting broke out again in the capital, wrecking an earlier peace deal and killing hundreds. He later travelled to South Africa, where he was held under house arrest until earlier this year. Under pressure from governments in East Africa and from United Nations and Western donors, Machar’s group, other rebel factions and the government last month signed a peace deal, under which he will again become vice president.

2018-10-31," (This October 30 item corrects headline and paragraph 5 to show capital expenditures were within guidance when excluding Western Gas Partners business) By Liz Hampton HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil producer Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Tuesday fell short of third-quarter profit expectations but said its onshore oil sales hit a record and per-barrel margins had improved.  Total volumes for the quarter rose to 682,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of 9 percent from the same quarter last year. Oil producers are benefiting from a jump in global oil prices, up 44 percent in the third quarter over a year earlier, to near four-year highs.  Anadarko said its onshore oil sales volumes averaged a record 175,000 barrels per day during the quarter, up 37 percent from a year ago after adjusting for divestitures. It posted margins of $33.68 per barrel of oil in the quarter, up 58 percent from a year ago. The company’s oil production volumes in the Delaware Basin, which extends from West Texas to parts of New Mexico, rose to 70,000 barrels per day in the quarter, up 83 percent from a year ago.  Capital total expenditures for the quarter were $1.4 billion. Excluding spending related to the Western Gas Partners business, spending fell within Anadarko’s previous guidance of between $1.05 billion and $1.25 billion. Annual spending is projected to be unchanged at between $4.5 billion and $4.8 billion, it said.  Anadarko reported adjusted net income of $411 million for the third quarter, or 82 cents per share, versus a loss of $427 million a year ago. Analysts had anticipated per-share profit of 84 cents for the quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. Revenue for the quarter totaled $3.7 billion, versus $2.5 billion a year ago.

2018-10-31,"LONDON (Reuters) - Investment in new, large gas storage sites in Britain which can help provide a buffer in times of high demand and reduced supply is seen by operators as unlikely due to market prices offering low returns. This is due to weak gas price spreads, the difference between gas prices in summer and winter, which are not allowing operators to cover their fixed costs. The spread has narrowed in recent years, making it less profitable to buy gas in the warmer months, store it and sell when temperatures fall and prices rise. “If we were to see any new gas storage it will be small-scale and fast-cycle. I would be surprised if saw any more seasonal gas storage,” Roddy Monroe, chair of the Gas Storage Operators Group and former head of regulatory affairs at Centrica Storage, told the Britain’s Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy parliamentary committee on Wednesday. Centrica closed Britain’s largest gas storage facility last year as it had become too costly to maintain the ageing Rough offshore site, leaving the country with storage capacity equivalent to four to five days of winter demand. This was down from 15 days previously and in March this year a cold snap triggered a warning of shortages, driving a spike in wholesale gas prices to their highest in at least a decade. Gas storage is used as a buffer at times of high demand and disrupted supply, which can result from infrastructure outages. Since a government assessment in 2013 suggesting Britain would need to double its existing gas storage capacity, it has halved. And although the gas industry called for a review of Britain’s storage capacity the government declined, saying market forces would ensure there is enough gas. Duncan Burt, director of operations at National Grid, said there are different sources of gas which can be brought into Britain to provide flexibility. “Under severe events (like this March), that system has worked to deliver gas into the storage - whether it is additional gas stored on a boat (liquefied natural gas) or whether through a pipeline...We cannot see the need for specific additional storage,” he told the committee. Since 2008, existing capacity has been either mothballed where investment is required or closed, like Rough, which was Britain’s only long-range storage site. Other sites are medium-range which have much shorter injection and withdrawal times and hold much less gas. To upgrade Rough would have cost less than 1 billion pounds  ($1.3 billion), but the seasonal gas price spread would have had to almost double to around 20 pence per therm from around 10 pence currently to justify this cost, Monroe said. That spread was 50 p/therm 10 years ago, Refinitiv Eikon data shows.

2018-10-31,"WASHINGTON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - A group of Republican senators asked U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday to suspend civilian nuclear talks with Saudi Arabia after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi actions in Yemen and Lebanon. The five U.S. lawmakers, led by Senator Marco Rubio, said they would use the Atomic Energy Act to block any U.S.-Saudi nuclear agreements if Trump did not cut off talks. “The ongoing revelations about the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as well as certain Saudi actions related to Yemen and Lebanon, have raised further serious concerns about the transparency, accountability, and judgment of current decision makers in Saudi Arabia,” the senators wrote. “We therefore request that you suspend any related negotiations for a U.S.-Saudi civil nuclear agreement for the foreseeable future,” said the lawmakers, who included senators Cory Gardner, Rand Paul, Dean Heller and Todd Young. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter, which was first reported by NBC News. Khashoggi, a leading critic of Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, disappeared after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. The death of the Washington Post columnist, a U.S. resident who had American children, sparked global outrage and pitched the world’s top oil exporter into crisis. The United States has called for transparency in the investigation of Khashoggi’s death and revoked the U.S. visas of some Saudis over the incident. Trump has said Prince Mohammed bore ultimate responsibility for what happened to Khashoggi but has also cited Riyadh as a strong ally. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary James Mattis on Tuesday called for a cessation of hostilities in Yemen and urged the start of U.N.-led negotiations to end the civil war next month. Saudi Arabia’s official comments on Khashoggi’s death have shifted from initially denying any involvement to saying the killing was premeditated. Both Saudi Arabia and Turkey are investigating Khashoggi’s death.

The source did not want to be identified because the talks were still ongoing. A deal to buy brokerage services provider Axiom, which was founded in 2006 and has a major presence in the natural gas, petroleum, power, biofuels, and grains markets, would help TP ICAP expand its footprint as an energy broker. TP ICAP declined to comment, while Axiom could not be reached outside regular business hours.  In January, TP ICAP, which brings together buyers and sellers in financial, energy and commodities markets, bought SCS Commodities Corp, a U.S. energy and commodities broker for an undisclosed sum.  TP ICAP was formed after Tullett Prebon’s buyout of its main rival ICAP’s voice-broking business in 2015, and the deal reflected the growing strains on one of London’s trademark industries - the phone-toting brokers who acted as go-betweens for major banks and financial firms in currency, energy and interest rate markets.

2018-10-31,"(Repeats item published earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell MELBOURNE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The mining industry wants to shed its image as a low-tech shoveller of dirt and instead be seen as a cutting edge digital-savvy employer of choice. It’s a feat that could be compared to teaching an elephant to ballet dance. While mining companies have been quick to adopt new technologies to drive costs lower, there is an increasing recognition that the industry needs to embrace the so-called digital revolution if it is to prosper in the future. This means moving well beyond the driverless trains and trucks that have helped Australia’s major iron ore miners cut the cost of producing a tonne of the steel-making material by about two-thirds over the past decade. Harnessing technology, and the people to use it, was an over-arching theme at this week’s International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC). But there was also tacit recognition that the industry is a long way from being attractive to the type of workers it will need if it is to harness the advantages of digital technologies. One speaker at the event related the story of a mining executive addressing students studying technology degrees at a university. When asked for a show of hands of who wanted to work in a high-tech industry committed to innovation and providing the materials needed for an electrified and de-carbonised economy, virtually every hand went up. When the same students were asked to keep their hands up if they wanted to work in mining, and virtually every hand dropped. Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques told the conference that the industry “needs to change the barbecue conversation”. “Our industry is one of least trusted in the world,” he said in his keynote address on Oct. 30. The point is that mining needs to be seen as a positive force for the future of the world, delivering the metals needed for electric vehicles, renewable energy and the technologies that improve lifestyles. While the mining industry talks often about earning the social licence to operate, it appears that there is now some appreciation that its needs to go beyond just engaging with the communities where it operates, and to take its case to the wider public. How mining companies are going to achieve this remains the challenge. The industry hasn’t been exactly that effective in convincing the public, especially in advanced Western democracies, that it is part of the solution to the world’s problems. In many ways the mining industry is losing the public relations battle against environmental activists. Many of the latter fail to distinguish between the various types of commodities being mined, the processes being used in extraction and the usefulness of the resource in helping, or hindering, action against climate change. The fact that mining industry groups are too often linked with coal also hurts the industry as a whole, given the polluting fuel acts as a lightning rod for green activists. Rio’s Jacques made the point that miners should be more engaged with social media, saying “who you are on social media is who you are”. While his own company’s Twitter feed does do more than just parrot company press releases, it has only 60,300 followers. The main Greenpeace feed has 1.72 million, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature has almost 4 million. A scan of Twitter suggests Jacques does not appear to have a verified account in his capacity as Rio CEO, and nor do BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie or Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg. Perhaps if mining companies want to engage young people and convince them that the industry is an exciting, technology-driven place to work, they should do more to reach out directly to them. The opportunities are definitely there. Javier Orellana, the digital transformation lead at industrial software developer Aveva, told IMARC that the industry could save as much as $370 billion by 2025 by adopting digital technologies. Certainly, the nature of conferences like IMARC has changed in recent years, with significantly more presentations on technology and innovation, and a rise in the number of companies highlighting digital technologies, almost to the point where they outnumber the more traditional miners and engineering contractors. There is little doubt that mining companies are keen to embrace more technology. But it also appears that they aren’t quite sure how to win over scepticism among the youth that they will need to do the work.

Sino-U.S. trade tensions, concerns about the global economy and higher U.S. interest rates and fears that corporate earnings’ growth is peaking have combined to shake financial markets this month, leaving most major markets in negative territory for the year. That has spurred predictions that an almost decade-long bull-market has run its course. Data overnight showing that China’s factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years has reinforced worries about weakening growth stemming from the trade conflict with the United States. That followed disappointing euro zone growth data published on Tuesday. Investors rushed into the dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan languished at a 22-month low. A batch of positive earnings set a firmer tone for European stocks on Wednesday, though pan-European indexes are still headed for their weakest month since August 2015. The leading euro zone stock index was up 1.7 percent in early trading, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.7 percent and Germany’s DAX up 1.5 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 increased 1.6 percent. They tracked gains in Asia, where the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.5 percent, bringing month-to-date losses to 10.6 percent. Wall Street was indicated higher at the open, with the S&P 500 e-mini futures 0.7 percent ahead. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.6 percent but remains down 8.2 percent in October, its worst month since 2012. The index is down 13 percent from all-time highs hit in January. “Ultimately I’m still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. “I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.” Concerns over growth in Asia and the euro zone come as the U.S. economy continues to look in healthier shape, spurring fresh demand for the dollar. The greenback, measured against a basket of currencies , scaled a 2018 peak, while the euro nudged up slightly to $1.1350 after data showed euro zone inflation picking up in October. “Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,” said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London. China’s offshore yuan fell to a 22-month low of 6.9795. In onshore markets it was flat at 6.9673 per dollar but remained near a decade low brushed on Tuesday. The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly loss, the longest such losing streak on record. The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent while the Japanese yen was flat at 113.12 versus the dollar, a three-week low. The recovery in global stocks, including gains overnight on Wall Street, pushed Treasury yields higher. The 10-year U.S. bonds rose three basis points to 3.1397 percent. Oil prices recovered as markets braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran next week. O/R U.S. crude futures rose half a percent to $66.49 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, the lowest since mid-August. Brent crude gained more than one percent to $76.75 before settling half a percent up at $76.29. Brent had declined 1.8 percent on Tuesday to two-month lows.

2018-10-31,"(Reuters) - Oil is likely to stay above $75 a barrel, fueled by supply disruptions exacerbated by U.S. sanctions on Iran, but further gains could be limited as economists and analysts see demand growth slowing next year due to trade wars and economic weakness. A survey of 46 economists and analysts forecast Brent crude LCOc1 to average $76.88 a barrel in 2019, up from the $73.75 forecast in September. The price is expected to average $74.48 in 2018, versus the $73.57 average so far this year. Analysts who spoke to Reuters said demand is expected to decelerate in 2019, if concern over a widespread economic slowdown proves to be justified. Overall, global oil demand is projected to grow by between 1.1 and 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, a range that generally falls short of the 1.4 million bpd forecast for next year by the Paris-based International Energy Agency in October. Brent neared $87 a barrel earlier in the year following U.S. efforts to isolate Iran through renewed sanctions, but prices have since edged off those highs and Brent is now around $76.      Analysts worry that there is a lack of spare capacity to deal with potential outages elsewhere once the sanctions take effect on Nov. 4. “On the supply side, concerns (about) falling supplies from a number of OPEC producers - primarily Iran, owing to the renewed U.S. sanctions - and also Venezuela, Angola, Libya and Nigeria, will maintain upward pressure on prices,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports are expected to tighten supply, especially to Asia, which takes most of the country’s shipments. Apart from Saudi Arabia and Russia, few producers can fill any gap left by Iran, according to Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. “I expect (Saudi Arabia and Russia) to raise output if necessary - as a shortage on the supply side and an even higher oil price could be a major risk to the global economy in 2019,” Schallenberger added. For graphic on Reuters monthly oil price forecast vs Brent futures click tmsnrt.rs/2P1BZeb Despite concerns about supply, analysts said headwinds to global growth could hurt demand in the coming year, particularly as the United States and China engage in a trade war that has imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on each other’s goods. On Tuesday, at the Reuters Commodities Summit, Vitol Chief Executive Russell Hardy said the firm had lowered its outlook for oil demand growth to 1.3 million bpd from 1.5 million previously. “Potential variables for global oil demand include U.S.-China trade protectionist policies, emerging-market currency woes and the effects of tighter monetary policy,” said Benjamin Lu, a commodities analyst with Phillip Futures. The IEA said world oil consumption would top 100 million bpd in the final quarter of this year, putting upward pressure on prices, although emerging-market crises and trade disputes could dent this demand. Major producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in June to relax their oil production cuts, but the group said it may need to change course because of rising inventories and economic uncertainties. For graphic on Reuters monthly oil price forecast vs WTI futures click tmsnrt.rs/2P4VVx6 Six of the analysts surveyed expected supply from non-OPEC producers to increase by an average 1.6 million bpd next year, mainly driven by gains in U.S. shale output, which has been constrained by a lack of available transportation capacity. “Current pipeline bottlenecks (in the U.S.) prove to be a short-term obstacle ... The situation should improve next year thanks to the commissioning of additional pipeline capacities,” said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodity analyst at Commerzbank.  The price gap between Brent and WTI crude is expected to narrow as a result of new pipeline capacity coming onstream in the U.S. Midwest next year that will release new U.S. supply on to the global market, Fritsch said. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were forecast to average $70.15 a barrel in 2019, compared with the $67.48 consensus last month.

2018-10-31,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned Iranians they face hard times when new U.S. sanctions take effect on Sunday but said the government would do its best to alleviate them. Washington reimposed a number of sanctions on Iran in May after pulling out of an international 2015 agreement intended to curb Tehran’s nuclear programme. U.S. officials have said they aim to reduce Iran’s oil exports to zero. The Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB) news agency on Wednesday quoted Rouhani as calling the move “a new injustice” which the government did not fear. But he added: “In the past few months our people have faced difficult times and it’s possible that the next few months will be difficult. But the government will use all its power to reduce these problems.” The cost of living has soared in recent months, leading to demonstrations against profiteering and corruption in which  protesters have chanted anti-government slogans. The rial currency has also sunk against the U.S. dollar due to the sanctions threat, with a heavy demand for dollars among ordinary Iranians trying to protect their savings. Iran began selling crude oil to private companies for export on Sunday as part of a strategy to counter the planned sanctions. “You will not be able to reach any of your goals with regard to Iran’s oil,” Rouhani said, according to IRIB. “You will not be able to bring it to zero or reduce it.” Separately, Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Wednesday  280,000 barrels of oil had been sold on Iran’s energy bourse and an additional 720,000 barrels would be offered for sale again on the exchange, according to Oil Ministry news site SHANA.  European powers will implement a so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) under consideration to facilitate trade with Iran next week, Mahmoud Vaezi, the presidency office head, said Wednesday, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). The SPV aims to keep trade flowing when U.S. sanctions hit Tehran. European diplomats have described the SPV proposal as a means to create a barter system, similar to one used by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, to exchange Iranian oil for European goods without money changing hands.

Overall, global oil demand is projected to grow by between 1.1 and 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, a range that generally falls short of the 1.4 million bpd forecast for next year by the Paris-based International Energy Agency in October. Brent neared $87 a barrel earlier in the year following U.S. efforts to isolate Iran through renewed sanctions, but prices have since edged off those highs and Brent is now around $76. Analysts worry that there is a lack of spare capacity to deal with potential outages elsewhere once the sanctions take effect on Nov. 4. “On the supply side, concerns (about) falling supplies from a number of OPEC producers - primarily Iran, owing to the renewed U.S. sanctions - and also Venezuela, Angola, Libya and Nigeria, will maintain upward pressure on prices,” said Cailin Birch, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The U.S. sanctions against Iran’s crude exports are expected to tighten supply, especially to Asia, which takes most of the country’s shipments. Apart from Saudi Arabia and Russia, few producers can fill any gap left by Iran, according to Frank Schallenberger, head of commodity research at LBBW. “I expect (Saudi Arabia and Russia) to raise output if necessary - as a shortage on the supply side and an even higher oil price could be a major risk to the global economy in 2019,” Schallenberger added. Despite concerns about supply, analysts said headwinds to global growth could hurt demand in the coming year, particularly as the United States and China engage in a trade war that has imposed billions of dollars in tariffs on each other’s goods. On Tuesday, at the Reuters Commodities Summit, Vitol Chief Executive Russell Hardy said the firm had lowered its outlook for oil demand growth to 1.3 million bpd from 1.5 million previously. “Potential variables for global oil demand include U.S.-China trade protectionist policies, emerging-market currency woes and the effects of tighter monetary policy,” said Benjamin Lu, a commodities analyst with Phillip Futures. The IEA said world oil consumption would top 100 million bpd in the final quarter of this year, putting upward pressure on prices, although emerging-market crises and trade disputes could dent this demand. Major producers led by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed in June to relax their oil production cuts, but the group said it may need to change course because of rising inventories and economic uncertainties. Six of the analysts surveyed expected supply from non-OPEC producers to increase by an average 1.6 million bpd next year, mainly driven by gains in U.S. shale output, which has been constrained by a lack of available transportation capacity. “Current pipeline bottlenecks (in the U.S.) prove to be a short-term obstacle ... The situation should improve next year thanks to the commissioning of additional pipeline capacities,” said Carsten Fritsch, senior commodity analyst at Commerzbank. The price gap between Brent and WTI crude is expected to narrow as a result of new pipeline capacity coming onstream in the U.S. Midwest next year that will release new U.S. supply on to the global market, Fritsch said. U.S. crude futures were forecast to average $70.15 a barrel in 2019, compared with the $67.48 consensus last month.

2018-10-31,"(Reuters) - The U.S. oil industry has spent a record $30 million to fight a ballot measure in Washington state that would create the nation’s first carbon tax, double what an alliance of green groups and billionaire activists has spent to support it, according to state data reviewed by Reuters. The big-ticket battle reflects the stakes of climate regulation. The oil industry is worried that new curbs on carbon emissions will hobble business, while environmental advocates are concerned that a failure to act soon to halt global warming will spell devastating consequences for the planet. Washington is the nation’s fifth biggest fuel-producing state, with five refineries, according to the Energy Information Administration. It is also among several Democrat-led states that have vowed to pursue climate action in defiance of President Donald Trump’s agenda to ease regulation on fossil fuel companies. The state’s Carbon Emissions Fee and Revenue Allocation Initiative, known as Initiative 1631, would impose a $15 fee on each metric ton of carbon released to the atmosphere, rising $2 a year until the state’s 2035 emissions target is met. It would generate $2.3 billion over five years for clean energy and air programs if it is passed by voters in next week’s election, according to a state analysis. The measure is on the ballot for the Nov. 6 elections. A Crosscut/Elway poll this month showed half of voters approve of the initiative, with 36 percent against and 14 percent undecided. If the measure passes, the oil industry is likely to feel the most pain since transportation is the largest contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in Washington at 43 percent, according to a state report from 2016.  The Western States Petroleum Association raised $31.2 million from oil companies and business groups to oppose the measure, the most ever spent in the state to defeat a ballot initiative, according to state campaign finance data. The previous record was set in 2013, when agriculture and food companies spent $24 million to defeat a measure to require labeling of genetically engineered foods. The anti-carbon tax money has fueled a months-long public relations blitz involving television and digital ads, flyers and mailers that argued the fee would drive up energy costs for consumers, small businesses and farms, and which criticized proposed exemptions for industries like aluminum, pulp and paper, and soon-to-retire coal-fired power plants. “The state’s largest polluters would be exempt from 1631’s new costs, so many big corporations would pay nothing. But families, small businesses and farms would pay billions in higher energy costs,” farmer Rosella Mosby says in one ad while standing in a field on her family’s vegetable farm. Many of the TV ads aired during this month’s Major League Baseball’s World Series, one of the most widely viewed events on television. Dana Bieber, a spokeswoman for the “No on 1631” campaign, said the high spending was justified. “We’re up against a very misleading campaign and we think it’s important that voters have the facts,” she said in an interview. Top donors to the “No on 1631” campaign include BP America (BP.L), which contributed more than $11.5 million, followed by Phillips 66 (PSX.N) with $7.2 million and Andeavor with $4.4 million. All three own refineries in the state. BP spokesman Jason Ryan said his company supports action to combat climate change, but strongly opposes the Washington ballot initiative because it believes it would disrupt the state’s economy without significantly reducing carbon emissions. “It is a poorly designed policy,” he said. Out-of-state refining companies like Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) and HollyFrontier Corp (HFC.N) also contributed, as did the national refining industry lobby group, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers - a sign the industry is concerned the measure could inspire other states to follow suit. By contrast, environmental groups and climate activist billionaires including Bill Gates, Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer and Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of Apple founder Steve Jobs, put together $15.2 million to support the initiative, according to the state Public Disclosure Commission. Top supporters included The Nature Conservancy, which donated $3.05 million, the League of Conservation Voters, which contributed $1.4 million, and Gates and Bloomberg, who each contributed $1 million. The campaign spent $1.8 million of the money on television advertising emphasizing the clean air benefits of a carbon tax, along with spending on mass-mailings, canvassing and voter research. “With Big Oil spending $30 million, that makes it a real fight,” said Bill Holland, state policy director for the League of Conservation Voters. “It has been a frightening amount of money.” Reporting by Nichola Groom; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Leslie Adler",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-election-carbon/big-oil-outspends-billionaires-in-washington-state-carbon-tax-fight-idUKL2N1XA1GC,31 Oct 2018,"The U.S. oil industry has spent a record

2018-10-31,"KUALA LUMPUR, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Coffee farmers in matrilineal villages in a mountainous region of Indonesia are getting assistance from a geothermal energy company, which said it is helping them to grow, roast and find global buyers for their beans. Backed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), PT Supreme Energy Rantau Dedap has been supporting coffee growers in South Sumatra province while building a nearby geothermal power plant. This month, the company began linking them with buyers including PT Fortunium, Rumah Kopi Ranin and Indokom, which supply both the domestic and overseas markets, said company and ADB officials. “We are now reaching out to a global market,” said Viswanathan Ramasubramanian of ADB on Wednesday. “If there is an improvement in coffee quality, it has the potential to attract big sized buyers, which can further improve livelihoods,” he said by phone from the Philippines capital Manila, where ADB is based. The geothermal project on Sumatra, a large and mountainous island west of the capital Jakarta, began in 2011 and is being built with $227 million of the funding provided by the ADB. Coffee-growing communities in the area have a matrilineal culture, which means that women play a key role in society and property inheritance is passed down to the eldest daughter. To make way for the geothermal plant, the company purchased 125 hectares (309 acres) of land from 150 households, which used the proceeds to buy nearby land for coffee farming. Two years ago, Supreme Energy and ADB brought agronomists and other farming experts from Indonesian universities to review the coffee growing practices and provide training to increase yields. After just six months, the annual coffee bean production of many farmers who took part in the training doubled, according to Ramasubramanian. Earlier this year, more coffee specialists were called on to help improve the quality of the beans to eventually help farmers attract higher prices from international buyers. To achieve the best prices, farmers also formed collectives for selling their coffee to local buyers, Ramasubramanian told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The power project also supported the formation of women’s groups in several villagers, with equipment and technology provided to help with coffee roasting, grinding and packaging. “The plan is for the new coffee facilities to be developed step by step, to be mostly operated by local people, and prioritize the employment of women,” said Ismoyo Argo, a senior manager at Supreme Energy.

2018-10-31,"* European shares rally on positive earnings * Dollar hits 16-month high * Offshore yuan at fresh 22-month low * Euro zone, China growth worries persist * Oil recovers slightly after recent falls * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Tommy Wilkes LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Stock markets bounced higher on Wednesday, bringing some relief after a brutal October in which equities have suffered one of their worst drops in a decade and spooked investor confidence. Sino-U.S. trade tensions, concerns about global growth and higher U.S. interest rates and fears that corporate earnings are peaking have combined to shake financial markets in October, leaving most major markets in negative territory for the year. That has spurred predictions that an almost decade-long bull-market has run its course. Data overnight showing that China’s factory growth slowed to its lowest in two years has reinforced worries about weakening growth stemming from the trade conflict with the United States, and followed disappointing euro zone growth data published on Tuesday. Investors rushed into the dollar, sending it to a 16-month high while the offshore Chinese yuan was left to nurse another 22-month low. A batch of positive earnings set a firmer tone for European stocks on Wednesday, although pan-European indexes are headed for their weakest month since August 2015. The leading euro zone stock index was up 1.5 percent in early trading, with the pan-European STOXX 600 up 1.4 percent and Germany’s DAX up 1.3 percent. Britain’s FTSE 100 increased 1.4 percent. The gains follow Asia, where the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1.4 percent, drawing support from gains on Wall Street. The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, rose 0.6 percent but remains down 8.2 percent in October, its worst month since 2012. The index is down 13 percent from all-time highs hit in January. “Ultimately I’m still of the belief that we are in for more downside and rallies are for selling, but squeezes in bear markets are not normally comfortable affairs,” said Neil Campling, co-head of the global thematic group at Mirabaud Securities. “I think a 2-3 day battle toward the top of the downtrend. Then we can return to the bigger picture - the mid-terms (U.S. elections), trade wars, rates etc. once a few shorts have been taken out of the tape.” Fresh concerns over growth in Asia and the euro zone come as the U.S. economy continues to look in healthier shape, spurring fresh demand for the dollar. The greenback, measured against a basket of currencies , scaled a fresh 2018 peak on Wednesday, while the euro laboured near $1.1352, recovering slightly from losses earlier in the week. “Euro zone growth figures have been disappointing and the Bank of Japan is striking a dovish stance at a policy meeting today so there is more room for the dollar to gain from current levels,” said Paul Bednarczyk, director of G10 FX at Continuum Economics based in London. China’s offshore yuan fell to a fresh 22-month low of 6.9795. In onshore markets it was flat at 6.9673 per dollar but remained near a decade low brushed on Tuesday. The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly loss, the longest such losing streak on record. CNY/ The Australian dollar fell 0.3 percent while the Japanese yen was flat at 113.12 versus the dollar, a three-week low. Oil prices recovered as markets braced for the imposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran next week, after dropping to multi-month lows the previous day. O/R U.S. crude futures rose 0.92 percent to $66.79 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, the lowest since mid-August. Brent crude gained 1.11 percent to $76.75 after a decline of 1.8 percent on Tuesday.

2018-10-31,"DHLAIL, Jordan, Oct 31 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Syrian refugee Umm Mohammed fidgeted in her chair in a breezy office in Dhlail city, northern Jordan, before joking: “We don’t know how to sit still.” Along with others who fled conflict in neighbouring Syria, she works with low-income Jordanians in this industrial town famed for its dairy and textile factories. But their work is different: retrofitting homes to make them green. “We want to work - we don’t want to sit around idly. We want to contribute,” she said of her fellow refugees’ motivation. Umm Mohammed - she uses the moniker, which means ‘mother of Mohammed’, to avoid potential difficulties with Syrian officials - is from Deraa, a city close to the Jordanian border. It was the scene in March 2011 of the first major peaceful protests against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Umm Mohammed arrived in Jordan later that year with her husband and four children, carrying just a few pieces of luggage. At first she worked from home, fermenting pickles and making soap to sell in the local market, but she soon became involved with a local women’s project to hand-make straw shading devices that are fitted to windows to keep homes cooler. Her work forms part of a bigger effort - a pilot project to retrofit and build affordable green homes, led by two non-profit organisations: the Jordan Green Building Council (JoGBC) and Habitat for Humanity. The project involves retrofitting existing homes by adding shading devices, solar-thermal water heaters and rainwater collection tanks, and building new homes using green techniques such as reflective paint and double-block brick walls for better insulation. So far, about 48 homes have been retrofitted, while another half-dozen or so have been built from scratch and have near-zero carbon emissions. The JoGBC is hopeful that the project, which cuts emissions and builds community cohesion, will spread to other parts of the country. Making the straw shades suits women who do not want to work in factories with men or who need to work from home due to childcare, Umm Mohammed told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. And doing so has also allowed her to socialise with her Jordanian neighbours. “This project has definitely helped community cohesion in this area,” Umm Mohammed said. “Some of us (Syrians and Jordanians) are like brothers and sisters - we don’t see any difference. The Jordanians are very generous and supportive. But in other areas sometimes they shout at our kids: ‘Why are you still here? Go back to Syria.’ So it varies.” Jordan hosts about 666,000 registered Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations refugee agency (UNHCR), with most living in urban areas. here.pdf Ali Hossein, who fled the fighting in his Syrian hometown of Ghouta in 2013, is one of them. In his paint-stained trousers and sand-coated work boots he works as a blacksmith on the green homes project in Dhlail. “It’s a new and interesting idea. There’s nothing like it yet,” he said of the climate-friendly building skills he has acquired, from double-glazing to roof insulation techniques. “It was very beneficial and provided work opportunities for lots of families, and it really helped us integrate,” he said. Syria’s bloody conflict, now entering its eighth year, has caused half a million deaths and drawn in world and regional powers. More than half of its pre-war population have fled their homes - about 5 million sought refuge abroad, while millions more have been displaced internally. The influx of Syrian refugees came as Jordan already hosts nearly 2.2 million Palestinian refugees, according to 2016 figures from the U.N. Relief and Works Agency. The additional refugees from Syria have put a strain on energy, water and housing demands, and added pressure to Jordan’s ability to meet its obligations under the 2015 Paris climate agreement, said Jordan’s environment minister Nayef Hmeidi Al-Fayez. Although difficult to measure, the environmental impact of the swell in population was a big challenge, he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “All of a sudden whatever plans we had, whatever targets we had, they had to be revisited,” he said in Amman, the Jordanian capital. Amman is one of more than 70 cities worldwide that have pledged to become zero-carbon by 2050. That means they will eliminate nearly all fossil fuel emissions and offset what they cannot through actions such as planting carbon-absorbing trees. And even though Jordan is not a major emitter of greenhouse gases, Al-Fayez said, more people inevitably means more carbon emissions. “Sometimes there are things that will slow us down, but they will never stop us,” he said. For many low-income Jordanians the attention and funds directed towards refugees from Syria are a source of tension. “Some people ask: ‘Why are all the grants going to Syrians?’” said JoGBC project coordinator Aya Rabab’ah. “Many conflicts started so we worked for the development of the host community with the engagement of the Syrians, so in this way we’re reducing the conflicts and trying to create more cohesion.” For Jordanian Ibtisam Al-Mimar, the green homes project has healed community rifts and helped the climate. “We made friendships and became a community through the work,” said Al-Mimar. “Some of us have intermarried, we work together. Relations are becoming better as we mix, and more cohesion is visible.” Rabab’ah said solving the dual issues of housing and community cohesion meant the green homes were both lowering emissions and, as word spread, becoming more popular. There are now waiting lists in several parts of Jordan with families keen to lower their costs and emissions, and with builders looking to market their green credentials. Amman’s chief resilience officer Nisreen Al-Araj - a city official who works across local government departments and the mayor’s office - said more refugees meant more pressure on the capital’s aging infrastructure. But, she said, having Jordanians and Syrians work together could bring opportunities - provided people’s mindsets changed. “The children who are living today of those refugees, it’s very possible that they are the Jordanians of tomorrow,” Al-Araj told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Meantime many Syrian refugees dream of going home, including Umm Mohammed. However, that is not possible: in August, the UNHCR said conditions were not yet ready for mass refugee returns to Syria. In the meantime, “we are becoming Jordanian,” said Umm Mohammed. ""There's nothing left for us back at home,"" she said. ""They've taken our land, our homes - and most of my relatives are dead.""

2018-10-31,"* CFO says slower China growth was a return to normal * Clariant not expecting repercussions from Saudi stake * Turkey, South Africa dented sales in period (Adds details about Chinese slowdown, Saudi stake, comments from analysts and CFO) ZURICH, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Clariant, in which Saudi Basic Industries (SABIC) owns a quarter of the shares, stuck to its full-year outlook despite soft Chinese demand and turbulence in Turkey and Africa that led to slower third-quarter growth. Third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) hit 241 million Swiss francs ($239.78 million), the speciality chemicals group said on Wednesday, compared to a 247 million franc average in a Reuters poll. Sales rose 5 percent in local currencies to 1.6 billion francs, compared to 1.627 billion in the poll, decelerating from the 7 percent second-quarter rate. Clariant, which took on four new board members from SABIC this month amid the crisis over the killing of a journalist in the Saudi embassy in Istanbul, said its business in China grew only 9 percent, down from 20 percent rates recorded in recent quarters. Though some customers in China’s electronics industry are braced for a trade war with the United States, Chief Financial Officer Patrick Jany said Clariant was more affected as contracts for its catalysts — chemicals that speed up the manufacturing of other products — that were spurring above-average growth came to an end. “I understand the concern,” Jany said. “(But) the 9 percent we show now in the third quarter is not a reflection of a significant slowdown. It is probably more the normal days you would expect to have in China.” Its catalyst sales fell 4 percent, which analysts at Zuercher Kantonalbank said were worse than expected but were offset by a better performance of care chemicals for soaps and by Clariant’s plastics and coatings business. The shares were up 1.9 percent at 0830 GMT. Clariant shares year-to-date are down more than a fifth. The Muttenz-based company confirmed its 2018 outlook of achieving sales growth in local currency, higher operating cash flow and an improvement in profit margins. Still, operating profit as a percentage of sales stagnated at 15 percent in the quarter and at 15.3 percent in the first nine months, shy of the 20 percent it is aiming for by 2021 as it deepens its SABIC partnership. The slowdown in the Middle East and Africa, where sales slipped 1 percent, was largely driven by Turkey, where a crumbling lira hit results, and South Africa’s recession. Though Riyadh-controlled SABIC is Clariant’s biggest shareholder, Jany did not foresee much impact should the kingdom face global sanctions over Jamal Khashoggi’s death. “It may have some repercussions on growth in some markets ... but on our business, no consequence at all,” Jany said. “I think that’s a separate evolution.” ($1 = 1.0051 Swiss francs) (Reporting by John Miller, editing by John Revill and David Evans)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/clariant-results/update-2-clariant-says-softer-china-turkish-downturn-weigh-on-growth-idUKL8N1XB11L,31 Oct 2018,"* Turkey, South Africa dented sales in period

2018-10-31,"* Largest SWFs: tmsnrt.rs/2tskfub By Gwladys Fouche OSLO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Norway’s $975 billion wealth fund, the world’s largest, wants to know how much of a company’s carbon dioxide emission costs can be passed on to customers. The fund holds 1.4 percent of all globally listed shares, representing 9,000 companies, so a lot is at stake for the fund as it considers how to allocate investments amid rising climate-related costs. Norges Bank Investment Management is turning to data analytics, building a software tool that can help guide the process. Called Angle, the software can now take non-financial data, such as carbon dioxide emissions, combine it with trading data and earnings data of a given company, and see how it will affect its earnings in the years ahead. The next step, which has not been disclosed before, is to develop the platform to see how much of the carbon cost can be passed on to customers and how much companies must pay themselves. “For us, it is reasonably obvious that the focus on climate change risk will not go away and that is there as a risk for the companies (we invest in), whether directly or indirectly,” fund CEO Yngve Slyngstad said in an interview. “Therefore, there is an issue about the pricing of different companies,” he told Reuters, adding that the latest development of the software was not yet completed. “There is more work to be done on it,” he said. The work began when the fund was mandated by the Norwegian Parliament to divest from companies that derive 30 percent of more of its business or activities from thermal coal in 2015. “We needed the data (to analyse) utilities’ energy mix, but it has developed to see if it can be used to other sectors,” said Slyngstad. Other institutional investors are also pushing companies to disclose the data they need to assess the climate-change risk to their investments. “The Norwegian sovereign wealth fund is one of the leading institutional investors when it comes to the analysis of climate risk,” Stephanie Pfeifer, chief executive of the institutional investors group on climate change, a group of 163 pension funds and asset managers representing over 21 trillion euros ($23.8 trillion) in assets. “They have put resources in the research that others have not necessarily done. They have had the capacity to do so,” she told Reuters. Still, while disclosing climate-related data is becoming more mainstream, few companies disclose the financial impact on their businesses, a survey by a G20 task force showed in September. For Slyngstad, the key is to get hold of data. Once you get hold of good data, he said, you can go from “words to action”. “The only surprise (with this work) is how hard it is to get the data,” said Slyngstad. “I think it will take years to get good data from the majority of companies we are invested in.” $1 = 0.8812 euros",https://uk.reuters.com/article/norway-swf/norway-wealth-fund-builds-tool-to-analyse-climate-risk-to-portfolio-idUKL8N1X930R,31 Oct 2018,"Norway's $975 billion wealth fund,

2018-10-31,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s resurgent nuclear industry will miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country’s electricity by 2030, a Reuters analysis shows. With eight reactors running and one more set to come online in November, nuclear has this year overtaken non-hydro renewables in power output for the first time since the 2011 catastrophe, when all of the country’s nuclear plants were idled. Yet operators can expect as few as six units to restart in the next five years, and fewer than 20 by 2030, the analysis shows. That is far short of the 30 needed to meet the government target reiterated this year.     Based on the analysis, the world’s third-largest economy may get about 15 percent of its power from nuclear in 2030, compared with a government target of 20-22 percent.  “It’s impossible to meet the target, that’s pretty much confirmed,” said Takeo Kikkawa, an energy studies professor at Tokyo University of Science, who sat on an official panel that reviewed Japan’s energy policy this year. He said he did not expect another round of restarts before 2020. One major trading house predicts nuclear will account for 14 percent of power production in 2030, according to a presentation given at a private seminar this year and shown to Reuters. Nuclear remains an unpopular energy option in Japan and the country will reboot only a fraction of the 54 reactors it had before the disaster. Six reactors at Fukushima Daiichi are being dismantled in a decades-long exercise that is fraught with technological challenges and radioactive waste. Operators have decided to decommission another 10 units across the country since Fukushima. The Nuclear Regulation Authority created new safety standards from scratch after the disaster highlighted failings in the industry and its overseers. All reactors must be relicensed before restarting.         Yet Japan’s nuclear industry, which before Fukushima operated the world’s third-largest number of reactors and provided about 30 percent of the country’s electricity, has staged a significant recovery. The turnaround has exceeded expectations of analysts and the utilities themselves. Kansai Electric Power and Kyushu Electric Power, for instance, have won approval to restart or are on course to win approval for all the reactors they applied to relicense.         Those units are far from Tokyo and are pressurised water reactors (PWR), unlike the boiling water reactor (BWR) designs favoured in eastern Japan, including those that melted down at Fukushima.  Many court cases are pending for reactors in the east of the country. Local political support varies, and the regulator is locked in disputes with operators over earthquake risk assessment. The older BWR technology used in many of the reactors under review is also an issue because the stigma of Fukushima hangs over them. “When you come to the BWRs, the issue becomes very politicized,” said Nobuo Tanaka, the chairman of the Sasakawa Peace Foundation who was the head of the International Energy Agency between 2007 and 2011 after a stint in Japan’s industry ministry. The reputation of Tepco, which operates two nuclear plants that have been damaged in natural disasters, also looms large, Tanaka said. “Tepco does not have any support as a nuclear operator,” he said. The utility has to be removed from the equation before progress on BWR reactors can be made, he said.  Tepco has reached the first stage of approval, but faces strong opposition from local residents. But Japan’s utility lobby group said progress was being made.  “The safety reviews of PWR plants took time but they have been progressing steadily and there have been some developments in the BWR category as well,” Satoru Katsuno, the chairman of Japan’s federation of electric utilities and president of Chubu Electric, said of the outlook for restart approvals. Chubu Electric has been locked in a dispute for years with the regulator over disaster resilience measures at its Hamaoka plant, which uses BWR reactors.     For graphic on Status of Japan's reactor fleet, click tmsnrt.rs/2OTpNfA The analysis suggests that Japan will rely on fossil fuels, particularly liquefied natural gas and coal, as the pace of renewables expansion slows. That will make it harder to meet its emissions targets under international agreement.  The government estimates costs for replacement fuel – mostly liquefied natural gas - to compensate for idled reactors totalled 14.6 trillion yen ($130 billion) across the industry in the six years through March. The lack of realistic energy targets makes it harder for the industry to plan for investment, utility officials say. And the issue of disaster resilience is not going away: a big earthquake struck the northern island of Hokkaido in September and left a nuclear plant reliant on backup generators.

2018-10-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesia has enforced mandatory use of diesel containing 20 percent locally produced biofuel amid steps to rein in its fuel bill and cushion the impact on its economy of a currency crisis and higher oil prices, a government official told Reuters. Speaking on the sidelines of the Singapore International Energy Week conference, deputy energy minister Arcandra Tahar said Jakarta in September made use of the fuel, known as B20, mandatory in all diesel machinery in the country in a move to curb gasoil imports. Major emerging Asian economies including Indonesia have been hit hard this year by rising crude oil prices, which despite declining this month are still up by about 15 percent since the start of 2018, while the rupiah, Indonesia’s currency, has hit a 20-year low this year.  “Is there any impact the rupiah and oil prices will have on our economy? Yes... Do we have a corrective action? Yes, we do,” said Tahar. While industry watchers have been debating the possibility of Indonesia introducing fuel price controls, as India did this month amid similar troubles, Jakarta has yet to announce any such move. Although Indonesia is an exporter of crude oil itself, it imports even more refined products, including gasoline and diesel. That is putting huge pressure on the government budget and Pertamina, the country’s state-owned oil company, which is being squeezed between government fuel polices, higher oil prices and the rupiah’s slide. Tahar said he expected Indonesia’s use of B20 fuel in the farming sector to increase to 6 million kilolitres next year, from the current nearly 4 million kilolitres. Southeast Asia’s largest economy is also trying to boost the locally sourced fuel content in the oil, gas and mining sectors by giving them a 2-4 percent cut of gross tax revenue if they use at least 30 percent of local content, he said. “If you have gross revenue of $10 billion and using 35 percent of local content, you are going to get an incentive of 2 percent or around $200 million,” Tahar said. “That’s a huge number compared to the cost saving you may get if you import from another country.” Last month, Jakarta’s trade ministry issued a requirement to use letters of credit from banks affiliated with Indonesian banks to help shore up the ailing rupiah. This will apply to the mining sector, Tahar said. A Pertamina official said last week that it is looking to buy crude oil purchases in other currencies to reduce spending of foreign exchange in U.S. dollars.  Tahar said, however, that would be difficult as the main oil market in Singapore trades in U.S. dollars. In the electricity sector, meanwhile, Indonesia is switching primary sources of power plants from diesel to crude palm oil, he said, also a move to reduce the country’s exposure to high oil prices. In the longer term, he said Indonesia plans to encourage the use of electric vehicles as it pushes to shake off its dependency on oil imports and boost energy security. He did not give specific examples of how the government would boost usage of electric vehicles. But he said oil product demand growth for next year will remain steady at 3-4 percent.

2018-10-31,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian oil and gas group OMV (OMVV.VI) lifted third-quarter profit by 31 percent, largely thanks to higher oil prices and lower production costs, and said it expects a strong rise in output for the rest of the year.  Unlike other European energy groups, OMV is sticking with fossil fuels but shifting its focus from oil to gas because of its lower carbon dioxide emissions. The jump in third-quarter earnings announced on Wednesday echoed soaring profits at oil majors BP (BP.L), Total (TOTF.PA) and Repsol (REP.MC), all boosted by oil prices that hit a four-year high in the period. OMV said it now expects the Brent oil price to average $74 a barrel in 2018, up from a previous forecast of $70. Shares in the company were up 3.3 percent at 48.50 euros in early trade. OMV said that daily production in the fourth quarter will be “slightly higher” than the 437,000 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in the first quarter, its strongest this year, OMV said.  The company produced 406,000 boe/day in the third quarter, down from  419,000 boe/day in the second quarter, largely because of maintenance work in Russia and Austria and the sale of its Pakistan exploration business. However, it forecast output to reach 500,000 boe/day by the end of the year, helped by the start-up of production at Abu Dhabi’s SARB and Umm Lulu offshore oilfields and at the Aasta Hansteen gas field in Norway.      Its main profit measure, which excludes special items and inventory gains or losses, rose nearly a third year on year to 1.05 billion euros ($1.19 billion) in the third quarter, beating the average forecast of 929 million euros in a Reuters poll of analysts. However, net income attributable to stockholders declined to 221 million euros from 439 million a year earlier, largely due to a significant increase in taxes, the group said. Its tax rate rose to 46 percent from 21 percent, largely because of high taxes in Norway and Libya.     OMV, which targets growth in low-cost countries outside Europe and has declared Southeast-Asia a new core market, confirmed that it expects to close the purchase of gas fields in New Zealand at the end of the year.  It also said it was continuing negotiations with Malaysian Sapura Energy (SAEN.KL), in which it wants to purchase a 50 percent stake.

2018-10-31,"* Volatile refinery margins: tmsnrt.rs/2PyVlXM * Fuel oil and gasoil cracks soar, gasoline plummets * Fuel oil supported by looming Iran sanctions * IMO 2020 pushes up gasoil profits * ‘These cracks are extraordinary’ - Trifecta By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Oil product margins have been tossed around on a wild rollercoaster ride in October, as factors like impending Iran sanctions, the Sino-American trade war and upcoming new shipping regulations yank fuel profits up, down and back again. Some margins, known as cracks, including for Asian fuel oil and gasoil have boomed, while others, like Asian and European gasoline cracks, have plunged. Asia’s cracks for gasoil and fuel oil have gained 16.3 percent and a whopping 124.3 percent, respectively, since the start of the year - with most of the jump happening this month. “These cracks are extraordinary,” said Sukrit Vijayakar, director of Indian energy consultancy Trifecta. Vijayakar, a veteran of India’s refining industry, said such high gasoil and fuel oil cracks should move a refiner to maximise these products. “Keenly aware that these cracks are extraordinary, he (the refiner) should protect such production decisions by hedging the cracks...as an insurance to protect windfall gains,” Vijayakar said. The margin on fuel oil - a residue from crude processing - is typically negative. In the last week of October, however, it stood at around $1 per barrel, pushed up in part by tightening supply ahead of sanctions against Iran, a major supplier of fueloil, which the United States will impose from next week. Another strong performer has been distillate fuel, including gasoil. One of the biggest drivers here has been new regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). This will force shippers to adopt cleaner fuel standards from 2020, and it pushing up demand for low-sulphur gasoil made from heavy crude. “In an IMO 2020 world, we expect distillate margins will increase,” Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday in a note to clients. “We expect refiners with...access to heavy crude barrels and high-distillate yields to benefit most from the regulations.” Not all has been rosy in refining. This year has been particularly painful for refiners specialised in churning out gasoline. Booming auto sales in emerging markets and especially China , which sells more than 2 million new cars every month, but also healthy demand from the United States, have in the past made gasoline a favourite among refiners, many of whom maximised its yield. That boom has turned into a bust as refiners now pump more than even this growing market can absorb, eroding profit margins. European refiners sent their excess fuel to Asia, hoping to find a home there for their surplus petrol. This came just as China’s massive refinery sector started exporting excess gasoline as even its thirsty domestic market couldn’t cope with the flood of fuel. Analysts say things may get worse, especially if an economic slowdown on the back of widespread emerging market currency weakness and the Sino-American trade war sucks demand out from under a sector already swamped by glut. “Gasoline fundamentals continue to deteriorate and are a source of concern for us,” Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday.

2018-10-31,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s battle against toxic air pollution is becoming increasingly difficult but the government will not relent in its efforts even as the economy slows, an environment ministry official told reporters on Wednesday. China has been shutting vast swathes of industrial capacity, curbing traffic and cutting coal use in pollution-prone regions of the north, but the Ministry of Ecology and Environment warned last week that an economic slowdown was making the campaign against smog more challenging. Last winter, factories complained their businesses were hurt after indiscriminate production cuts forced them to close whether they had installed pollution controls or not. With July to September economic growth at its slowest quarterly rate since 2009, Beijing is adopting a more nuanced approach this year.     But while the government has set more pragmatic targets based on actual economic conditions, poor weather is expected to make pollution-prone northern regions even more vulnerable to smog this winter, and the campaign will be even more strenuous, said Liu Youbin, spokesman for the environment ministry. “When making this winter plan, we have to make sure it is feasible and achievable and it cannot be too forward-looking - it will get harder and harder in the future to reduce pollution,” Liu said.    “It is biased and not accurate to say China will relax pollution-cutting measures,” he added. Though smog has been cut rapidly during a “war on pollution” now in its fifth year, environmental groups have warned that China has been “backsliding” on its environmental commitments, allowing coal consumption and climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions to creep back up. Coal use fell in 2014 and 2015, but it has since recovered, and carbon emissions could end up overtaking the 2013 record, estimated at 9.53 gigatonnes.      But China’s senior climate change official Li Gao told the Wednesday briefing that while coal consumption has been on the increase, the country’s coal-fired power plants are among the world’s most efficient, and the share of coal-fired power continues to decline. “Energy consumption is closely connected to economic development and affected by the economic situation,” he said.  “Coal-fired power does have appeal to local governments if not considering external conditions, so it will take time to tackle this problem...It’s normal to see some volatility on coal use in some years but our core policy is not changing, and that volatility will not stop us reaching the targets,” said Li in the sideline of the briefing.

A confluence of factors ranging from Sino-U.S. trade tensions to worries about global economic growth, higher U.S. interest rates and company earnings have spurred volatility in financial markets in the past few weeks. But shares in Europe were expected to follow Asia’s lead higher on the last day of the month, while U.S. S&P mini-futures edged up 0.3 percent. Spreadbetters saw London’s FTSE 100 opening 0.68 percent higher at 7,084, Frankfurt’s DAX opening up 0.87 percent at 11,386 points, and Paris’ CAC 40 up 0.82 percent at the open. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 1 percent, drawing support from gains on Wall Street overnight. Yet it was on track to fall around 11 percent this month, which would be its worst monthly performance since September 2011. The index had dropped to its lowest level since February 2017 on Monday as worries over corporate profits weighed heavily on U.S. equities. The MSCI AC World index, which includes a few large emerging markets in addition to developed markets, was down 8.6 percent this month and has lost about $4 trillion in value. The narrower MSCI World Index was down 8.43 percent and has wiped out $4.5 trillion in October. Wall Street’s main indexes had jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following the steep recent pullback for equities. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 1 percent on Wednesday and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1.2 percent as weaker-than-expected factory activity data reinforced views that Beijing will roll out more support measures for the economy. Australian stocks ended 0.4 percent higher, South Korea’s KOSPI added 0.7 percent. In Japan, the Nikkei advanced 2.2 percent, reassured by the Bank of Japan’s signal that it will keep its ultra-easy policy for some time to come. “The recent slide in equities had gone to such an extent that it was bound to invite buyers, such as in the Japanese stock market,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Ichikawa said the U.S.-China trade row will likely remain a factor of concern beyond the U.S. midterm elections on Nov. 6. U.S. President Donald Trump said during an interview with Fox News late on Monday that he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade. But he also said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was at 97.034, down from a 16-month peak of 97.063 after data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October, suggesting strong economic growth could persist in the near term. The dollar traded near three-week highs against the yen following the BOJ’s decision to hold fire on rates. At around 0637 GMT, one greenback cost 113.21 yen. The euro was flat at $1.1344 after losing 0.25 percent the previous day. A dip below $1.1336 would take the single currency to its lowest since mid-August. China’s yuan was flat at 6.9673 per dollar in onshore trade but remained near a decade low brushed on Tuesday. The Chinese currency was on track for a loss of 1.4 percent in October, its seventh straight monthly loss — the longest such losing streak on record. The yuan has been pressured by worries about slowing Chinese economic growth and a potential sharp escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. Data on Wednesday showed China’s manufacturing sector expanded at its weakest pace in more than two years in October, and showed a deepening slump in export orders. The Australian dollar was down 0.2 percent at $0.70925 , weighed by soft domestic inflation data. The downbeat China factory growth data was also a drag on the Aussie. The Indian rupee fell as much as 0.6 percent on reports that the central bank governor may consider resigning amid growing tensions with the government. Oil prices recovered slightly after dropping to multi-month lows the previous day on signs of rising supply and concern that global demand for fuel will fall victim to the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. crude futures were up 0.38 percent at $66.43 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, the lowest since mid-August. Brent crude gained 0.62 percent to $76.38 after a decline of 1.8 percent on Tuesday. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney

2018-10-31,"BEIJING, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Three cities in China’s northern province of Hebei have issued second-level or ‘orange’ pollution alerts, a state-back newspaper reported on Wednesday, forcing industrial plants to cut output.

Under an orange alert, the second-highest warning behind red in China’s four-tier system, steel mills must halve their output, while coal-fired power utilities must operate at “minimum” levels. The move comes after the country’s environment watchdog warned that smog was likely to blanket Hebei from Oct.31 to Nov.5 due to high temperatures and humid conditions.

2018-10-31,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Japan’s Osaka Gas Co Ltd is considering expanding its Southeast Asia operations, a top executive said, tapping a region where natural gas demand is booming but domestic reserves are dwindling fast. Graphic: World LNG demand - tmsnrt.rs/2ORBpj8 Osaka Gas, one of the world’s biggest gas utilities and importers of liquefied natural gas (LNG), is increasingly turning abroad as it faces faltering demand at home due to a mature market and shrinking population. One opportunity is Vietnam, Kazuhisa Yano, Executive Chairman and Chief Asia Representative of Osaka Gas, told the Reuters Commodity Summit interview series. Vietnam is one of Asia’s fastest-expanding energy markets due to a large population and sharp economic growth, but reserves at its existing oil and gas fields are declining fast. “We will ... study Vietnam’s gas market,” Yano said on Tuesday, talking to Reuters while attending an industry conference in Singapore. “There are several industry parks in Vietnam, and (there is) demand for gas for such kinds of industrial (purposes).” Vietnam does not currently import any LNG, but is planning to start in coming years, like other Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said this week that Southeast Asia is at the heart of future LNG demand growth, which it expects to increase by a third globally to 500 billion cubic meters (370 million tonnes) by 2023. While Osaka Gas reviews Vietnam as a potential market, it will also look into expanding its current operations in the region. The firm already has subsidiaries for operations such as sales and trading in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, Yano said. Like Vietnam, domestic gas reserves are running out in the Philippines, and LNG will soon be needed to meet demand from new power generation projects. Yano said Osaka Gas was considering entering that market as a supplier. In Indonesia, which is still an LNG exporter but where dwindling reserves and a lack of investment have also resulted in falling production, Osaka Gas in October announced the launch of a natural gas joint marketing business with Indonesia’s state-owned Pertamina. Yano said Osaka Gas was also considering investment into LNG receiving terminals and power generation assets in Indonesia.

A confluence of factors from Sino-U.S. trade tensions to worries about U.S. corporate earnings to the end of easy money in development economies have spurred volatility in financial markets in the past few weeks. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 1 percent higher on Wednesday afternoon, drawing support from gains on Wall Street overnight. Yet, it was on track to fall around 11 percent this month, which would be its worst monthly performance since September 2011. The index had dropped to its lowest level since February 2017 on Monday as worries over corporate profits weighed heavily on U.S. equities. Wall Street’s three stock indexes had jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following the steep recent pullback for equities. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.84 percent on Wednesday and the Shanghai Composite Index climbed 1 percent, with gains reflecting investor optimism about policymakers’ pledges of support despite weak factory activity data for this month. Australian stocks ended 0.43 percent higher, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.69 percent and Japan’s Nikkei advanced 2 percent, reassured by the Bank of Japan’s signal to keep its ultra-easy policy for some time to come. “The recent slide in equities had gone to such an extent that it was bound to invite buyers, such as in the Japanese stock market,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. The MSCI AC World index, which includes a few large emerging markets in addition to developed markets, was down 8.6 percent this month and has lost about $4 trillion in value. The narrower MSCI World Index was down 8.5 percent and has wiped out $4.5 trillion in October. Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the outlook for markets was still cloudy, adding that the U.S.-China trade row will “likely to remain a factor of concern beyond the U.S. midterm elections.” U.S. President Donald Trump said during an interview with Fox News late on Monday that he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade. But he also said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies extended overnight gains and was near a 16-month peak of 97.054 after data on Tuesday showed U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October, suggesting strong economic growth could persist in the near term. The dollar traded near three-week highs against the yen following the BOJ’s decision to hold fire on rates. At around 0540 GMT, one greenback cost 113.28 yen. The euro was down 0.04 percent to $1.1339 after losing 0.25 percent the previous day. A dip below $1.1336 would take the single currency to its lowest since mid-August. China’s yuan was flat at 6.9670 per dollar in onshore trade but remained near a decade low of 6.9724 brushed on Tuesday. The yuan has been pressured by worries about slowing Chinese economic growth and a potential sharp escalation in the U.S.-China trade war. New data released Wednesdsay showed China’s manufacturing sector expanded at its weakest pace in more than two years in October, and showed a deepening slump in export orders. The Australian dollar was down 0.2 percent at $0.7091 , weighed by soft domestic inflation data. The lacklustre October China factory growth data was also a drag on the Aussie. Oil prices recovered slightly after dropping to multi-month lows the previous day on signs of rising supply and concern that global economic growth and demand for fuel will fall victim to the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. crude futures were up 0.51 percent at $66.52 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, their lowest since mid-August. Brent crude gained 0.63 percent to $76.39 per barrel after a decline of 1.8 percent on Tuesday. Additional reporting by Swati Pandey in Sydney

2018-10-31,"(Reuters) - Faraday Future co-founder Nick Sampson has quit his executive post at the Chinese electric vehicle developer, the latest blow to the troubled company that said it was experiencing “extraordinary financial hardship.” Sampson was senior vice president for product strategy and is the second of three co-founders to resign in just over a year, leaving only Chief Executive Jia Yueting. His exit announced on Tuesday comes as Faraday is embroiled in a bitter legal fight with its largest shareholder, China’s Evergrande Health Industry Group Ltd, following a planned $2 billion investment that went sour. The company’s problems underscore the challenges that EV manufacturers face in bringing problem-free cars to market - a feat even Tesla, the biggest U.S. automaker by market value, has struggled to do. Faraday Future (FF) has placed some employees on unpaid leave through December and offered others the option of taking leave for the same period of time, the company told Reuters in an emailed statement. This move comes days after Faraday said it was planning layoffs and salary cuts. The company said Peter Savagian, its senior vice president for global product and technology, had stepped down as well. “Recent actions taken by Evergrande is causing FF to experience extraordinary financial hardship,” Faraday said.  “The investor has intervened in the company’s capital planning and is preventing FF from utilizing our assets, which requires FF to take some very difficult yet necessary actions,” it added. Evergrande Health, a unit of property giant China Evergrande Group, owns 45 percent of Faraday. Evergrande Health was not immediately available for comment.  Faraday is free to seek financing from sources other than Evergrande Health, according to an interim ruling earlier this month by a Hong Kong arbitration court. But the ruling comes with stringent conditions and gives Evergrande Health preferential rights to any new share issue by Faraday. Faraday, which began in 2014, lost another co-founder Tony Nie in October last year. Jia, Faraday’s CEO, is best known for starting the tech conglomerate LeEco, which is struggling with high debts after expanding too quickly. Faraday, which posted a net loss of $340 million last year, said last month that a preproduction model of its first vehicle, the FF 91, was presented to employees on Aug. 29 ahead of schedule.

2018-10-31,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s market regulator will set up a system to recall vehicles that violate the country’s pollution and emissions standards, it said on Wednesday, with cars now the biggest source of smog in major cities.  China’s air quality is going to come under even further pressure, with another 100 million vehicles set to ply its roads in the coming five years, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in comments posted on its website.  The nation’s newly revised air pollution law includes provisions to recall vehicles that fail to meet state emissions standards, it said, and it has already studied similar product recall systems in the United States, Europe and Japan.  The regulator is currently studying key issues like the identification of equipment defects and the quality of key components used in reducing engine emissions, but it will work with the environment ministry to draw up new legislation and aims to implement the new system as soon as possible.  Though China has been cracking down on factory emissions and curbing the consumption of coal, vehicle pollution remains a growing problem, increasing lung-damaging, ground-level ozone levels in many major cities.  China’s total vehicle fleet reached 310 million last year, and cars were responsible for about 45 percent of air pollution in the capital, Beijing, and nearly 30 percent in Shanghai, according to figures from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment earlier this year.  China eliminated more than 20 million old and substandard vehicles from its roads last year to cut pollution, and it has also banned the sale of low-grade, high-emissions diesel.  Its “China VI” fuel standards, which are tougher than those used in the European Union, have already been introduced in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region - known for its heavy smog - and will be made mandatory nationwide at the beginning of next year.  Top refiner Sinopec is upgrading its refineries to produce fuel to comply with the new standards.  But enforcing the standards has been a challenge, with fraudulent practices believed to be widespread. Some garages have been found selling equipment to cheat fuel quality detectors, and the environment ministry said in July it had shut as many as 639 substandard vehicle testing stations last year.  The ministry also fined two truck makers late last year for manufacturing and selling vehicles that failed to meet environmental standards.

2018-10-31,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell MELBOURNE, Oct 31 (Reuters) - The mining industry wants to shed its image as a low-tech shoveller of dirt and instead be seen as a cutting edge digital-savvy employer of choice. It’s a feat that could be compared to teaching an elephant to ballet dance. While mining companies have been quick to adopt new technologies to drive costs lower, there is an increasing recognition that the industry needs to embrace the so-called digital revolution if it is to prosper in the future. This means moving well beyond the driverless trains and trucks that have helped Australia’s major iron ore miners cut the cost of producing a tonne of the steel-making material by about two-thirds over the past decade. Harnessing technology, and the people to use it, was an over-arching theme at this week’s International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC). But there was also tacit recognition that the industry is a long way from being attractive to the type of workers it will need if it is to harness the advantages of digital technologies. One speaker at the event related the story of a mining executive addressing students studying technology degrees at a university. When asked for a show of hands of who wanted to work in a high-tech industry committed to innovation and providing the materials needed for an electrified and de-carbonised economy, virtually every hand went up. When the same students were asked to keep their hands up if they wanted to work in mining, and virtually every hand dropped. Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques told the conference that the industry “needs to change the barbecue conversation”. “Our industry is one of least trusted in the world,” he said in his keynote address on Oct. 30. The point is that mining needs to be seen as a positive force for the future of the world, delivering the metals needed for electric vehicles, renewable energy and the technologies that improve lifestyles. While the mining industry talks often about earning the social licence to operate, it appears that there is now some appreciation that its needs to go beyond just engaging with the communities where it operates, and to take its case to the wider public. How mining companies are going to achieve this remains the challenge. The industry hasn’t been exactly that effective in convincing the public, especially in advanced Western democracies, that it is part of the solution to the world’s problems. In many ways the mining industry is losing the public relations battle against environmental activists. Many of the latter fail to distinguish between the various types of commodities being mined, the processes being used in extraction and the usefulness of the resource in helping, or hindering, action against climate change. The fact that mining industry groups are too often linked with coal also hurts the industry as a whole, given the polluting fuel acts as a lightning rod for green activists. Rio’s Jacques made the point that miners should be more engaged with social media, saying “who you are on social media is who you are”. While his own company’s Twitter feed does do more than just parrot company press releases, it has only 60,300 followers. The main Greenpeace feed has 1.72 million, and the Worldwide Fund for Nature has almost 4 million. A scan of Twitter suggests Jacques does not appear to have a verified account in his capacity as Rio CEO, and nor do BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie or Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg. Perhaps if mining companies want to engage young people and convince them that the industry is an exciting, technology-driven place to work, they should do more to reach out directly to them. The opportunities are definitely there. Javier Orellana, the digital transformation lead at industrial software developer Aveva, told IMARC that the industry could save as much as $370 billion by 2025 by adopting digital technologies. Certainly, the nature of conferences like IMARC has changed in recent years, with significantly more presentations on technology and innovation, and a rise in the number of companies highlighting digital technologies, almost to the point where they outnumber the more traditional miners and engineering contractors. There is little doubt that mining companies are keen to embrace more technology. But it also appears that they aren’t quite sure how to win over scepticism among the youth that they will need to do the work.

Glencore had expected to achieve annual cash savings of more than $300 million in its coal business by the end of 2018 in a two-year cost-cutting drive, but on Wednesday said it now expects savings of more than $450 million by year-end. The company now expects its mine unit costs to fall to $49 a tonne in 2019, from a forecast of $52 for 2018, from its operations in Australia, Colombia and South Africa, it said in a presentation to analysts on a tour of its Australian coal mines. “(The firm has achieved) strong unit cost performance despite material cost headwinds from energy, royalties and higher consumable costs,” it said in slides prepared for the tour. The cost-cutting comes as the company, whose own coal sales make up about 12 percent of the seaborne thermal market, is boosted by strong coal prices, driven by rising demand in Asia. The growth in Asia comes just as investment in new coal production has slumped and as the energy content of traded coal has dropped compared with the average energy content of coal sold by Glencore, the company said. It added that it expected to produce 145 million tonnes of coal in 2019, which could generate $6.2 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) at a spot price of $108 a tonne for Newcastle coal. Glencore earlier this year completed the acquisitions of the Hail Creek coal mine in Australia and a 49 percent stake in the Hunter Valley Operations (HVO) from Rio Tinto in a joint venture with Yancoal Australia. Hail Creek is expected to be the biggest earner of its top 12 coal complexes in 2019 and HVO the sixth biggest, Glencore said, without giving specific forecasts for EBITDA from those mines. The HVO joint venture has already cut nearly a fifth of its full-time workers and removed 13 percent of trucks without affecting production levels, Glencore said.

2018-10-31,"(Repeats Oct. 30 story. No change to text. John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2CQDDYT By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Global economic momentum is decelerating, according to a broad range of financial and real-economy indicators, which is weighing on worldwide equity markets and oil prices. The depth and duration of the slowdown is impossible to gauge at this point, whether it turns out to be simply a mild and short-lived “soft patch”, a longer but still positive “growth recession” with output falling relative to trend, or an “outright recession” with activity falling in absolute terms. Recent declines in equity markets and softness in freight indicators may turn out to be a false alarm or a pause within an extended cycle rather than mark a cyclical turning point. Most commentary about the economic cycle is still influenced by the last deep and wrenching recession which accompanied the global financial crisis in 2008/09. But severe recessions have not been common since the end of the Second World War and most downturns have proved milder, which therefore seems a more likely prediction for the next cyclical slowdown. In the United States, post-1945 recessions have tended to be short, lasting less than a year in most instances, and in some cases have seen business activity level off rather than decline (tmsnrt.rs/2CQDDYT). If the economy is nearing a cyclical peak, however, the next stage in the cyclical sequence is likely to involve some combination of: * Fiscal expansion * Financial easing * Lower trade tensions * Lower oil prices Further tax cuts or an increase in government spending, possibly on highways and other infrastructure, would be one way to ameliorate the slowdown and get the economy growing again. The U.S. federal government is already on course to run an annual budget deficit of more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade but the prospect of even higher deficits is unlikely to forestall demands for fiscal stimulus. If the expansion slows or tips into recession, the Federal Reserve will also come under pressure to cancel planned interest rate increases and rescind some of the rises that have already happened. With the target federal funds rate currently at 2.00-2.25 percent, up from a post-crisis low of 0.00-0.25 percent, the central bank has scope to ease financial conditions by conventional interest rate reductions. In the event of a mild slowdown, interest rate reductions on their own are likely to prove sufficient, but if more aggressive measures are required, the central bank could start expanding its balance sheet again. Slower growth will lead to pressure on policymakers to reconsider trade policies that have disrupted global supply chains and damaged market access. The Trump administration has argued the strength of the U.S. economy makes now an opportune time to tackle what it calls China’s unfair trade and investment practices. A strong domestic economy can weather the short-term pain of a trade war to protect long-term strategic advantages, according to this argument. But if the economic expansion falters, the administration is likely to come under pressure to reconsider the costs and benefits of its aggressive trade policies. At a minimum, the administration is likely to come under pressure not to worsen the downturn by escalating the trade war and to find ways to reduce tensions. If there is a downturn, the administration will want it to be over well before the next presidential election in November 2020. Any slowdown in global growth is likely to see oil prices hit a plateau or even fall, as consumption growth moderates while production continues to accelerate. Lower oil prices would avoid another period of oversupply by curbing the projected expansion in output and stimulating faster growth in oil consumption. Modestly lower oil prices would also provide some economic stimulus and form part of the natural cyclical progression (a sharp fall in prices would worsen the economic outlook by curbing oil and gas investment). OPEC members could try to support oil prices by cutting their own output, perhaps in conjunction with invited non-OPEC producers, but only at the risk of losing market share (again). Attempting to support oil prices during an economic slowdown is unlikely to be successful, so the most OPEC may be able to achieve is to avoid a rise in inventories and averting a price collapse. The precise mix of fiscal expansion, financial easing, reduced trade tensions and lower oil prices in the next stage of the cycle is impossible to predict in advance. But the potential for a cyclical slowdown and flat or lower oil prices is one reason hedge funds and other money managers have been cutting bullish bets on oil and refined fuels sharply since the end of August.

2018-10-31,"TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed for the first time in three days on Wednesday, but rising supply and fears over the outlook for demand amid the U.S.-China trade war kept pressure on the market. Brent crude futures had gained 36 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $76.27 a barrel by 0110 GMT. They fell 1.8 percent on Tuesday, at one point touching their lowest since Aug. 24 at$75.09 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures advanced 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $66.45 a barrel on Wednesday. They dropped 1.3 percent the day before, after hitting their weakest since Aug. 17 at $65.33 a barrel. Both crude benchmarks have fallen about $10 a barrel from four-year highs reached in the first week of October, and are on track to post their worst monthly performance since July 2016. Oil has been caught in the global financial market slump this month, with equities under pressure from the trade fight between the world’s two largest economies. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he thinks there will be “a great deal” with China on trade but warned that he has billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to go if a deal is not possible. Trump said he would like to make a deal now but that China was not ready. He did not elaborate. The United States has already imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. In a bearish signal, the American Petroleum Institute reported U.S. crude inventories rose 5.7 million barrels last week, more than analyst forecasts for a 4.1 million-barrel build. Investors will look to official government data on U.S. inventories due on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said high oil prices were hurting consumers and could dent fuel demand at a time of slowing global economic activity. Oil production from Russia, the United States and Saudi Arabia reached 33 million barrels per day (bpd) for the first time in September, Refinitiv Eikon data showed.

A confluence of factors from Sino-U.S. trade tensions to worries about U.S. corporate earnings to the end of easy money in development economies have spurred volatility in financial markets in the past few weeks. Anxiety that global growth might be rapidly losing momentum has been at the centre of the market ructions. Early Asian trade on Wednesday suggested investor sentiment remained fragile. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.05 percent, but it was still on track to fall roughly 11 percent this month. The index had dropped to its lowest level since February 2017 on Monday as worries over corporate profits weighed heavily on U.S. equities. Wall Street’s three stock indexes jumped more than 1 percent on Tuesday, helped by strong gains for chip and transport stocks as investors took advantage of cheaper prices following the steep recent pullback for equities. Australian stocks edged up 0.1 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI rose 0.35 percent and Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.5 percent. “The recent slide in equities had gone to such an extent that it was bound to invite buyers, such as in the Japanese stock market,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. The MSCI World index has lost about 8.50 percent of its value so far in October, evaporating a whopping $4.5 trillion in just one month, according to analysis by Kyle Rodda, analyst at IG in Melbourne. Ichikawa at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management said the outlook for markets was still cloudy, adding that the U.S.-China trade row will “likely to remain a factor of concern beyond the U.S. midterm elections.” U.S. President Donald Trump said during an interview with Fox News late on Monday that he thought there could be an agreement with China on trade. But he also said he had billions of dollars worth of new tariffs ready to be imposed if a deal was not possible. In currencies, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies was near a 16-month peak of 97.02 scaled overnight after data showed U.S. consumer confidence rose to an 18-year high in October, suggesting strong economic growth could persist in the near term. The dollar rose to a three-week high of 113.20 yen. Immediate focus for the yen was on the Bank of Japan’s policy decision due later in the day. Later on Wednesday, the BOJ is set to keep monetary policy steady and maintain its optimistic view on the economic outlook, even as global trade frictions, growth worries and volatile markets put it further away from achieving its elusive inflation target. The euro was little changed at $1.1346 after losing 0.25 percent the previous day. A dip below $1.1336 would take the single currency to its lowest since mid-August. China’s yuan was a shade weaker at 6.9727 per dollar in offshore trade and in close range of a 21-month low of 6.9770 brushed on Tuesday. The yuan has been pressured by worries about slowing Chinese economic growth and a potential sharp escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, falling this week to its lowest level in a decade in onshore trading. Oil prices recovered slightly after dropping to multi-month lows the previous day on signs of rising supply and concern that global economic growth and demand for fuel will fall victim to the U.S.-China trade war. U.S. crude futures was up 0.46 percent at $66.49 per barrel after dropping to $65.33 on Tuesday, their lowest since mid-August.
