2018-11-26,"LIMA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian construction company Odebrecht is close to reaching a final settlement with Peruvian prosecutors over their investigation into bribes paid by Odebrecht for public works contracts in Peru, a prosecutor said on Monday. Odebrecht has admitted to paying about $30 million in bribes to win contracts in the South American country and has agreed to provide prosecutors with details on the payments, culminating in a formal plea deal intended to reduce its exposure to legal risks. “It is true we are near to closing everything,” Rafael Vela, one of the prosecutors investigating Odebrecht, told Reuters. He declined to offer details on what the agreement would include. Brazilian newspaper Valor reported late Sunday that Odebrecht would sign a definitive agreement this week with Peruvian authorities investigating the company. Representatives of the Peruvian attorney’s office could not immediately be reached for comment. The Odebrecht office in Lima told Reuters that the company was in full talks to reach an agreement, but declined to provide further details. “Odebrecht Peru maintains its commitment to collaborate with the justice administration and to the confidentiality of the case, so it is unable to make any comment on the matter,” it said to Reuters in an email. Odebrecht has been at the center of a massive graft scandal that has rippled across Latin America. In 2016, it acknowledged in a leniency deal that it had bribed officials in a dozen countries to secure public works contracts, dating back over a decade. It agreed to pay a record $3.5 billion in settlements in the United States, Brazil and Switzerland. After Brazil, Peru is the country where the Odebrecht scandal has been most disruptive. Peru’s four most recent presidents are under investigation in connection with alleged bribes paid by Odebrecht. The investigation hit a snag in July, when the Brazilian builder raised complaints about the probe in Peru to authorities in Brazil. Sources at the time said it wanted legal protections because it felt it was being treated as a suspect and not a willing informant. (Reporting By Marco Aquino.

2018-11-26,"JINCHENG, China (Reuters) - Residents in the rugged, overmined city of Jincheng in northern China’s coal heartland have been breathing a little easier after campaigns to reduce pollution forced dozens of collieries and chemical plants to close. “Everything was covered in dust, and it’s cleaner now,” said Zhang Haibin, a 44-year-old farmer living in a largely abandoned hamlet on the edge of a defunct coal deposit that once attracted migrant workers from across the country. But Jincheng has paid a heavy price, Zhang said. Factories and coal mines have shut down, sending shockwaves through the local economy. The migrants have drifted away, and jobs are hard to find even for locals. And the air is still not clean enough, falling short of the government’s pollution targets. That means that as another punishing anti-pollution campaign gets underway this winter in smog-choked north China, Jincheng will be under even more pressure. The city’s experience illustrates the challenges facing the Chinese government as it tries to rein in pollution without further weighing on an economy that is showing signs of a slowdown, exacerbated by the effects of a bruising trade war with the United States. Across north China, cities are struggling to strike a balance between reversing the environmental damage done by decades of breakneck growth and keeping their heavy industrial economies afloat. Jincheng has done particularly poorly, according to the central government. A sprawling, mountainous administrative region in the south of Shanxi province, Jincheng is still dominated by coal. Though many pits have been shut, the craggy landscape bears the scars of decades of excessive mining. Residents say air quality has improved, but whiffs of sulfur pervade the city’s industrial districts, and smoke can be seen billowing from factory chimneys. Jincheng was the worst performer among 28 northern cities forced to impose special pollution measures last year, according to data from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.  It failed to meet its target of cutting concentrations of lung-damaging PM2.5 particles by 10 percent last winter, and recorded 1,819 pollution violations, the most of the 28 cities. Summoned to Beijing in April to explain his city’s poor performance, mayor Liu Feng said the city’s gross domestic product plunged 9 percent and fixed asset investment 41 percent in the first quarter as a result of production cuts. Feng told officials, at a meeting attended by Reuters, that he was “deeply embarrassed” and would seek to “learn painful lessons” about improving compliance this year. Feng said city inspectors had been too “passive” and had failed to properly forecast smog build-ups or supervise industries. But he also blamed unfavorable weather conditions, as well as the city’s “industrial structure”, dominated by polluting power plants, steel mills and cement factories. The economy bounced back after the winter curbs were lifted, with GDP growing 4.9 percent from a year earlier in the first three quarters of 2018, according to the city’s statistics bureau, although fixed asset investment was still down 1.9 percent on the year. But with the winter anti-pollution curbs that took effect on Nov. 1, Jincheng - like many cities in Shanxi - will again struggle to reconcile official pollution targets with their industrial structures. Shanxi “faces a very complex situation, it has few resources and its supervision capabilities are quite weak - it has a lot of different kinds of challenges,” said Ma Jun, director of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), a non-government group that monitors pollution. “Many cities in Shanxi rank the lowest in the country when it comes to environment law enforcement and information disclosure,” Ma said. Shanxi produces nearly a billion tons of coal a year, around a quarter of the national total, and despite promises to promote cleaner energy, its production of the fossil fuel actually increased in the first three quarters of 2018. Last year’s winter smog crackdown was criticized for a “one size fits all” approach that failed to take account of local conditions, shuttering hundreds of factories whether they had implemented pollution controls or not. Beijing has promised a more business-friendly campaign this year, setting lower emissions-cutting targets and promising to exempt environmentally compliant firms.  But after its failures last year, Jincheng is unlikely to be treated leniently in the war on pollution, which is a signature policy of President Xi Jinping. On Monday, inspectors said 19 firms in Jincheng had failed to follow rules to restrict output during a smog outbreak last week, the latest in a series of problems uncovered this year. The city’s coal districts are now in a state of siege as inspectors scour mines, coal processing facilities, chemical plants and storage depots for violations. This winter, Jincheng aims to cut coal chemical production by 30 percent, and impose output curbs of as much as 50 percent in certain districts. It will also establish a 95-square kilometer “no-coal zone” banning household coal combustion and convert more than 9,000 households to gas.  One manager with Shanxi Lanhua High-Tech (600123.SS), a local conglomerate involved in coal, chemicals and real estate, said the city was under far greater pressure. The firm will completely shut down some of its subsidiaries in winter, and expects to lose around 450 million yuan ($64.84 million) in earnings over the winter period. “This year the intensity is going to be stronger,” said the manager, who requested anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to talk to the media.            Ma of the IPE said polluting firms in cities like Jincheng had long taken advantage of the system. Their failure to comply with costly rules means they could outcompete compliant rivals, and China needed to create a “level playing field” to make sure lawbreakers were eliminated from the market. But at a meeting of China’s parliament in March, delegates from Jincheng said the city needed more financial support from Beijing to diversify and regenerate its economy. Despite years of crackdowns, Jincheng continues to rely heavily on coal, and while surviving mines have benefited from the closure of smaller rivals, related businesses - including local truckers - are struggling with higher compliance costs and intensifying competition. Gas has now emerged as the major bright spot for the city, with its seams rich in coalbed methane, which has replaced coal as a source of heating for many outlying villages, but development will still take time. “The GDP growth that Jincheng wishes to accomplish ... will be driven from gas today, while historically it would have been from coal,” said Randeep Grewal, chairman of Greka, a unit of G3 Exploration (G3EG.L), which has drilled more than 4,500 coalbed methane wells in Jincheng. “We are in that transition mode, and clearly in transition, you have a bit of growing pains, but the transition is irreversible.” In the meantime, the legacy of coal is still being felt by residents of Jincheng like Zhang, the farmer. His sparsely furnished home is riddled with dangerous cracks - the result of subsidence caused by mining - but he said he has not received enough compensation from the state to move out. “They’ve even closed down livestock farms here because of the environmental policies and lots of farmers are out of work,” he said. “The government knows how to ask you for money but it doesn’t know how to resolve the problems of ordinary people.” Additional reporting by Muyu Xu in Beijing and the Shanghai newsroom; Editing by Philip McClellan",https://uk.reuters.com/article/china-pollution-economy/insight-smog-war-casualty-china-coal-city-bears-brunt-of-pollution-crackdown-idUKL4N1XV2BJ,26 Nov 2018,"* Jincheng under pressure after failing smog targets last

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Trump said he expects to move ahead with raising tariffs on $200 billion in Chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent currently. Trump said it was “highly unlikely” he would accept China’s request to hold off on the increase. The comments ran counter to recent speculation about a possible deal when Trump meets with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Buenos Aires later this week. “Trump’s pessimistic view on the chances of a game-changing China trade deal may puncture global equity markets’ optimistic start to the week,” said Sean Callow, a senior FX analyst at Westpac in Sydney. “Combined with last week’s harsh report from the U.S. trade representative, investors have only the flimsiest hope that the Trump-Xi meeting in Argentina will amount to more than a hill of soybeans.” The early reaction was limited to a drop in trade-sensitive currencies, including the Australian dollar, with share markets yet to open in Asia. The U.S. dollar remained firm for the moment at 113.60 yen , while the euro nursed losses at $1.1328. That left the dollar a shade firmer at 97.089 against a basket of currencies. Shares in Apple Inc fell after-hours in reaction to Trump’s comments that tariffs could also be placed on laptops and iPhones imported from China. Trump’s remarks came just as the mood among investors had shown signs of brightening. Wall Street took heart from an upbeat holiday shopping period. European stocks also bounced on Monday, on talk that Italy was preparing to rework spending plans that have fuelled tensions with the European Union, though coalition leaders later said the government was sticking to its main 2019 budget goals as it awaits a full cost analysis of its most important spending measures for next year. Even oil managed to regain a little ground after the gut-wrenching slide of recent weeks. The Dow ended Monday up 1.46 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.55 percent and the Nasdaq 2.06 percent. The rally came after the S&P 500 on Friday recorded its lowest close in six months, down more than 10 percent from September’s peaks, putting it in “correction” territory. In commodity markets, oil prices climbed nearly 3 percent on Monday in what was seen as largely a technical correction after weeks of losses. Brent crude futures rose $1.68 to $60.48 a barrel, while U.S. crude gained $1.16 to $51.58 a barrel. Reporting by Wayne Cole

2018-11-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday the agreement allowing the United Kingdom to leave the European Union may make trade between Washington and London more difficult, but the UK prime minister’s office disputed his interpretation. Trump told reporters outside the White House that the deal sounded like it would be good for the European Union, but “I think we have to take a look seriously whether or not the UK is allowed to trade. “Because right now if you look at the deal, they may not be able to trade with us,” he said. “And that wouldn’t be a good thing. I don’t think they meant that.” He said he hoped British Prime Minister Theresa May would be able to address the problem, but he did not specify which provision of the deal he was concerned about. A spokeswoman for May’s office said the agreement struck with the EU allowed the UK to sign trade deals with countries throughout the world, including with the United States. “We have already been laying the groundwork for an ambitious agreement with the U.S. through our joint working groups, which have met five times so far,” the spokeswoman said. Under the deal secured with EU leaders on Sunday, the UK will leave the bloc in March with continued close trade ties. But the odds look stacked against May getting it approved by a divided British parliament.

2018-11-26,"NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - A mobile application launched in dozens of U.S. and Canadian cities on Monday measures the planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions of inner-city travel, its creators said, letting concerned commuters map their so-called carbon footprints. Mapping app Cowlines can suggest the most efficient route as well which uses the least fuel, combining modes of transport such as bicycling and walking, within cities, its Vancouver, Canada-based creators said. Some two-thirds of the world’s population is expected to settle in urban areas by 2050, according to the United Nations. The trend presents an environmental challenge, given that the world’s cities account for the bulk of greenhouse gas emissions. Not only will the app measure a trip’s emissions and suggest alternatives, it will provide the data to cities and urban planners working on systems from subway lines to bike-sharing programs, said Jonathan Whitworth, chief strategy officer at Greenlines Technology, which created the app. “As you would imagine here in Canada, especially Western Canada, most people are driven by the environmental side of it,” Whitworth told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. The app aims to encourage users in 62 U.S. and Canadian cities to use cleaner modes of transportation, from mass transit to walking or biking, he said. In the United States, mass transit accounts for less than 2 percent of passenger miles traveled, according to Daniel Sperling, founding director of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. “People are starved for good information and data for good travel choices,” said Sperling. The app’s suggested route is a cowline - city planner parlance for the fastest route, said Whitworth. In pastoral settings, a cowline is the most direct path cattle use to reach grazing grounds. The app shows users after a trip how many kilograms of carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions they are responsible for, Whitworth said. While other apps such as Changers CO2 Fit track users’ carbon footprints, Cowlines claims its methodology, certified by the International Organization for Standardization, is most accurate, he said. Whitworth said the company also plans to sell the data it collects.

2018-11-26,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday rejected projections that climate change will cause severe economic harm to the U.S. economy, findings outlined by a report his own U.S. government published last week.  The congressionally mandated report www.globalchange.gov said that climate change will cost the country's economy billions of dollars by the end of the century, but Trump said he does not believe the economic impacts will be devastating. “I’ve seen it, I’ve read some of it, and it’s fine,” the Republican president told reporters at the White House. Asked about severe economic impacts, he said, “I don’t believe it.”  The report was issued on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, when many Americans traditionally go shopping, a timing that Trump’s critics said was chosen to bury the report.  Last year, Trump announced his intent to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris deal to combat climate change, becoming the first country of 200 to do so. Due to U.N. rules, he cannot quit the deal until after the 2020 presidential election.  “Right now, we’re at the cleanest we’ve ever been and it’s very important to me,” Trump said. “But if we’re clean but every other place on Earth is dirty, that’s not so good.”  U.S. carbon emissions from industry slipped 2.7 percent last year as coal plants shut and use of natural gas and renewable energy rose. But Trump’s critics said leaving the Paris agreement means the United States is allowing others to lead the global fight to curb climate change.  Trump has also rolled back Obama-era environmental and climate rules such as the Clean Power Plan, while seeking to boost output of oil, gas and coal for domestic use and for shipping to allies and partners. U.S. output of crude oil is already the highest in the world, above Saudi Arabia and Russia. The report, written with the help of more than a dozen U.S. government agencies and departments, said the effects of climate change would harm human health, damage infrastructure, limit water availability, and alter coastlines. Agriculture, tourism and fishing, industries that depend on natural resources and favorable climate conditions, would all be hit, it said.  The report also said projections of damage could change if greenhouse gas emissions were curbed, although many of the impacts of climate change, like powerful storms, droughts and flooding, have already begun. The report supplements a study issued last year that concluded humans are the main driver of global warming and warned of catastrophic effects to the planet.

2018-11-26,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Monday, clawing back some of last week’s steep losses, but gains were capped by uncertainty over global economic growth and further signs of increasing supply, including record Saudi production. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose $1.68 to settle at $60.48 a barrel, a 2.9 percent gain. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 gained $1.21, or 2.4 percent, to close at $51.63 a barrel.  Prices on Friday hit their lowest since October 2017 amid intensifying fears of a supply glut. Brent sank to $58.41 a barrel, while WTI fell to $50.15 a barrel. “We are reluctant to read much into today’s oil price advance given a much oversold technical condition that needed only a moderate stock market rally to force some short covering,” Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates, said in a note. Supporting oil prices, U.S. stock markets broadly rallied as Cyber Monday, the largest online shopping day of the year, began. Crude futures sometimes track with the equities market. Prices found some support as crude stockpiles at the delivery point for WTI at Cushing, Oklahoma, rose just 126 barrels from Tuesday to Friday, traders said, citing a report from market intelligence firm Genscape. However, demand concerns and record output from Saudi Arabia limited Monday’s rebound. Saudi crude oil production hit 11.1-11.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, an all-time high, an industry source said. A rising dollar that has undercut demand in key emerging market economies, higher borrowing costs and the threat to global growth from the trade dispute between the United States and China have pushed investors out of assets more closely aligned with the global economy, such as equities or oil.  Hedge funds and other money managers raised their bullish position on U.S. crude for the first time in 8 weeks in the week that ended Nov. 20, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Monday. The increase was the first since September and lifted net longs from their lowest point in more than a year.  Market participants are looking ahead to a Dec. 6 meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna. Saudi Arabia is expected to push for a production cut of up to 1.4 million bpd by OPEC and its allies. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Monday the G20 meeting this week could be a catalyst for a rebound in commodities prices, possibly prompting a thaw in U.S.-China trade tensions and offering greater clarity on a potential OPEC oil curb. Goldman believes OPEC and other nations will come to an agreement, leading to a recovery in Brent prices. “While we didn’t think that Brent prices were justified at $86 per barrel, neither do we believe that they are at $59 with our 2019 Brent forecast at $70,” Goldman said.

But Ecuador, one of OPEC’s smallest members, does not expect the cut to derail its own plans to boost production to 560,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year, up from 515,000 bpd currently, as it seeks to increase government revenue to cut its fiscal deficit, said the minister, Carlos Perez. “The country needs these resources, and I do not think there will be any issue because our output is marginal in the context of OPEC,” Perez said during a tour of the Ishpingo-Tambococha-Tiputini (ITT) oilfield in the country’s Amazon region. “The country’s interest comes before our commitments to OPEC.” The ITT field is crucial to those plans. The government expects output in the area to rise to 114,000 bpd next year, up from 64,000 bpd currently. OPEC will meet on Dec. 6 amid expectations that leading producer Saudi Arabia will push for a production cut of up to 1.4 million bpd by the producer club and its allies to prop up weak oil prices. “We will support it because it will have a positive impact,” Perez said. “The moment we get crude inventories under control, that will have an effect on the price of crude.” (Writing by Luc Cohen Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Richard Chang)",https://uk.reuters.com/article/ecuador-oil/update-1-ecuador-to-support-opec-oil-production-cut-energy-minister-idUKL2N1Y1198,26 Nov 2018,"Ecuador would support

2018-11-26,"(Adds detail on the project, comment from local mayor) By Lefteris Karagiannopoulos OSLO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Norwegian gas system operator Gassco and Canadian energy firm Enbridge are working on reviving a 350 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project to boost power supply security at Norway’s Nyhamna gas processing plant, they told Reuters. The project, which would be the country’s first offshore wind farm, is called Havsul 1 and was fully licensed by Norwegian energy regulators in 2009 before being abandoned in 2012 due to profitability concerns and insufficient subsidies. Nyhamna is one of Norway’s biggest gas processing plants, handling output from Shell’s Ormen Lange field. Its capacity was raised to 84 million cubic metres (mcm) per day this year to accommodate gas from the Aasta Hansteen field. However, the plant’s power supply is fed by a single grid line, the fragility of which has caused outages in recent years, affecting exports to Britain. Gassco spokeswoman Lisbet Kallevik said the company was undertaking a technical study for Enbridge, evaluating the possibility of a tie-in of Havsul 1 to the Nyhamna plant. The study was expected to be completed by spring 2019. “The windmill project will - if decided - secure power supply for the Nyhamna processing plant and the region for years to come,” she said. The additional capacity at Nyhamna means the need for a reliable power supply is increasing but longstanding discussions to upgrade the power line between Gassco and state grid Statnett have failed to produce results. Havsul 1, with a capacity to produce about 1 Terawatt hour (TWh) of electricity annually, would not only benefit the gas plant, but also indirectly feed the local grid by reducing a portion of Nyhamna’s demand, Enbridge told Reuters. “Our intention is to enter into a commercial agreement with Nyhamna gas processing facility to supply a dedicated source of renewable electricity, also enhancing security of supply for the facility and local grid,” spokeswoman Mandy Dinning said, adding the partners would only be able to reach a final investment decision after 2019. The project also has political support from the region’s municipalities, said Dag Olav Tennfjord, a local mayor. Initially Havsul 1 was part of a larger plan to construct three offshore wind farms, with around 1,500 megawatts capacity, but Norway’s regulator rejected the other farms. The estimated cost for Havsul 1 was up to 7 billion crowns ($814.52 million) at the time of its 2009 licensing. Since then, the project’s rights have changed ownership twice, with Enbridge securing its licenses earlier this year. However, development costs for offshore wind have fallen since Havsul 1 was abandoned in 2012, while Norway said last year it would offer some concessions for such projects. $1 = 8.5940 Norwegian crowns

2018-11-26,"NAIROBI, Nov 26 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Fishing communities along Africa’s coastline are at a greater risk of extinction as countries eye oceans for tourism, industrial fishing and exploration revenue to jumpstart their “blue economies,” U.N. experts and activists said on Monday. The continent’s 38 coastal and island states have in recent years moved to tap ocean resources through commercial fishing, marine tourism and sea-bed mining, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA). “There is a great risk and a great danger that those communities will be marginalized,” said Joseph Zelasney, a fishery officer at U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). “The resources that they depend on will be decimated,” he added at a side event at the Blue Economy Conference organised by Kenya, Canada and Japan in Nairobi. The world’s poorest continent hosts a blue economy estimated at $1 trillion but loses $42 billion a year to illegal fishing and logging of mangroves along the coast, according to UNECA estimates. Seismic waves generated by prospectors to search for minerals, oil and gases along the ocean floor have scared away fish stocks, said Dawda Saine of the Confederation of African Artisanal Fishing in Gambia. “Noise and vibration drives fishes away, which means they (fishermen) have to go further to fish,” Saine said. Pollution from a vibrant tourism sector and foreign trawlers have reduced stocks along the Indian Ocean, Salim Mohamed, a fisherman from Malindi in Kenya, said. “We suffer as artisanal fishers but all local regulation just look at us as the polluter and doesn’t go beyond that,” he said. The continent’s fish stocks are also being depleted by industrial trawlers which comb the oceans to feed European and Asian markets, experts say, posing a threat to livelihoods and food security for communities living along the coast. Growth of blue economies in Africa could also take away common rights to land and water along the coastline and transfer them to corporations and a few individuals, said Andre Standing, advisor with the Coalition for Fair Fisheries Arrangements. Most of the land and beaches along Africa’s thousands of miles of coastline is untitled, making it a good target for illegal acquisition, activists said. “There is a great worry that we could see privatisation of areas that were previously open to these communities,” Standing told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. ""We need to have a radical vision that values communities and livelihoods or they will become extinct."" (Reporting by Kevin Mwanza; editing by Jason Fields.

2018-11-26,"CARACAS/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Venezuela’s oil ministry last month turned down a proposal by BP (BP.L) to buy Total’s (TOTF.PA) stake in a promising but inactive natural gas project along the maritime border with Trinidad and Tobago, five people briefed on the matter said. BP owns the rights to the Trinidadian side of the gas play. It could have used the output from the neighbouring area, the Deltana Platform’s fourth block off Venezuela’s eastern coast, to feed its growing operations on the island, said the people, who were not authorized to speak publicly. The rejection highlights how Venezuela’s socialist government, often hostile to foreign companies, remains an obstacle to investment even as oil majors eye the OPEC nation’s barely tapped gas reserves to expand their liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolios. The ministry told the parties the area’s reserves needed to be re-estimated, an argument it has used to reject other deals.  Two of the people said the deal had been waiting for approval for two years. France’s Total said in a March filing that the sale of its 49 percent stake was “awaiting approval from the authorities.”  Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) owns the other 51 percent. An Equinor spokesman said it finished exploration drilling 10 years ago, but declined to comment on Total’s plans. Gas investment could help Venezuela, which has the world’s largest crude reserves, compensate for lack of capital for its oil industry, whose production continues plummeting amid a political and economic crisis.    Venezuela’s mostly undeveloped gas reserves were 225 trillion cubic feet (TCF) at the end of 2017, compared with Trinidad’s 9.2 TCF, according to BP’s Statistical Review of World Energy. BP and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.AS) own stakes in all four of Trinidad’s LNG plants, known as trains. Shell, the world’s largest liquefied gas trader after buying BG Group for $52 billion, is pushing Venezuela to let it produce gas in the offshore Dragon field, close to its Hibiscus platform off Trinidad.  “There’s a real shortage of gas supply in the downstream industries in Trinidad,” said Tanvir Malik, a research analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit. Total’s attempt to sell comes as some Western oil firms seek to shrink their Venezuelan operations as reputational risk grows amid U.S. sanctions and corruption probes linked to government officials and state-run oil company PDVSA. Shell requested approval this year to sell its only crude asset in Venezuela to French firm Maurel & Prom. Total recently downgraded its Venezuelan projects to the lowest investment category, implying it could continue looking for buyers, two company sources said.   BP declined to comment. Venezuela’s oil ministry and Total did not respond to requests for comment. Venezuelan law requires PDVSA to take a majority stake in crude oil joint ventures, but is more flexible with gas, allowing foreign firms to individually operate projects through exploration and production licenses.  But ownership changes in gas projects are still subject to regulatory approval, and the government is required to provide an explanation for rejections, said Eugenio Hernández-Bretón, a partner at the Baker McKenzie law firm in Caracas. Under late socialist President Hugo Chavez, PDVSA tried to take control of prominent gas projects, including the Deltana and Mariscal Sucre offshore plays, both close to Trinidad with total estimated reserves of about 22 TCF. Neither project has yet started commercial production due to long delays stemming from lack of funds and disputes over control between PDVSA and the private companies. “It is really difficult for a foreign investor to feel comfortable with Venezuelan laws applied in practice,”  Hernández-Bretón said.  “We don’t have the financial resources or technical expertise for developing natural gas projects, whereas Trinidad has the expertise and the backing of foreign investors.”  While once an afterthought to crude oil, Big Oil is focusing increasingly on natural gas as global demand for less carbon-intensive fuels rises and LNG facilitates international gas trading. Both Shell and BP are ramping up gas operations in Trinidad, one of the world’s top 10 gas exporters. Efforts are under way to reverse the island’s 18 percent decline in gas output in the past decade.  A BP gas platform built by U.S. engineering firm McDermott International (MDR.N) in Mexico recently set sail to Trinidad, a McDermott executive told Reuters.     PDVSA and Trinidad’s state gas company signed an agreement in August to allow exports from Dragon into Trinidad, without specifying how to finance the construction of a $1 billion pipeline needed to transport the gas.

2018-11-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has postponed until February a decision on how fast Europe’s largest economy should phase out brown-coal-fired power plants and whether the government should compensate utilities as well as regions that could face job losses, a commission said. With brown coal mines the only truly domestic resource in a country reliant on energy imports, Germany faces wrangling over when to abandon coal-burning to meet ambitious climate goals by 2030, as it also wants to be free of nuclear energy by 2022. The German cabinet has appointed a 24-strong group, the coal commission, to find a compromise deal. It was expected to present an exit plan by the end of the year. But after another round of talks in Berlin on Monday, the heads of the coal commission said in a statement that further negotiations were needed and that the group now aimed to wrap up its work on February 1. The commission includes Matthias Platzeck and Stanislaw Tillich, former prime ministers of brown coal-mining states Brandenburg and Saxony, which are industrially weak regions. Losses of thousands of jobs, even if spread out over years, will hurt both eastern states. In addition, Brandenburg and Saxony will have regional elections next year. Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said the postponement of the decision could increase the chances for a broader acceptance of the coal exit plan. “I think there is no reason to be disappointed,” Altmaier said, adding that Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who also participated in the talks on Monday, was trying to fend off calls for extra spending. Two people familiar with the talks told Reuters that Scholz has shown little sympathy for paying compensation to operators of brown-coal-fired power plants that could be forced to shut down early. Scholz is also sceptical of other measures to help companies cope with the effects of the planned brown coal exit, such as lowering energy tax, two people familiar with the talks said. A finance ministry spokeswoman declined to comment. So far, the coalition parties have agreed to spend 1.5 billion euros (1.33 billion pounds) to help regions especially affected by structural change such as the planed coal exit. The commission will help allocate federal funds for bringing new industries into the regions, such as battery cell research and production. Coal-to-power production both from brown coal and imported hard coal accounts for 40 percent of Germany’s total power production, making the exit from coal difficult while maintaining reliable supply to industries and households.

2018-11-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Faroe Petroleum (FPM.L) rejected a 608 million pound  hostile bid by DNO (DNO.OL) on Monday, which it said substantially undervalued the Aberdeen-based firm. Norway’s DNO (DNO.OL) which already owns 28 percent of Faroe, returned to the North Sea last year after years of expansion in the Middle East focusing on Iraqi Kurdistan, with the aim of growing via acquisitions and other investments. “We urge shareholders to reject DNO’s opportunistic, unsolicited and inadequate offer,” Faroe’s Non-Executive Chairman John Bentley said. Faroe shares closed nearly 26 percent higher at 159.6 pence, above the 152 pence cash offer price, while shares in DNO rose by more than 3 percent after it made the bid public on Monday. Paul Mumford at Cavendish Asset Management, which holds between 1 and 2 percent of Faroe, said DNO would need to offer around 2 pounds per share for its bid to succeed. “Given the falling oil prices, DNO clearly thought it could swoop in and secure itself a bargain,” Mumford said. Faroe, which said DNO had not engaged with it before making its offer, said that its board would write to shareholders and urged them to take no action in the meantime.  Its CEO Graham Stewart told Reuters in September that Faroe wanted to stay independent. DNO said its offer represented a 44.8 percent premium to Faroe’s closing price on April 3, a day before it triggered bid speculation by building a stake. “In the period between our first acquisition ... and this offer, the price of Brent crude has dropped 13 percent and oil and equity markets have entered a period of great uncertainty,” DNO Executive Chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said. Sparebank 1 Markets analyst Teodor Sveen-Nilsen said the deal would give Faroe shareholder access to DNO’s strong cashflow, but added he expected DNO would need to increase the offer price by 10 to 20 percent. DNO said it had made the offer to safeguard its investment because of Faroe’s refusal to grant it a seat on the board and against moves to dilute shareholdings. In August, DNO withdrew its request for seats on Faroe’s board amid an escalating war of words over the British company’s wider governance culture and strategies.  BMO Capital Markets, which advises Faroe, said in a note that it valued Faroe’s shares much higher at around 170 pence and at around 2.10 pounds on a fully de-risked basis.

2018-11-26,"(Fixes typo in first paragraph) By Allison Martell and Allison Lampert TORONTO/MONTREAL, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday expressed his  “deep disappointment” in General Motors Co’s decision to close its Oshawa plant, a move Canadian officials only learned about on Sunday and which led workers to walk off the job on Monday. Canadian officials promised to aid auto workers affected by the 2019 closure, part of a wider restructuring by the automaker that will cut production of slow-selling models and slash its North American workforce. GM said the closure affects a total of 2,973 assembly line jobs. GM’s total employment in Canada is 8,150 direct jobs. “I spoke with GM (CEO) Mary Barra to express my deep disappointment in the closure,” Trudeau tweeted on Monday. “We’ll do everything we can to help the families affected by this news get back on their feet.” Ontario, home to the Oshawa plant, was told by the automaker that there was nothing it could do to prevent it, premier Doug Ford said. Oshawa is about 37 miles (60 km) east of Toronto. “The first thing I said is, ‘What can we do? What do we have to do?’” said Ford, referring to a Sunday night call with GM Canada’s President Travis Hester. “He said the ship has already left the dock.” Ford later added: “We’re disappointed in GM. We supported GM years ago when they were in trouble.” The Canadian and Ontario governments joined the United States in supporting GM with billions of dollars in aid after the automaker filed for bankruptcy protection during the severe 2009 global economic downturn. Canada and Ontario also backed a 2005 investment by GM to modernize the Oshawa plant’s paint shop. Canadian Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains said that GM “only made this official announcement to us yesterday.” A former Canadian auto executive said it would be difficult for Canadian government officials to entice GM further to keep the plant open. “The government has done everything they could to keep them afloat. Obviously incentives by themselves don’t keep a car plant open,” said the executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. “It’s all about getting a product mandate,” or a commitment to produce a specific vehicle. Workers in the Unifor trade union walked out of the Oshawa plant “in protest,” ahead of a meeting with GM about the announcement, a union spokeswoman said. “I’ve moved my family twice for this company and they do this to me,” a tearful worker told CBC TV as he left the plant. Under Unifor’s four-year contract signed in 2016, GM must give the union a year’s notice before closing the plant. The automaker intends to close the plant in December, 2019. A 2015 study commissioned by Unifor, which represents GM employees, estimated that shutting the plant would eliminate 4,100 direct jobs and reduce Ontario’s gross domestic product by C$1.1 billion.

2018-11-26,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany is pushing back against European Union countries that want more ambitious emission limits for trucks, saying carbon dioxide cuts should not go beyond 15 percent by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030, according to EU documents. EU member states have begun talks to reach a compromise on the first ever emissions curbs on heavy-duty vehicles, which account for almost one quarter of the bloc’s transport-related emissions. The final targets will still need to be negotiated with EU lawmakers, who voted earlier this month for tougher targets than those proposed by the EU executive in May.  Germany, whose auto industry is a major driver of its economy, says the new limits should not go beyond the European Commission’s proposal, according to a document setting out Berlin’s position dated Nov. 20. The EU currently has no limits on the CO2 produced by trucks.  The Netherlands, the EU’s second-biggest manufacturer of heavy-duty vehicles, wants a higher reduction in greenhouse gases from trucks to combat global warming. A Dutch position paper, seen by Reuters, calls for a 20 percent reduction in CO2 emissions from trucks by 2025 and 30 percent by 2030. France will also push for more ambitious targets than what was proposed by the European Commission in May, though has not yet settled on concrete limits, an EU official said. Many other member states are still shaping their positions due to be discussed by EU environment minister on December 20. Extreme temperatures across the northern hemisphere this summer have intensified concerns that more needs to be done more quickly to combat climate change, leading some countries to call for emissions to be cut at a faster rate than planned. The European Parliament has backed a CO2 reduction target of 20 percent by 2025 and 35 percent by 2030, despite warnings from the truck industry that the higher reductions could cost jobs and cut growth. If a common position is reached among EU governments in December, negotiations between the EU’s three lawmaking institutions on the final targets would start early next year.

2018-11-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is likely to experience hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters by the 2070s, as well as rising sea levels which can lead to floods, due to the effects of climate change, long-term projections by the Met Office show.  To help homes and businesses plan for the future, a report based on science from the Met Office and around the world sets out a range of climate scenarios over the next century based on different rates of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere. UK Climate Projections 2018 shows rising summer temperatures, more extreme weather and rising sea levels are expected in Britain and urgent action is needed. Even in the lowest-emission scenario, average annual temperatures are expected to be up to 2.3 degrees Celsius (4.14°F) higher by the end of the century. In the highest-emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be up to 5.4C (9.72°F) higher by 2070 and winters up to 4.2C (7.56°F) higher.  The chance of a summer as hot as this year is about 50 percent by 2050. This summer was the joint hottest on record, when a six-week spell of hot weather saw daytime temperatures in many parts of the country regularly over 30C (86°F).  The report said average summer rainfall could fall by up to 47 percent by 2070 and winter rainfall could be up to 35 percent higher. Meanwhile, sea levels could rise by up to 1.15 meters (3.77 ft) by 2100, which increases the risk of flooding. “Sea levels are projected to rise over the 21st century and beyond under all emission scenarios – meaning we can expect to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels around the UK coastline,” the Met Office said in a  statement. Although Britain has already reduced emissions by more than 40 percent since 1990, the projections show a future Britain could face without further action, it added.  The report was developed by the Met Office Hadley Center, in partnership with the government and the Environment Agency. It is the first major update on Britain’s climate projections since 2009.

2018-11-26,"* Italian bank shares jump 5 percent on deficit cut hopes * Pound up vs dollar after Brexit agreement * Wall Street opens higher on retail bounce * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh (Adds Wall Street open; changes dateline, previous NEW YORK) By Hilary Russ NEW YORK, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday, fueled by gains in retailer shares during a prime holiday shopping period, while European stocks rallied after signs that Italy was preparing to rework the spending plans that have fueled tensions with the European Union. Oil bounced back after its own “black” Friday, adding to a risk-on sentiment, and the pound rose after Britain’s Brexit agreement won approval from European leaders. Italy’s governing coalition may reduce next year’s budget deficit target to as low as 2 percent of gross domestic product to avoid disciplinary action from the European Commission, Reuters reported. Currently, Italy’s deficit target is 2.4 percent, far higher than the 0.8 percent set by the previous government. The country’s budget has put it in dispute with the Commission and alarmed the euro zone. The prospect of a lower deficit sent Italy’s banks index up nearly 5 percent on Monday, toward its strongest day since June. An equally strong rally in bond markets sent Italian borrowing costs to their lowest since September. The euro was down 0.03 percent to $1.1337, while sterling was last trading at $1.2814, up 0.02 percent on the day. The dollar index rose 0.03 percent. Analysts remain cautious that the Brexit deal faces stiff opposition within the British Parliament, which is expected to vote on the agreement in around two weeks. “During the next two weeks the pound will likely trade with increased volatility,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG. Wall Street rose as retailers anticipated $7.8 billion in sales on the largest online shopping day of the year, with shoppers who missed out on Black Friday deals expected to flock to the internet for Cyber Monday. Technology stocks were also higher after taking a beating last week. “We had a pretty miserable week in terms of the equity markets and sometimes you get a relief rally.

2018-11-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been marginalised as critical decisions about the oil market are taken by a troika of the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The rise and subsequent fall in oil prices this year has been almost entirely driven by production decisions in these three countries and their policies towards managing the impact of renewed sanctions on Iran. The troika accounted for 36 million barrels per day of crude and condensates production in 2017 (39 percent of the global total) compared with just 27 million bpd from the rest of OPEC (30 percent of the global total). Troika production has surged even further this year as U.S. shale firms ramped up output in response to higher prices, while Russia and Saudi Arabia relaxed production curbs put in place at the end of 2016. Output from the troika is the fastest-growing element in global oil supplies, which will likely push its share above 40 percent in 2018 while the rest of OPEC falls below 30 percent (“Statistical review of world energy”, BP, 2018). Production decisions made in the troika tend to determine whether the oil market will be over- or under-supplied in the short to medium term, while other OPEC and non-OPEC countries watch from the sidelines. The rest of OPEC is struggling under sanctions, mismanagement and unrest; is too small to matter; is maximising production rather than participating in output controls; or simply aligns its output policies with those of Saudi Arabia. The only OPEC member that operates an independent production policy and has been able to increase its output significantly in 2017/18 has been Iraq. In this context, it is not surprising that the distinction between OPEC and non-OPEC members has become increasingly blurred and decision-making shifted outside the organisation. Discussion and analysis have moved away from OPEC’s twice-yearly ministerial conference to the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC), which blends OPEC and non-OPEC members. The JMMC contains two leading non-OPEC producers (Russia and Oman) and just four OPEC countries (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria and Venezuela) plus the OPEC president (currently the United Arab Emirates). The JMMC’s membership is a tacit admission that non-OPEC Russia and to a lesser extent Oman play a more important role in production policy than most OPEC members. Dividing oil production into “OPEC” and “non-OPEC” has become an obsolete way of analysing the oil market. A better approach recognises a hierarchy of decision-makers with varying degrees of freedom and importance. The inner core of decision-making consists of Saudi Arabia and Russia, which have closely coordinated their output policy during 2017/18, and act as the de facto leaders of OPEC and non-OPEC respectively. Next comes the United States, which is not in OPEC and lacks a unified production policy, but has a decisive influence on oil supplies and prices through its rapidly growing shale output and sanctions. Decisions about the severity of sanctions (including scope, enforcement and waivers) give the United States significant influence (less than Saudi Arabia and Russia but more than other OPEC and non-OPEC members). The United States has acted as a third member of the troika even though it is formally forbidden by law from coordinating production policy domestically or with foreign countries. Recognising their joint influence, policymakers from Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States have regularly briefed one another about production decisions and sanctions in 2018. And the president of the United States has expressed strong and clear views about the appropriate level of oil prices and exerted pressure on Saudi Arabia. The third level of the hierarchy consists of OPEC members Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates and non-OPEC Oman, which have proved willing to adjust their production under Saudi and Russian leadership. The troika plus Kuwait, the UAE and Oman account for almost half of global liquids production. The fourth level consists of Iraq, which has also to some extent coordinated its production policy with Saudi Arabia and Russia but retained much more independence. The fifth and final level consists of all other OPEC and non-OPEC producers, which essentially maximise their output and are not part of the production control system. In this hierarchical system, production policy is driven by initial consultations between Saudi Arabia and Russia, paying due attention to the diplomatic requirements and anticipated output reactions of the United States. Kuwait, the UAE, Oman and later Iraq are then brought on board, followed eventually by the rest of OPEC and non-OPEC allies. In this hierarchy, only Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States are genuinely independent actors, while Kuwait, the UAE, Oman and Iraq are important followers. Other OPEC and non-OPEC members are largely inconsequential in terms of decision-making and production outcomes. Iran, which was a founder member of OPEC and its second-most important member through the 1980s, has been pushed out of the decision-making process by U.S. sanctions. Iran’s exclusion from membership of the JMMC is symptomatic of its marginalisation within OPEC and the wider oil market. In this new system, the locus of decision-making has shifted from the twice-yearly OPEC conference in Vienna to the periodic meetings of the JMMC and bilateral briefings among ministers. In April/May 2018, Saudi Arabia and Russia took the critical decision to start increasing output in bilateral discussions held well before it was formally ratified by the OPEC conference and then non-OPEC countries in June 2018. Under U.S. pressure, Saudi Arabia, backed by Russia, Kuwait, the UAE and Oman, decided to raise output further in September, again outside the formal OPEC framework. Experienced observers expect the next round of critical production decisions will be taken, at least in outline form, at this week’s Group of 20 meeting in Buenos Aires rather than at OPEC’s formal conference next month. Top political leaders from all members of the troika will attend the G20 with their senior economic and energy advisers. “For the oil market, it looks like the real OPEC meeting will come a week ahead of schedule,” according to Javier Blas, chief energy correspondent at Bloomberg. “The cartel is set to meet on Dec. 6 in Vienna, but days earlier the key decision makers are set to gather on the sidelines of the G20 summit,” Blas notes. It provides an opportunity for leaders and their ministers to reach an understanding about the preferred direction of prices next year (“As oil plunges, the real OPEC meeting will be at next week’s G20”, Bloomberg, Nov. 23). Oil policy is increasingly driven by the political and diplomatic priorities of Saudi Arabia’s de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS), Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump. The MbS-Putin-Trump triangle sets the political context, with operational decisions left to energy ministers and officials (“How strongmen play their cards will determine next move for oil”, Financial Times, Nov. 23). As the balance of power has shifted away from historically important producers such as Iran, Nigeria and Venezuela, so the focus of decision-making has also flowed into new channels. As power shifts to the troika and its closest allies, the OPEC conference and its OPEC/non-OPEC follow-up have become a theatrical stage rather than where the real decisions are taken.

2018-11-26,"* Italian bank shares jump 5 percent on deficit cut hopes * Euro rises against dollar despite German data worries * Pound up vs dollar, dips vs euro after Brexit agreement * Rouble falls amid new Ukraine tensions * Wall Street expected to open higher on retail bounce * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Europe’s markets rallied on Monday on signs that Italy was preparing to rework the spending plans that have fuelled tensions with the European Union, while Wall Street futures were looking for post-Black Friday pick-me-up. A bounce in oil after its own “black” Friday, the survival chances of Britain’s newly sealed Brexit agreement and renewed Russia and Ukraine tensions had all kept Europe’s traders busy, but it was Italy that stole the show. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had hinted over the weekend at the possibility of tweaking the country’s budget deficit goal, saying “no one is stuck” to the 2.4 percent target and there was talk on Monday of closer to 2 percent. Italy’s banks index duly leapt 5 percent towards its strongest day since June and an equally strong rally in bond markets sent Italian borrowing costs to their lowest since September. “It will help the banks if the BTP-Bund spread goes lower which it has been this morning,” Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at Credit Suisse Wealth Management, said. “You potentially move from a negative spiral to a more positive spiral where you end up with less pressure on the banks, more ability to lend and that will underpin growth in a better fashion.” The euro also climbed, rising 0.25 percent to $1.1370 and as much as 0.7 percent at 128.73 yen, though it lost a bit of traction after Germany’s monthly Ifo survey showed a larger-than-expected drop in business morale. “The (Ifo) index’s fall is somewhat alarming,” Uwe Burkert of LBBW wrote in a note. “It was generally expected that the economic weakness of the third quarter would be corrected with a firmly positive growth figure in the fourth quarter.” There was also a 0.3 percent rise for the pound against the dollar after Britain and European Union reached an agreement over Brexit plans on Sunday. It was flat against the euro, though, and analysts remain cautious that the Brexit deal faces stiff opposition within the British parliament, which will is expected to vote on the agreement in around two weeks’ time. “The failure of the pound to rally on recent positive developments suggest the market is pricing in that the deal won’t pass the first time in parliament,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG. “During the next two weeks the pound will likely trade with increased volatility,” he added. Wall Street stock futures firmed up after another negative session on Friday had seen the S&P 500 record its lowest close in six months, more than 10 percent down from September’s peaks, and pushed it back in ‘correction’ territory. Signs that shoppers had succumbed to deep discounts offered on Black Friday and Cyber Monday saw Amazon shares jump 2.7 percent and eBay gain 2.1 percent in premarket trading. Heavy oil price losses that sent Brent crude plunging below $58 per barrel had dragged energy stocks lower on Friday. Brent, hit by growing signs of crude oversupply on world markets as demand ebbs, clawed back lost ground on Monday but was struggling to get much above $60. Both U.S. WTI and Brent futures are down more than 20 percent this month, and unless they recover further this week the losses would mark their biggest fall since October 2008. Brent crude futures last stood at $60.15 per barrel, up 2.3 percent in London. U.S. crude futures last fetched $51.23 per barrel, up 1.6 percent on the day and off Friday’s low of $50.15. “It is difficult to say whether $60 is the new normal, as there doesn’t seem to be a ‘normal’ at the moment,” Cantor Fitzgerald oil and gas analyst Jack Allardyce said. Overnight in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of the region’s shares excluding Japan edged up 0.6 percent, led by gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan, while Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai composite index eased 0.1 percent, though, and Bitcoin extended its recent wrechid run, dropping more than 5 percent from the day’s highs as selling in cryptocurrencies returned. Bitcoin was last trading at $3,880 — holding above the 2018 lows it hit last week but it has lost around three quarters of its value this year. Russian and Ukraine bonds also saw some notable selling after Russia seize three Ukrainian naval ships off the coast of Crimea that Russian authorities said had illegally entered its waters. With relations still raw after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the incident risks pushing the two countries towards a wider conflict and is likely to renew Western calls for more sanctions on Moscow. Gold, meanwhile, rose as fears of a slowdown in global economic growth and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. interest rate trajectory and U.S. China trade tensions bolstered the metal’s appeal ahead of a G20 meeting at the end of the week.

2018-11-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - AXA (AXAF.PA), France’s biggest insurer, has extended its climate change policy to its recently acquired XL division, joining a growing list of European insurers that have taken action to help to tackle global warming. AXA, Europe’s second largest insurer after Allianz (ALVG.DE), said XL would stop insuring projects related to the construction of coal-fired power plants and to tar sands extraction and pipelines, which will mean a 100 million euro (88.6 million pounds) revenue loss, mainly in 2020, AXA said.  “One hundred million euros is a lot of money but, when you take into account AXA’s world revenue, this is something we can absorb in terms of activity growth,” Jad Ariss, AXA’s head of public affairs and corporate responsibility, said. AXA reported annual group revenues of 98.6 billion euros for 2017. Bermuda-based XL, bought by AXA earlier this year in a $15 billion (11.7 billion pounds) deal, mainly handles property and casualty insurance in the United States. A number of European insurers and banks have committed to pull back for most polluting industries under pressure from environmentalist groups and activist investors. AXA’s announcement over its XL division follows Italian rival Generali’s (GASI.MI) pledge earlier this month to stop offering insurance coverage to new coal mines and plants. Other insurance industry players such Scor (SCOR.PA), Swiss Re (SRENH.S) and Zurich Insurance (ZURN.S) have also announced certain restrictions on carbon intensive industries. European insurers have been more proactive than rivals in the United States in terms of their climate change policies. Reducing insurance coverage of the coal industry raises costs for coal power generation, which could increase pressure on utilities to switch to cleaner energy. Next month, the United Nations climate change conference takes place in Poland. XL will also stop investing in assets related to coal and tar sands. The company will sell 660 million euros worth of financial assets starting in 2019, AXA executive Ariss said.  AXA itself had taken the step to divest from the coal and tar sands industry in late 2017.  XL will also refrain from investing in assets related to the tobacco industry and assets related to chemical and biological weapons, cluster bombs or anti-personnel mines, Ariss said.

2018-11-26,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Iran’s nuclear chief warned the European Union on Monday of “ominous” consequences if it did not follow through with action to keep the economic benefits of the 2015 nuclear agreement alive. Ali Akbar Salehi said the European Union was “doing its best” after the United States pulled out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil exports this month, even as  the bloc’s efforts to salvage trade ties have floundered.  But Salehi, the head of Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization, told reporters in Brussels: “If words are not turned into deeds, then ... it is very ominous, the situation would be unpredictable.” The EU and other remaining parties to the accord - China and Russia - hope to convince Tehran to respect the curbs that the deal placed on its nuclear programme, despite Washington’s pull-out and the its sanctions that aim to force the rest of the world to stop buying Iranian oil. Striving to circumvent those sanctions, EU nations plan to facilitate non-dollar transactions with Iran. A so-called Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) would act as a barter system offseting Iranian exports with purchases of EU goods. Speaking on the sidelines of talks on civilian nuclear cooperation, EU diplomats admitted they could only do so much to urge firms to brave the risk of U.S. penalties and do business with Iran. “What we are doing now is a lot of symbolism,” said one EU diplomat involved in talks with Iran. “The SPV isn’t going to be a game changer,” said another EU official. “The prospects are pretty grim.” No EU country has yet agreed to host the SPV and progress in creating it is likely to be slow, despite the political will in Paris, Berlin and London. “This is a hugely complex and unique undertaking, technical work has been advancing,” Europe’s Climate and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Canete said at a joint briefing with Salehi. “Nobody should have any doubt on the level of political ambition and determination by the member states involved, in particular France, Germany and the United Kingdom to swiftly operationalise the SPV.” Reporting by Alissa de Carbonnel and Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Robin Pomeroy",https://uk.reuters.com/article/iran-nuclear/update-2-iran-nuclear-chief-warns-of-unpredictable-consequences-if-deal-breaks-down-idUKL8N1Y12LX,26 Nov 2018,"Iran's nuclear chief warned the

2018-11-26,"(Repeats with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has boasted that falling crude prices are like a tax cut for the world, however, motorists in much of Asia have yet to pocket substantial savings from the recent rout in oil markets. Since its 2018 closing peak of $86.29 a barrel on Oct. 3, Brent crude has tumbled 32 percent to end at $58.50 on Nov. 23. This decline has been matched by the price of 92-octane gasoline in Singapore GL92-SIN, which was down by 33 percent from its peak of $92.65 a barrel on Oct. 2 to $62.30 on Nov. 23. However, the retail price of gasoline in major Asian countries has fallen by significantly smaller margins. The pump price of gasoline in India’s capital New Delhi was 76.66 rupees ($1.07) a litre on Nov. 24, according to price monitoring website mypetrolprice.com. This is down 10 percent from the peak of 84.06 rupees on Oct. 4, illustrating that the sharp decline in crude and ex-refinery gasoline prices has yet to filter through to consumers. However, the above calculation doesn’t factor in the impact of fuel taxes, which in India are about one-third of the retail price. Excluding taxes from the price reveals a slightly larger 13.2 percent drop in the untaxed component of India’s gasoline price from the October peak until Nov. 24. Australia’s national average gasoline price has dropped by about 14.1 percent, from a 2018 peak of A$1.605 ($1.16) a litre in the week to Oct. 28 to A$1.378 in the week to Nov. 25, according to data from the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Australia’s fuel taxes are about the same percentage as those in India, meaning there has been a slightly larger drop in the untaxed component of the fuel price, but still nothing close to the plunge in Brent. China, which has a managed system for retail fuel prices, has seen a lower drop than India and Australia, with gasoline falling 5.4 percent to 7.74 yuan ($1.12) a litre in the week ended Nov. 19, according to data on the website globalpetrolprices.com. It’s likely that retail gasoline prices will drop in those countries in coming weeks, but it would be unlikely that they fall by as much as motorists might hope for, given the slump in crude. Asian refiners are already struggling to make any money producing gasoline, with the profit margin, or crack, for making a barrel of 92-octane from Brent crude in Singapore GL92-SIN-CRK at 32 cents on Nov. 23. This is up from a loss of $1.17 a barrel on Nov. 8, which was the weakest crack in seven years, but still well below the $11.55 peak for 2018, reached on Aug. 15. With profits from gasoline currently tenuous, the scope for refiners to lower prices further is likely constrained. In some ways it’s a double-edged sword for the region’s refiners, as they can lower gasoline prices and make a loss in the hope of boosting demand in order to remove a surplus of the fuel. Asian refiners are also in a quandary over strong margins for middle distillates, such as diesel, which encourage them to run their plants at high rates, even though this also ensures they produce more gasoline than the market is demanding. The profit margin for producing a barrel of gasoil, the base for diesel and jet fuel, from Dubai crude in Singapore was $15.50 in early trade on Monday, down from the 2018 peak of $17.97 on Nov. 15, but well above the low of $12.12 from June 27. Given the strong demand for diesel and robust refinery profits, it’s no surprise that the retail price in India and Australia has failed to reflect the recent decline in crude. Diesel in New Delhi was 70.65 rupees a litre on Nov. 23, down 6.7 percent from the recent peak of 75.74 rupees on Oct. 16. The national average diesel price in Australia was A$1.595 in the week to Nov. 25, down only 3.2 percent from the recent high of A$1.649 in the week to Oct. 28. While much of the focus in crude markets has been on the supply side, and the rapid switch from fears of tightness to oversupply, the demand side of the equation shouldn’t be ignored. Probably the best method for producers, traders and refiners of clearing oversupply in crude markets is to have demand gain to clear the surplus. However, given the modest declines in retail prices for gasoline and diesel in major Asian countries, a demand-led tightening of the market may remain elusive.

2018-11-26,"* ADNOC awards Wintershall 10 pct in Ghasha for 40 years * Deal aimed at unlocking reserves, Wintershall has know-how * First exploration, production licences due in Q1 2019 (Adds FRANKFURT dateline, additional details from Wintershall, context) DUBAI/FRANKFURT, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC) and Germany’s Wintershall said on Monday they would develop offshore gas and condensate fields as Wintershall widens its regional focus and the UAE firm benefits from its partner’s experience in sour gas. Wintershall said it had signed a deal to acquire a 10 percent stake in the Ghasha concession in Abu Dhabi with investments running into billions of dollars. This would be alongside ADNOC as operator, and Italy’s Eni , which was awarded a 25 percent stake earlier this month. Contracts to develop the deposits were awarded for 40 years. The deal builds on ADNOC’s new, integrated gas strategy aimed at unlocking value from Abu Dhabi’s reserves as the United Arab Emirates moves towards gas self-sufficiency, Wintershall cited ADNOC Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber as saying. “Wintershall has extensive experience of appraising and developing ultra-sour gas resources in technically complex fields,” he said. Wintershall has more than 40 years’ experience in production from 16 sour gas fields in Germany. Sour gas is a high-sulphide hydrocarbon that is now mostly exhausted in Germany, where Wintershall has produced 30 billion cubic metres of it and built four gas purification plants. In the Middle East, mass production of sweet gas, which does not need cleansing, used to be the norm. The partners envisage producing more than 40 million cubic metres per day from around the middle of the next decade, when the project could supply gas for electricity for over 2 million homes. Once completed, the project could also produce over 120,000 barrels of oil per day. Wintershall, a subsidiary of chemicals company BASF , has been present in the UAE since 2010. Apart from the Middle East, it also has operations in Europe, Russia, Latin America and North Africa. European gas resources are falling in the long term and Libya’s oil output has been eroded by years of armed conflict and political turmoil, prompting Wintershall to emphasise gas over oil, as well as new regions. Wintershall is merging with sector peer DEA. As for the Ghasha project, the first exploration and production licences for six oil and gas blocks are expected to be awarded in the first quarter of 2019, ADNOC said last week.

2018-11-26,"(Adds comments on biodiesel fund) By Bernadette Christina Munthe and Fransiska Nangoy JAKARTA, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Top exporter Indonesia said on Monday it will temporarily remove a levy on palm oil after a sharp drop in prices which has hit farmers. Indonesia collects levies from palm exporters to help finance the development of its palm-based biodiesel programme, as well as funding other palm oil agenda, such as replanting. “Palm prices are falling rapidly ... We see that the situation has become urgent, especially for farmers and the whole palm industry,” Darmin Nasution, the country’s coordinating minister for economic affairs, said. The latest policy will take effect as soon as the Finance Ministry issues the regulation, he said. As prices recover to $500 per tonne, levies of $25 will be imposed for crude palm oil and $5-$10 per tonne for its derivatives, Nasution said, adding that levies of $20-$50 per tonne will be imposed again when prices reach at least $550. The palm oil benchmark contract in Kuala Lumpur has dropped almost 10 percent so far in November and touched its lowest since August 2015 last week. It closed at 1,965 ringgit ($469.42) per tonne on Monday. “We have agreed that the levy on palm oil and its products, due to price conditions, will be lowered to zero,” Nasution, who earlier this month said the government had decided not to change export levies, told reporters. Nasution said the Crop Estate Fund has collected “more than enough” funds so far and its programmes will resume as normal. Rida Mulyana, a senior Energy Ministry official, said the lower palm oil price meant the cost of biodiesel is less than regular diesel, so producers do not require a subsidy which is usually funded by the levy.

2018-11-26,"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia raised oil production to an all-time high in November, an industry source said on Monday, as U.S. President Donald Trump piled pressure on the kingdom to refrain from production cuts at an OPEC meeting next week. The meeting, at which OPEC members will consider how to arrest a decline in oil prices, comes days after leaders of top global oil producers - Russian President Vladimir Putin, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Trump - travel to Argentina for a G20 summit this week. Saudi Arabia agreed to raise supply steeply in June, in response to calls from consumers, including the United States and India, to help cool oil prices and address a supply shortage after Washington imposed sanctions on Iran. But the move backfired on Riyadh after Washington imposed softer than expected sanctions on Tehran. That triggered worries of a supply glut and prices collapsed to below $60 per barrel on Friday from as high as $85 per barrel in October. The industry source, who is familiar with the matter, said Saudi crude oil production hit 11.1-11.3 million barrels per day (bpd) in November, although it will not be clear what the exact average November output is until the month is over.   Those levels are up around 0.5 million bpd - equal to 0.5 percent of global demand - from October and more than 1 million bpd higher than in early 2018, when Riyadh was curtailing production together with other OPEC members. Non-OPEC Russia, which teamed up with Saudi Arabia in the first OPEC joint production cuts since 2016, has also raised production steeply in recent months to a post-Soviet high of 11.4 million bpd. Analysts at Goldman Sachs, one of the most active banks in commodities, said the G20 meeting could be a catalyst for prices to rebound. “We expect an OPEC cut and its announcement to lead to a recovery in (Brent) prices,” the bank said in a note. Saudi oil industry sources have signaled they wanted prices to stay above $70 per barrel and Saudi energy minister Khalid al Falih said this month global oil supply could exceed demand by over 1 million bpd next year, requiring OPEC to take action. Falih said earlier this month that state oil giant Saudi Aramco would ship 0.5 million bpd less crude in December than in November as demand from customers was lower. Possibly complicating Saudi decisions on oil output is the crisis around the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at Riyadh’s consulate in Istanbul last month.  Trump stood behind Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite calls from many U.S. politicians to impose stiff sanctions on Riyadh. Prince Mohammed is the ultimate Saudi oil policy maker and Saudi watchers have said the Prince will try to avoid confrontation with Washington, including on oil prices. The United States is not a member of OPEC and is not participating in the output reduction. Trump has repeatedly called on OPEC to refrain from cuts and has raised pressure on the group in the last few days. On Sunday, Trump thanked himself for lower oil prices and compared it to a big tax cut for the U.S. economy. “So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T),” Trump tweeted, referring to himself.  Last week, Trump tweeted: “Oil prices are getting lower... Thank you Saudi Arabia but let’s go lower”.

2018-11-26,"OSLO, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Norwegian gas system operator Gassco and Canadian energy firm Enbridge are working on reviving a 350 megawatt (MW) offshore wind project to boost power supply security at Norway’s Nyhamna gas processing plant, they told Reuters. The project, which would be the country’s first offshore wind farm, is called Havsul 1 and was fully licensed by Norwegian energy regulators in 2009 before being abandoned in 2012 due to profitability concerns and insufficient subsidies. Nyhamna is one of Norway’s biggest gas processing plants, handling output from Shell’s Ormen Lange field. Its capacity was raised to 84 million cubic meters (mcm) per day this year to accommodate gas from the Aasta Hansteen field. However, the plant’s power supply is fed by a single grid line, the fragility of which has caused outages in recent years, affecting exports to Britain. Gassco spokeswoman Lisbet Kallevik said the company was undertaking a technical study for Enbridge, evaluating the possibility of a tie-in of Havsul 1 to the Nyhamna plant. The study was expected to be completed by spring 2019. “The windmill project will - if decided - secure power supply for the Nyhamna processing plant and the region for years to come,” she said. The additional capacity at Nyhamna means the need for a reliable power supply is increasing but long-standing discussions to upgrade the power line between Gassco and state grid Statnett have failed to produced results. Havsul 1, with a capacity to produce about 1 Terawatt hour (TWh) of electricity annually, would not only benefit the gas plant, but also feed the local grid, Enbridge told Reuters. “Our intention is to enter into a commercial agreement with Nyhamna gas processing facility to supply a dedicated source of renewable electricity, also enhancing security of supply for the facility and local grid,” spokeswoman Mandy Dinning said, adding the partners would only be able to reach a final investment decision after 2019. Initially Havsul 1 was part of a larger plan to construct three offshore wind farms, with around 1,500 megawatts capacity, but Norway’s regulator rejected the other farms. The estimated cost for Havsul 1 was up to 7 billion crowns ($814.52 million) at the time of its 2009 licensing. Since then, the project’s rights have changed ownership twice, with Enbridge securing its licenses earlier this year. However, development costs for offshore wind have fallen since Havsul 1 was abandoned in 2012, while Norway said last year it would offer some concessions for such projects. $1 = 8.5940 Norwegian crowns

2018-11-26,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German business morale fell by more than expected in November as the country’s exporters get caught up in a trade dispute between China and the United States. Economists expressed concern about the drop in the Ifo economic institute’s business climate index, which followed the first quarterly contraction in German GDP since 2015. Munich-based Ifo said on Monday the index fell for the third month in a row to 102.0. This was lower than a consensus forecast of 102.3 in a Reuters poll of economists. “Sentiment among German businesses weakened further this month,” said Ifo chief Clemens Fuest. “Companies scaled back their assessments of the current business situation albeit from a high level. Their business expectations also clouded over.” He added that the economy would grow by 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter at most after contracting by 0.2 percent in the July-September period. Reciprocal tariffs on goods imposed by the world’s two largest economies are hurting German companies that manufacture in both countries and export in both directions across the Pacific. The tariffs are not only dampening the business outlook but are starting to leave their mark on the German economy, which has long depended on exports for growth. Data last week showed that weaker exports were the main reason for the quarter-on-quarter contraction in July-September, and economists said there are clear signs that overall German growth was slowing. In addition to trade tensions, the German economy is also feeling the effects of slowing growth in the euro zone.  “The index’s fall is somewhat alarming,” Uwe Burkert of  LBBW wrote in a note. “It was generally expected that the economic weakness of the third quarter would be corrected with a firmly positive growth figure in the fourth quarter.”  Detailed July-September GDP data on Friday showed exports fell 0.9 percent on the quarter while imports rose 1.3 percent, with net trade knocking a full percentage point off growth. This translated into a third quarter contraction of 0.2 percent. The third-quarter GDP contraction was mainly due to weakness in the car industry as it struggled to adjust to new emission testing requirements. While that problem should not affect the fourth quarter, the industry remains vulnerable to trade disruptions as a result of threatened U.S. tariffs on cars manufactured in the European Union and Britain’s planned exit from the bloc. Andreas Scheuerle of DekaBank pointed to factors also including the Italian government’s row with the European Commission over its expansionary 2019 budget. “There is the threat of a trade escalation between the U.S. and China and possibly between the U.S. and the EU and there is the threat of a budget dispute with Italy as well as Brexit,” he said. “No wonder firms are cautious looking forward.” Most economists expect the German economy to cool rather than enter a recession. In its ninth year of growth, it has been increasingly relying on consumption supported by low interest rates, rising wages and a robust labour market. Those factors are expected to support growth next year while modest tax cuts and spending increases planned by the government should also help offset some of the effects of weaker trade. “The fall in oil prices looks set to support consumer spending, particularly against a backdrop of low unemployment and rising wage growth,” Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics wrote in a note. “But the improvement will be tempered by a continued slowdown in global demand.”      Writing by Joseph Nasr; Editing by Paul Carrel, Matthew Mpoke Bigg and David Stamp",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-economy-ifo/update-2-falling-business-morale-points-to-weak-german-growth-idUKL8N1Y11VL,26 Nov 2018,"* Most economists see economy cooling, no recession

2018-11-26,"DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi Aramco will expand its market share in Asia despite likely OPEC limits on output next year, and is eyeing deals in China and Africa as it aims to become a global leader in chemicals, the head of the world’s top oil producer said on Monday.  Amin Nasser, chief executive of the state oil giant, told Reuters that his company would abide by any OPEC agreement to cut crude production in 2019, less than two weeks before the exporter group meets to decide output policy. But he added that he still sees growth opportunities in Asia - identifying China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia - and will push ahead with refining ventures to guarantee new outlets for Aramco’s crude. “We are always going to be attempting to expand our market share but at the same time the company is obliged to meet any agreement by OPEC,” Nasser said in an interview in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. “Asia is a very important market for us. We are looking at two potential JVs (joint ventures) for refineries in China right now ... We continue to expand our market share in different markets. “We are looking at India, we are looking at Malaysia, we are looking at Indonesia, we are looking at China. All these markets are very important to us. And other markets as well, even in Africa,” he added.  Aramco said last week it would sign five crude oil supply agreements with Chinese customers, taking its supply to China to a record-high 1.67 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019. Nasser did not explain how Aramco would meet that higher demand if the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Saudi Arabia is the de facto leader, decided to restrict production next year.  Asked whether the company planned to reduce crude exports to the United States as inventories there increase, he said: “All markets are important for us. Asia is the biggest market for sure, then Europe and the U.S.” Nasser added that plans to expand the company’s Motiva refinery in the United States and move into petrochemical production at that plant were going ahead as scheduled.  OPEC meets in Vienna on Dec. 6, amid expectations that Saudi Arabia will push for a production cut of up to 1.4 million bpd by the producer club and its allies to prop up sagging oil prices.  Benchmark Brent crude was trading near $60 a barrel on Monday, clawing back some losses after plunging nearly 8 percent the previous session amid fears of a supply glut. Saudi Arabia’s crude production has hit an all-time high in November of about 11.1-11.3 million bpd, an industry source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday. Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said earlier this month that Aramco would ship less crude in December compared to November due to lower seasonal demand. Aramco aims to become a global leader in chemicals and the world’s largest integrated energy firm, with plans to expand its refining operations and petrochemical output. The company plans to raise its total refining capacity - inside the kingdom and abroad - to 8-10 million bpd from around 5.4 million bpd now, Nasser said. “We are the industry leader when it comes to upstream oil and gas. But when it comes to downstream, even though we have a big position in refining ... our ambition is much bigger, we are looking at 8-10 million bpd in refining,” he said. “Chemicals is a major area for expansion. We are going to be the global leader when it comes to chemicals.” To get there, Aramco is embarking on the possible acquisition of a strategic stake in Saudi Arabia’s SABIC, the world’s fourth-largest petrochemicals maker.  Nasser said he hoped to finalize talks “soon” with the Public Investment Fund to buy the sovereign wealth fund’s stake in SABIC. “We are doing partly the due diligence and the negotiations at the same time. These things take time,” he said.  “And then if we are able to conclude the negotiations, still there is the process of antitrust in different countries and that also takes some time. We did not put a timeframe that we need to have but we are hoping to have it soon.” Aramco aims to allocate some 2-3 million bpd of its crude production to petrochemicals, Nasser said.

2018-11-26,"* Italian bank shares jump over 5 percent on deficit cut hopes * Euro rises against dollar despite German data worries * Pound up against dollar, dips vs euro after Brexit agreement * Rouble falls amid new Ukraine tensions * Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh By Marc Jones LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - European stocks, Italian bonds and the euro rallied on Monday on signs that Rome was preparing to rework the spending plans that have left it facing formal European Union disciplinary action. A bounce in oil prices after their ‘black’ Friday, the survival chances of Britain’s newly-sealed Brexit agreement and renewed Russia and Ukraine tensions were keeping traders busy too, but it was Italy that stole the show. Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini had hinted on Sunday at the possibility of tweaking the country’s budget deficit goal, saying “no one is stuck” to the 2.4 percent target and the signs of a shift continued on Monday. Italy’s banks index duly leapt 5.3 percent which put it on track for its strongest day since June, while shorter-term Italian borrowing costs fell sharply in the bond markets to their lowest since September. “It will help the banks if the BTP-Bund spread goes lower which it has been this morning,” Pierre Bose, head of European strategy at Credit Suisse Wealth Management, said. “You potentially move from a negative spiral to a more positive spiral where you end up with less pressure on the banks, more ability to lend and that will underpin growth in a better fashion.” The euro also climbed, rising 0.3 percent to $1.1376 and was up 0.7 percent at 128.90 yen, though it flinched briefly when Germany’s monthly Ifo survey showed a larger-than-expected drop in business morale. “The (Ifo) index’s fall is somewhat alarming,” Uwe Burkert of LBBW wrote in a note. “It was generally expected that the economic weakness of the third quarter would be corrected with a firmly positive growth figure in the fourth quarter.” There was also a rise for the pound against the dollar after the United Kingdom and European Union reached an agreement over the UK’s Brexit plans on Sunday. It dipped against the euro, though, and analysts remain cautious that the Brexit deal faces stiff opposition from within the UK parliament which will vote on the agreement in around two weeks’ time. UK Prime Minister Theresa May will hold an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday to brief ministers on her strategy to convince the deal’s critics that include the Northern Irish DUP party currently propping up May’s government. “The failure of the pound to rally on recent positive developments suggest the market is pricing in that the deal won’t pass the first time in parliament,” said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at MUFG. “During the next two weeks the pound will likely trade with increased volatility,” he added. Wall Street stock futures firmed up after another negative session on Friday had seen the S&P 500 record its lowest close in six months, more than 10 percent down from September’s peaks, and pushed it back in ‘correction’ territory. Heavy oil price losses that sent Brent crude plunging below $58 per barrel had dragged energy stocks lower. Brent, hit by growing signs of crude oversupply on world markets as demand ebbs, clawed back lost ground first thing on Monday but has been struggling to keep a foothold above $60. Both U.S. WTI and Brent futures are down more than 20 percent this month, and unless they recover further this week the losses would mark their biggest fall since October, 2008. Brent crude futures last stood at $60.15 per barrel, up 2.3 percent in London. U.S. crude futures last fetched $51.23 per barrel, up 1.6 percent on the day and off Friday’s low of $50.15. Overnight in Asia, MSCI’s broadest index of the region’s shares excluding Japan edged up 0.6 percent, led by gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan, while Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai composite index eased 0.1 percent, though, and Bitcoin extended its recent run of falls, dropping more than five percent from the day’s highs as selling in cryptocurrencies gathered broad momentum again. Bitcoin was last trading at $3,880 — holding above the 2018 lows it hit last week but it has lost around three quarters of its value this year. Gold, meanwhile, rose as fears of a slowdown in global economic growth and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. interest rate trajectory and U.S. China trade tensions bolstered the metal’s appeal ahead of a G20 meeting at the end of the week.

2018-11-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union’s progress towards increasing the use of renewable energy and improving energy efficiency is slowing, putting its ability to meet its 2020 and 2030 targets at risk, the European Environment Agency (EEA) said on Monday. Rising energy consumption, particularly in transport, is to blame for the slowdown, the EEA said in an annual report on EU efforts on its renewables and energy efficiency targets.  Renewable energy, such as wind and solar, accounted for a 17.4 percent share of gross final energy consumption in the EU last year, according to the EEA’s preliminary data, up from 17.0 percent in 2016. This indicates that the EU remains on track to reach its target of a renewables share of 20 percent by 2020, although the report said the pace of growth had slowed. The agency said there was insufficient progress towards a 10 percent target for renewables use in transport by 2020. “With 2020 approaching, the trajectories needed to meet the national targets are becoming steeper. Increased energy consumption and persisting market barriers are hindering the uptake of renewables in several member states,” the report said. Preliminary EEA data for 2017 showed 20 member states were on track to reach their individual targets on renewable energy by 2020, a decline from 2016 when 25 countries were on track. On energy efficiency, both primary and final energy consumption were above the trajectory needed towards 2020. The continued growth in energy consumption, particularly in transport but also in other sectors, made achieving the 2020 target increasingly uncertain, the report said. The EU also has new targets for 2030 but the report said current trends would not be enough to reach them, and additional and more ambitious efforts would be needed in the coming decade. By the end of this year, member states must submit the first draft of their national energy and climate plans to help them achieve targets for 2030.

AXA said XL will stop insuring projects related to the construction of coal-fired power plants and the extraction of tar sands. The move will mean a revenue loss of about 100 million euros ($114 million) for XL, which would mainly occur in 2020. “100 million euros is a lot of money but, when you take into account AXA’s world revenue, this is something we can absorb in terms of activity growth,” said Jad Ariss, AXA’s head of public affairs and corporate responsibility. XL will also - similar to its parent AXA - stop investing in assets related to coal and tar sands. The company will sell 660 million euros worth of financial assets starting in 2019, said Ariss.

2018-11-26,"RIYADH, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Saudi Electricity Co plans to establish a power generation subsidiary, pending shareholder approval, a step viewed by analysts as a sign the state-controlled power giant is pushing ahead with a long-awaited restructuring. The company, the Gulf’s largest utility, said in a bourse filing on Monday that it called shareholders for a meeting on Dec. 18 “to vote on the establishment of a power generation subsidiary,” without giving further details. The Public Investment Fund, the kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund, owns a 74 percent stake in Saudi Electricity. The other major shareholder is state oil giant Saudi Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE, which owns a stake of almost 7 percent. Saudi Arabia is embarking on a push to raise around $200 billion in the next several years through privatisation programmes in 16 sectors ranging from oil to healthcare, education, airports and grain milling. The unbundling of SEC is a centrepiece of Saudi Arabia’s energy reforms and restructuring of the power sector. At least as far back as 2008, Riyadh had been considering splitting SEC into separate companies that would be offered either to local citizens through initial public offerings or to local or international corporate partners. But the plan stalled as the government focused on other proposals, including a potential listing of Aramco. Earlier this month, two sources told Reuters that SoftBank had hired Deutsche Bank to advise on its power investment plans in Saudi Arabia. The Japanese firm has shown interest in electricity distribution in the world’s top oil exporter, the sources said, with one adding that SoftBank could consider purchasing a minority stake in SEC from the PIF. An industry analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the new subsidiary could be an indicator that the company will go ahead with its long awaited restructuring and privatisation plan. “They could transfer all generators under the new subsidiary’s assets, then privatise it,” he added. Under the government’s reform drive, aimed at transforming the kingdom’s economy and cutting its dependence on oil, solar power is viewed as a way to trim the amount of crude used to generate power at home, leaving more available for overseas shipments.

China’s imports from top supplier Russia jumped 58 percent from a year earlier to 7.347 million tonnes, according to the General Administration of Customs data, marking the highest ever and equivalent to about 1.73 million barrels per day (bpd). For the first 10 months, Russian imports were at 57.91 million tonnes, or 1.39 million bpd, up 16.6 percent. Chinese customs last month began updating an online database with commodity imports by country of origin, replacing a service that had until March only been available to clients. Percentage changes with year-earlier figures were calculated by Reuters. China’s crude import demand hit an all-time high in October and is expected to stay strong to year-end as independent refiners snap up cargoes to use up their import quotas. The strong demand from China’s so-called “teapot” refiners has helped to push spot premiums for popular grades such as Russian ESPO Blend and Oman crude to their highest in more than four years. Iranian shipments, however, tumbled 64 percent in October from the year-ago month to 1.0496 million tonnes, about 247,160 bpd, ahead of U.S. sanctions that came into effect on Nov. 4. Month-on-month, imports from Iran in October marked their third fall in a row as China’s state oil firms came under growing pressure to scale back purchases ahead of the sanctions. For the January-October period, imports from Iran fell 3.4 percent from 2017 to 25.54 million tonnes, or 613,300 bpd. China is one of eight countries that have been granted a waiver to continue buying some crude oil from Iran. The world’s largest energy consumer is allowed to buy 360,000 bpd of oil from the Islamic Republic for at least 180 days from the imposition of sanctions, Reuters reported. Saudi Arabia’s shipments last month were 4.77 million tonnes, or 1.12 million bpd, up 3.4 percent from October 2017. Imports for the first 10 months from the top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) inched up 0.2 percent to 43.2 million tonnes, or 1.04 million bpd. A search in the database for U.S.-sourced crude oil imports yielded no results. Chinese firms stopped importing U.S. crude oil around August and September due to a growing trade spat between Washington and Beijing. The suspension lasted until November when a cargo of 140,000 tonnes was discharged to a Chinese port. 1 tonne = 7.3 barrels for crude conversion

2018-11-26,"PARIS (Reuters) - Total’s French retail electricity arm is on track to win 700,000 customers this year, challenging former state monopolies EDF and Engie with a low-cost, digital service it believes could mimic Uber’s success in the taxi market.  Total Spring is signing up 3,500 to 4,000 customers every day, attracting them with a 10 percent discount to the regulated price that state-controlled rival EDF must use, its director Marc Bensadoun told Reuters.  A decade after liberalization, France’s power supply market is final coming to life as the process of switching providers has become easier and the entrance of new players has increased customer awareness of the options available.  EDF still accounts for about 80 percent of the retail power market, with roughly 26 million customers, but it is losing around 100,000 a month, according to French energy market regulator CRE. Since oil giant Total’s entry into the market a year ago, several other major French companies -  including retail groups Casino and Leclerc - have launched retail electricity offers with big discounts to EDF’s regulated tariffs.  Italian energy group Eni also launched an offer a year ago, with a target of around two million clients by 2021.  Total is aiming for at least 15 percent of the French retail gas and power market by 2022, or six million customers, up from about 6 percent at the end of 2017, helped by its $1.7 billion purchase of alternative power supplier Direct Energie. Retailer Leclerc is offering a discount of up to 20 percent to the regulated price to the 14.2 million customers who hold its loyalty card. The discount takes the form of a voucher to use in its network of 681 stores, and it aims to recruit three million clients by 2025.  Casino has declined to give its target.  Total views its 15 percent market share goal as vital to being competitive and developing additional services, Bensadoun told Reuters at Total Spring’s office in central Paris. “But market share is only part of our strategy,” he said. “We also aim to develop our production capacity to guarantee low-carbon energy at attractive prices to our customers.” Total has acquired two gas-fired plants following its purchase of Direct Energie, and plans to increase its electricity generation in France to 10 gigawatts (GW) by 2023 from 5 GW. The company has said it will bid for French hydro power concessions and expand its solar generation units in France. Despite its push into the retail power and gas market, Total - which has regularly been tipped as a potential buyer of Engie - has no plans to become a mega-utility.  “We considered that the competition was asleep and we decided to shake things up,” Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne told investors last week. The company intends to keep its retail power unit in France lean, to continue selling at a discount to regulated tariffs. “We came into the market ... with a ‘low-cost’ model which is fundamentally digital. Today, we are managing three to four million clients with 500 people. So I can say that we are a kind of Uber in the electricity market,” Pouyanne said.

2018-11-26,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said no effort should be spared to help victims of a 6.3 magnitude earthquake on Iran’s western border with Iraq that injured more than 700 people, most suffering minor wounds, state television reported on Monday.  The Sunday night earthquake was felt in at least seven provinces of Iran, but most strongly in Kermanshah, where last year more than 600 people were killed and thousands injured in the country’s deadliest earthquake in more than a decade.  “Rouhani has ordered officials to do whatever is necessary to provide help for the victims of the earthquake,” TV reported. The head of Iran’s Red Crescent Society, Mahmoud Mohammadi Nasab, told TV that there were no fatalities. TV aired footage of damaged houses in the town of Sarpol-e Zahab in Kermanshah where some people remain homeless following last year’s 7.3 magnitude quake.   “We have had 729 injured, 700 of them have been treated and released ... some 18 people have been hospitalised,” Houshang Bazvand, governor of the western province of Kermanshah, told state TV. Iran’s state news agency IRNA said another two earthquakes measuring 5.2 and 4.6 on the Richter scale had jolted Sarpol-e Zahab on Monday morning following Sunday’s earthquake and 161 aftershocks.  Fears of aftershocks forced many people to spend the night out on the streets in cold weather. The quake triggered landslides in some areas, but Iranian authorities said rescue teams had access to all towns and villages.  Iran sits astride major fault lines and is prone to frequent tremors. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude quake in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the historic city of Bam.

Investors were also cautious before U.S. and Chinese leaders meet for crucial talks at the end of the week as trade tensions between the economic superpowers showed no signs of easing. “The U.S.-China summit is the biggest event for the rest of the year,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. European shares are seen opening higher, with spread-betters picking Britain’s FTSE, France’s CAC and Germany’s DAX to rise 0.4-0.5 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.6 percent, led by gains in Hong Kong and Taiwan, while Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.8 percent. In China, the Shanghai composite index eased 0.3 percent. U.S. stock futures tacked on 0.6 percent in Asian trade, on hopes of brisk spending by U.S. consumers on so-called Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. Shoppers across the United States snapped up deep discounts on toys, clothing and electronics both online and at stores on Black Friday, giving retailers a strong start to their make-or-break holiday season. U.S. stock markets had another tough session on Friday, when the benchmark S&P 500 hit its lowest close in more than six months as the energy sector took a beating in the wake of the oil slump. The S&P 500 fell 0.66 percent to end about 10.2 percent down from its Sept. 20 closing record high, the second time this year it has entered a 10-percent correction after a rout in early February. Oil prices bounced slightly after having dived 8 percent on Friday for their biggest weekly losses in almost three years as signs of slowing demand and rising U.S. production intensified fears of a supply glut. So far this month, both WTI and Brent futures were down more than 20 percent, and unless they recover further this week the losses would mark their biggest fall since October 2008. U.S. crude futures last fetched $51.12 per barrel, up 1.4 percent on the day and off Friday’s low of $50.15. Brent crude futures last stood at $59.39 per barrel, up 2.3 percent in Asia. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this month. Barring any deals there, the U.S. tariffs on $200 billion goods, introduced in late September, are likely to be raised to a proposed 25 percent next year from 10 percent. “July-September corporate earnings have hardly been affected by the latest tariffs. It’s in the next earnings that we will see the impact. And if the tariffs are raised further next year, earnings will be hit further,” said Mizuho’s Kuramochi. Some market players say investor worries go well beyond trade issues, noting the decline in global stocks and oil prices began right after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence intensified pressure on China in a speech on Oct. 4. In that speech, Pence highlighted disputes with China on wide-ranging issues from cyber attacks, Taiwan, freedom of the seas to human rights, accusing Chinese security agencies of masterminding the “wholesale theft of American technology,” including military blueprints. “Pence’s speech is a start of the cold war,” said a currency trader at a U.S. bank, meaning global supply chains would be put at risk. “And we have a slowdown in iPhones sales and all that. Bearish factors are piling up,” he said. Already, the global economy is showing cracks with businesses wary about investment amid the rising headwinds to earning growth. A survey on Friday showed euro zone business growth has been much weaker than expected this month as slowing global economic momentum and a U.S.-led trade war have led to a sharp fall in exports. IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone fell to 52.4 in November, its lowest since late 2014. That put pressure on the euro. The single currency traded at $1.1348, little changed in Asia after a 0.6 percent drop on Friday. Germany’s 10-year bond yield also fell to 0.331 percent its lowest since early September. The British pound hardly moved at $1.2818 after European Union leaders sealed a Brexit deal on Sunday. Markets are now looking to whether the deal can get through a fractious British parliament which is set to vote on it just before the next EU summit on Dec. 13-14. The yen edged down about 0.2 percent at 113.23 to the dollar on a rise in stocks. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies stood almost flat at 96.888, not far from this year’s top of 97.704 marked two weeks ago. But it could lose momentum if Federal Reserve policy makers take a more cautious approach to future policy tightening amid concern of economic slowdown next year. Chairman Jerome Powell will speak on Wednesday while Vice Chairman Richard Clarida’s speech is due on Tuesday. “If there are no dramatic changes at the weekend G20, then market focus will shift to how the Fed will deal with the current situation,” said Masayuki Kichikawa, chief macro strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. “There are already some dovish comments from the Fed recently.

2018-11-26,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The steep plunge in crude futures in the last few weeks was triggered by a nascent glut as supply-growth started to outpace demand, but it was also part of a broader pullback from risky emerging market assets such as Asian currencies and stocks. Those assets had done well in recent years, boosted by economic growth in nations such as China, India and Indonesia. But bulging debt across many Asian economies, tightening U.S. fiscal policy and the Sino-U.S. trade war have driven investors to vote with their feet, pulling their money out of assets such as oil or Asian stocks and instead turning to safe-havens like the U.S. dollar.  As part of that shift, oil markets have lost a third of their value since early October LCoc1CLc1. “Anything denominated against the USD is under pressure right now,” said Gregg McKenna, an independent cross-asset market analyst based in Australia. (GRAPHIC: Oil vs Dollar - tmsnrt.rs/2R8L4ih)  Billions of dollars have been pulled out of crude futures. “Traders reported capitulation and liquidation,” ANZ bank said in a note on Monday. It added that net long positions for crude futures, which would profit from increasing oil prices, “were reported to be cut to their lowest level in three years”. And traders seem to be preparing for further falls. Managed short positions in front-month U.S. crude oil futures CLc1, which would profit from further price declines, have surged from record lows of around 14,100 lots of 1,000 barrels each in July, to almost 110,000 lots by mid-November, exchange trade data showed. That is the highest number of short positions since October 2017. (GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil price & short positions - tmsnrt.rs/2Rjq7Sc)  What’s more, the number of puts - which give a trader the option though not obligation to sell a financial instrument at a certain price - in February Brent crude oil futures at $55 LCO5500N9 and $50 per barrel LCO5000N9 has surged to record levels since October. Equally, the price to buy such an option has jumped as demand for them has increased. (GRAPHIC: Brent put options - tmsnrt.rs/2R9W1jK)  The same pessimism can be seen in broader Asian markets. “2018 clearly marked the end of the 10-year Asia credit bull market due to tightening financial conditions in Asia (especially China),” Morgan Stanley said in a note released on Sunday. “We don’t think that we are at the bottom of the cycle yet,” the U.S. bank said. Its peer J.P. Morgan said on Friday that the “slide in U.S. and global equity markets shifts the balance of risks more clearly to the downside”. J.P. Morgan said the parallel slump in equities and commodities, including crude oil and industrial raw materials like iron ore and metals, was concerning. ANZ bank said “steel futures in China posted their fourth weekly decline as investors become increasingly worried about weak economic growth”.[O/R] (GRAPHIC: Oil prices vs Asian stock market - tmsnrt.rs/2R8dwku)  Beyond financial markets, there are also signs of a downturn in global trade. More than 90 percent of all products are taken from producer to consumer by ship. Here, rates for containers CHT-IDX-HARPX, which carry finished goods, and rates for dry-bulk vessels carrying raw materials like coal or iron ore .BADI, have slumped by 26.4 percent and 38.35 percent respectively from their 2018 highs as shipping stalls amid the economic headwinds. “Slowing U.S. growth would dampen demand for exports from Asia ... possibly weighing on freight,” Singapore shipping brokerage Eastport said on Monday.

2018-11-26,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China still needs to do a lot of work before it can fully launch its long-awaited nationwide carbon emissions trading scheme and will gradually phase in the system that is already running behind schedule, a senior government official said on Monday. China began launching pilot regional trading platforms in 2013 in line with its efforts to curb surging greenhouse gas emissions, compelling firms in industries like power, steel and cement to cut emissions or buy carbon permits to cover their annual allocations. The country had aimed to replace the regional pilots with a nationwide emissions trading scheme (ETS) by 2017, but it still needs to ensure it has the required legal and technological infrastructure in place, Li Gao, head of the climate change office at Ministry of Ecology and Environment, said.   “As far as work arrangements are concerned, we must promote the construction of the carbon market in a phased and step-by-step manner,” Li said, noting that China would also do its utmost to limit risks by preventing “speculation” and the “excessive financialization” of carbon trading.         Accumulated trade volume from China’s seven pilot regional carbon trading schemes reached 6 billion yuan ($863.9 million) by the end of October, up from 4.7 billion yuan at the end of last year, the ministry said. A total of 250 million tonnes of carbon dioxide had changed hands by the end of October, versus 200 million at the end of 2017. The schemes cover Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Chongqing and Shenzhen, as well as the provinces of Guangdong and Hubei. President Xi Jinping pledged in 2015 to replace the regional schemes with the nationwide ETS by 2017, but despite a soft launch late last year, trading has yet to get off the ground amid concerns about data accuracy in some industrial sectors. Li said China has already carried out a lot of “preliminary work” but the government still needed to draft new laws and regulations. The scheme will start with the electric power sector but China will aim to achieve full nationwide trading in the “shortest possible time”.  China is the world’s biggest source of greenhouse gases, and has pledged to bring emissions to a peak by “around 2030” as part of its commitments to the 2015 Paris accord.

2018-11-26,"LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has boasted that falling crude prices are like a tax cut for the world, however, motorists in much of Asia have yet to pocket substantial savings from the recent rout in oil markets. Since its 2018 closing peak of $86.29 a barrel on Oct. 3, Brent crude has tumbled 32 percent to end at $58.50 on Nov. 23. This decline has been matched by the price of 92-octane gasoline in Singapore, which was down by 33 percent from its peak of $92.65 a barrel on Oct. 2 to $62.30 on Nov. 23. However, the retail price of gasoline in major Asian countries has fallen by significantly smaller margins. The pump price of gasoline in India’s capital New Delhi was 76.66 rupees ($1.07) a litre on Nov. 24, according to price monitoring website mypetrolprice.com. This is down 10 percent from the peak of 84.06 rupees on Oct. 4, illustrating that the sharp decline in crude and ex-refinery gasoline prices has yet to filter through to consumers. However, the above calculation doesn’t factor in the impact of fuel taxes, which in India are about one-third of the retail price. Excluding taxes from the price reveals a slightly larger 13.2 percent drop in the untaxed component of India’s gasoline price from the October peak until Nov. 24. Australia’s national average gasoline price has dropped by about 14.1 percent, from a 2018 peak of A$1.605 ($1.16) a litre in the week to Oct. 28 to A$1.378 in the week to Nov. 25, according to data from the Australian Institute of Petroleum. Australia’s fuel taxes are about the same percentage as those in India, meaning there has been a slightly larger drop in the untaxed component of the fuel price, but still nothing close to the plunge in Brent. China, which has a managed system for retail fuel prices, has seen a lower drop than India and Australia, with gasoline falling 5.4 percent to 7.74 yuan ($1.12) a litre in the week ended Nov. 19, according to data on the website globalpetrolprices.com. It’s likely that retail gasoline prices will drop in those countries in coming weeks, but it would be unlikely that they fall by as much as motorists might hope for, given the slump in crude. Asian refiners are already struggling to make any money producing gasoline, with the profit margin, or crack, for making a barrel of 92-octane from Brent crude in Singapore at 32 cents on Nov. 23. This is up from a loss of $1.17 a barrel on Nov. 8, which was the weakest crack in seven years, but still well below the $11.55 peak for 2018, reached on Aug. 15. With profits from gasoline currently tenuous, the scope for refiners to lower prices further is likely constrained. In some ways it’s a double-edged sword for the region’s refiners, as they can lower gasoline prices and make a loss in the hope of boosting demand in order to remove a surplus of the fuel. Asian refiners are also in a quandary over strong margins for middle distillates, such as diesel, which encourage them to run their plants at high rates, even though this also ensures they produce more gasoline than the market is demanding. The profit margin for producing a barrel of gasoil, the base for diesel and jet fuel, from Dubai crude in Singapore was $15.50 in early trade on Monday, down from the 2018 peak of $17.97 on Nov. 15, but well above the low of $12.12 from June 27. Given the strong demand for diesel and robust refinery profits, it’s no surprise that the retail price in India and Australia has failed to reflect the recent decline in crude. Diesel in New Delhi was 70.65 rupees a litre on Nov. 23, down 6.7 percent from the recent peak of 75.74 rupees on Oct. 16. The national average diesel price in Australia was A$1.595 in the week to Nov. 25, down only 3.2 percent from the recent high of A$1.649 in the week to Oct. 28. While much of the focus in crude markets has been on the supply side, and the rapid switch from fears of tightness to oversupply, the demand side of the equation shouldn’t be ignored. Probably the best method for producers, traders and refiners of clearing oversupply in crude markets is to have demand gain to clear the surplus. However, given the modest declines in retail prices for gasoline and diesel in major Asian countries, a demand-led tightening of the market may remain elusive.

2018-11-26,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will work to achieve its existing greenhouse gas targets and strive to do better as the challenges of climate change become more urgent, Xie Zhenhua, the country’s top climate envoy, said at a briefing on Monday. “I believe the promises we make will be 100 percent completed and we will strive to do better,” said Xie, speaking to reporters before a new round of climate talks in Katowice, Poland on how to implement the 2015 Paris agreement. “Although we have encountered a lot of difficulties, a lot of problems, our targets and our resolution will not change,” he added.     China, the world’s biggest source of climate-warming carbon dioxide, has pledged to halt its rise in emissions by “around 2030” through cleaner forms of energy, boosting efficiency and encouraging high-technology industries. However, overseas researchers have suggested that China’s emissions already reached a peak of 9.53 gigatonnes in 2013 and declined in the three years that followed, suggesting that Beijing’s targets were far too conservative. U.S. President Donald Trump said last year that he would pull out of the 2015 agreement, arguing that it was too lenient on China. Xie said Trump’s decision to withdraw hurt the confidence and resolution of many other countries, but its impact was now beginning to wane, and China’s own commitments to clean, low-carbon development were unbending.           China has already met a target to cut carbon intensity - the amount of CO2 emissions per unit of economic growth - by 40-45 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, and it is also on course to bring the share of non-fossil fuels to 15 percent of total energy consumption by the end of the decade, Xie said. China was the world’s biggest investor in renewable energy and is in the process of establishing the world’s largest carbon trading exchange, he added. Xie said he hoped developed countries would honor their commitments to the Paris agreement and provide the promised financial and technical support to poorer nations.  He also called on nations to use the upcoming G20 meeting to reaffirm their commitment to combating climate change.      “We hope that this meeting can send out a strong political signal that these economic powers should continue to make efforts to carry out the Paris Agreement and 2030 sustainable development goals,” Xie said.

2018-11-26,"* B10 rules to increase minimum bio-content of biodiesel to 10 pct * Palm oil is used as feedstock for biodiesel * Move is part of push to boost local consumption of palm oil (Adds minister comment, background) KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Malaysia on Monday said it would start to phase in a higher biodiesel mandate from next month, with the new rule coming into full force from February in an effort to bolster palm oil prices. The so-called B10 biodiesel programme will raise the minimum bio-content that local producers must put in biodiesel to be used in transport to 10 percent from 7 percent, potentially boosting demand for palm oil as a feedstock. Primary industries minister Teresa Kok said the B10 programme would be implemented for the transportation sector in phases beginning from Dec. 1, with mandatory implementation from Feb. 1. A B7 programme for the industrial sector will be implemented from July. Malaysia, the world’s second biggest producer of palm oil after Indonesia, has taken a hit from a recent slump in the price of the vegetable oil. Benchmark palm oil prices slumped to a near three-year low last week due to high inventories, rising production and sluggish demand. Kok said the B10 programme would increase local consumption of crude palm oil and help reduce stocks. “At the current low price of palm oil, now is the right time to implement the expanded biodiesel programme,” she said. The higher mandate is expected to consume about 761,000 tonnes of palm oil annually, she said. (Reporting by Liz Lee, writing by A.

Markets are also bracing for a crucial meeting between U.S. and Chinese leaders at the end of the week as trade tensions between the economic superpowers showed no signs of easing. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged up 0.4 percent, led by gains in Taiwan shares following local elections, while Japan’s Nikkei advanced 0.6 percent. In China, the Shanghai composite index ticked up 0.3 percent. On Wall Street, U.S. stocks lost ground on Friday, with the benchmark S&P 500 hitting its lowest close in more than six months as the energy sector was sold off in the wake of the oil slump. The benchmark S&P 500 fell 0.66 percent to end about 10.2 percent down from its Sept. 20 closing record high, the second time this year it has entered a 10-percent correction after a rout in early February. U.S. stock futures rose 0.3 percent in Asian trade on Monday. Oil prices traded near their lowest levels since October last year, having dived 8 percent on Friday for the biggest weekly losses in nearly three years, with rising U.S. production intensifying fears of a supply glut. So far this month, both WTI and Brent futures were down more than 21 percent, on track for their biggest fall since October 2008 unless they recoup some of those losses this week. In early Monday trade, U.S. crude futures fetched $50.53 per barrel, slightly higher though not far from Friday’s low of $50.15. Brent crude futures last stood at $58.99 per barrel, near Friday’s low of $58.41. The oil woes also reflected anxiety over a heated trade war between the United States and China. “The U.S.-China summit is the biggest event for the rest of the year,” said Nobuhiko Kuramochi, chief strategist at Mizuho Securities. U.S. President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping are expected to hold talks on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina at the end of this month. Barring any deals there, the U.S. tariffs on $200 billion goods are set to be raised to 25 percent next year from 10 percent, Kuramochi said. Such a hike is likely to put a brake on the global economy, which is already showing cracks with businesses wary about investment amid the rising headwinds to earning growth. A survey on Friday showed euro zone business growth has been much weaker than expected this month as slowing global economic momentum and a U.S.-led trade war have led to a sharp fall in exports. IHS Markit’s Flash Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro zone fell to 52.4 in November, its lowest since late 2014. That put pressure on the euro. The single currency traded at $1.1335, little changed in Asia after a 0.6 percent drop on Friday. Germany’s 10-year bond yield also fell to 0.331 percent its lowest since early September. The British pound hardly moved at $1.2818 after European Union leaders sealed a Brexit deal on Sunday. Markets are now looking to whether the deal can get through a fractious British parliament which is set to vote on it just before the next EU summit on Dec. 13-14. The yen changed hands at 112.91 to the dollar. The dollar’s index against a basket of six major currencies stood at 96.908, not far from this year’s top of 97.704 marked two weeks ago.

2018-11-26,"(Reuters) - Cash-strapped Venezuela settled a $1.2 billion arbitration claim that will prevent a creditor from stripping away its crown jewel foreign asset, the U.S.-based Citgo Petroleum Corp refining business, according to Canadian court documents. The deal with Crystallex International Corp suspends the Canadian mining company’s push for a court-ordered auction of control of Citgo as a way of collecting on an arbitration award against Venezuela that has grown to more than $1.4 billion with interest. Citgo is based in Houston, Texas. Venezuela completed an initial payment of $425 million, mostly in the form of “liquid securities,” on Nov. 23, according to a filing in the Ontario Court of Justice, where Crystallex sought protection from creditors in 2011. Part of the payment was made in bonds issued by Venezuela and its state oil company, PDVSA, according to a Venezuelan finance industry source with knowledge of the issue.  Venezuela agreed to pay the remainder in installments by early 2021. If Venezuela fails to post collateral by Jan. 10 for the remaining payments, Crystallex can restart legal proceedings. A U.S. judge in Delaware was scheduled to hear on Dec. 20 Crystallex’s arguments for a court-ordered auction of control of Citgo. The company’s three U.S. refineries are a key destination for Venezuela’s crude exports, and Citgo has been valued in the billions of dollars. Venezuela has managed to protect Citgo even though the country has been crippled by an economic crisis and U.S. sanctions, and has halted payments on tens of billions of dollars of debt. Caracas made payments last month to investors who hold bonds secured by Citgo shares. Venezuela expropriated a Crystallex gold mining project in 2011, which led to the 2016 arbitration award. Crystallex and Venezuela reached an agreement last year, but Caracas failed to maintain payments after transferring $75 million. As Venezuela’s debt defaults have piled up and U.S. sanctions have isolated the country, creditors have closed in on overseas assets of PDVSA. ConocoPhillips said in October it had received $345 million in the third quarter from PDVSA as part of a four-year deal to settle a $2 billion arbitration award stemming from the loss of assets during a 2007 nationalization drive. Rusoro Mining Ltd reached a settlement with Venezuela in October. The Canadian mining company began pursuing Citgo this year to collect on a $1.3 billion arbitration award over the nationalization of its gold assets in the country.

2018-11-26,"* Brent remains below $60 per bbl after almost 8-pct drop on Fri * Oil plunge came amid broad market weakness * Morgan Stanley expects weakness to last into 2019 By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Oil prices won back some ground after hefty losses on Friday, but remained under pressure with Brent crude below $60 per barrel amid weak fundamentals and struggling financial markets. Front-month Brent crude oil futures were at $59.20 per barrel at 0049 GMT, up 40 cents, or 0.7 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were up 16 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $50.58 per barrel. But Monday’s gains did little to make up for the almost 8-percent plunge on Friday, which traders have already dubbed ‘Black Friday’. Greg McKenna, an independent financial analyst from Australia said there had been an “utter capitulation in crude oil” markets. The downward pressure comes from surging supply and a slowdown in demand-growth which is expected to result in an oil supply overhang in 2019. Beyond weak fundamentals, oil markets are also being impacted by a downturn in wider financial markets. “2018 clearly marked the end of the 10-year Asia credit bull market due to tightening financial conditions in Asia (especially China), and we expect this to remain the case in 2019,” Morgan Stanley said in a note released on Sunday. “We don’t think that we are at the bottom of the cycle yet,” the U.S. bank said. Oil markets have also been weighed down by the strong U.S.-dollar, which has surged against most other currencies this year, thanks to rising interest rates that have pulled investor money out of other currencies and also assets like oil, which are seen as more risky than the greenback. “Anything denominated against the USD is under pressure right now, said McKenna. Another risk to global trade and overall economic growth is the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, the United States and China. “The U.S.-China trade conflict poses a downside risk as we forecast the U.S. to impose 25 percent tariffs on all China imports by Q1 2019,” U.S. bank J.P. Morgan said in a note published on Friday. Reporting by Henning Gloystein

2018-11-26,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Drax (DRX.L) has started a pilot project to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions at its biomass plant, the first of its kind in Europe, Drax said on Monday. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) involves the capture of emissions from power plants and industry to allow them to be stored underground or compressed in containers to be used for industrial applications such as making drinks fizzy. The technology is also likely to be needed to help limit a rise in global temperatures at 1.5 degrees Celsius, according to a recent U.N. report. Drax said using the technology at the plant in North Yorkshire, England, that burns biomass - wood pellets, often made from compressed sawdust – could enable the company to operate the world’s first carbon negative power station. When coupled with CCS, the overall process of generating electricity from biomass removes more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than it releases, the company said. “If successful, the six-month pilot project will capture a tonne of CO2 (carbon dioxide) a day from the gases produced when renewable power is generated,” Drax said in a statement. Drax said the CO2 will initially be stored on site but that eventually it will seek to find a use for the gas, such as in the drinks industry which earlier this year was hit with a CO2 shortage. Britain has a target to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent compared with 1990 levels by 2050, but has asked its climate change experts to advise on whether it should set a date to meet a net zero emissions target. A report by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in October warned not meeting the goal to limit rising temperatures at 1.5 degrees would mean huge changes to the world such as rising sea levels, life-threatening heat and loss of species.
