2019-01-19,"MEXICO CITY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged to step up efforts to stamp out fuel theft on Saturday after an explosion at a pipeline killed at least 21 people and injured dozens more. The blast at the pipeline, which was ruptured by suspected thieves, sent flames shooting into the skies in the municipality of Tlahuelilpan in the central state of Hidalgo on Friday. Video footage showed residents scrambling to fill containers from the burst pipe and badly burned victims, raising questions about the management of an issue Lopez Obrador has made a top priority since taking office on Dec. 1. Veteran leftist Lopez Obrador launched a crackdown on fuel theft on Dec. 27 and ordered pipelines to be closed temporarily to stop illegal taps draining billions of dollars from the heavily-indebted state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex). “Far from stopping the fight ... against fuel theft, it’s going to become stronger, we’ll continue until we’ve eradicated these practices,” Lopez Obrador, who has said he will step up the security presence in sensitive areas, said. Video on social media of people filling buckets from the pipeline during daylight hours in the presence of the armed forces prompting questions about why authorities had not acted. The government said soldiers reached the scene after Pemex detected the illegal tap, but could not secure the area in time. “At some point there were too many people there and the army and military personnel withdrew to avoid problems,” Public Security Minister Alfonso Durazo told broadcaster Televisa. “It was just as they were withdrawing that the explosion occurred.” Aerial footage on Mexican television showed what appeared to be smoldering corpses scattered on the ground near the blaze. Hidalgo’s governor Omar Fayad said that emergency services had registered the charred bodies of 21 people, and that at least 71 others had been injured. However, he said the death toll could still rise as authorities reviewed the site. Lopez Obrador says his shutdown greatly reduced theft, but it sparked fears for the economy, as well as triggering shortfalls in central Mexico, including Hidalgo. Soon after the government said Friday’s blaze had been put out, TV footage showed tense exchanges between authorities guarding the site and residents arguing that the death toll was significantly higher than 21. The damage also raised the prospect of a new setback in the government’s bid to restore fuel supply. Pemex Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero said the ruptured pipeline, which Durazo said early findings suggested had been tapped before, was vital to transporting an additive needed for gasoline produced in Mexico.

2019-01-19,"(Updates with fire extinguished) MEXICO CITY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - At least 21 people were killed and 71 were injured on Friday when a pipeline ruptured by suspected fuel thieves exploded in central Mexico as dozens of people tried to fill up containers, state and federal authorities said. Mexican television footage showed flames leaping into the night sky in the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, in Hidalgo state north of Mexico City, as people screamed and cried for help. Hidalgo’s governor Omar Fayad told Mexican television that emergency services had registered the charred bodies of 21 people, and that at least 71 others had been injured. Fayad said the number of victims could still rise depending on what emergency services discovered where the blaze had been hottest, which had been difficult to access. Shortly before midnight, Public Security Minister Alfonso Durazo said the fire had been put out, and that the government would need time to establish the final death toll. Images published on broadcaster Televisa showed people with severe burns from the blast as the government sent in ambulances and doctors to treat the victims. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has launched a major crackdown on rampant fuel theft, which the government said cost the country more than $3 billion last year. The explosion was one of the worst in recent history in a country that has suffered hundreds of illegal ruptures to its network of oil and gas pipelines. “I urge the entire population not to be complicit in fuel theft,” Fayad said on Twitter. “Apart from being illegal, it puts your life and those of your families at risk.” The ruptured pipeline was near the Tula refinery of state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex), which in a statement blamed the incident on an illegal tap. Separate television footage showed the pipeline gushing a fountain of fuel earlier in the day and dozens of people at the site trying to fill buckets and plastic containers. Lopez Obrador expressed his concern on Twitter, and said he wanted “the entire government” to help people at the scene. Separately, Pemex said on Friday evening it was also dealing with a separate pipeline rupture by suspected fuel thieves in San Juan del Rio in the neighboring state of Queretaro. There was no danger to the population, the firm added. The president’s crackdown on theft has significant public backing, though his decision to turn off pipelines to thwart the thieves disrupted fuel supply in central Mexico and raised concern that the shortages could damage the economy. Some users of social media responded to the explosion with anger, saying the fuel thieves only had themselves to blame.
