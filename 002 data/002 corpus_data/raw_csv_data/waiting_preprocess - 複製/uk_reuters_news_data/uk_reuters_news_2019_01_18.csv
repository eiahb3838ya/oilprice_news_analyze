2019-01-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal court judge on Friday ruled that the federal government cannot process seismic testing permits for offshore oil drilling during the ongoing government shutdown, dealing a blow Trump administration’s energy agenda. Judge Richard Gergel of the U.S. District Court in South Carolina issued the decision in response to a motion filed by a range of conservation and business groups and coastal cities opposed to the administration’s efforts to expand U.S. offshore drilling. The Justice Department had sought a delay in the court proceedings arguing that it did not have the resources it needed to work on the case during the shutdown. Gergel said in his decision that he would grant the stay, but said federal authorities cannot work on seismic permitting until the government re-opens and is funded. The Interior Department has recalled employees, including those at the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM), to continue working on permitting for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling and testing despite the shutdown, drawing criticism from Democrats and environmentalists. “The Court hereby enjoins the federal defendants, BOEM, and any other federal agency or entity from taking action to promulgate permits, otherwise approve, or take any other official action regarding the pending permit applications for oil and gas surveys in the Atlantic,” Gergel wrote in his order. BOEM spokeswoman Connie Gillette said the agency will comply with the judge’s order but could not comment further due to the pending litigation. The Trump administration’s plans to open up offshore drilling along the eastern seaboard has riled state governments, including Republican-leaning South Carolina, who fear seismic testing and offshore drilling will harm their lucrative tourism industries. “While oil and gas exploration could bring in billions of dollars, doing it without adequate study and precautions could end up costing billions of dollars and cause irreversible damage to our economy and coast,” said South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, who is seeking to join the lawsuit fighting drilling, said.

2019-01-18,"MADRID, Jan 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Spain’s prime minister vowed on Friday to make up for a decade of inaction on climate change brought on by a harsh economic recession during which he said the country lost its passion and creativity to tackle the issue. Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez, who came into power in June, said the low-carbon transition Spain is now aiming for must be “socially just”, and not leave anyone behind, including coal miners set to lose their jobs in the shift from fossil fuels. “Spain is ready to contribute to creating a global economy that is prosperous, fair and ecological,” Sanchez told a high-level discussion on boosting climate ambition in Madrid. A new national plan for energy and climate, expected to mobilise investments of 235 billion euros ($267.15 billion) from 2021-2030, will soon be submitted to the European Union, he said. Officials said the Socialist government also plans to present a new climate change law to parliament by the end of this month. A draft, published last November, included targets for the southern European nation to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, and to produce all of its electricity from renewable sources by the same date. Sanchez noted that legislation on climate change was often unpopular with the general public. It could usher in tough adaptation in the short-term, but the aim was to avoid longer-term damage - and governments should ask citizens to understand and support this, he added. Communicating the need for urgent action on climate change was a key motivation for two days of debate on sustainable development and climate change, organised by Spain’s Ministry for Ecological Transition. Speakers included top global experts such as U.N. climate chief Patricia Espinosa, economists Nicholas Stern and Jeffrey Sachs, and former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark. Clark, who headed the United Nations Development Programme from 2009-2017, said Spain could play a key role in an alliance of governments that “get it” on climate change, alongside others such as Sweden, Canada and her own country. “We need political will and leadership,” she said. Teresa Ribera, Spain’s minister for ecological transition, emphasised the importance of international solidarity in fighting climate change. At U.N. climate talks in Poland in December, governments understood it was worthwhile continuing to work together despite efforts by a few, such as the United States, to break the united front shown in the 2015 Paris Agreement, she said. The U.N.’s Espinosa said success at those negotiations on agreeing the rules for putting the Paris accord into practice showed “multilateralism is still in force”. “We can only tackle global problems through cooperation and joint work,” she added. In an interview with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, she said she hoped a climate summit called by the U.N. secretary-general for September would spur countries to raise their targets for cutting emissions, so as to meet the Paris pact goal of limiting warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius. Under the accord, governments have committed to strengthen their national climate plans by 2020. Espinosa said some could come forward with those plans as soon as the September summit, inspiring others to follow. Stern warned that if global temperatures rise 3 degrees C above pre-industrial times, as they are now on track to do, it would bring mass migration, conflict, “destruction and decline”. But moving to adopt clean energy and reduce carbon emissions would create jobs in renewable power generation and other sectors, and result in cities “where we can move and breathe”. ""It is crystal clear that this transition to the zero-carbon economy is the growth story of this century,"" he said.

2019-01-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World stock indexes jumped on Friday, with Wall Street posting a fourth straight week of gains, and the dollar had its first positive week since mid-December as optimism increased that an end is in sight to the U.S.-China trade conflict. Stocks were boosted by a Bloomberg report that said China sought to raise its annual goods imports from the United States by more than $1 trillion (£776 billion) in order to reduce its trade surplus to zero by 2024. That followed a report on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. The Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. While the equity rally lifted all major sectors, trade-sensitive industrials .SPLRCI posted among the biggest S&P 500 sector gains, up 1.9 percent on the day. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index .SOX rose more than 2 percent and Germany's exporter-heavy DAX .GDAXI was up 2.6 percent. “There seems to be some progress going in the trade negotiations,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. While that was the biggest influence, “we’ve still got momentum since the first of the year,” he said. “Some of the money that came out of the market at year-end, whether it was high frequency traders or tax-loss selling, is coming back in.” Adding to strength in equities and supporting U.S. Treasury yields was data that showed U.S. manufacturing output increased the most in 10 months in December.  Some strategists said relatively light equity trading volume this week indicated that some investors were still waiting on the sidelines. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 336.25 points, or 1.38 percent, to 24,706.35, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 34.75 points, or 1.32 percent, to 2,670.71 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 72.77 points, or 1.03 percent, to 7,157.23. The S&P 500 registered its biggest four-week percentage gain since October 2011. The index is now 8.9 percent below its Sept. 20 record close after dropping 19.8 percent below that level - near the 20-percent threshold commonly considered to confirm a bear market - on Christmas Eve. The pan-European STOXX 600 index  rose 1.80 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS gained 1.23 percent. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for another round of talks aimed at resolving the trade dispute between the world’s two largest economies. Recent indicators show signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum. The trade optimism boosted the dollar against other major currencies. The dollar index .DXY rose 0.31 percent, with the euro EUR= down 0.26 percent to $1.1365. U.S. Treasury yields rose to three-week highs as investors piled back into Wall Street. Benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR last fell 12/32 in price to yield 2.7878 percent, compared with 2.747 percent late on Thursday. Oil prices jumped about 3 percent, rising after OPEC detailed specifics on its production-cut activity to ease global oversupply.

2019-01-18,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore’s defence minister said on Friday that Lockheed Martin Corp’s F-35 fighter jets were the most suitable replacement for the country’s F-16 fleet, and it planned to initially buy a few for evaluation. With Southeast Asia’s largest defence budget, the wealthy city-state is a key prize for global arms companies as it looks to invest in new technology and upgrade its equipment. Singapore’s fleet of around 60 F-16 jets, which first entered service in 1998, will be retired soon after 2030. “They (defence agencies) have decided that the F-35 would be the most suitable replacement fighter,” Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen said in a Facebook post. “We want to procure a few planes first, to fully evaluate the capabilities of the F-35 before deciding on the acquisition of a full fleet.” Ng said defence agencies would speak to their U.S. counterparts to move the process forward, but that it would take 9-12 months to finalise terms on the initial deal. The F-35, one of the world’s most advanced fighter jets,  accounts for about a quarter of Lockheed’s total revenue. “We look forward to supporting them on their continued evaluation of the F-35,” a Lockheed spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. The most common variation of the jet, the F-35A, costs around $90 million each, based on contract negotiations with the Pentagon in the United States. While the price has declined with increased production, U.S. President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have criticized it as too high, and have cited numerous production delays and cost overruns. Other international customers have expressed interest in the F-35. Both Switzerland and Finland have competitions underway to select a new fighter jet. Last year, all Lockheed Martin’s U.S. and international F-35 fighter jets were grounded for engine inspections following a crash of an F-35B on Sept. 28 near Beaufort, South Carolina.

2019-01-18,"MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Friday urged both Russia and Ukraine to de-escalate the conflict in eastern Ukraine and said France and Germany were ready to help by monitoring naval traffic near the Crimean coast. Speaking in Kiev after a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin, Maas again called for Moscow to release of the crews of three Ukrainian navy vessels it seized in November off Crimea. He said Russia must allow ships to pass through the Kerch Strait that leads to the Sea of Azov. “All sides must contribute to the de-escalation of the conflicts,” said Maas in Kiev after meeting with Lavrov earlier in the day in Moscow. Klimkin welcomed the offer to monitor shipping traffic through the Kerch Strait. Lavrov told reporters President Vladimir Putin had agreed to a proposal by German Chancellor Angela Merkel for German experts to monitor the strait a month ago, but they had still not arrived. It was not immediately clear if French participation had previously been offered. Events in the Kerch Strait have exacerbated tensions between Ukraine and Russia over the Moscow’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and violence between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Maas bemoaned lack of progress in implementing the so-called Minsk peace accord aimed at ending the violence in eastern Ukraine, and also took aim at Kiev for what he called insufficient progress on combating corruption. Despite its concerns over Russian actions, Germany has continued to back the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project that has drawn criticism from Washington and some European states. Maas said Lavrov had renewed Moscow’s pledge to continue shipments of natural gas through Ukraine despite work on the Nord Stream 2 pipeline under the Baltic Sea. Russian gas giant Gazprom is building the project jointly with Western partners Uniper, Wintershall, Engie, OMV and Shell.

2019-01-18,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Northern Cyprus wants to resolve a dispute over natural gas drilling with Greek Cypriots to avoid the possibility of its leading to wide instability, the breakaway state’s deputy prime minister said after visits with Trump administration officials and U.S. lawmakers.  “We believe this is an unfair situation ... which may put the stability of the region at risk,” Kudret Ozersay, who is also foreign minister of Northern Cyprus, said in an interview last week. Ozersay was on his first diplomatic visit to the United States in his current position for Northern Cyprus, which only Turkey recognizes as a country.  Cyprus is thought to have rich deposits of offshore natural gas, but the island is divided and tensions are rising about the drilling.  Cyprus was split by a Turkish invasion in 1974 that followed a Greek-inspired coup. Northern Cyprus is now a Turkish Cypriot state of about 300,000 people.  Greek Cypriots, who run Cyprus’ internationally recognized government, have licensed several offshore blocks to multinational energy companies for exploration. They have said a peace deal would allow both communities to benefit from any offshore resources, but have balked at including the issue in settlement talks. Peace talks collapsed in 2017. Next month Greek Cypriots and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) are due to announce the results of offshore natural gas exploration.  Ozersay said the terms of drilling are unacceptable because they allow Greek Cypriots to profit from drilling even before a settlement is reached, while Turkish Cypriots can only profit after such an agreement. There is a “window of opportunity” for the two sides to agree terms to drilling that are acceptable to Northern Cyprus, said Ozersay, who talked with U.S. officials to pressure for change. Last year Cyprus accused the Turkish military of blocking the Saipem 12000 drill ship, contracted by Italian company Eni (ENI.MI) from exploring for natural gas. Turkey claimed that certain areas of Cyprus’s offshore exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, fall under the jurisdiction of Turkey or that of Turkish Cypriots. The move was noticed by Washington. Local media reported in June that Wess Mitchell, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, said Washington had been clear in its messaging with Turkish officials that “harassment of drilling vessels in the (EEZ) is not something that we will allow to go unnoticed or speak up about.”  The State Department did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting with Ozersay. Ozersay said Northern Cyprus has cooperated with international bodies to extradite individuals listed on Interpol, the international police body, and wants to continue the efforts, a hint that the breakaway state should be recognized for its efforts. “To the extent possible we will try to implement the rules of international law and we will be ready to cooperate with international actors and organizations,” he said. An expert on European energy politics said Northern Cyprus was trying to build momentum while President Donald Trump expects warmer relations with Turkey. “Clearly the Trump administration is trying to improve relations with Turkey, thus it is logical that Northern Cyprus is trying to leverage a deal,” said Brenda Shaffer, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Eurasian, Russia and and East European Studies at Georgetown University’s School of Foreign Service. Ozersay also met with U.S. Representatives Steve Cohen and Gerald Connolly, both Democrats, and Steve Chabot and John Curtis, both Republicans. The lawmakers did not respond to requests for comment about their meetings.

2019-01-18,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rallied about 3 percent on Friday, boosted after OPEC detailed specifics on its production-cut activity to reduce world supply, and on signals of progress in resolving the U.S.-China trade war. Futures were on track for a third straight week of gains, with Brent crude LCOc1 up $1.64 to $62.82 a barrel, or 2.7 percent, at 11:06 a.m. EST (1606) GMT. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up $1.70 to $53.77 a barrel, or 3.3 percent. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries on Friday issued a list of oil production cuts by its members and other major producers for six months starting on Jan. 1 to boost confidence in its oil supply reduction pact. “It’s going to send a signal to the market that they’re serious,” said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago. “I think they also want to point out that they’re probably going to be overcompliant with these numbers, especially from Saudi Arabia.” The OPEC and non-OPEC ministerial panel also called on members and the organization’s allies, including Russia, to “redouble their efforts in the full and timely implementation” of the move. The producer group and its allies agreed in December to return to output cuts, of 1.2 million barrels per day, to support oil prices and fight a glut amid rising supply, especially from the United States.  On Thursday, OPEC’s monthly report showed it had made a strong start in December before the pact went into effect, implementing the biggest month-on-month production drop in almost two years.     Markets were also buoyed by signs that Washington and Beijing might soon resolve their trade dispute.      A Bloomberg report on Friday showed China offered to go on a buying spree of U.S. goods, which investors saw as an attempt to draw closer to a trade deal with Washington. However, some signs of weakening demand and surging U.S. output may keep prices in check. The International Energy Agency said on Friday that U.S. oil production growth combined with a slowing global economy would put oil prices under pressure. “By the middle of the year, U.S. crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either Saudi Arabia or Russia,” said the IEA, which kept its estimate of oil demand growth unchanged and close to 2018 levels at 1.4 million barrels per day.

2019-01-18,"(Recasts, adds quote) By Scott DiSavino Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut 21 oil rigs this week, the biggest decline since February 2016, as drillers reacted to the 40 percent plunge in U.S. crude prices late last year. Drillers cut 21 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 18, bringing the total count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI Many of the rigs cut were in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the country’s biggest shale oil formation, were the rig count dropped by seven this week to 481, the lowest since August. Oil prices tanked in the fourth quarter of 2018, with U.S. crude futures dropping from a near four-year high of $76.90 a barrel in early October to an 18-month low of $42.36 in December. The move forced some companies to reconsider capital spending plans, and there is ongoing concern that prices will remain soft enough that it will restrict new investment. “Obviously they’re reacting in sort of slow-motion fashion to the price crash that we had during November and December,” said John Kilduff, partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital LLC in New York, noting it takes a month or two to add or pull a rig after deciding to do so. The rest of this week’s rig decline occurred in smaller oil producing regions scattered across the country. The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 747 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. Several producers, however, have said they expect to reduce drilling activity in 2019 after U.S. crude prices fell 25 percent last year, the first annual decline since 2015. If they follow through on those cuts, it would be the first annual average rig count decline in three years after they added 138 oil rigs in 2018 and 222 in 2017. They cut 11 rigs in 2016. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided mixed guidance for 2019 after indicating they would spend about $88.7 billion in 2018, a 23 percent increase over the $72.2 billion spent in 2017. There were 1,050 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020. That forecast was unchanged from the previous week. Reporting by Scott DiSavino and Laila Kearney in New York;

2019-01-18,"WASHINGTON, Jan 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Indigenous people from across the globe gathered in the U.S. capital on Friday for a march drawing attention to social and environmental injustices against indigenous communities worldwide, in what organizers said was a first-ever event. Coordinators said more than a thousand participated in the Indigenous Peoples March, aimed at raising awareness about systemic problems, including police brutality, violence against women, voter suppression and an “environmental holocaust”. Up to 2.5 billion people depend on indigenous and community lands, which make up more than half of all land globally, but they legally own just 10 percent. Campaigners say native groups are struggling with encroachment by governments and logging, mining and agribusiness companies. “We’re here in support of the aims of indigenous peoples across the world – that is, for our safety, health, the protection of our families and our water, for the protection of our lives,” Rufus Kelly, of the Nottoway Tribe in Virginia, said. “And we want to make sure that people know we have not gone anywhere – that we are still here. We’re not extinct. We’re right here among you, and we want to share that with you.” Parallel events took place in other U.S. cities and abroad, said Jesse Phelps of the Lakota People’s Law Project, saying the D.C. march was a “huge step toward the unification and amplification” of indigenous voices. The march stems from a months-long 2016-17 protest between the U.S. government and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe over plans for an oil pipeline to cross Sioux lands in North Dakota, said co-organizer Nathalie Farfan, noting that one of Donald Trump’s first moves as president was to approve construction on the project. “Standing Rock was a traumatic situation, but that was also the first time we saw allies come from all over to help out,” Farfan said. That type of solidarity-building has been taking place across the globe, according to Victoria Tauli-Corpuz, the United Nations’ top expert on the rights of indigenous peoples, who said she “fully supports” Friday’s marches. ""Indigenous peoples in almost all parts of the world are still suffering from racism and discrimination and gross violations of their human rights, but their persistence in strengthening their movements and communities enabled some of them to succeed in protecting their lands and territories from environmental destruction,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

2019-01-18,"WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian oil producer MEG Energy Corp’s (MEG.TO) CEO invited his Husky Energy Inc (HSE.TO) counterpart this month to negotiate a friendly takeover of MEG, but Husky did not follow up, MEG’s vice president of investor relations John Rogers said on Friday. Husky abandoned its hostile bid for MEG on Thursday, saying  it could not win sufficient MEG shareholder support after Alberta’s government ordered production cuts to reduce a crude glut.  MEG’s chief executive officer, Derek Evans, phoned Husky CEO Rob Peabody in early January and invited him to visit and discuss a possible friendly deal to sell MEG, Rogers said. “We approached them and said, ‘You know with a little bit of negotiation, I’m sure we can find a way out of this,’” Rogers said, recalling MEG’s invitation. “They never got back to us.” Husky spokesman Mel Duvall said its offer expired without the minimum tender condition being met.  MEG produced an estimated 88,000 barrels of oil per day in 2018, according to GMP First Energy, equal to about 40 percent of Husky’s production. The company, whose investors include Chinese state-owned oil producer CNOOC Ltd (0883.HK), is the largest pure-play Canadian heavy oil producer. Publicly, Husky, whose majority investor is Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing, continued to urge MEG shareholders to tender to its offer leading up to its expiry this past Wednesday.  Husky was expected to secure over 50 percent support from MEG shareholders, sources told Reuters and other media outlets on Wednesday. It was expected to consider extending its offer to win the required two-thirds. But Husky allowed the offer to expire, citing Alberta’s curtailment orders and a lack of progress expanding pipelines as recent negative developments. It has not said publicly how much support it received. The company’s decision to abandon its bid “may dent its credibility,” RBC analyst Greg Pardy said in a note. MEG had invited Husky in November to sign a confidentiality agreement and enter its data room, Rogers said. Husky did not take MEG up on it, although several other companies did, he said.   No rival bids were made. MEG’s spurned invitations suggest that Husky’s commitment to the deal may have wavered after conditions in Canada’s oil patch deteriorated. Discounts on Canadian oil hit record-high levels in October, leading the Alberta government to order the curtailments, which Husky has criticized. Rogers said he did not believe MEG was in play any longer, despite a 36 percent selloff of its stock on Thursday that could make the heavy oil producer a bargain buy.

2019-01-18,"(Adds ABPA comment in paragraph 11) By Jake Spring and Anthony Boadle BRASÍLIA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Brazil is moving toward a self-monitoring system for food processors, Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Friday, including meatpackers still recovering from an inspection scandal that hurt trade with key markets. Dias said in an interview that the South American nation’s new business-friendly government plans to send draft legislation on self-monitoring to Congress in the first half of this year. Self-monitoring, widely used in the United States and other developed countries in Europe, would be introduced gradually across various agricultural products and eventually be used for oversight of meatpackers. “Why can’t Brazil do self-monitoring when Europe and the United States use it?” Dias told Reuters. Commercial partners banned certain Brazilian meat producers after a federal probe revealed alleged bribery and falsified inspection results in the country’s meat exporting industry, the world’s largest. The scandal briefly threatened about $15 billion in exports from Brazil’s powerhouse protein industry as markets from China to Europe curtailed shipments of meat pending a review of the South American nation’s inspection protocols. But Dias, a farm lobby congresswoman who was picked to head the agriculture ministry by new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, adamantly defended the food industry’s ability to monitor itself. “Our agriculture sector can provide guarantees. Just because of one episode we shouldn’t demonize Brazil’s food industry,” she said. Dias argued that Brazilian multinational companies already use self-monitoring at subsidiaries abroad. Brazil is home to meatpacking giants JBS SA and BRF SA, both of which were implicated in the ongoing food probes. The federal investigation, which started in 2017 and was expanded last year, is examining relations between food processors, Agriculture Ministry officials and laboratories with a mandate to certify the safety of meat sold domestically and in foreign markets such as China, Japan, the Middle East and Europe. JBS and BRF declined to comment on the introduction of a self-monitoring system. Meat industry lobby group ABPA said it supports initiatives to strengthen quality controls, without elaborating. Dias said she could not give specifics on what oversight would remain in the hands of the government since the matter was still under discussion with companies. Dias said she has not begun talks with the European Union over lifting its ban on Brazilian chicken imports as the Bolsonaro government, which took office on Jan. 1, was still formulating its policies. The agriculture minister said she may travel to China in February or March, but no date for the trip has been set. Beijing has imposed anti-dumping measures on Brazilian chicken products, which Brasília is trying to get lifted. Brazil’s farm sector is also concerned that Bolsonaro’s plan to move the country’s Israeli embassy to Jerusalem could hurt halal meat sales to Muslim countries, Dias said. Exports of Halal food, including beef, chicken, honey and cheese, rose to an estimated $5 billion last year. “Of course, the agricultural sector that I represent is worried,” she said, when asked about possible repercussions for trade with Arab countries angered by the foreign policy shift by Brazil, which has traditionally backed a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. She said the policy is still being ironed out within Brazil’s government and talks are being held with trading partners. “We have to find a middle ground going forward because Brazil cannot lose markets. What we need is to open new markets,” Dias said.

2019-01-18,"(Reuters) - Tellurian Inc’s (TELL.O) proposed Driftwood liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Louisiana took a major step forward on Friday as the U.S. federal energy regulator issued a final environmental report clearing the way for the company to seek a permit to build the export terminal. The company said it now needs an order from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allowing the construction and operation of the 27.6 million tonn per annum (mtpa) liquefaction plant aimed at meeting growing global demand for the supercooled fuel. “Tellurian will then stand ready to make a final investment decision and begin construction in the first half of 2019, with the first LNG expected in 2023,” said Tellurian Chief Executive Meg Gentle in an statement. In the report, known as a final environmental impact statement, FERC staff concluded that the Driftwood LNG project “would result in adverse impacts on the environment; however, impacts on the environment would be reduced to less than significant levels” with avoidance and mitigation measures. Driftwood is one of dozens liquefaction/export projects under development in the United States seeking customers so they can start construction and enter service over the next decade to meet growing global demand for the fuel. U.S. LNG exports have quadrupled in the last two years and are expected to top 10.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) by the end of 2020, making the country one of the world’s largest LNG exporters. One bcf of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. In addition to the LNG terminal, Tellurian is developing pipelines to transport gas from shale formations in Texas and Louisiana to LNG terminals and other Gulf Coast customers.

Adding to strength in equities and supporting U.S. Treasury yields was data that showed U.S. manufacturing output increased the most in 10 months in December. Wall Street was set for a fourth week of gains, with foreign trade-sensitive industrials up 1.9 percent and leading sector gains for the S&P 500.

The trade hopes followed a report on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin was considering lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports. The Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. “There seems to be more goodwill on both sides now.

2019-01-18,"HOUSTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The trading arm of Australian bank Macquarie Group has  filed a lawsuit against Jupiter Marketing & Trading, alleging the U.S. firm breached contracts for oil purchase and storage. Macquarie is seeking some $17.5 million in fees and outstanding payments from Jupiter, according to the suit, which was filed on Thursday in Harris County District Court in Houston. Jupiter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Privately held Jupiter is one of several pipeline and storage suppliers racing to build crude export terminals along the U.S. Gulf Coast. It has proposed a terminal in Brownsville, Texas, with 10 million barrels of storage capacity and the capability to load a Very Large Crude Carrier. In October, Jupiter said it had secured funding to build a 680-mile crude oil pipeline from West Texas to the U.S. Gulf Coast, which could transport 1 million barrels of oil per day. Macquarie is seeking some $3 million to terminate existing storage and purchase agreements with Jupiter and roughly $14.5 million for outstanding payments of crude oil it sold to Jupiter. Under one of the agreements, Macquarie had rights to store crude at Jupiter’s space at a NuStar Energy facility. In December, NuStar alerted Macquarie that Jupiter was overdue on storage payments at that terminal, according to the lawsuit. By early January, the firm told Jupiter it would terminate its agreements, requesting the termination fee and outstanding payments for oil purchased. Representatives for NuStar did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Macquarie declined to comment.

2019-01-18,"(Reuters) - U.S. refiners are bidding up prices for scarce types of crude oil needed for their most sophisticated plants as the United States reconsiders harsher sanctions on Venezuela that could further reduce imports of the country’s oil. Trump administration officials in recent days met with U.S. oil company executives to lay out potential actions in response to the Jan. 10 inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an election it considered illegitimate.  Among other steps, U.S. officials have recognized the opposition-run Venezuelan congress as the only legitimately elected authority.  But the proposals that would most affect the energy industry involve banning U.S. exports of refined products to Venezuela or limiting oil imports - a move that, until now, the White House has not taken even after sanctioning individuals and barring access to U.S. banks. “It’s more serious than I’ve heard before,” said a refining industry executive familiar with the White House discussions. “They are setting the table to pull the trigger if they have to.”  U.S. refiners have few supply alternatives if the Trump administration were to cut off crude imports from that country. Supplies of the heavy oils preferred by Gulf Coast refiners have been harder to secure in recent months because of cutbacks and production curbs in Western Canada, Mexico and Venezuela.  One type of U.S. heavy oil, called Mars, traded at a $6.80 per barrel premium to U.S. crude futures on Thursday, the strongest in nearly five years and up from a $4.50 per barrel premium on Tuesday, a U.S. oil broker said.  U.S. companies that depend on Venezuelan oil have opposed past proposals that would halt imports and did so again this week, said several people close to the talks. Two big refiners, Phillips 66 (PSX.N) and PBF Energy (PBF.N), cut direct purchases from state-run PDVSA last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Latin American advisers have warned the administration that oil sanctions could backfire by making the United States appear to be forcing political change in Venezuela, said a person familiar with talks among the White House, the National Security Council and oil firms.  U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has become directly involved, accelerating possible financial and political steps against Maduro, the person said. A State Department spokesperson on Friday said the U.S. is considering “all diplomatic and economic measures” to support Venezuelans working to restore democracy.  Venezuela last year exported 500,013 barrels per day of crude to the United States, its main destination for oil exports, down from 591,422 bpd in 2017, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  The largest U.S. importers of Venezuelan oil last year were Citgo Petroleum [PDVSAC.UL], the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA, Valero Energy (VLO.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and PBF Energy.  Citgo, Valero and PBF Energy either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment. Chevron declined to comment on the potential for sanctions, but said it actively manages supplies and has plans in place to make necessary adjustments to ensure it can supply customers.  “The cautious approach taken by the U.S. in recent days – not imposing new sanctions right after Maduro’s inauguration – suggests the next step could be a meaningful escalation of pressure to try to restore democratic order,” Barclays analysts wrote in a note to investors on Friday. Options on the table include restricting Venezuela’s imports of U.S. diluents that are used to make exportable crude blends; a full oil embargo on Venezuela’s shipments to the United States; and the recognition of an alternative government to Maduro’s, which could allow the international community to freeze and divert assets and revenues, according to Barclays.

2019-01-18,"Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firms cut 21 oil rigs this week, the biggest decline since February 2016, even as the United States is expected to reinforce its leadership as the world’s number one crude producer this year. Drillers cut 21 oil rigs in the week to Jan. 18, bringing the total count down to 852, the lowest since May 2018, General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is still much higher than a year ago when 747 rigs were active after energy companies boosted spending in 2018 to capture higher prices that year. Crude oil output from the United States last week rose to a peak of 11.9 million barrels per day (bpd), and is expected to hit a new record of more than 12 million bpd this year and climb to nearly 13 million bpd next year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said this week. The United States has become the world’s largest crude producer, boosted by output from shale formations, with production of nearly 11 million bpd in 2018, which broke the country’s annual record set in 1970. U.S. oil production growth combined with a slowing global economy will put oil prices under pressure in 2019, challenging OPEC’s resolve to support the market with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. “The United States, already the biggest liquids supplier, will reinforce its leadership as the world’s number one crude producer. By the middle of the year, U.S. crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either Saudi Arabia or Russia,” the IEA said. U.S. crude futures were trading above $53.50 a barrel on Friday, putting the front-month on track to rise for a third week in a row after a report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) showed its production fell sharply last month, easing global oversupply concerns. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading near $55 a barrel for the balance of 2019 and for calendar 2020 . Several producers have said they expect to reduce drilling activity in 2019 after U.S. crude prices fell 25 percent last year, the first annual decline since 2015. If they follow through on those cuts, it would be the first annual average rig count decline in three years after they added 138 oil rigs in 2018 and 222 in 2017. They cut 11 rigs in 2016. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided mixed guidance for 2019 after indicating they would spend about $88.7 billion in 2018, a 23 percent increase over the $72.2 billion spent in 2017. There were 1,050 oil and natural gas rigs active in the United States this week, according to Baker Hughes. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and gas rig count will fall from 1,032 in 2018 to 999 in 2019 before rising to 1,087 in 2020. That forecast was unchanged from the previous week. Reporting by Scott DiSavino

2019-01-18,"(Adds details of communications, analyst comment) By Rod Nickel WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of Canadian oil producer MEG Energy Corp invited his counterpart at Husky Energy Inc earlier this month to negotiate a friendly takeover of MEG but Husky did not follow up, MEG’s vice president of investor relations, John Rogers, said on Friday. Husky abandoned its hostile bid for MEG on Thursday, saying it could not win sufficient MEG shareholder support after Alberta’s government ordered production cuts to reduce a crude glut. MEG CEO Derek Evans phoned Husky CEO Rob Peabody in early January and invited him to visit and discuss a possible friendly deal to sell MEG, Rogers said. “We approached them and said, ‘You know with a little bit of negotiation, I’m sure we can find a way out of this,’” Rogers said, recalling MEG’s invitation. “They never got back to us.” A Husky official said he could not immediately comment. Publicly, Husky continued to urge MEG shareholders to tender to its offer leading up to its expiry this past Wednesday. Husky was expected to secure over 50 percent support from MEG shareholders, sources told Reuters and other media outlets on Wednesday. It was expected to consider extending its offer to win the required two-thirds. Instead, it allowed it to expire, citing Alberta’s curtailment orders and a lack of progress expanding pipelines as recent negative developments. Husky has not said publicly how much support it received. Husky’s surprise decision to abandon its bid “may dent its credibility,” RBC analyst Greg Pardy said in a note. MEG had issued an earlier invitation to Husky in November to sign a confidentiality agreement and enter its data room, Rogers said. Husky did not take MEG up on it, although several other companies did, he said. No rival bids were made. MEG’s spurned invitations suggest that Husky’s commitment to the deal may have wavered after conditions in Canada’s oil patch deteriorated. Discounts on Canadian oil hit record-high levels in October, leading the Alberta government to order the curtailments, which Husky has criticized. Rogers said he did not believe MEG was in play any longer, despite a 36 percent selloff of its stock on Thursday that could make the heavy oil producer a bargain buy.

2019-01-18,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil should open indigenous land to commercial farming, Agriculture Minister Tereza Cristina Dias said on Friday, while also seeking to soften many of President Jair Bolsonaro’s controversial stances on native people and the environment. Farmers form a key base of support for right-wing firebrand Bolsonaro who since taking office Jan. 1 has placed pro-agribusiness policies at the center of his agenda. Activists warn his government’s positions would strip away protections for the environment, the Amazon rainforest and indigenous peoples. Reservation land covering roughly 12 percent of Brazil’s territory is currently off limits for commercial farming. “They could plant there ... and maybe have income for their community,” Dias told reporters. “They cannot do this today. That needs to be changed in Congress.” Reservations should still be required to preserve a minimum percentage of native vegetation, as all farmers currently are, she said. Bolsonaro has given control over indigenous land designations to the Agriculture Ministry, after arguing on the campaign trail that no new indigenous reservations should be created. But Dias struck a more moderate tone, saying Bolsonaro did not favor new reservations in areas that have long been settled by farmers. “Small farmers that have been there 50 years and have deeds issued by the state or federal government, if you kick them out, there aren’t conditions there for indigenous people to hunt and fish and have their lives,” she said in a press briefing. “When the president says he doesn’t want more demarcations, he’s talking about this type of contested areas.” But the Amazon deserves completely different treatment, and tribes with little contact with the outside world should be protected, she said, a position that is shared by Brazil’s new rights minister who will be responsible for indigenous affairs. Bolsonaro has suggested Brazil may exit the Paris Agreement on climate change and appointed a foreign minister who calls global warming a leftist fabrication. But Dias said she is fine with staying in the accord, as the country is on track to meet its climate change goals. As for a campaign promise to end the “industry” of environmental fines, Dias told Reuters prior to the briefing that Brazil must end “indiscriminate” fines levied by multiple agencies without working with the farmers to resolve misunderstandings.

2019-01-18,"DAKAR, Jan 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Tens of thousands of displaced people in northeast Nigeria are cut off from humanitarian aid following a militant attack earlier this week, the United Nations said on Friday. The town of Rann in Borno state was overrun by Islamist militants on Monday evening before being re-captured by the Nigerian military the next day. About 76,000 Nigerians who had fled fighting were living in the town and dependent on aid agencies for food and health services including nutrition therapy for starving children, said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). Since the attack humanitarians have been unable to access Rann by either road or helicopter, with no idea when they might be able to return, said OCHA spokeswoman Samantha Newport. “The attacks in Rann, that are increasingly frequent, are having a devastating impact on the civilians taking refuge in this isolated town and severely affecting our ability to deliver life-saving aid to women, men and children in need,” said Edward Kallon, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Nigeria. Nigeria’s northeast is home to two Islamist insurgencies: Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa (ISWA), which broke away as a faction in 2016. The conflict is now in its 10th year. Attacks have increased during the run-up to a February election in which President Muhammadu Buhari will seek a second term. The World Food Programme delivered food aid in the end of December to Rann, so people may still have enough to eat, but markets and shelters were also burned down in the attack, said OCHA spokeswoman Newport. About 9,000 Nigerians fled from Rann across the nearby border into Cameroon, but the UNHCR reported that almost all of them were forced to return. Up to 170 people died in Rann in 2017 when Nigeria’s air force accidentally bombed a refugee camp, saying the site was not marked on its maps. Violence caused at least 260 aid workers to pull out of the affected areas between November and January, the most since the humanitarian response scaled up in 2016, OCHA said, adding that some have since returned.

2019-01-18,"RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA) plans to stop taking loans from public banks at “special rates” to finance projects, Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco said on Friday. “This cycle in which Petrobras used loans from public banks, with differentiated interest rates to finance its projects, is over,” Branco said in a statement. “We believe that large companies that have easy access to the financial markets do not need to be subsidized with public resources that should be invested in programs in favor of society.”  New Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has released a list of the 50 largest borrowers at state-controlled development bank BNDES, which showed Petrobras to be the leading recipient of credit lines and equity capital disbursed by the bank. Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who took power this month, has railed about BNDES’ allegedly corrupt lending practices in building “national champion” companies under the leftist Workers’ Party governments from 2003 to 2016. Joaquim Levy, a former finance minister and the new CEO of BNDES, used his swearing-in speech to pledge transparency.  For several years now, BNDES has been trying to divest assets and stakes in public companies. Levy’s predecessor said last year that it “makes no sense” for the Brazilian development bank to hold stakes in companies such as Vale (VALE3.SA), Eletrobras (ELET6.SA), JBS (JBSS3.SA) and Eletropaulo (ELPL3.SA). Earlier this month, Levy said the pace of sales of stakes owned by the bank’s investment arm will depend on prices and the market impact of the transactions.

2019-01-18,"LONDON, Jan 18 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Britain’s Marks & Spencer is the latest food retailer to cut plastic pollution and food waste, opening a trial store in London that sells fresh fruit and vegetables without packaging or sell-by dates. It joins a wave of supermarkets and manufacturers, from Germany’s Lidl to U.S. Whole Foods, pledging to reduce waste in response to rising public outcry over environmental damage. These businesses take their cue from social enterprises that have been working for years to show that zero-waste food retail is commercially viable as well as better for the planet. Here are six social enterprises changing the way groceries are bought and sold around the world: La Tablee des Chefs This Canadian social enterprise collects surplus food from hotels and restaurants and distributes it to charities and food banks. It also runs free cookery classes for young people to spread the word about healthy eating. Toast Ale A Yorkshire brewer in northern England, it collects unsold loaves from bakeries and uses them to make beer. It reinvests profits in a charity that campaigns to end food waste. Wasteless This Israeli tech firm has developed artificial intelligence that can identify produce nearing its best-before date and automatically adjusts the price to sell at a discount. This company, in the British seaside town of Brighton, aims to challenge the standard supermarket, while making quality, locally-sourced food affordable. It has plastic-free aisles and refill stations and says it pays staff and suppliers fairly. Green Price Hong Kong’s Green Price sources food near its best-before date from retailers, then sells at a discount to low-income families. Profits go towards providing healthy meals to children in need. Ooze Drinks London’s Ooze Drinks buys fruit and veg that do not meet supermarkets’ cosmetic standards and turns them into juices.

2019-01-18,"(Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Schlumberger NV (SLB.N) said on Friday it would spend less in 2019 and forecast single-digit growth in international markets this year, sending its shares as much as 5 percent higher. With the sharp drop in oil prices since 2014 many producers have evaluated spending budgets for 2019, stoking concerns that a slowdown in activity would hurt oilfield service companies, which have struggled to boost their prices.  Schlumberger, a bellwether for the oilfield services sector, expects full-year 2019 capital expenditure of between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, versus $2.2 billion in 2018, driven by lower spending in North America, Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said on an earnings call.  Shares of Schlumberger rose more than 5 percent to $43.60 in early trading. “The downward guidance for 2019 capital expenditures helped solidify the dividend is safe,” said Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst for Edward Jones.  Schlumberger said recent volatility in crude prices has led to even more uncertainty in the spending outlook for oil and gas producers. Crude prices have tumbled roughly 30 percent since October.  “Future investments will likely be much closer to a level that can be covered by free cash flow,” Kibsgaard said about its U.S. operator customers. But he said that even as operators tighten their purse strings, the company had built “significant flexibility” into its 2019 operating plan. He also said supply cuts by OPEC and Russia could lead to a gradual recovery in oil prices in 2019. And after several years of underinvestment, the company anticipates growth in international markets, driven by higher activity in regions including Latin America, Africa and Asia.   Revenue from Schlumberger’s North America business rose 0.3 percent year over year to $2.82 billion, while international revenue rose nearly 1 percent to $5.28 billion. Schlumberger warned in early December that fourth-quarter North America revenue would take a hit due to steeper-than-anticipated declines in the hydraulic fracturing market. Revenue from its OneStim hydraulic fracturing businesses slid 25 percent sequentially in the fourth quarter, prompting the company to idle some of its fleets late in the fourth quarter, it said.  While analysts called Schlumberger’s results neutral to positive, investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co noted they would not “do much to make investors feel a sense of urgency to dive headlong into OFS (oilfield service) stocks.”  Fourth-quarter net income was $538 million, or 39 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.26 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier when it took $2.7 billion in charges, including a $938 million write-down on its Venezuelan holdings and unpaid bills there. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 36 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  Revenue was flat at $8.18 billion, compared with a year earlier, but beat the average analyst estimate of $8.04 billion.

2019-01-18,"HARARE (Reuters) - Before prices of basic goods spiked in Zimbabwe this month, cab driver and father-of-six Victor Makazhu could buy nearly two weeks of groceries for $45. Now that sum will get him less than seven days’ worth. Inflation soared to a 10-year high above 40 percent in December and has probably risen further since. President Emmerson Mnangagwa this week raised fuel prices by 150 percent, leading to protests that have triggered a crackdown by security forces. “At the moment I cannot afford adequate food for my family,” Makazhu said after shopping for staples in central Harare on Thursday. “These groceries will not last me a week,” he told Reuters, pointing to 2 kg packs of sugar, rice, flour and maize meal and milk. The southern African nation dumped its hyperinflation-wrecked currency in 2009 and adopted the dollar. Over time, supplies of dollars have dried up and, in November 2016, authorities in Harare launched a surrogate - ‘bond notes’ covered by a hard currency loan and pegged at 1:1 to the dollar. On the street, however, $1 now fetches up to three bond notes, leaving citizens able to do little but watch as the money in their bank accounts loses value compared with hard cash. Few could blame Zimbabweans for feeling a sense of deja vu. While nowhere near the 500 billion percent hyperinflation of the crisis of 2008, the country is again grappling with soaring prices and shortages of fuel and medicines. After four hours of what locals call ‘speculative queueing’ outside a filling station in the center of town, schoolteacher Gilbert Kepekepe was still nowhere near getting served. Before the latest price increase he used to spend $230 to fill his tank, which he did twice a month. Now that would cost him $528.  “I will have to probably cut on some other things or simply decide not to drive to work. But the other question is, ‘is it cheaper to use public transport’,” said Kepekepe Analysts said the fuel price hike would trickle down to other basic goods and services, and public taxis known as “kombis” have at least doubled their fares in the last two weeks.

2019-01-18,"(Adds details, background) By Tarek Amara TUNIS, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Tunisia will almost double production of natural gas to about 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day this year, the industry and energy minister, Slim Feriani, told Reuters on Friday. The country’s gas output will jump from 35,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) when the southern Nawara gas field comes onstream in June, Feriani said. “We will raise our production by about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent when the Nawara project in the south will start,” Feriani told Reuters in interview. This project will be jointly owned by Austria’s OMV and Tunisian National Oil Company ETAP with investments of about $700 million. Feriani also said Tunisia was seeking to attract about $2 billion in foreign investment to produce 1,900 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy in three years. “We will start launching international bids for the production of renewable wind and sun energy. We aim to produce 1,900 MW by investment of up to $2 billion until 2022,” he said. This would represent about 22 percent of the country’s electricity production. Tunisia also plans to raise production of phosphate from 3 million tonnes to 5 million in 2019, he said. Raising the output will boost economic growth and provide revenue to revive its faltering economy, the minister said. Phosphate exports are a key source of foreign currency reserves, which have dropped to levels worth just 82 days of imports, according Tunisia’s central bank. Tunisia produced about 8.2 million tonnes of phosphate in 2010 but output dropped after its 2011 revolution. Annual output has not exceeded 4.5 million tonnes since 2011. Feriani said lower production has caused Tunisia to lose markets and about $1 billion each year. Phosphate exports were hit by repeated protests in the main producing region of Gafsa, where unemployed youth demanding jobs blockaded rail transport.

The announcement is a much-needed vote of confidence in Africa’s most industrialised economy, where President Cyril Ramaphosa is trying to attract $100 billion of new investments to rekindle growth. The new refinery would reduce the need for refined product imports and cement Saudi Arabia’s dominant position in South Africa’s oil sector. The Gulf kingdom already supplies 40 percent of the crude oil consumed in South Africa. “Saudi Aramco and South Africa’s Central Energy Fund are moving forward with the feasibility study and identifying the parameters of the project,” Falih told reporters in Pretoria, South Africa’s administrative capital. South African Energy Minister Jeff Radebe said a location for the refinery and petrochemicals plant would be finalised in the coming weeks. The capacity for the refinery is yet to be determined. South Africa has talked about building an extra refinery for a decade, but it has struggled to agree commercial terms with investors. It has six refineries, four using crude oil and two synthetic fuel as feedstock. Royal Dutch Shell, BP , Total and Sasol are among major refinery operators. Falih said Saudi Arabia had held discussions with Ramaphosa’s predecessor, Jacob Zuma, about building a refinery in South Africa but the proposed location was not attractive. The two governments are now considering Richard’s Bay in KwaZulu-Natal province, home to South Africa’s major coal export terminal, among potential locations for the refinery. State oil giant Saudi Aramco is also studying whether to use South African oil storage facilities in Saldanha Bay, while Saudi power firm Acwa Power is looking at investing in South Africa’s revamped renewable energy programme. Falih confirmed there were discussions about the kingdom investing in South African state defence company Denel, as exclusively reported by Reuters in November.

2019-01-18,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Armed groups have killed more than 100 soldiers and seized a huge stock of weapons in clashes in northeast Nigeria since Dec. 26, a report by a group of aid agencies said on Friday, weeks ahead of an election in which security is a campaign issue. An army spokesman denied the number of soldiers killed was that high. Attacks by militants have intensified over the past few weeks and forced thousands of people to flee to safer areas in Nigeria and over the border to neighbouring Chad, the report said. They have mostly been carried out by an Islamic State-allied faction of the Boko Haram group.   The surge has occurred in the run-up to an election on Feb. 16 in which President Muhammadu Buhari is seeking a second term, and his critics have seized upon security as an issue.  Buhari, a retired general and former military ruler, came to power in 2015 promising to defeat the Boko Haram insurgency, which aims to create an Islamic state in the northeast. Islamic State in West Africa (ISWA) split from Boko Haram in 2016 and has carried out most attacks in the last few weeks.  The report by the Global Protection Cluster in Chad, a group of aid agencies led by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said: “Raids against the Nigerian army have killed more than 100 Nigerian soldiers. According to the information available, the armed groups captured a huge stock of weapons.” “Undoubtedly we recorded some casualties in these encounters, since we are at war and not a picnic, but certainly not the over-bloated casualty statistics being touted by UNHCR,” said Nigerian Army spokesman Onyema Nwachukwu in a text message.  The report said attacks in the Baga-Kawa area of northeast Nigeria on Dec. 26 caused more than 6,357 people to flee east into Chad and some 20,000 others to flee to safety within Nigeria. Last month, ISWA seized the town of Baga, where a multi-national force formed by Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger to fight the militants is based. The Nigerian army later regained Baga and said it had given ISWA a “bloody nose”. Boko Haram has killed about 30,000 people and forced about two million people to flee their homes since the insurgency began in 2009.  ISWA has been responsible for attacks on military bases of recent weeks. In contrast, Boko Haram typically carries out suicide bombings and gun raids, though it said it carried out Monday’s attack on the northeast Nigerian town of Rann. United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Nigeria, Edward Kallon, said on Friday that repeated attacks were “severely affecting” aid delivery to the 76,000 internally displaced people living in Rann.  Boko Haram held territory in northeast Nigeria around the size of Belgium in early 2015 but was forced out of most of that land by troops from Nigeria and neighbouring countries.  “When this administration came, Boko Haram was holding 17 local governments in the northeast. They are not holding any local governments,” said Buhari in a televised interview on Wednesday, when asked about his security record in light of recent attacks.

2019-01-18,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - Shares in India’s Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) rose on Friday, following record quarterly numbers that showed the conglomerate’s strategy to diversify beyond refining and petrochemicals was bearing fruit. The company’s gross refining margins - a measure of its core profitability - took a hit amid volatility in oil prices and slowing demand globally, but its fast-growing telecom and retail businesses drove profit to new highs. Analysts expect that while the outlook in the short term for the core business is challenged, it is the consumer business growth that will continue and support earnings momentum.  The “consumer business now contributes more than 25 percent of our EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization or operating profit),” said V. Srikanth, joint chief financial officer of Reliance Industries, on Thursday. Reliance’s consumer business should see earnings growth of 18 percent over the next two years, Morgan Stanley said in a report. The strong earnings growth and outlook for the consumer arm drove shares in Reliance up as much as 4.9 percent on Friday. In a speech in the western state of Gujarat, its chairman Mukesh Ambani laid out plans to deepen the conglomerate’s commitment to retail by creating a new commerce platform, blending online retail with brick and mortar stores, that aims to empower India’s unorganized retail sector to compete against the likes of Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Walmart-owned (WMT.N) rival Flipkart. The company is testing devices for small shopkeepers that act as payment systems and which also integrate into Reliance’s wholesale network, enabling better inventory management. Reliance said on Thursday that its retail business saw revenue doubling to 356 billion rupees ($5 billion) in the last quarter, while earnings before interest and taxes more than tripled from the year-ago period to 15 billion rupees.  The “kind of growth and sales we are seeing clearly point to a major growth phase in retail for Reliance,” said Abneesh Roy, a senior retail analyst at domestic broking firm Edelweiss. Meanwhile, the Ambani-controlled company saw earnings before interest and tax from its telecom business more than doubling to 23.69 billion rupees in the quarter. In December, India rolled out new foreign investment restrictions for its e-commerce sector to prevent predatory pricing and deep discounting, the curbs follow intense lobbying by India’s many millions of small shopkeepers and the middlemen who serve them. Mukesh also called on the government on Friday to stop the rise of “data colonization.” “In this new world, data is the new oil. And data is the new wealth. India’s data must be controlled and owned by Indian people ─ and not by corporates, especially global corporations,” Ambani told an audience which included India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India has proposed regulations to force foreign companies to store data locally, dealing a blow to the likes of Mastercard (MA.N), Visa (V.N), Facebook (FB.O) and others.

2019-01-18,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The days of unlimited speeding on Germany’s famously fast Autobahns could be over if the government adopts a series of draft proposals on climate protection put forward by its committee on the future of transport. Charged with coming up with recommendations on reducing the environmental harm caused by transport, the committee also proposed fuel tax hikes and electric vehicle quotas to help Germany finally meet European Union emissions targets. The proposals, outlined in a draft paper seen by Reuters, could prove controversial in car-mad Germany, whose decades-old motorway network is famous for “no limits” sections where drivers can put even the fastest cars through their paces. Germany could be hit with heavy EU fines if it fails to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and poisonous nitrogen oxides. Transport emissions, which have not fallen since 1990, are a particular target for reductions. The government is torn between the need to protect Germany’s crucial car industry, buffeted by a series of costly emissions cheating scandals in recent years, and the need to act to protect a rapidly deteriorating climate. The paper says measures including a motorway speed limit of 130 kmh and fuel tax hikes from 2023, the abolition of tax breaks for diesel cars and quotas for electric and hybrid car sales could deliver half the greenhouse gas emissions cuts that are needed. The National Platform on the Future of Mobility has yet to finalize the recommendations. It is due to report its findings at the end of March, which will then be incorporated into a climate change law the government wants to enact this year. But the committee is well aware that many of its suggestions could be controversial. “Not every instrument and every measure will be accepted,” reads the draft. “It will take political deftness, diplomatic skill and a willingness to compromise to achieve the climate change goals.” Writing by Thomas Escritt; Editing by Mark Potter",https://uk.reuters.com/article/germany-climate-transport/climate-plans-could-make-germanys-no-limits-autobahns-history-idUKL8N1ZI37H,18 Jan 2019,"The days of unlimited speeding on

E-mini futures for the S&P 500 index were up about 0.2 percent and Dow futures were up about 0.3 percent, indicating a higher open on Wall Street. European stocks surged to their highest since early December, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up over 1 percent by afternoon trade in London. Trade-exposed indexes and stocks gained the most, with autos rising nearly 2 percent and Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX up 1.5 percent. The gains followed the lead of stocks in Asia overnight, which in turn took their cue from Wall Street’s performance on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30. U.S. stocks rallied on the report but pared some of the gains after the Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. The Journal also reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer resisted Mnuchin’s idea. “Even though the Treasury quickly denied the report, markets didn’t retrace much, which implies that traders believe the news are credible – or at least that the overall negotiating process is moving in the right direction,” said Marios Hadjikyriacos, investment analyst at online broker XM. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.75 percent. The index has gained 1.5 percent this week. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1.4 percent. Australian stocks rose half a percent, South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.8 percent and Japan’s Nikkei gained more than 1 percent to a one-month high. The gains across regions helped lift the MSCI All-Country World Index to its highest in more than a month. The index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was set for its fourth straight weekly gain, its longest weekly winning streak in six months. It was last up almost half a percent. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the latest round of trade talks aimed at resolving the dispute between the world’s two largest economies. Indicators released recently showed signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum. A report due on Monday is expected to show China’s fourth-quarter economic growth slowed to its weakest since the global financial crisis, according to a Reuters poll, as demand faltered at home and abroad. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was set for its first weekly rise in five, though it was flat on the day. The euro rose 0.1 percent to $1.14040. It was on track for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.7716 percent, its highest in three weeks. The pound was 0.4 percent lower at $1.2932, after climbing to a two-month peak of $1.3001 on hopes that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. British retail sales fell for the first time since March during the three months to December, confirming a slowdown in consumer spending as Brexit draws near. Prime Minister Theresa May survived a vote of confidence this week, removing some political uncertainty for now. The longer-term prospects for Britain and its markets remained far from clear, though. U.S. crude oil futures extended Thursday’s gains. , adding 1.5 percent to $52.84 per barrel. Brent crude was up 1.3 percent at $61.99 per barrel and on track to gain roughly 2 percent on the week. Elsewhere in commodities, palladium was 1.2 percent higher at $1,412.50 an ounce after rising to an all-time high of $1,434.50 overnight. Demand has recently outstripped supply for the metal, used in emissions-reducing catalytic converters for cars. Palladium also appeared to get a boost from hopes for further government stimulus in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Spot gold was down half a percent at $1,285.03 an ounce, after relinquishing its spot as the most expensive precious metal to palladium early in December.

2019-01-18,"(Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) By Devika  Krishna Kumar and Liz Hampton NEW YORK/HOUSTON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Energy fund managers took heavy losses last year with wrong-way bets on the prices of oil and natural gas, leading to a wave of closures in the volatile fund sector. The number of active energy-focused funds fell to just 738 in 2018 through September from about 836 in 2016, according to the latest available data from hedge funds industry tracker Eurekahedge. That’s the lowest number of active funds since 2010. The number of funds solely focused on oil or gas has tumbled to 179 in 2018 from 194 in 2016. Funds that have suspended operations included high-profile names such as Jamison Capital’s macro fund, T. Boone Pickens’ BP Capital and Andy Hall’s main hedge fund at Astenbeck Capital Management, along with smaller niche funds such as Casement Capital. “There is a massive decline in the number of funds, and no replacements,” said David Mooney, founder of Casement Capital. “There has been a near ‘extinction event’ in commodities hedge funds.” “We had about 16 large hedge funds trading natural gas in Houston a few years ago,” he said. “That number is now reduced to a small number of managers.” Some funds saw investors pull out because they increasingly view energy as an unsafe spot for their money. Casement suspended operations after difficulties raising investor interest, two industry sources said. The firm was supported by Lighthouse Partners, according to a regulatory filing. Lighthouse declined to comment, and Mooney would not elaborate on the reasons for Casement’s decision to close. “All hedge funds, including commodities, that are being scrutinized for near-term performance are coming under pressure,” said Jonathan Goldberg, founder of one of the best-known energy-focused hedge funds, BBL Commodities. Closures of energy-focused hedge funds have outpaced launches in the last three years, according to data from Eurekahedge. “It becomes self-reinforcing,” Goldberg said in an interview. “If people lose money and are seeing negative feedback for it, they cut risk and it becomes harder and harder to manage the business.” Macro hedge funds - those with strategies based on broad global macroeconomic trends, such as a bet that oil prices will rise - were among the hardest hit, falling 3.6 percent in 2018. That’s the weakest annual performance since 2011, when such funds fell 4.2 percent, according to the Hedge Fund Research (HFRI) Macro index, a key industry index. Through mid-December, commodity trading advisors (CTAs) were down by 7.1 percent, according to a late December estimate by Credit Suisse. In December, Goldberg said he would wind down BBL Commodities’ flagship fund and focus instead on longer-term trading opportunities. Goldberg’s BBL Commodities Value Fund lost 14.2 percent in July, Reuters reported. Goldberg said in December that returns had been “limited” recently. Funds took heavy losses this past year when oil prices took an unexpected dive beginning in October amid growing worries about oversupply and weakening demand. U.S. oilfields hit an all-time production record last year at more than 11.5 million barrels a day. A sharp rise in natural gas prices in late 2018, on concerns of tight supplies and cold weather, also added to the pain because many funds had paired bets on lower natural gas and higher crude. Fluctuations in prices typically create opportunities for fund managers to book a profit, but the moves of oil and gas prices followed a prolonged period of subdued volatility in energy markets and caught fund managers off guard. Oil prices had rallied through most of the year, and hedge funds built increasingly large bets on the rally continuing. Money managers began the year with a record number of bullish open positions in U.S. crude and largely maintained them near those levels until mid-year. That changed late last year, when the U.S. granted waivers to big purchasers of Iran’s oil after reinstating sanctions on the nation, and as the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia all produced at record levels, feeding worries about a supply glut. The market sunk in a series of volatile trading days as funds rushed to unload positions. Hedge fund investors said they do not see the situation for niche funds improving. Among those that have been having the most difficulty are natural gas funds, said one recruiter who works with several funds and banks in the commodities industry. In November, U.S. natural gas futures experienced their most volatile streak in nine years. Velite Capital, which emerged earlier this decade as one of the most profitable natural gas hedge funds, founded by star trader David Coolidge, began winding down in August. Madava Asset Management, meanwhile, shut after investor Blackstone Group requested to pull funds, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Timoneer Energy, a hedge fund specializing in natural gas futures and options, also wound down last year, sources said. The firm was set up in 2015 by a portfolio manager and three analysts from Velite. Several former members of the fund did not respond to a request for comment. Two years ago, energy executives John James and Sachin Goel planned to launch natural gas-focused hedge fund Mercasa Energy, backed by an initial commitment of $10 million from investor Titan Advisors, which has some $4.5 billion in assets under management. But the fund was not able to secure additional investments, and by early 2018, Mercasa had shut. Titan Advisors declined to comment. Ernest Scalamandre, founder of AC Investment Management, an investment firm focused on commodities, said he expects funds dedicated to oil and natural gas to remain challenged. “I don’t envision the fundamentals changing all that much for gas and or crude,” he said.

2019-01-18,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria on Friday announced a presidential election for April 18 without indicating whether veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika would stand, following calls for his nomination by a loyal ruling caste of businessmen, trade unions and the military. The 81-year old leader, who has been in office since 1999 and rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013, has now 45 days to say whether he wants to seek a fifth term. Under the constitution the election date was made necessary by the expiry in April of Bouteflika’s fourth term. Algeria’s ruling coalition and other leading figures in labour unions and the business world had previously urged him to run again for the presidency. But there have been concerns about his health. In December, Boutelfika, who has been wheelchair-bound since 2013, was unable to meet Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman when he came to Algiers for a two-day visit due to acute flu. His last meeting with a senior foreign official was during a visit by German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sept. 17. An earlier meeting with Merkel and a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte were cancelled. The North African country, an OPEC oil producer, avoided the major political upheaval seen in many other Arab countries in the past decade but has experienced some protests and strikes.  Unemployment, especially among young people, remains high. The economy has improved over the past year as oil and gas revenues have picked up, allowing authorities to ease austerity measures imposed when they halved between 2014 to 2017. Oil and gas revenues account for 60 percent of the budget and 94 percent of export revenues. Analysts said Bouteflika’s announcement of the election date will ease concerns that the vote might get postponed. In 1991, the army cancelled elections which an Islamist party was set to win, triggering almost a decade of civil war that killed some 200,000 people. “This decision shows that Bouteflika is sticking to the constitution,” said political analyst Arslan Chikhaoui. Observers say if Bouteflika runs again he is set to win, as the opposition is divided into Islamists and secular parties. Bouteflika is part of a thinning elite of the veterans who fought France in the 1954-1962 independence war and have run Algeria ever since. Many also credit him with ending the civil war by offering former Islamist fighters amnesty. Bouteflika’s supporters say his mind remains sharp, even though he needs a microphone to speak. The opposition says he is not fit to run again. He is unlikely to face competition from within ruling circles. Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, leader of the National Rally for Democracy (RND) allied to the FLN, has already said he will not run if Bouteflika goes for a fifth term. Nobody has yet said they will run against Bouteflika, even though the president has said he wants more competition. He won with 82 percent of the vote in 2014, 90 percent in 2009, 85 percent in 2004 and 74 percent in 1999. The government has said it wants to diversify the economy away from oil and gas, which accounts for 60 percent of budget finances, but there has been resistance from those within the ruling elite to opening up to foreign investment. That has left the economy dominated by the state and firms run by business tycoons.

2019-01-18,"(For VDKI data on seaborne coal trade, click) * Imports expected to gain 1.4 percent this year * Forecast rise would follow 13 percent fall in 2018 * Politicians seek phase-out of coal By Vera Eckert FRANKFURT, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Germany is expected to import 45 million tonnes of hard coal this year, up roughly 1.4 percent from 2018 despite mounting competition from renewable energy, as the closure of domestic mines reduces domestic supply, importers said on Friday. The total would comprise an estimated 30 million tonnes for power generation and 15 million tonnes of coking coal and coke, products used in steelmaking, data from lobby group VDKI showed. Germany’s last two hard-coal mines, in the west of the country, closed at the end of December under a deal to stop unprofitable mining in favour of imports. The pair had contributed an annual 2.6 million tonnes of power station feedstock. The coal importer lobby said hard coal usage would benefit from a court ban on logging in an ancient forest, a move that will impede the mining of domestic rival lignite, or brown coal, by utility RWE. The court ruling curbs supply to RWE’s brown-coal power plants, and hard coal could cover part of the deficit. The two types of coal accounted for a combined 38 percent of German power production last year. Despite the forecast rise, there could be import losses in 2019 as a result of a long-term national plan, due within the next fortnight, on phasing out coal, VDKI said. The projected increase would also be from a weaker base. Volumes in 2018 declined by 13 percent year-on-year to 44.5 million tonnes as renewable energy gets priority on grids, elbowing out thermal plants’ output. Steam coal imports for power stations alone fell 17 percent to 30 million tonnes. Green power made up 40 percent of total generation in 2018, resulting from Germany’s politically driven process to replace fossil fuels. VDKI estimated the addition of green power plants lost it 3 million tonnes of imports last year, while relatively high solar production in a hot year also played a part. “2018, just like 2017, was a very bad year for hard coal in Germany,” VDKI chairman Wolfgang Cieslik said during the presentation of the data in Hamburg. VDKI managing director Franz-Josef Wodopia said steelmaking usage of coal could benefit from higher demand projections by the World Steel Association for 2019, but cautioned that the macroeconomic environment had recently worsened. “We cautiously expect the same level of imports as in 2018,” he said of coking coal.

2019-01-18,"LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Global oil refining capacity is set to increase at its fastest pace on record this year, possibly boosting stocks of products such as diesel, gasoline and marine fuel, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. Oil refining capacity will rise by 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) and demand for refined products by around 1.1 million bpd, the IEA said in a monthly report. It was not clear yet what that meant for margins, which slumped as the price of crude rose last year, said the Paris-based IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrialised countries. “This (demand growth) utilises only half of the new capacity coming on stream. If refining margins are supported by accommodating crude prices, utilisation rates will not decline. This should mean that product stocks will increase,” it said. An increase in stocks of refined products could be “useful”, the IEA said, ahead of the implementation next year of regulations by the International Maritime Organization to reduce sulphur content in shipping fuel. Margins remain under pressure from rising oil throughput, which hit a historic high last month at 84.2 million bpd. Refineries will process 83.4 million bpd this year, compared with 82.2 million bpd last year, according to the agency. “The global refining industry is facing a challenging 2019 ... If average crude prices continue moving higher for the third consecutive year, refining margins may decline to levels that force slowdown in some refining regions,” the IEA said.

2019-01-18,"HELSINKI (Reuters) - The EU Chemicals Agency ECHA on Friday proposed a ban on deliberately adding microplastics to products such as cosmetics, detergents and agricultural fertilisers in the EU by 2020 to combat pollution.  The tiny bits of plastic pollution in waterways and oceans are causing growing concern among scientists about their effect on marine ecosystems.  The European Commission, which estimates that between 70,000 and 200,000 tonnes of microplastics enter the environment each year, had requested the proposal from the ECHA as part of its plastics strategy.   “The aim is to avoid nearly 30,000 tonnes of microplastics ending up in nature a year,” the ECHA’s spokesman Matti Vainio said at a conference in Helsinki. The Commission’s Vice President Jyrki Katainen, who also spoke at the event, said an EU ban could set a standard for industries around the world. “The European Union is first in the world to have launched a comprehensive plastics strategy which aims at reducing also microplastics,” he said. The ECHA will present its official proposal within a year for the EU member countries to consider and Katainen said the Commission could approve it towards the end of 2020.  Vainio warned the use of microplastics would continue to increase rapidly without the ban. “It emerged as a surprise to us that agriculture is the largest user of microplastics”, Vainio said, referring to a widely-used technology to encapsulate agricultural fertilizers within tiny plastic shells that emit them slowly into the soil but leave behind microplastics. The proposed ban would exclude some products such as medicine and paints.

2019-01-18,"(Repeats with no changes) By Marianna Parraga and Collin Eaton Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. refiners are bidding up prices for scarce types of crude oil needed for their most sophisticated plants as the United States reconsiders harsher sanctions on Venezuela that could further reduce imports of the country’s oil. Trump administration officials in recent days met with U.S. oil company executives to lay out potential actions in response to the Jan. 10 inauguration of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an election it considered illegitimate. Among other steps, U.S. officials have recognized the opposition-run Venezuelan congress as the only legitimately elected authority. But the proposals that would most affect the energy industry involve banning U.S. exports of refined products or limiting oil imports - a move that, until now, the White House has not taken even after sanctioning individuals and barring access to U.S. banks. “It’s more serious than I’ve heard before,” said a refining industry executive familiar with the White House discussions. “They are setting the table to pull the trigger if they have to.” U.S. refiners have few supply alternatives if the Trump administration were to cut off crude imports from that country. Supplies of the heavy oils preferred by Gulf Coast refiners have been harder to secure in recent months because of cutbacks and production curbs in Western Canada, Mexico and Venezuela. One type of U.S. heavy oil, called Mars, traded at a $6.80 per barrel premium to U.S. crude futures on Thursday, the strongest in nearly five years and up from a $4.50 per barrel premium on Tuesday, a U.S. oil broker said. U.S. oil companies that depend on Venezuelan oil have opposed past proposals that would halt imports and did so again this week, said several people close to the talks. Two big refiners, Phillips 66 and PBF Energy, cut their dependence on the South American country last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data. Latin American advisors have warned the administration that oil sanctions could backfire by making the United States appear too involved in the Venezuelan political crisis, said a person familiar with talks among the White House, the National Security Council and oil firms. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has become directly involved, accelerating possible financial and political steps against Maduro, the person said. State Department spokespeople were not immediately available for comment. Venezuela exported 500,013 barrels per day to the United States last year, down from 591,422 bpd in 2017. The largest U.S. importers of Venezuelan oil last year were Citgo Petroleum, the U.S. refining arm of Venezuela’s state-run oil company PDVSA, Valero Energy, Chevron Corp and PBF Energy. Citgo, Valero and PBF Energy either did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment. Chevron declined to comment on the potential for sanctions, but said it actively manages supplies and has plans in place to make necessary adjustments to ensure it can supply customers. White House officials are aware hitting Venezuela with oil sanctions could deepen the humanitarian crisis there and hurt U.S. businesses and consumers by raising fuel prices. “With regard to sanctions, all options are on the table,” said Garrett Marquis, spokesman for the White House National Security Council who declined to discuss specifics of the deliberations. Mexico, a supplier of heavy crude, reported its production dropped to 1.72 million barrels per day in November, from 1.93 million bpd at the start of the year.

European stocks rose to their highest since early December, with the pan-European STOXX 600 index up nearly 1 percent. Trade-exposed indexes and stocks gained the most, with autos rising 1.3 percent and Germany’s exporter-heavy DAX up 0.7 percent. The gains followed the lead of stocks in Asia overnight, which in turn took their cue from Wall Street’s performance on Thursday. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30. U.S. stocks rallied on the report but pared some of the gains after the Treasury denied Mnuchin had made any such recommendation. The Journal also reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer resisted Mnuchin’s idea. E-mini futures for the S&P 500 0.3 percent higher on Friday. “The story was probably not as interesting as the headlines suggested, as the story states that the proposal comes from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin (a China dove), while the US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer (China hawk) opposes the idea,” strategists at Danske Bank wrote in a note to clients. “Nonetheless, we still interpret the story as another sign that a US-China trade deal is moving closer and markets probably do as well.” MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.55 percent. The index has gained 1.3 percent this week. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.6 percent and Japan’s Nikkei gained more than 1 percent to a one-month high. The gains across regions helped lift the MSCI All-Country World Index to its highest in more than a month. The index, which tracks stocks across 47 countries, was set for its fourth straight weekly gain, its longest weekly winning streak in six months. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the latest round of trade talks aimed at resolving the dispute between the world’s two largest economies. Indicators released recently showed signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum. A report due on Monday is expected to show China’s fourth-quarter economic growth slowed to its weakest since the global financial crisis, according to a Reuters poll, as demand faltered at home and abroad. The dollar was supported after U.S. Treasury yields rose amid improved risk appetite. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was set for its first weekly rise in five. The euro rose to $1.1398 after dipping overnight. It was on track for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.766 percent, its highest in three weeks.

2019-01-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. oil production growth combined with a slowing global economy will put oil prices under downward pressure in 2019, challenging OPEC’s resolve to support the market with output cuts, the International Energy Agency said on Friday. The IEA, which coordinates the energy policies of industrial nations, said it was keeping its estimate of oil demand growth for this year unchanged at 1.4 million barrels per day, close to 2018 levels. “The impact of higher oil prices in 2018 is fading, which will help offset lower economic growth,” the Paris-based IEA said in its monthly report. Oil LCOc1 rallied above $85 per barrel in the second half of 2018 on concern about lower supplies from Iran due to new U.S. sanctions. But crude fell towards $50 at the end of 2018 due to an economic slowdown and rising U.S. supply, prompting producer group OPEC to cut output in an effort to keep prices above $60. The IEA said global oil supply last month fell by 950,000 bpd, roughly 1 percent, led by lower OPEC output even before the organization’s new supply-cutting pact took effect in January. The IEA said non-OPEC production growth was set to slow to 1.6 million bpd in 2019 after record annual gains of 2.6 million bpd in 2018. However, the United States will continue to surprise on the upside. “The United States, already the biggest liquids supplier, will reinforce its leadership as the world’s number one crude producer. By the middle of the year, U.S. crude output will probably be more than the capacity of either Saudi Arabia or Russia,” the IEA said.

2019-01-18,"SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Sinopec Corp (0386.HK), Asia’s top refiner, may have a hard time finding buyers for a multi-billion-dollar stock offering of its fuel marketing arm because of investor pushback against higher valuations amid tepid equity markets. Sinopec won final regulatory approval in December for the listing of its marketing unit in Hong Kong, said two people with knowledge of the matter. The company runs the world’s largest retail fuel network with over 30,000 gas stations, 23,000 convenience stores, as well as pipelines and storage for refined fuel products across China, the world’s second-largest oil consumer after the United States. But, Sinopec may have picked a bad time for an initial public offering (IPO) for a fuel marketing company amid investor fears of slowing economic growth in China, which posted a drop in exports and imports in December as its trade war with the United States drags on. Hong Kong's Heng Seng Index .HSI has dropped 19 percent since it hit a record in January 2018. More specifically, there are concerns about slowing Chinese oil demand growth and the potential oversupply of fuels in the country. In November, Sinochem Energy put its Hong Kong IPO on hold even after it lowered its valuation, reducing the amount of funds it expected raise to about $1.4 billion from $2 billion.  “It will be a hard sell for Sinopec,” said one of the two sources, a banking analyst who tracks Sinopec closely.   “The market has an average price/earning ratio of 8 or 9 times, but Sinopec is looking for more than 10 times,” said the analyst, referring to a common metric for valuing companies that measures how much an investor is paying for a portion of a company’s earnings. Sinopec Corp declined to comment on its IPO plans.   The slowing market may mean a further delay for an IPO that has been under discussion since 2016. Sinopec attempted to raise $12 billion through a listing of the fuel marketing business in 2017.  In 2014, Sinopec sold a nearly 30 percent share of the business to investors for $17.5 billion, valuing the company then at about $58 billion, in the then largest privatization push of state-owned enterprises since President Xi Jinping took office.   This time, Sinopec will list the marketing arm through a separately incorporated entity, Sinopec Marketing Co. Ltd, which was set up just weeks after the National Development and Reform Commission and later the State Council approved the listing plan, said the second of the two sources familiar with the matter.   “Sinopec will try its best to list its marketing division in 2019, now that the top government body has given the go-ahead,” the source said, declining to be named as the subject was not public. A separate banking source estimated that Sinopec’s IPO could happen in the fourth quarter as the firm has not started discussing the sale with banks yet and none have been mandated to work on the deal.

2019-01-18,"LONDON (Reuters) - Buoyed by the success of seismic imaging that found an extra billion barrels of oil in the Gulf of Mexico, BP (BP.L) is looking to take its latest technology to Angola and Brazil. The software used in the Gulf, based on an algorithm created by Xukai Shen, a geophysicist straight out of Stanford University, led to BP discovering the crude in an area where it had long thought there was none to be found. Industry experts said the scale of the discovery 8 km below BP’s Thunder Horse field, announced last week, marked a major leap forward for deepwater exploration - a costly business known for its low success rate and high risk. It is an example of how technology is helping deepwater make a comeback after a decade when the industry has focused on advances in onshore shale. The new deposit was found with software known as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which is run on a super-computer and analyses reverberations of seismic soundwaves to produce high-resolution 3D images of ancient layers of rock thousands of metres under the sea bed, helping geologists locate oil and gas.  It is more accurate than previous surveying methods, BP said, and processes data in a matter of days, compared with months or years previously. While the discovery marked the biggest industry success for digital seismic imaging, the British oil major’s rivals are hot on its heel with similar techniques.  BP scientist John Etgen, the company’s top adviser on seismic imaging, said it aimed to retain its edge with a new machine it has developed, Wolfspar, to be used alongside FWI. The submarine-like Wolfspar is dragged by a ship through the ocean and emits very low frequency soundwaves, which are particularly effective for penetrating thick salt layers that lie above rocks containing fossil fuels, he added. Etgen told Reuters that BP planned to roll out Wolfspar alongside FWI in the second half of this year at the Atlantis field in the Gulf of Mexico, where a large salt layer still hides parts of the site. The company plans to expand the use of the technology to other big oil and gas basins, including Brazil next year and Angola at a later stage, he said.  “Seeing through very complex, very distorted salt bodies was the hardest problem we had, the most challenging,” the Houston-based scientist said in an interview. In both Brazil and Angola, oil deposits are locked under thick salt layers. Brazil’s deepwater oil fields comprise one of the world’s fastest-growing basins in terms of production. BP last year signed a partnership with Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras (PETR4.SA) to develop resources there. Billion-barrel oil finds are rare, particularly in mature basins like the Gulf of Mexico. But the scale of output from deepwater wells means they can compete with the most low-cost basins in the world, in particular U.S. shale.  BP is far from alone in focusing on technology; all big oil companies have put a growing emphasis on digitalisation to reduce costs following the oil price collapse of 2014.    In fact, BP’s spend on R&D was the third lowest among the world’s top publicly traded oil companies in 2017 at $391 million, compared with Exxon Mobil’s (XOM.N) $1.1 billion and Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) and Total’s (TOTF.PA) budgets of over $900 million. Other majors have also made advances. Italy’s Eni (ENI.MI) has launched the world’s most powerful industrial computer to process seismic data, for example, while France’s Total is using drones to carry out seismic mapping in dense forests such as in Papua New Guinea. However Barclays analysts said in a report last year that BP and Norway’s Equinor (EQNR.OL) had the most advanced deployment of technology among oil majors.  The seismic breakthrough for BP came when Xukai Shen tested a new idea he had for the FWI algorithm in 2016. “What happened was magic - the pieces came together,” recalled Etgen. “We finally had the right algorithm with the right data set to create the model of the salt formation and use the model to remove distortion.” BP says its new seismic technology could save it hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration hours by pinpointing the location of the most promising deposits. “It allows us to drill the right wells, drill wells at lower costs, drill wells in the best part of the reservoir, drill fewer wells,” Etgen said. The costs of the technology are a fraction of BP’s oil and gas production budget of around $12 billion per year. An FWI survey costs up to $20 million to carry out, while processing the data costs up to $10 million, Etgen told Reuters. The annual spend on the super-computer that runs the software is about $20 million.  “The companies that are investing in technology are coming through and winning the race,” Henry Morris, technical director at independent North Sea-focused explorer Azinor Catalyst. “That’s where BP are doing a good job. It’s working.” Seeing through salt layers with confidence “adds real value” and saves companies the premiums they must pay to acquire resources through acquisitions, according to Bernstein analysts. “With high-performance computing, the seismic processing and interpretations are being done in two weeks rather than 1,000 years, as it would have been if they still used 20th century computers,” they said. “Investors should therefore expect more from BP with this edge.” Additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Pravin Char",https://uk.reuters.com/article/bp-seismic/focus-after-billion-barrel-bonanza-bp-goes-global-with-seismic-tech-idUKL8N1ZA5GN,18 Jan 2019,"* BP aims to deploy new Wolfspar technology in Angola,

2019-01-18,"* CNOOC storing LNG offshore on tanker -sources * Outage at Gorgon, planned maintenance at Bontang support prices * Spot supply ample with new cargoes offered this week By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Asian spot prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) continued to fall this week as importers in North Asia have largely finished their purchases for winter, but losses were stemmed as plants closed for maintenance. Spot prices for March delivery to Asia LNG-AS this week slipped to $8.20 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 10 cents from the previous week, trade sources said. Prices for cargoes to be delivered in the second-half of February were estimated at about $8.35 per mmBtu, they added. Several buyers in Japan and China, the two biggest LNG importers globally, said their inventories were sufficient and that spot buying for winter was largely done. Although that could change if temperatures fall. While Beijing and Shanghai are expected to have above-average temperatures in the coming weeks, Tokyo and Seoul could see a few colder-than-average days, weather data from Refinitiv Eikon showed. China’s state-owned CNOOC is temporarily storing LNG in a tanker off South Korea as the warmer-than-usual winter has cut expected spot demand for the fuel, industry sources said this week. Maintenance at two major LNG export plants, both planned and unplanned, helped to keep prices from sliding further, traders said. Chevron Corp’s Gorgon LNG project in Australia has temporarily halted train 3 to address a mechanical issue, while trains 1 and 2 continued to operate as usual, a company spokesman said earlier this week. Traders did not expect big delays in exports of cargoes. At least one buyer said shipments from the plant were due to arrive on schedule. Indonesia’s Bontang LNG export plant has shut one of its production trains for maintenance until the end of January, a company official said this week. The routine maintenance, which typically takes a month, is not expected to affect exports, he added. Still, supply was ample with several spot cargoes being offered, traders said. Sources have said Angola’s LNG export plant offered a cargo for delivery over late February to early March, while Exxon Mobil Corp’s Papua New Guinea plant and Russia’s Sakhalin 2 plant sold a cargo each for February at about $8 to $8.30 per mmBtu.

Spreadbetters expected European stocks to take their cue from Asia, with Britain’s FTSE seen rising 0.45 percent, while Germany’s DAX and France’s CAC were tipped to each gain 0.5 percent. The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30. U.S. stocks rallied following the report, but pared some of those gains after a Treasury spokesperson told CNBC that Mnuchin had not made any such recommendations. WSJ also reported that U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has resisted Mnuchin’s idea. For the day, all three major U.S. indexes were up, led by a surge in industrial stocks. With equity markets having taken a knock on the trade tensions last year, even the whiff of progress in the months-long Sino-U.S. trade war was enough to boost risk sentiment. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.55 percent. The index has gained 1.3 percent this week. The Shanghai Composite Index was up 1 percent. Australian stocks rose 0.5 percent, South Korea’s KOSPI advanced 0.6 percent while Japan’s Nikkei gained more than 1 percent to a one-month high. “As with 2018, the U.S.-China trade row remains a key market theme in 2019. A slight difference is that there are some signs that the two sides are seeking some sort of a resolution,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “China seems to be running low on options, while the United States would also want to avoid a prolonged conflict given the negative consequences on its markets and the economy,” Monji said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the latest round of trade talks aimed at resolving the dispute between the world’s two largest economies. In December, Washington and Beijing agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. Indicators released recently have shown signs that the Chinese economy is losing momentum. China’s fourth-quarter economic growth, due to be reported on Monday, likely slowed to the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, a Reuters poll showed, as demand faltered at home and abroad. The dollar was mildly supported after U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the improvement in risk appetite in the broader markets. The greenback was a shade higher at 109.390 yen after popping up to a two-week high of 109.44. The dollar has gained about 0.7 percent against the Japanese currency this week. The euro was little changed at $1.1390 after dipping slightly overnight. The common currency was on track for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.744 percent after going brushing 2.761 percent the previous day, its highest in three weeks. The pound traded nearly flat at $1.2978, in reach of a two-month peak of $1.3001 scaled overnight on the back of hopes that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. British Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal suffered a heavy defeat in parliament this week but she survived a subsequent vote of confidence, removing some political uncertainty for now. Still, longer-term prospects for Britain and its markets remained far from clear. “As the government negotiates with itself to come up with new proposals to pitch to an European Union that has stated no intention to renegotiate anything, the uncertainty will remain lively and volatile,” wrote Carl Weinberg, chief international economist at High Frequency Economics. U.S. crude oil futures extended gains after rising the previous day on a bounce in Wall Street and news that OPEC sharply curtailed production in December. U.S. crude futures added 1.1 percent to $52.65 per barrel. The contracts have gained more than 2 percent this week. Brent crude was up 0.95 percent at $61.76 per barrel and on track to gain roughly 2 percent on the week. Elsewhere in commodities, palladium was 1.3 percent higher at $1,414.00 an ounce after rising to an all-time high of $1,434.50 overnight. Demand has recently outstripped supply for the metal, used in emissions-reducing catalytic converters for cars. Palladium also appeared to get a boost from hopes for further government stimulus in China, the world’s biggest auto market. Spot gold was steady at $1,290.71 an ounce, having relinquished its spot as the most expensive precious metal to palladium early in December.

2019-01-18,"NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Energy fund managers took heavy losses last year with wrong-way bets on the prices of oil and natural gas, leading to a wave of closures in the volatile fund sector. The number of active energy-focused funds fell to just 738 in 2018 through September from about 836 in 2016, according to the latest available data from hedge funds industry tracker Eurekahedge. That’s the lowest number of active funds since 2010. The number of funds solely focused on oil or gas has tumbled to 179 in 2018 from 194 in 2016. Funds that have suspended operations included high-profile names such as Jamison Capital’s macro fund, T. Boone Pickens’ BP Capital and Andy Hall’s main hedge fund at Astenbeck Capital Management, along with smaller niche funds such as Casement Capital.  “There is a massive decline in the number of funds, and no replacements,” said David Mooney, founder of Casement Capital. “There has been a near ‘extinction event’ in commodities hedge funds.” “We had about 16 large hedge funds trading natural gas in Houston a few years ago,” he said. “That number is now reduced to a small number of managers.” Some funds saw investors pull out because they increasingly view energy as an unsafe spot for their money. Casement suspended operations after difficulties raising investor interest, two industry sources said.   The firm was supported by Lighthouse Partners, according to a regulatory filing. Lighthouse declined to comment, and Mooney would not elaborate on the reasons for Casement’s decision to close. “All hedge funds, including commodities, that are being scrutinized for near-term performance are coming under pressure,” said Jonathan Goldberg, founder of one of the best-known energy-focused hedge funds, BBL Commodities. Closures of energy-focused hedge funds have outpaced launches in the last three years, according to data from Eurekahedge.  “It becomes self-reinforcing,” Goldberg said in an interview. “If people lose money and are seeing negative feedback for it, they cut risk and it becomes harder and harder to manage the business.” Macro hedge funds - those with strategies based on broad global macroeconomic trends, such as a bet that oil prices will rise - were among the hardest hit, falling 3.6 percent in 2018. That’s the weakest annual performance since 2011, when such funds fell 4.2 percent, according to the Hedge Fund Research (HFRI) Macro index .HFRIMI, a key industry index. Through mid-December, commodity trading advisors (CTAs) were down by 7.1 percent, according to a late December estimate by Credit Suisse. In December, Goldberg said he would wind down BBL Commodities’ flagship fund and focus instead on longer-term trading opportunities. Goldberg’s BBL Commodities Value Fund lost 14.2 percent in July, Reuters reported. Goldberg said in December that returns had been “limited” recently. Funds took heavy losses this past year when oil prices took an unexpected dive beginning in October amid growing worries about oversupply and weakening demand. U.S. oilfields hit an all-time production record last year at more than 11.5 million barrels a day. A sharp rise in natural gas prices in late 2018, on concerns of tight supplies and cold weather, also added to the pain because many funds had paired bets on lower natural gas and higher crude. Fluctuations in prices typically create opportunities for fund managers to book a profit, but the moves of oil and gas prices followed a prolonged period of subdued volatility in energy markets and caught fund managers off guard. Oil prices had rallied through most of the year, and hedge funds built increasingly large bets on the rally continuing. Money managers began the year with a record number of bullish open positions in U.S. crude 3067651MNET and largely maintained them near those levels until mid-year.  That changed late last year, when the U.S. granted waivers to big purchasers of Iran’s oil after reinstating sanctions on the nation, and as the United States, Russia and Saudi Arabia all produced at record levels, feeding worries about a supply glut. The market sunk in a series of volatile trading days as funds rushed to unload positions. Hedge fund investors said they do not see the situation for niche funds improving. Among those that have been having the most difficulty are natural gas funds, said one recruiter who works with several funds and banks in the commodities industry. In November, U.S. natural gas futures experienced their most volatile streak in nine years. Velite Capital, which emerged earlier this decade as one of the most profitable natural gas hedge funds, founded by star trader David Coolidge, began winding down in August. Madava Asset Management, meanwhile, shut after investor Blackstone Group requested to pull funds, according to a Wall Street Journal report. Timoneer Energy, a hedge fund specializing in natural gas futures and options, also wound down last year, sources said. The firm was set up in 2015 by a portfolio manager and three analysts from Velite. Several former members of the fund did not respond to a request for comment. Two years ago, energy executives John James and Sachin Goel planned to launch natural gas-focused hedge fund Mercasa Energy, backed by an initial commitment of $10 million from investor Titan Advisors, which has some $4.5 billion in assets under management. But the fund was not able to secure additional investments, and by early 2018, Mercasa had shut.      Titan Advisors declined to comment.  Ernest Scalamandre, founder of AC Investment Management, an investment firm focused on commodities, said he expects funds dedicated to oil and natural gas to remain challenged.  “I don’t envision the fundamentals changing all that much for gas and or crude,” he said.

2019-01-18,"(Reuters) - India’s Reliance Industries (RELI.NS) on Thursday posted record quarterly profit driven by its telecoms, retail and petrochemicals businesses, which offset the impact of a weaker refining margins due to volatile crude prices. The results saw the conglomerate making progress in its drive, announced last year, to make its consumer businesses eventually as large as its core energy operations, which are also struggling with slowing growth in China.  “Consumer business now contributes more than 25 percent of the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and profit),” V Srikanth, joint chief financial officer said, referring to the telecoms and retail businesses. The businesses contributed around 12 percent to EBITDA in 2017. Net profit on a consolidated basis rose to 102.5 billion rupees ($1.44 billion) in October-December, beating analysts’ average estimate of 96.48 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.  Consolidated revenue grew 56.4 percent to 1.60 trillion rupees. Gross refining margin (GRM) - the profit earned on each barrel of crude processed - was $8.8 per barrel for the quarter, the lowest for 16 quarters but outperforming the benchmark Singapore complex margin by $4.5 per barrel. Operating profit from refining fell 18 percent year-on-year, despite a 47 percent jump in revenues from that business. Srikanth said that while there would be short-term weakness in refining, the company could cope due to its ability to process a wide variety of crudes and a diversified business portfolio. Reliance’s refinery in the western state of Gujarat is the world’s biggest single-location refinery, with a capacity to process 1.36 million barrels per day of crude. For an interactive graphic on Indian telcos, click: tmsnrt.rs/2SZeOzb The telecoms business is central to the ambition of Chairman Mukesh Ambani, Asia’s richest man, to boost the company’s consumer operations. In the last two years, Reliance’s telecoms start-up Jio has used cut-price data and free voice calls to corner over 250 million subscribers, leaving rivals nursing losses. Jio posted a nearly 65 percent jump in quarterly profit to 8.31 billion rupees ($117 million). The company said last month it would hive off its tower and fiber assets, a move that could help sell or list the assets in future. “We’re in the process of de-merging our tower and fiber business and the end objective will be to have different set of investors who would want to run these companies,” said Srikanth. “This means that these assets go off our balance sheets so the liabilities also go down,” he added.  Reliance’s outstanding debt in the end of December was around $40 billion, while cash and cash equivalents was $11 billion.

2019-01-18,"(Repeats column that ran on Thursday, with no changes) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2Hixl8t By John Kemp LONDON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Oil traders seem increasingly convinced OPEC’s prompt action in cutting production will be enough to offset the impact of rising shale production and slowing global growth. Brent futures prices have stabilised around $60 per barrel in recent sessions, well below the peak of over $85 at the start of October, but significantly higher than the trough of less than $50 in late December. More importantly, Brent’s six-month calendar spread has strengthened from a contango (discount) of almost $1.80 per barrel to just 35 cents over the same period. Calendar spreads have been correlated with the changing balance between production and consumption, alternating between contango and backwardation as the market cycles between over- and under-supply. The narrowing discount on futures for early delivery in recent weeks indicates traders expect the market to be less oversupplied than before (tmsnrt.rs/2Hixl8t). Stronger spreads suggest OPEC’s cuts have succeeded in shifting market expectations about the outlook for 2019. Saudi Arabia and its OPEC and non-OPEC allies have implemented substantial reductions in production and exports during December and the first part of January. OPEC crude production declined by 750,000 barrels per day in December, according to industry sources surveyed by the OPEC secretariat. Most of the reduction came from Saudi Arabia (470,000 bpd), but there were also substantial cuts from Iran (160,000 bpd) and Libya (170,000 bpd) as a result of U.S. sanctions and domestic unrest respectively. Saudi Arabia has said its output will decline even further this month as the kingdom attempts to avoid an accumulation of excess oil inventories. By acting quickly and aggressively, Saudi Arabia and its allies hope to avert an extended period of over-production and a sharper drop in prices, and early evidence suggests they have succeeded. The biggest uncertainty is still from the global economic outlook, where OPEC acknowledged in its most recent monthly report that risks to world growth “remain skewed to the downside”. If global growth slows further, the potential for an oil market surplus will re-emerge, and OPEC members will come under pressure to reduce output even further. However, the organisation is hopeful the major central banks will respond to signs of an economic slowdown by becoming less aggressive in tightening monetary policy. The result would be an easing of financial conditions, a weaker dollar, and a soft landing for the global economy and oil market in 2019. (“Monthly Oil Market Report”, OPEC, Jan. 17) Most traders and hedge funds favour the soft-landing scenario rather than a hard-landing or a re-acceleration of growth. Fund positioning in the main crude and fuels futures contracts is close to neutral. In practice, there are substantial risks in both directions. Faster-than-expected growth would leave the market short of crude, hedge funds racing to rebuild bullish positions, and propel prices higher quickly, allowing OPEC to relax some of its recent cutbacks. If the economy does slow further and slides into recession, however, prices and calendar spreads will come under renewed pressure, forcing OPEC to cut again. In the current market, the supply picture looks comfortable, with plenty of spare capacity and Saudi Arabia acting as swing producer, so prices will be determined primarily by events on the demand side.

2019-01-18,"SYDNEY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. oil prices inched higher on Friday after a report from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries showed its production fell sharply last month, easing fears about prolonged oversupply. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $52.40 per barrel at 0026 GMT, up 32 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement. WTI futures closed down 0.4 percent on Thursday. International Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade, after closing up 1.1 percent in the previous session. OPEC cut oil output sharply in December before a new accord to limit supply took effect on Jan. 1, it said on Thursday, suggesting that producers have made a strong start to averting a glut in 2019 as a slowing economy curbs demand. “The OPEC+ production cuts (that stared this month) will be paramount to keeping the market tight and supporting prices,” ANZ said in a research note. The body is making cuts along with other major producers such as Russia. OPEC said in its monthly report that its oil output fell by 751,000 barrels per day (bpd) in December to 31.58 million bpd, the biggest month-on-month drop in almost two years. But tempering that support for prices, OPEC also cut its forecast for average daily demand for its crude in 2019 to 30.83 million barrels, down 910,000 bpd from the 2018 average.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin discussed lifting some or all tariffs imposed on Chinese imports and suggested offering a tariff rollback during trade discussions scheduled for Jan. 30. U.S. stocks rallied following the report, but pared some of those gains after a Treasury spokesperson told CNBC that Mnuchin had not made any such recommendations. For the day, all three major U.S. indexes were up, led by a surge in industrial stocks. Following Wall Street’s lead, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.25 percent. The index has gained nearly 1 percent this week. Australian stocks rose 0.6 percent, as did South Korea’s KOSPI while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.7 percent. “As with 2018, the U.S.-China trade row remains a key market theme in 2019. A slight difference is that there are some signs that the two sides are seeking some sort of a resolution,” said Soichiro Monji, senior economist at Daiwa SB Investments in Tokyo. “China seems to be running low on options, while the United States would also want to avoid a prolonged conflict given the negative consequences on its markets and the economy,” Monji said. Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will visit the United States on Jan. 30 and 31 for the latest round of trade talks aimed at resolving the bitter dispute between the world’s two largest economies. In December, Washington and Beijing agreed to a 90-day truce in a trade war that has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods. Indicators released recently have shown signs that the Chinese economy is losing some momentum. China’s fourth-quarter economic growth, due to be reported on Monday, likely slowed to the weakest pace since the global financial crisis, a Reuters poll showed, as demand faltered at home and abroad. In currencies, the dollar was mildly supported after U.S. Treasury yields rose amid the improvement in risk appetite in the broader markets. The greenback was steady at 109.14 yen after popping up to a two-week high of 109.40 overnight. The dollar has gained about 0.6 percent against the Japanese currency this week. The euro was little changed at $1.1392 after dipping slightly overnight. The common currency was on track for a weekly loss of 0.7 percent. The 10-year Treasury yield stood at 2.746 percent after going brushing 2.761 percent the previous day, its highest in three weeks. The pound stood at $1.2984, hovering close to a two-month peak of $1.3001 scaled overnight on the back of hopes that Britain can avoid a no-deal Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal suffered a heavy defeat in parliament this week but she survived a subsequent vote of confidence, removing some political uncertainty for now. U.S. crude oil futures extended gains after rising the previous day on a rebound in Wall Street and news that OPEC sharply curtailed production in December. U.S. crude futures added 0.13 percent to $52.14 per barrel. The contracts have gained 1.1 percent this week.
