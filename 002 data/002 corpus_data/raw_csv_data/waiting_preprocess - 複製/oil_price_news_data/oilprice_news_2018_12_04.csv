2018-12-04,"The OPEC+ meeting is set to kickoff, with a press conference scheduled for Thursday afternoon in Vienna. While there seems to be a vague outline of an agreement in hand, there is still quite a bit of uncertainty about what might come out of the meeting.Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih injected a bit more uncertainty into the market with his comments in a Tuesday interview with Bloomberg. He said that Russia supports production restraints “in principle,” but that it would be “premature” to say what specifically they might agree to. He even said that OPEC+ still needs to “figure out what needs to be done and by how much.”While there is always a bit of jawboning and word games ahead of any OPEC meeting, the comments suggest that there is still some disagreement over the specifics. “We need to get together and listen to our colleagues, hear about their views on supply and demand and their projections of their own countries’ production,” al-Falih said. “The next road to cross is whether all countries are willing to come on board and contribute to that cut.”Saudi Arabia’s inclination is to cut aggressively, but it also does not want to anger U.S. President Donald Trump, who has bailed the Saudis out on the Khashoggi affair. Al-Falih was notably more circumspect regarding a production cut on Tuesday than he was only a few weeks ago, when he announced that Saudi Arabia would unilaterally lower exports beginning in December. Between then and now the U.S. Senate passed a bill ending American support for the Saudi war in Yemen, significantly upping the pressure on Saudi Arabia not to cut by too much.  Related: What Crashing Refining Margins Mean For Oil MarketsMeanwhile, Riyadh still needs to convince Moscow to some degree. Even though Russian President Vladimir Putin said that he was on board, Bloomberg reports that Russia only wants to cut output by 150,000 bpd, a rather modest amount, which would mean more heavy lifting by Saudi Arabia to balance the market. Russia appears willing to go along with some sort of reduction, but it also does not feel the same urgency as the Saudis, particularly because of the dynamics of how its currency fluctuates with oil prices, making lower prices much less painful compared to Saudi Arabia.Even if Saudi Arabia and Russia are not quite on the same page regarding the size of the cut and how to share the reductions, most analysts see some sort of deal emerging from Thursday’s meeting. In fact, even though Russia is not a price hawk in the same way that Saudi Arabia is, Moscow can gain from the damaged relationship between Washington and Riyadh.“Having stayed largely silent on the Khashoggi case, Moscow has an opportunity to strengthen relations with Riyadh further if it accommodates Saudi Arabia,” Torbjorn Soltvedt, politics principal analyst for Verisk Maplecroft wrote in a note to clients. “An OPEC+ agreement led by Saudi Arabia and Russia that openly defies the US is unlikely; but we believe Riyadh has a good chance of securing the participation of Moscow in a flexible supply cut agreement.”  Related: Australians Create Battery From WasteSoltvedt said that the consultancy’s “basecase scenario is a de-facto Saudi-led cut with Russian participation, but a flexible agreement that shies away from specific targets.” Individual countries may not have specific targets; instead a collective target could be the main takeaway.Flexibility is important, Verisk Maplecroft argues, because the oil market could undergo another dramatic shift in just a few months’ time. “Another benefit of this approach is that it reduces the likelihood of another OPEC U-turn if the Trump administrations decides to not renew Iran waivers expiring in May,” Soltvedt of Verisk Maplecroft wrote. “With around 1 million bpd of Iranian oil in the balance, a rigid OPEC agreement in the traditional mold risks quickly being overtaken by events in 2019.”The Trump administration – mainly Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Advisor John Bolton – are eager to tighten the screws on Iran. In October, as the U.S. was in the midst of preparing to issue waivers for eight countries importing oil from Iran, the oil market looked precariously tight. The ensuing price crash – no doubt made worse by the waivers themselves – has revealed a market much looser than expected.That means that by May, the Trump administration will likely want to let most of those waivers expire. The result could be much more Iranian supply knocked offline. Saudi Arabia and Russia need to account for this possibility at Thursday’s meeting in Vienna. That means, as Verisk Maplecroft argues, a production cut, but one that can be easily rolled back should events require it.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Most-Likely-Outcome-Of-The-OPEC-Meeting.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 17:23 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 04, 2018",The Most Likely Outcome Of The OPEC Meeting
2018-12-04,"A fractured OPEC is meeting later this week to discuss a deal to cut oil production—yet again—to rebalance the market and lift oil prices that have recently slipped to below most of the cartel members’ budget-balance points.OPEC needs a unanimous vote to pass decisions such as curtailing production. Yet, Iran—one of OPEC’s biggest producers but also one of the most sidelined members in recent months—warns that the group is unlikely to reach an agreement on a sizeable cut of around 1.4 million bpd as some are suggesting. Such a failure to act decisively would send oil prices plunging to $40 a barrel, Iran’s OPEC Governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili told Bloomberg in an interview.The cartel and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies may not extend their cooperation pact either, according to Iran’s representative at OPEC—a position typically held by the second most powerful oilman in a cartel member after the oil minister.Iran has repeatedly expressed frustration with the Saudi/Russia-led increase in oil production since June to offset what was expected to be a steep decline in Iranian oil supply with the U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s petroleum and shipping industries.Iran’s oil exports indeed dropped by some 1 million bpd, but they are likely still holding onto above 1 million bpd, while U.S. waivers to eight Iranian customers allow buyers to continue purchasing oil at reduced volumes until the end of April next year.Oil prices have plunged by around 30 percent from early October as the market started to fear an oversupply is building up again, due to record high production in Saudi Arabia and Russia, and an all-time high oil output in the United States, coupled with fears of slowing economic and oil demand growth.“I doubt, with the failure they had in the last three months, that the declaration of cooperation gets extended,” Kazempour told Bloomberg, referring to the Saudi-Russia alliance.  Related: Are Oil Markets About To Turn Around?“Why institutionalize a failure? And it needs unanimity to be extended,” he noted.Iran, for one, will not take part in any cuts while there are U.S. sanctions on its oil, Kazempour said, adding that those who increased production should be the ones to cut, that is the Saudis and Russians and few Arab Gulf states like the UAE and Kuwait.“Now they are asking others to share in the cut. Whoever increased, they should cut,” Kazempour told Reuters on Monday.“The pilot and co-pilot crashed the plane and all 25 passengers are now in critical condition,” said Iran’s OPEC governor.The ‘pilot and co-pilot’, however, agreed this weekend to extend the deal, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin said, although he admitted there isn’t an agreement on specific cuts, yet.“But we, together with Saudi Arabia, will do this, and whatever final figure we will decide upon, we agreed that we will monitor the market situation and promptly respond to it,” Putin said.While the general framework between OPEC and non-OPEC may be in place, Saudi Arabia will have to appease growing frustration at smaller members within OPEC and convince them to fall in line, in order to get a unanimous vote on some sort of production cuts, which may not even be worded as ‘reduced output’.  Related: The Saudi Dilemma: To Cut Or Not To CutDays before the December 6-7 meeting in Vienna, Qatar surprisingly announced on Monday that it would be quitting OPEC as of January 1, as it focuses on natural gas.According to Iran’s Kazempour, Qatar is not the only one frustrated with OPEC’s recent decisions, especially the ones taken by the Saudi-Russia co-chaired Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC).“There are many other OPEC members frustrated that the JMMC is deciding on production unilaterally and without the required prior consensus of OPEC,” Kazempour told Reuters.Smaller OPEC members may need some convincing, but a higher price of oil is not an insignificant argument for many of the cartel members who can’t balance their budgets at $60 a barrel Brent.It looks like Saudi Arabia and Russia are ready to continue managing the oil market and will have their way one way or another—if they can’t get consensus on a wording with ‘(…) million barrels per day’ of cuts, they can always bet on a vague statement of ‘market stability’, ‘declaration of cooperation’ to ‘adjust compliance levels’, open to interpretation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Oil-To-Fall-To-40-If-OPEC-Fails-To-Reach-Deal.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 15:39 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 04, 2018",Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach Deal
2018-12-04,"The government of Alberta this week took an unprecedented decision to enforce a crude oil production cut so excess inventories could be shrunk and the price of western Canadian grades could improve, but the industry’s problems are far from over. They will be among the hardest hit by the International Maritime Organization’s new emission rules, to enter into effect in two years, which will require a reduction of the sulfur content of bunkering fuel to 0.5 percent from 3.5 percent.“We’ve got challenges with respect to pipelines, we’ve got challenges with respect to rail and now we’ve got challenges with respect to our demand market,” Bloomberg quoted the chief executive officer of the Canadian Energy Research Institute as saying at a presentation this week. The emission rules will start affecting the price of Canadian crude next year, Allan Fogwill, along with other analysts, believes.Canadian crude is heavy and sour, that is, high in sulfur content, which is the obvious reason why the IMO changes would affect prices, adding to already substantial pressure from pipeline bottlenecks and the rising amount of crude that is being transported by costlier rail.According to IHS Markit analyst Kurt Barrow, the emission rules will make Canadian crude another $7-8 cheaper than West Texas Intermediate in 2019. Even the completion of the Line 3 replacement project won’t offset these losses, although it will add 375,000 bpd to daily pipeline capacity.Another analyst, Wood Mackenzie research director Mark Oberstoetter, told Bloomberg Western Canadian Select will likely be US$20 cheaper than WTI for most of 2019, which is the cost of railway transportation for Albertan heavy crude. All in all, things are looking pretty bad. But how bad is bad?  Related: OPEC Oil Exports Jump Ahead Of MeetingFor one thing, Canadian heavy is the main heavy crude feedstock for U.S. refineries. Canada is in fact the biggest exporter of crude to the United States, at a rate of over 4 million bpd as of September, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, which compares with around 3 million bpd from OPEC. There aren’t a whole lot of alternative sources of heavy crude, what with Venezuela spiraling down into a deeper crisis and production falling along with exports.For another, the new emission rules will not eliminate demand for fuel oil, it will only reduce it. Reuters recently polled 33 refiners on their IMO 2020 plans and found that although as much as 40 percent planned to stop producing high-sulfur fuel oil, the rest had no plans to suspend production despite the expected drop in demand. Instead, they were upgrading their refineries to further process the residual petroleum product into more gasoline and diesel, and also banking on stable demand from the power generation sector: when fuel oil becomes cheap enough, it serves as an alternative to coal.The new emission rules will definitely present a new challenge to Albertan producers on top of what they already have to deal with. However, the importance of their crude for U.S. refineries and the low prices that have opened up the Chinese refining market for more Canadian oil exports should serve as a cushion against major price and production shocks.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Next-Disaster-For-Canadian-Drillers.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 15:15 | Irina Slav","Dec 04, 2018",Is This The Next Disaster For Canadian Drillers?

Its total resource estimate for the Stabroek Block now rises to more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent.Tuesday December 4, 2018Trump and Xi agree to truce. The U.S. and China agreed to delay their trade war, although both sides have sold the temporary agreement differently to their home audiences. Trump played up a lowering of Chinese tariffs on U.S. autos, something that China did not confirm they agreed to. Still, global markets welcomed the ceasefire, even if it only kicks the can down the road. The U.S. will hold off on the scheduled increase in tariffs from 10 to 25 percent that was set to take effect in January. The two sides now have 90 days to reach an agreement.OPEC production steady in November. OPEC’s production was flat in November at 33.13 million barrels per day, down a slight 10,000 bpd from the month before. Saudi output exceeded 11 mb/d for the first time in history, but those gains were offset by a declines elsewhere, including 230,000 bpd from Iran and 160,000 bpd from Iraq.OPEC+ gears up for production cut. Russian President Vladimir Putin said over the weekend at the G20 summit that Russia has agreed to go along with a production cut in Vienna. The size of the cut is undecided at this point. Saudi Arabia wants something more aggressive, but is also wary of angering Washington. Most analysts predict a middle-of-the-road production cut. “Given Saudi Arabia’s need to balance a host of conflicting interests, our basecase scenario is a de-facto Saudi-led cut with Russian participation, but a flexible agreement that shies away from specific targets,” Verisk Maplecroft said in a note to clients. Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that it was still “premature” to lay out the specifics of the deal.

Alberta required its oil industry to lower output by 325,000 bpd beginning in January to erase the stockpile glut and ease the strain on the region’s takeaway capacity. The move is intended to boost WCS prices – and by all accounts, the move seems to have worked. WCS jumped this week. According to Scotiabank, WCS discounts could average just $20 per barrel in the first quarter of 2019, down sharply from a more painful $29-per-barrel discount had the policy not been enacted.Qatar quits OPEC. Qatar announced its withdrawal from OPEC on Monday, after nearly six decades inside the group. The Qatari government said it was for “technical” reasons; mainly to focus on natural gas production. But a member of the ruling family also criticized OPEC, which seemed to undercut the official reason for the country’s exit. “The withdrawal of Qatar from OPEC is a wise decision, as this organization has become useless and does not bring us anything,” said former prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani. “It is just being used for purposes that harm our national interest.” Saudi Arabia launched an economic blockade against Qatar last year, and most analysts believe the intense rivalry between the two countries drove Qatar to exit.Libyan warlord finds international support. The Wall Street Journal profiled Khalifa Haftar, the warlord that controls the eastern half of Libya and stands in opposition to the internationally-recognized government in the western half of the country. Haftar has a bloody record of torture, extrajudicial killings and disappearances, but he has found growing support from Europe and elsewhere as his control has grown. “Some Western officials now regard Mr. Haftar as indispensable to any future Libyan peace pact,” the Wall Street Journal wrote. Many oil companies have investments in territory controlled by Haftar.Iran threatens to blockade Strait of Hormuz if U.S. tightens sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani threatened to block all oil shipments through the Strait of Hormuz if Washington follows through on tighter sanctions intended to zero out Iranian oil exports. “The US should know that we are selling our oil ... and it is not able to stop Iran's oil exports,” Rouhani said. “And it should know if it intends to block our oil someday, no oil will be exported through the Persian Gulf.” It’s not the first time that Tehran has issued such a threat.U.S. State Department to conduct environmental review of Keystone XL. In response to a court order, the State Department will conduct an additional environmental review of the Keystone XL project, after its route was been altered.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office on December 1, and in his inaugural speech he lambasted the energy reform instituted under his predecessor. “They told us it was going to save us but it has only meant the fall in oil production and the excessive increase in gasoline, diesel, gas and electricity prices,” he said of the reforms. Still, he vowed his government would “respect the [energy] contracts already signed and ensure that investments will be secure.” He also promised major investments in Mexico’s refineries.French government to delay fuel tax hike.

2018-12-04,"A proposed U.S. legislation that could pave the way for suing OPEC for market manipulation is a “big concern” among the cartel and may weigh on the message from the meeting later this week and on some members’ incentive to continue being part of OPEC, Michael Cohen, the head of energy markets research at Barclays, told CNBC on Tuesday.“I think it’s something that could very easily weigh on the messaging of this meeting that is going to happen on Thursday and Friday,” Cohen told CNBC, when asked to comment on the proposed U.S. legislation in light of the current divisions within OPEC, especially Qatar quitting the cartel.The proposed U.S. legislation—the so-called No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels (NOPEC) Act—could pave the way to antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. against the cartel and its national oil companies, if passed.Forms of antitrust legislation aimed at OPEC were discussed at various times under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, but they both threatened to veto such legislation.In May this year, the NOPEC Act was introduced again. Such legislation would make OPEC subject to antitrust laws by removing a state immunity shield created by judicial precedent.Given U.S. President Donald Trump’s continued criticism of OPEC and the way the cartel manipulates the oil market and prices, OPEC members are concerned that the legislation may pass this time around.“It is certainly possible that a country that is looking to enhance or burnish its ties to the United States may look at the NOPEC legislation and say: ‘Well, we don’t want to be a part of this organization anymore,’” Cohen told CNBC today.OPEC is also said to have urged all its members not to mention specific oil prices, and to instead stick to the ‘market stability’ narrative in public comments about oil policies to avoid the risk of potential U.S. antitrust lawsuits for manipulating the market if the United States passes the legislation.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/NOPEC-Act-Is-A-Big-Concern-For-OPEC-Members.html,"Dec 04, 2018 at 10:37 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 04, 2018",NOPEC Act Is A Big Concern For OPEC Members
2018-12-04,"Crude oil exports from OPEC went up by 619,000 bpd last month, data from French shipping data tracking company Kpler showed, with Venezuela notable for a 358,000-bpd increase alone. In fact, the troubled South American country with the largest oil reserves in the world booked the third-largest increase in monthly exports.Saudi Arabia came on top, with an increase of 791,000 bpd in its exports, followed by the UAE, whose crude oil shipments abroad rose by 470,000 bpd. Angola also exported more in November than October, with the increase at 238,000 bpd, Kpler said.Not surprisingly, Iran booked the largest decline in its crude oil exports as U.S. sanctions entered into effect, despite the waivers granted by Washington; the effect of these will be felt later. For November, however, Iran’s exports were down by 854,000 bpd to a total 1.041 million bpd.Iran’s neighbor, Iraq, also booked a substantial decline in oil exports, down 239,000 bpd from October, to 3.765 million bpd.Saudi Arabia exported an average daily of 8.138 million bpd last month, with Iraq coming second, and the UAE third, with a daily export rate of 2.828 million bpd. Nigeria exported 1.876 million bpd, down by 81,000 bpd from a month earlier.The figures will likely pressure prices, which had just begun to improve slightly after Russian President Putin said at the G20 meeting Moscow was prepared to continue its partnership with OPEC regarding production, which suggested it will join the cuts.While the amount of oil that OPEC and its partners will remove from the market has not yet been settled, analysts saw it at between 1 million bpd and 1.4 million bpd. Reuters today quoted sources from the cartel as saying the number discussed would be 1.3 million bpd.
