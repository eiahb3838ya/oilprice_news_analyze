2018-11-30,"Oil prices have plunged to one-year lows, but refiners in certain parts of the U.S. are not benefitting from cheaper crude.According to new data from the EIA, refining margins for motor gasoline have fallen to five-year lows. “Flattening year-over-year growth in gasoline demand in the United States, combined with high levels of refinery output, have contributed to low or negative motor gasoline refining margins for refiners along the East and Gulf Coasts,” the EIA said on November 27. Gasoline refining margins have been declining since August.In November, U.S. gasoline demand is expected to have averaged 9.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), down 262,000 bpd from a year earlier.(Click to enlarge)Meanwhile, prices for distillates, such as diesel, are much higher. The discrepancy is notable, and the markets for gasoline and distillates have diverged sharply this year. The forthcoming 2020 International Maritime Organization regulations on sulfur content in maritime fuels is set to push extremely dirty heavy fuel oil out of the mix for ship-owners. One of the most important replacements for fuel oil be diesel and gasoil – in other words, distillate demand is set to spike at the start of 2020. In anticipation of these regulations, distillate prices are seeing upward pressure.With diesel prices on the rise and gasoline prices heading in the other direction, refiners might want to maximize diesel output. However, things aren’t that simple. As the EIA notes, for every barrel of crude oil processed in a refinery, it tends to yield twice as much gasoline as it does diesel. “As a result, although gasoline margins have been low recently, refiners cannot completely stop making gasoline in favor of other petroleum products, such as distillate,” the EIA said. (Click to enlarge)But because diesel prices are favorable, refiners are simply churning out product as quickly as possible, which is exacerbating the emerging supply glut of gasoline.This wouldn’t necessarily be a huge problem except that gasoline demand has stalled out in the United States. Part of that is the hangover from higher fuel prices earlier this summer. In essence, refiners are chasing diesel, dumping gasoline onto the market, at a time when consumers have been pulling back. The result has been gasoline supply outpacing demand, which translated into unusually large storage levels.Typically, as peak summer demand season gives way to autumn, refiners go offline for maintenance, which leads to a drawdown in gasoline stocks. But the combination of higher-than-usual refining runs and weak demand meant that gasoline inventories held up through October.Related: Legendary Oil Trader Expects Crude Prices To ReboundTo complicate matters further, much of the surging oil production the Permian basin is light in quality, which means that it tends to be better suited for gasoline production rather than distillates.The recent plunge in crude oil is starting to trickle down into lower pump prices, which could yet provide a bit of a spark to demand. Indeed, in the most recent data release from the EIA, gasoline stocks edged down ever-so-slightly, continuing a downward trend since October. Still, gasoline inventories are at the upper end of the five-year average range at 224.6 million barrels for the week ending on November 23.But the upshot of the differences between gasoline and diesel markets is that refining margins for gasoline have steadily declined over the past few months. The EIA forecasts margins to “remain low during the winter before rebounding and following their normal seasonal patterns heading into the 2019 summer driving season.”It will be interesting see how this affects various refiners and even the integrated oil companies. During the oil market downturn that began in 2014, the oil majors suffered from low crude prices, but did better than pure-play upstream producers because they had their refining units to cushion the blow. Cheap crude stoked demand for motor fuels, and the oil majors benefiting from very large margins on refining.This time around, the narrowing margins for gasoline is ill-timed since it is also occurring alongside a downturn in crude prices. As the EIA notes, this is likely temporary. But it wasn’t so long ago that most analysts and industry executives saw 2018 shaping up to be a hugely positive year. The simultaneous meltdown in refining margins and crude oil prices could dash those hopes.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/What-Crashing-Refining-Margins-Mean-For-Oil-Markets.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 17:07 | Nick Cunningham","Nov 30, 2018",What Crashing Refining Margins Mean For Oil Markets
2018-11-30,"To cut and push up prices or not to cut and preserve market share, this is the question that Saudi Arabia is facing ahead of this year’s December OPEC meeting. It seems like just yesterday when OPEC met in 2016 and decided to cut production by 1.8 million barrels daily, including from Russia, to reverse the free fall of oil prices. At the time, it worked because everyone was desperate. Now, many OPEC members are both desperate while not yet recovered from the 2014 blow. Saudi Arabia is not an exception.A recent report from Capital Economics said Saudi Arabia has its problems but it could withstand lower oil prices without feeling too much of a pinch. ""Even if [Brent] prices fall further to $40-$50 a barrel, immediate balance of payments strains are unlikely to emerge,"" the report said, with its authors adding the Kingdom would be able to finance its trade deficit from its foreign exchange reserves “for at least a decade.”This suggestion is not universally accepted. Reuters’ John Kemp this week offered a different perspective in his regular column on oil, noting Saudi Arabia’s foreign exchange reserves currently stand at US$500 billion, down from nearly US$750 billion in 2014 when the oil prices slumped under the weight of U.S. shale oil. At the same time, Saudi Arabia is in a major push to diversify its revenue streams and has committed a lot of money to it.Also, Kemp wrote, “The kingdom probably needs to keep several hundred billion dollars’ worth of reserve assets on hand to maintain confidence in its fixed exchange-rate peg to the U.S. dollar and prevent a run on the currency.”It’s a classic rock and a hard place situation for the Saudis. On the one hand, they could continue pumping at the current record rate or close to it, pressuring prices further, which is what they did in 2014. That strategy hurt U.S. shale substantially, but the attempted assault did not go quite as planned. Now, it will once again hurt U.S. shale, but again, it won’t beat the resilience of the US shale patch.  That much should have become clear in the past three years.Related: Saudi Oil Output Hits Record High In NovemberOn the other hand, Saudi Arabia could start cutting, but it will need to convince all other OPEC members to join the cuts and, more importantly, Russia. Reuters earlier today reported, quoting unnamed sources, that Russia had “accepted the need to cut production” and prices immediately jumped, once again highlighting how important the Russia-Saudi Arabia cooperation has become for oil markets, if it even needs highlighting.For now, it seems like a cut is the more likely outcome. In spite of reservations expressed by Nigeria and Libya, if Saudi Arabia managed to convince everyone to cut amid the major tensions with Iran ahead of the U.S. sanctions, then it could probably convince them again, if only on the grounds that if they don’t start cutting all will suffer.Kemp agrees. “Saudi Arabia cannot afford another slump in oil prices,” he warns. “It needs to keep revenues high to help its economy climb out of recession and finance ambitious social and economic transformation programs.”Yet the Kingdom is preparing. Kpler reported this week loadings of Saudi crude since the start of November had reached new highs of 8.14 million bpd, which was 770,000 bpd more than the average daily loadings rate for October and much higher than the last 2018 high of 7.766 million bpd booked for June. The bulk of the increase comes from China, with shipments in that direction up by more than half a million barrels daily in November from October. Production is also at record highs, like Russia’s was ahead of the first cuts in 2016. Perhaps we are seeing a lesson learned there or perhaps the Kingdom is out of options besides cutting.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Saudi-Dilemma-To-Cut-Or-Not-To-Cut.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 17:04 | Irina Slav","Nov 30, 2018",The Saudi Dilemma: To Cut Or Not To Cut
2018-11-30,"Despite hitting its lowest level in over a year earlier in the week, crude oil is showing signs of stabilizing. This is perhaps an early indication that the worst of the selling may be over. With crude oil, sentiment is being influenced by expectations of production cuts by OPEC and its allies.Crude OilU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures is currently in a position to post a potentially bullish technical closing price reversal bottom on the weekly chart. Helping to form the chart pattern is Thursday’s rapid reversal to the upside on the daily chart. This move was fueled after industry sources said Russia had accepted the need to cut production, together with OPEC ahead of its meeting in Vienna on December 6-7.At the start of the week, crude oil was in a position to post one of its biggest one-month declines in November since the worst of the financial crisis in 2008, having dropped about 22 percent so far. Primarily driving the price action this month has been increasing supply by the United States and Saudi Arabia.Russia Changes its TuneAfter U.S. crude oil fell below $50 for the first time in over a year, the news hit that Russia would consider joining OPEC and other producers to cut output. This triggered the technical reversal in the markets.The reaction by traders to the news about Russia was primarily driven by short-covering, but nonetheless, it is a good sign that the buying may be greater than the selling at…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Are-Oil-Markets-About-To-Turn-Around.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:56 | Jim Hyerczyk","Nov 30, 2018",Are Oil Markets About To Turn Around?
2018-11-30,"Just as the U.S. shale patch is drafting spending budgets for 2019, oil prices have tumbled 25 percent from four-year highs in early October to just above $50 a barrel WTI Crude at the end of November.Oil at $50 is largely considered the break-even point for many shale developments and is the minimum price at which most U.S. drillers have been budgeting spending plans over the past year or so.Most producers across the shale patch will be announcing 2019 spending plans alongside full-year 2018 earnings releases at end-January and early February, but signs have already started to emerge that the U.S. shale patch will be cutting budgets for 2019.Collective spending plans for next year may be the first budgets cut across the industry since the oil price crash of 2015-2016, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.Just two months ago, $50 oil was not the base-case scenario at which U.S. companies planned, and few had expected such a steep price correction. Now exploration and production companies—who had just started to report rising cash flows and to finally reward shareholders with buybacks and increased dividends—find themselves in a position to choose from where to cut spending next year, considering that a prolonged period of $50 oil would eat into cash flows and undermine previous cash generation projections.  Anadarko Petroleum is one of the few companies that have already announced its 2019 budget—and it’s lower than this year’s. Anadarko said in mid-November that its 2019 capital investment program is in the US$4.3 billion-US$4.7 billion range, plus a US$1 billion addition to its share buyback program. The company expects around US$1.6 billion adjusted free cash flow at $60 WTI in 2019. So lower WTI prices would undermine this free cash flow estimate.Analysts who until recently expected an uptick in the U.S. shale patch budgets, now see declines. Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, for example, expected minor increases in 2019 budgets, but now sees budgets either flat or down next year compared to this year, Andy McConn, a Houston-based analyst at WoodMac, told Bloomberg. Related: How Much Does OPEC Need To Cut To Balance The Market?The current sentiment and expectations about 2019 budgets are in stark contrast with the mood in the companies’ Q3 earnings releases and budget tweaks.According to a Rystad Energy analysis of 34 onshore producers, their combined capex guidance increased by an additional US$1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2018, after a US$3.7-billion increase in Q2, with companies active in the Permian accounting for over 70 percent of the total budgets adjustment.In the Dallas Fed Energy Survey for Q3—carried out in September when the oil market was still fearing a huge loss of Iranian oil supply—executives at 166 energy firms forecast on average that WTI prices would be  $68.81 per barrel by the end of this year, with responses ranging from $55 to $85 per barrel. Only around 6 percent of respondents expected WTI to be lower than $65 a barrel at end-2018.Two and a half months after the survey, the mood on the market is starkly different and the WTI price is lower than the lowest year-end projections of the company executives. Drillers have started to plan reduction in budgets, according to executives and officials who spoke to Reuters last week.Smaller producers in Texas have already begun to scale back some drilling activity, according to Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton.“Six weeks ago some of these were profitable and now they’re break-even,” Sitton told Reuters.Related: The Biggest Losers Of The Current Oil Price Slump“The (price) swing has been large enough that we have some companies that are no longer generating free cash flow.”The next few days may show if WTI prices in the low $50s will persist, as the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting in Vienna will be discussing a production cut to prevent a new global glut and prop up prices.If the cartel and allies fail to lift the market out of the bearish mood or if they decide to avoid angering U.S. President Donald Trump—who wants oil prices even lower— by not acting decisively on cuts, the U.S. shale patch may be in for some complicated math of how to balance production growth and shareholder returns at $50 WTI oil.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shale-Drillers-May-Cut-Capex-As-Oil-Falls-To-50.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:52 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Nov 30, 2018",Shale Drillers May Cut Capex As Oil Falls To $50
2018-11-30,"As I write, the world’s leaders are meeting at the G20 summit in Argentina. There are, as always, lots of story lines surrounding the meeting, some financial in nature such as the chance of informal trade negotiations, and some not so much, such as whether Donald Trump’s cancellation of his private meeting with Vladimir Putin indicates the end of their bromance. For energy investors though, the meeting will be watched with a different focus. Both Saudi Arabia and Russia are in attendance, so they will be watching for any signs of an agreement to cut oil output.That question is being asked because of current circumstances. Crude oil has been in freefall, with both Brent and WTI having lost around a third since hitting highs in early October. There are some demand related worries involved as trade wars threaten to slow global growth, but the biggest reasons for the drop are supply related. A couple of months ago, those highs were achieved in anticipation of a disruption to global supply as the Trump administration’s abandonment of the Iran nuclear deal with Iran and the resulting sanctions took effect.Since then though, a few things have become clear. Firstly, U.S. production has been stepped up by more than imagined. In addition, the Saudis increased their output to help offset the expected loss from Iran but, most importantly in that context, that loss doesn’t look likely to materialize. Despite a lot of tough talk, the sanctions on Iranian…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Output-Cuts-May-Be-Coming-But-Dont-Bet-on-It.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:49 | Martin Tillier","Nov 30, 2018",Oil Output Cuts May Be Coming But Don’t Bet on It
2018-11-30,"A Massachusetts Institute of Technology team of researchers has taken the first three-dimensional images of kerogen’s internal structure, with a level of detail more than 50 times greater than has been previously achieved. The images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given formation.The fossil fuels that provide much of the world’s energy originate in a type of rock known as kerogen, and the potential for recovering these fuels depends crucially on the size and connectedness of the rocks’ internal pore spaces.(Click to enlarge)Using a high-resolution system called electron tomography, researchers probed a tiny sample of kerogen to determine its internal structure. At left, the sample as seen from the outside, and at right, the detailed 3-D image of its internal pore structure. Image Credit: MIT. Click image for the largest view.These new images should allow more accurate predictions of how much oil or gas can be recovered from any given formation. But this wouldn’t change the capability for recovering these fuels, but it could, for example, lead to better estimates of the recoverable reserves of natural gas, which is seen as an important transition fuel as the world tries to curb the use of coal and oil.The findings have been published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, in a paper by MIT Senior Research Scientist Roland Pellenq, MIT Professor Franz-Josef Ulm, and others at MIT, CNRS and Aix-Marseille Université (AMU) in France, and Shell Technology Center in Houston.The team, which published results two years ago on an investigation of kerogen pore structure based on computer simulations, used a relatively new method called electron tomography to produce the new 3-D images, which have a resolution of less than 1 nanometer, or billionth of a meter. Previous attempts to study kerogen structure had never imaged the material below 50 nanometers resolution, Pellenq said.Fossil fuels, as their name suggests, form when organic matter such as dead plants gets buried and mixed with fine-grained silt. As these materials get buried deeper, over millions of years the mix gets cooked into a mineral matrix interspersed with a mix of carbon-based molecules. Over time, with more heat and pressure, the nature of that complex structure changes.Related: Goldman: Oil Prices Set For Rebound In 2019The process, a slow pyrolysis, involves “cooking oxygen and hydrogen, and at the end, you get a piece of charcoal,” Pellenq explains. “But in between, you get this whole gradation of molecules,” many of them useful fuels, lubricants, and chemical feedstocks.The new results show for the first time a dramatic difference in the nanostructure of kerogen depending on its age. Relatively immature kerogen (whose actual age depends of the combination of temperatures and pressures it has been subjected to) tends to have much larger pores but almost no connections among those pores, making it much harder to extract the fuel. Mature kerogen, by contrast, tends to have much tinier pores, but these are well-connected in a network that allow the gas or oil to flow easily, making much more of it recoverable, Pellenq explained.The study also reveals that the typical pore sizes in these formations are so small that normal hydrodynamic equations used to calculate the way fluids move through porous materials won’t work. At this scale the material is in such close contact with the pore walls that interactions with the wall dominate its behavior. The research team thus had to develop new ways of calculating the flow behavior.“There’s no fluid dynamics equation that works in these subnanoscale pores,” he said. “No continuum physics works at that scale.”To get these detailed images of the structure, the team used electron tomography, in which a small sample of the material is rotated within the microscope as a beam of electrons probes the structure to provide cross-sections at one angle after another. These are then combined to produce a full 3-D reconstruction of the pore structure. While scientists had been using the technique for a few years, they hadn’t applied it to kerogen structures until now. The imaging was carried out at the CINaM lab of CNRS and AMU, in France (in the group of Daniel Ferry), as part of a long-term collaboration with MultiScale Materials Science for Energy and Environment, the MIT/CNRS/AMU joint lab located at MIT.Related: $50 Oil Puts Shale To The Test“With this new nanoscale tomography, we can see where the hydrocarbon molecules are actually sitting inside the rock,” Pellenq said. Once they obtained the images, the researchers were able to use them together with molecular models of the structure, to improve the fidelity of their simulations and calculations of flow rates and mechanical properties. This could shed light on how production rates decline in oil and gas wells, and perhaps on how to slow that decline.So far, the team has studied samples from three different kerogen locations and found a strong correlation between the maturity of the formation and its pore size distribution and pore void connectivity. The researchers now hope to expand the study to many more sites and to derive a robust formula for predicting pore structure based on a given site’s maturity.This is highly interesting work. Of all the oil and gas discovered so far less than half has been recovered and marketed. Those reservoirs are found, infrastructure installed and connected to markets. Secondary and tertiary recovery are already very big businesses indeed.So one has to wonder if the big private petroleum firms may or may not be at this point or beyond. These firms hire the best petroleum engineers in the world and petroleum engineers are all very bright folks indeed.But the research is offering, out in the open, real basic information and importantly, perspective.By New Energy and FuelMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/New-Breakthrough-Will-Change-How-Oil-Reserves-Are-Measured.html,"Nov 30, 2018 at 16:04 | Brian Westenhaus","Nov 30, 2018",New Breakthrough Will Change How Oil Reserves Are Measured
2018-11-30,"Oil prices dropped early on Friday, on course to finish their worst month since 2008, as fears of oversupply and slowing demand growth dragged oil down into a bear market in November with prices off by some 30 percent from four-year highs in early October.At 07:10 a.m. EDT on Friday, WTI Crude was down 1.81 percent at $50.52, and Brent Crude traded down 1.47 percent at $59.03.On Thursday, oil prices jumped on reports that Russia had conceded that it needs to reduce oil production and join a new Saudi-led OPEC cut to balance the market.The rise didn’t last long—prices headed down again on Friday, pressured by rising U.S. oil production and comments by Russia’s Energy Minister Alexander Novak, who said in an interview with the TASS news agency that “To me, the current price range is comfortable for producers and consumers.”Earlier this week, Russian President Vladimir Putin also signaled that Moscow is okay with oil prices at their current levels.Russia is comfortable with oil at around $60, Putin said, a week ahead of the OPEC+ meeting in Vienna and just two days before the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires.In his interview with TASS published on Friday, Novak, as usual, was elusive about Russia’s position about a new production cut, and said that Moscow will have its stance ready by the December 6-7 meeting.Before the OPEC/non-OPEC meeting, the oil market will be looking for clues about global economy and trade at this weekend’s G-20 summit. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to meet on the sidelines of the event to discuss the trade war.
