2018-02-12,"In the aftermath of the wave of aggressive forecasts for supply growth from U.S. shale lately, OPEC added its voice to the mix on Monday, acknowledging that its American rivals would add more oil onto the market than it previously expected.According to OPEC’s latest forecast for 2018, non-OPEC supply will rise by 1.4 million barrels per day (mb/d) this year, an upward revision of 250,000 bpd from last month’s forecast. That is a rather large revision and it represents an acknowledgement that the cartel’s strategy of keeping upwards of 1.8 mb/d of supply off of the market has allowed a lot of runway for U.S. shale to ramp up. “[T]he steady oil price recovery since summer 2017 and renewed interest in growth opportunities has led to oil majors catching up in terms of exploration activity this year, both in the shale industry and offshore deep water” OPEC wrote in its report.Yet, OPEC’s president dismissed the warning signs from U.S. shale, stating that soaring output would not derail OPEC’s calculations or strategy. “Shale is coming and the expectation is that it will come stronger than in 2017, and this is something that we have to watch,” OPEC president and UAE energy minister Suhail Al Mazrouei said, according to Bloomberg. “But considering all factors, I don’t think it will be a huge distorter of the market.”The increase in output on an annual basis will be impressive: U.S. production will rise by 1.3 mb/d compared to 2017 levels, according to OPEC’s numbers. But OPEC sees most of the gains from the U.S. to be heavily frontloaded, with dramatic gains coming in January, February and March (on top of the huge increases in the fourth quarter of 2017).  Related: U.S. Shale Companies Are Ready To ExpandOutput is choppier for the rest of the year, with increases in some months, but dips in others. Crucially, in December 2018, OPEC is forecasting U.S. oil production at 10.25 mb/d, which is essentially flat compared to current levels.Moreover, it also sees robust demand offsetting some of the concerns about too much supply. OPEC revised up its demand forecast by 60,000 bpd from last month’s report. The group also tried to remind the world that even as U.S. shale continues to rise, so does demand. “Cumulatively, between 2015 and 2017, the world has added around 5 mb/d of demand for oil products on the back of healthy economic conditions globally and a relatively steady product price environment.”For this reason, OPEC still sees a lot of upside in sticking with the cuts and letting the market continue to balance. It will still take some time to drain inventories, especially given the fact that inventories will likely increase in the first half of the year. “In line with the existing overhang, the market is only expected to return to balance towards the end of this year,” OPEC wrote in its February Oil Market Report.At the same time, the threat of new supply from OPEC is also looming just over the horizon. Compliance remains strong — OPEC production in January was mostly unchanged from December levels — and by all indications, compliance should remain elevated.Yet, as S&P Global Platts notes, OPEC members are gearing up for increases in production capacity as the oil market continues to move closer to balance. They may not ratchet up output just yet, but they are beginning to signal their future plans to do so.For example, Kuwait’s oil minister recently stated that his country’s capacity would rise to 3.225 mb/d, compared to its current 3 mb/d. Iran’s oil minister promised (threatened?) to add 100,000 bpd within days after the expiration of the OPEC agreement. UAE hopes to add 500,000 bpd of capacity over the course of this year. Finally, Iraq has a goal of having the ability to export 5 mb/d by the end of 2018.""We will not wait until the excess inventories get to zero before we do something if needed,"" one source told S&P Global Platts.  Related: Oil Prices: Collapse Now, Spike LaterTo be sure, these are capacity additions, not production. The output will likely remain on the sidelines as long as OPEC continues to work together and the supply curbs are kept in place. But as S&P Global Platts argues, the mere fact that more officials from these key oil-producing countries are advertising their pending capacity additions could signal an eagerness to ramp up production.The comments come as several oil market analysts have warned that OPEC could overtighten the market. Goldman Sachs recently argued that the market is probably already balanced, and that because inventory data is published on a several-month delay, OPEC might end up draining inventories below the five-year average. That could send prices up by summer, when demand is at a seasonal peak.Overall, the OPEC report is not nearly as bearish as the corresponding reports from the IEA and EIA, and the group offers a “stay-the-course” mantra in the face of surging shale supply, predicting a rebalancing later this year.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Unfazed-As-Rivals-Boost-Oil-Output.html,"Feb 12, 2018 at 16:27 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 12, 2018",OPEC Unfazed As Rivals Boost Oil Output
2018-02-12,"The budget deal that the U.S. Congress passed and President Donald Trump signed into law last Friday calls for selling 100 million barrels of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) by 2027 to help fund the government.The sale of 100 million barrels of crude oil in the next decade would represent the largest non-emergency sell-off of strategic oil reserves and would equate to some 15 percent of the current stockpiles in the SPR.The mandate for the SPR sale has drawn criticism because, some experts say, it would blunt the purpose of the strategic reserve to mitigate major global oil supply disruptions or price shocks. Other critics have said that tapping the emergency oil reserve for non-energy needs of the government is short-sighted, and that the SPR should not be used as a “government ATM.”The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 mandates the Secretary of Energy to draw down and sell from the SPR a total of 30 million barrels of crude oil between fiscal years 2022 and 2025; another 35 million barrels during fiscal year 2026; and additional 35 million barrels in fiscal year 2027. In addition, under a budget deal from 2015, the Secretary of Energy is authorized to draw down up to US$350 million worth of crude oil from the SPR in the 2018 fiscal year to use for modernization of the reserve.The budget deal also reduces the minimum required level in the reserve under which no drawdowns can be made, to 350 million barrels from 450 million barrels.According to the Congressional Budget Office, the sale of the 100 million barrels from the SPR would generate US$6.36 billion between 2018 and 2027.As of February 2, 2018, the SPR held a total of 665.1 million barrels of crude oil, while the current storage capacity is 713.5 million barrels, according to the Department of Energy. The average price paid for oil in the Reserve is $29.70 per barrel.  Related: Tesla’s Powerpack: Real Hope Or Mostly Hype?After the sale authorized last week will be completed by 2027, the SPR would hold 406 million barrels of oil, equal to around 56 percent of its capacity, according to DoE estimates quoted by Platts.Kevin Book, managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, told Platts that the 100-million-barrel sale was “a resounding declaration of lawmakers’ new perspective on energy security.”But Book also told Bloomberg that “This is nothing short of liquidation of a safety net.”Current and past energy officials also criticized the proposal for the largest non-emergency strategic oil sale in U.S. history.Energy Undersecretary Mark Menezes told Bloomberg in an interview that the SPR was not designed to serve as “a government ATM.”“My own view is that SPR was put in place as an energy security mechanism to ensure that we had supply,” Menezes noted.Bob McNally, president of consultancy Rapidan Energy Group and a former senior energy official at the White House under President George W. Bush, told Bloomberg that “Selling the SPR to cover non-energy budget expenses is deeply short-sighted and unwise.”  Related: Goldman: Investors Grow Wary Of Another Oil Price Rally“In 1996 and 1997 we sold SPR barrels to pay for unrelated budget expenses and I was in the White House when we put those barrels back at higher prices starting about five years later, after 9/11,” McNally said.“Geopolitical risk is alive and well in the oil market, and the SPR is America’s only formal short-term line of defense against oil supply disruptions and price spikes,” Robbie Diamond, president of Securing America’s Future Energy, told Bloomberg.While the proposed sale of 100 million barrels of the SPR may be a bet on America’s energy independence and security in the next decade, it is also raising concern that it could diminish the U.S. ability to respond to sudden major outages of oil supply as geopolitical woes are back on the oil market.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Mandates-Biggest-Non-Emergency-Strategic-Oil-Selloff.html,"Feb 12, 2018 at 14:23 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 12, 2018",U.S. Mandates Biggest Non-Emergency Strategic Oil Selloff
2018-02-12,"We recently discussed Iraqi flows to the U.S., and how they continue to exhibit strength. Iraqi flows to the U.S. last year averaged just under 600,000 bpd, up a third from 2016's volume. While January deliveries were robust, clambering above 700,000 bpd, they were even more impressive to Asia, rising to a record.Loadings from southern Iraq are the driving force behind the record. Exports from the Kurdish region of northern Iraq still remain in check amid conflict in the area (hark, averaging under 300,000 bpd for the last three months). Also, flows from northern Iraq only head to Europe and the eastern Mediterranean.It has been loadings from Basrah instead, and particularly a pick-up in Basrah Heavy into India, which has helped propel Asian deliveries to a record:(Click to enlarge) We can see from our ClipperData that Iraq sends crude into a number ( --> 8 <-- ) of different Asian countries, but it has been flows to India and China where we have seen the biggest pick up. Between the two, imports reached over two million barrels per day last month, with India climbing to the highest on our records at 1.2mn bpd, over 50 percent above last year's average. China was no slouch either, importing a quarter more crude in January than last year's average.  Related: Oil Majors Optimistic Despite Price PlungeOver 70 percent of deliveries went to three refineries in India: Essar's Vadinar refinery, Reliance's Jamnagar refinery and Indian Oil's Paradip refinery. As for China, a good chunk (~50 percent) flowed to Sinopec facilities in central China.Iraq continues to focus its export efforts on Asia. It has cut its March official selling price for Basrah Light into Asia by 35 cents versus February, to 40 cents less than the Oman/Dubai average. This puts Basrah Light at its widest discount to Saudi Arabian crude since April 2016. It has also lowered the price of Basrah Heavy, down 45 cents to a $4.20/bbl discount versus Oman/Dubai's average.(Click to enlarge)While crude from northern Iraq typically heads into Europe and the eastern Mediterranean, we still see a good chunk of crude from the southern part of the country (a.k.a., Basrah Light and Basrah Heavy) also heading that way too.Deliveries averaged about 440,000 bpd last year - heading to more countries in Europe than Asia. January is seasonally a strong month for deliveries into Europe from southern Iraq, and this month is no different, with 540,000 bpd discharged there last month. Although flows dropped to the Netherlands, France received its first crude in eight months, with deliveries of Basrah Heavy to both Lavera's teminal in Fos sur Mer and CIM's Le Havre terminal.(Click to enlarge) By Matt SmithMore Top Reads From oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iraq-Boosts-Asian-Oil-Exports-To-New-Record.html,"Feb 12, 2018 at 12:29 | Matt Smith","Feb 12, 2018",Iraq Boosts Asian Oil Exports To New Record
2018-02-12,"OPEC’s total crude oil production averaged 32.30 million bpd in January, down by 8,100 bpd from December, as rising production in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Libya did not fully offset another massive plunge in Venezuela’s production and a small decline in Angola.According to OPEC’s Monthly Oil Market Report published on Monday, secondary sources—the ones the cartel uses to monitor compliance and official stats—pegged Venezuela’s crude oil production in January 2018 at 1.600 million bpd, down by 47,300 bpd compared to December 2017. This was the largest monthly decline in oil production among OPEC’s 14 member states. Venezuela, allowed to pump as much as 1.972 million bpd under the deal, surely did not make that cut voluntarily—its economy is collapsing and oil production has been in freefall for months now.  OPEC’s secondary sources’ estimate is lower than last week’s survey by one of those sources—S&P Global Platts—which had estimated that Venezuela’s production dropped to 1.64 million bpd in January.Venezuela, for its part, self-reported to OPEC that its oil production last month increased by 148,300 bpd over December to 1.769 million bpd.Among the OPEC members that raised their production, Iraq was the leader with an increase of 30,200 bpd in January over December, to 4.435 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources. This is, yet again, higher than Iraq’s quota under the deal—4.351 million bpd—showing another month in which OPEC’s second-largest producer is either unwilling or unable to comply with the cuts.  Related: Venezuela Is Moving From Crisis To CollapseOPEC’s leading producer Saudi Arabia lifted its January production by 23,300 bpd to 9.977 million bpd—but still below its 10.058-million-bpd quota, overcomplying once again.The third-largest increase among OPEC nations last month came from Libya, whose production rose by 21,000 bpd to 978,000 bpd. Libya and Nigeria—which now have a combined cap of 2.8 million bpd to contribute to the deal after being exempt last year—together were just shy of that ceiling as Nigeria’s production was 1.819 million bpd, according to OPEC’s secondary sources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/OPEC-Production-Steady-In-January-As-Venezuela-Output-Plunges.html,"Feb 12, 2018 at 10:59 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 12, 2018",OPEC Production Steady In January As Venezuela Output Plunges
