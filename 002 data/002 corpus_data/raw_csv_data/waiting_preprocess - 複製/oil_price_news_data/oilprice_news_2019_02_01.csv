2019-02-01,"Police and private security contractors have been quietly preparing to head off protests of a key oil pipeline in the U.S. Midwest in an effort to avoid another Standing Rock.According to The Intercept, Minnesota police have been planning for 18 months in case protestors try to block construction of the Line 3 pipeline. Police and private security contractors have tracked and identified potential protestors and have consulted with law enforcement in North Dakota who busted up the Standing Rock protests. It’s not clear why law enforcement is siding with industry, or why they are surveilling environmental and indigenous groups, but they clearly fear a rerun of the Dakota Access protests that garnered international attention in 2016.The Line 3 replacement, at least to date, has not received nearly as much attention as the Dakota Access Pipeline, Keystone XL, or the Trans Mountain Expansion, for that matter. But the Line 3 replacement is absolutely vital to Enbridge, its owner, and to the Canadian oil sands industry as a whole.The pipeline runs through Ojibwe lands in Minnesota. Opposition has been strong, but so far limited to Ojibwe and local environmental groups. But the issue could yet blow up into another Standing Rock. Private security contractors themselves have “singled out Line 3 as the next likely flashpoint of opposition to a U.S. pipeline project,” according to The Intercept.For good reason. Not only would Line 3 present a threat to indigenous tribes in Minnesota, but it is also a critical project to Canada’s oil industry. Alberta and the Canadian oil industry have struggled for years to push through a single major pipeline project.TransCanada’s Keystone XL has been in limbo for more than a decade. The company’s Energy East pipeline, which would have run across much of North America from Alberta to Canada’s East Coast, was scrapped two years ago.  Related: Oil Rises 18% In Best January On RecordThe Trans Mountain Expansion was supposed to be the project with the highest odds for completion, particularly since it was a twin line along an existing pipeline and not a greenfield project. But that project ran into a brick wall last year when Kinder Morgan threatened to shelve it, only to have the Canadian government bailout the company by essentially nationalizing the project. As of now, the pipeline’s fortunes are still unclear.That puts incredible importance on Line 3 as the salvation for Canada’s oil sands. Because of the pipeline bottlenecks, Western Canada Select (WCS), an oil benchmark that tracks heavy oil from Canada, suffered enormous price discounts. Late last year, WCS temporarily traded at a greater-than $40-per-barrel discount to WTI, which meant that WCS traded as low as $15 per barrel.With pipelines maxed out and WCS prices crashing, the provincial government in Alberta instituted mandatory production cuts. Just days ago, Alberta partially lifted the mandatory curtailments because WCS prices have rebounded. A surge in crude-by-rail shipments have helped – rail shipments were up 88 percent in October compared to a year earlier, according to the Wall Street Journal. The crisis in Venezuela and the U.S. government’s efforts at regime change have also pushed up heavy crude prices in Canada.However, rail is costly and ultimately is only a partial and temporary solution. Alberta needs a new pipeline if the province is to see its oil industry grow. The Line 3 replacement project is a roughly $C9 billion overhaul of an aging existing line. Replacing the more than 1,000-mile pipeline would restore its capacity to 760,000 bpd. As such, it’s hard to overstate the importance of the project to Canada’s oil industry. With Energy East dead, Trans Mountain Expansion on life support, and Keystone XL still up in the air, the Line 3 pipeline is the only significant increase in midstream capacity for the next few years at least.With much of the construction already completed, the replacement – including construction through Minnesota – is expected to be completed later this year. It’s no wonder that the industry, and apparently its allies in U.S. law enforcement, are desperate to avoid any delays that might crop up from a sudden outburst of protests.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadas-Most-Crucial-Pipeline-Comes-Under-Fire.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 17:00 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 01, 2019",Canada’s Most Crucial Pipeline Comes Under Fire
2019-02-01,"U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures are trading higher on Friday with the market hovering slightly below highs not seen since November 21.The market is being boosted by optimism over the higher-level trade talks between the United States and China that were completed on January 31. Also underpinning the market is strong adherence to the OPEC-led supply cuts during January.Prices are also being supported on Friday by a stronger-than-expected headline payrolls number that indicates strength in the labor market and solid ISM Manufacturing PMI data, which indicates strong factor demand.Throughout the week, a number of events fueled a two-sided trade including a tightening of U.S. supply and the announcements of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela. Weak manufacturing PMI data from China also weighed on prices as well as a dovish outlook by the U.S. Federal Reserve.Positive Spin on U.S. – China Trade TalksHelping to support prices late in the week is the upbeat tone in the markets following the two-day high level trade talks between the United States and China.On Thursday, President Trump said he would meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping soon to try to seal a comprehensive trade deal as the top U.S. negotiator reported “substantial progress” in the two days of high-level talks, CNBC said.OPEC and its Allies are Following Through on Their PledgeWTI prices rose to a two month high on Thursday after…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Momentum-Is-Building-For-Oil.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 16:53 | Jim Hyerczyk","Feb 01, 2019",Momentum Is Building For Oil
2019-02-01,"Baker Hughes, a GE company sees a bright year ahead for its businesses, underpinned by solid growth in key oil and gas regions like the Middle East and the North Sea and an acceleration of liquefied natural gas (LNG) project approvals.Unlike its closest competitors Schlumberger and Halliburton, Baker Hughes has less exposure to the softening in the North American pressure pump drilling market. So the GE company provided an upbeat outlook for 2019—brighter than the forecasts of its rivals—when it announced 2018 figures this week.Baker Hughes reported growing revenues in Q4 and in 2018, and adjusted earnings per share of US$0.26 in Q4, matching the analyst consensus estimate provided by The Wall Street Journal.“In the fourth quarter, we achieved $6.9 billion in orders, our largest orders quarter in almost 3 years, with sequential growth in all four of our business segments,” BHGE Chairman, President, and CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said.These segments are Oilfield Services, Oilfield Equipment, Turbomachinery & Process Solutions (TPS), and Digital Solutions.Like Schlumberger and Halliburton, Baker Hughes admitted that the oil price slump in the fourth quarter last year resulted in a considerable decline in completions activity across North America.“U.S. production surprised the upside and we saw completions activity in North America, specifically in the Permian dropped significantly,” Simonelli said on the earnings call.Related: The Only Way For The Aramco IPO Is Downstream“The areas most impacted by the recent steep decline in crude prices are the more traditional transactional markets in the U.S. and Canada. We expect the activity slowdown and pricing deteriorations in these markets in the first half of 2019 to negatively impact our well construction product lines. We expect the market for artificial lift and production chemicals to remain stable,” the manager noted.While Baker Hughes’ outlook on the immediate future of the North American market is surely not bright, analysts at Evercore ISI remind that the GE company has limited exposure to the pressure pumping market in North America.This year, Baker Hughes sees the biggest opportunities for its businesses in expected solid growth in the Middle East and the North Sea and more LNG projects, for which the company aims to provide its turbomachinery solutions.“Given the continued strong demand dynamics, likely project sanctioning is accelerating faster than we previously anticipated. We now see an opportunity for considerably more LNG projects reaching FID in 2019, including the recently announced LNG Canada project we see the potential for up to 100 million tons per annum of new capacity to be sanctioned by the end of 2019,” Simonelli said on the conference call, noting that more LNG projects being approved is “good news for BHGE.”BHGE secured an award to provide modular turbocompressor technology for LNG Canada’s liquefaction plant in Kitimat, British Columbia, the largest LNG project to reach a positive FID globally since 2014 and the first large-scale LNG project to use modular liquefaction trains, Baker Hughes said.Related: Oil Rallies As Saudis Cut Exports To The U.S.For this year, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie shares Baker Hughes’ bullish view on LNG projects. This year could be a record year for LNG project approvals, with more than 60 mmtpa of capacity likely taking FID, beating the previous 45 mmtpa record from 2005 and tripling the 21 mmtpa sanctioned in 2018, WoodMac says.Before Baker Hughes’ earnings release, its two bigger competitors—more exposed to the North American shale drilling market—had announced financials beating estimates, but both Schlumberger and Halliburton had to rely on the solid recovery of their international business to offset the softer North American market in Q4.Halliburton reported a Q4 net income beating analyst estimates, as continued recovery in its international business more than offset lower North American demand. In Q4, demand for completion services in North America— Halliburton’s biggest market by revenue—dropped as operators focus on returns, the company said.Schlumberger, for its part, said that it expects North America’s E&P operators to likely keep future investments much closer to a level that can be covered by free cash flow, while companies in international markets except for the Middle East and Russia “are starting to see the need to invest in their resource base simply to maintain production at current levels.”  Baker Hughes, with less exposure to North America, sees a brighter year ahead, thanks to growth in the key international oil and gas markets and an expected bumper year for LNG project approvals.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Baker-Hughes-Upbeat-About-2019.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 16:51 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 01, 2019",Baker Hughes Upbeat About 2019
2019-02-01,"Global deepwater liquid production is set to jump by 700,000 bpd from 2018 to reach a record-high of 10.3 million bpd in 2019, thanks to new fields coming on stream in Brazil and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, research firm Rystad Energy said on Friday.In addition to Brazil and the United States, the other biggest deepwater producers will be Angola, Norway, and Nigeria, according to Rystad.For the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie expects “a historic year” in 2019, with Shell’s Appomattox marking the first production ever from a Jurassic reservoir in the Gulf of Mexico. Drilling in the area is also set to post the first increase in four years and new projects are expected to be sanctioned, according to WoodMac.Operators have driven down the cost of developing new deepwater barrels by more than 50 percent since 2013, Wood Mackenzie said in November.According to the consultancy’s data and analysis, the most competitive region for deepwater is the Americas, and in particular Brazil, Guyana, and the Gulf of Mexico. In those areas, more than 50 billion boe of pre- and post-sanction deepwater developments are now profitable below an oil price of US$60 a barrel, based on break-even costs.The industry has started to increase investments in deepwater after the downturn, encouraged by the cost cuts and realizing that offshore resources would be important for meeting demand growth, WoodMac said.The consultancy sees global annual capital expenditure (capex) on deepwater rising to around US$60 billion by 2022 from some US$50 billion currently, driven by big projects in Guyana, Brazil, and Mozambique.The higher spending on deepwater, however, will lead to cost inflation, which may end the cost reduction streak for exploration and production companies, WoodMac warned.“We believe that many cost savings are not as 'sticky' as industry suggests, and are sceptical that many will stand the test of time during a sustained cyclical uptick,” Wood Mackenzie research director Angus Rodger said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Global-Deepwater-Oil-Production-To-Hit-New-Record-In-2019.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 14:10 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 01, 2019",Global Deepwater Oil Production To Hit New Record In 2019
2019-02-01,"Baker Hughes reported a sharp drop in the number of active oil and gas rigs in the United States this week.The total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs fell by 14 rigs, according to the report, with the number of active oil rigs falling by 15 to reach 847 and the number of gas rigs increasing by 1 to reach 198.The oil and gas rig count is now 99 up from this time last year, 82 of which is in oil rigs.Oil prices were trading up earlier on Friday as fears heightened over what some see as tight oil supplies with Venezuela’s oil-industry prospects look increasingly dim while OPEC seems content with its current scaling back of production despite those concerns. A further tailwind for oil prices came late on Thursday as President Donald Trump suggested there would be further efforts made to resolve the trade conflict with China, “leaving NOTHING unresolved on the table,” Trump said in a Thursday tweet.At 12:04pm EST, the WTI benchmark was trading up $0.82 (+1.52%) at $54.61—a roughly $1 increase from last week, with Brent crude trading up $1.17 (+1.92%) at $62.01 per barrel—up less than $1 per barrel on the week.  Canada’s oil and gas rigs increased by 11 rigs this week. Canada’s total oil and gas rig count is now 243, which is 99 fewer rigs than this time last year.The EIA’s estimates for US production for the week ending January 25 shows an increase at an average rate of 11.9 million bpd­—a record for the US—for the third week in a row.By 1:07pm EDT, WTI had increased by 2.06% (+$1.11) at $54.90 on the day.

2019-02-01,"Driven by its significant investment in Guyana, ExxonMobil is leader of the pack among the top oil and gas explorers of 2018, according to Rystad Energy’s annual exploration review.“ExxonMobil was exceptional, both in terms of discovered volumes and value creation from exploration,” said Rystad Energy head of upstream research Espen Erlingsen.Erlingsen added:“Last year, Rystad Energy witnessed the revival of offshore exploration activity. Improved market conditions and operational efficiencies, along with sustained cost deflation, allowed many E&P players to move forward with promising high impact exploration campaigns in 2018.”To measure performance, Rystad Energy looked at the number of exploration wells, net discovered resources and the value creation from wildcat exploration (wells drilled in new prospects) during 2018.In 2018, the US supermajor ExxonMobil drilled 2.7 net wildcat wells in Guyana, and discovered close to 2 billion barrels in additional gross resources in the Stabroek block (which includes the giant Liza discovery). These volumes are extremely valuable, as they will add to the large existing development solution in this region.Hess and CNOOC come in at second and third place in terms of value creation in 2018. However, both are partners in ExxonMobil’s Stabroek block, and have therefore benefitted from the Guyana success as well.Total ranks as the second best oil major, having created about $2.2 billion in valuation from 2018 exploration. The company had particular success in the US Gulf of Mexico (Ballymore), the UKSavannah Petroleum was the company with the highest value creation per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) last year thanks to its work in Africa. Rystad Energy estimates the resources discovered in Niger Block R3/R4 have a net present value of more than $10 per boe.Russian independent Novatek that had the greatest amount of discovered resources in 2018, at 935 million boe. Novatek’s volumes stem from the North Obskoye discovery in the Kara Sea.“Top E&P companies registered many exploration successes in 2018, as majors and minnows alike made significant discoveries, but ExxonMobil was exceptional,” Erlingsen added.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/ExxonMobil-Leads-In-Exploration-Successes-In-2018.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 09:55 | Rystad Energy ","Feb 01, 2019",ExxonMobil Leads In Exploration Successes In 2018
2019-02-01,"China’s independent refiners—typically known as ‘teapots’—imported a combined 2.72 million bpd of crude oil in January, down by 8.7 percent from December, a monthly S&P Global Platts survey of smaller refiners showed on Friday.The January imports of the independent refiners jumped by 27.7 percent compared to January 2018, but according to a source at the Qingdao port, several vessels originally scheduled to discharge the crude in late December were held up by logistical bottlenecks until January.The Platts survey from last month showed that the December imports of the independent refiners increased by 5.6 percent from November as the teapots were rushing to utilize their crude oil import quotas allocated by the Chinese state for 2018. Yet the smaller refiners failed to use up the quotas, according to the survey.For 2019, China issued in early January the first batch of crude import quotas, and they were lower than last year’s first batch. According to analysts, the quotas in the second batch, typically issued around September, could be higher. The basis for the 2019 quotas allocation was the use of the quotas between January and October 2018. During that period, independent refiners had used 71 percent of their quotas, Seng Yick Tee, an analyst with Beijing-based consultancy SIA Energy, told Reuters.In early January, independent refiners had slowed down purchases for delivery in January and February, because Chinese demand for fuel is generally lower during the Lunar New Year holiday, which this year falls next week.In recent weeks, however, teapots have started to buy more crude that will arrive in China in March and April, as independent refiners are looking to buy more crude for March and April delivery to restock supplies while oil prices are still relatively low. The buying in recent weeks has pushed up spot premiums for the independent refiners’ favorite crude grades from Russia, Oman, Africa, and Europe to between $0.50 and $1 higher than quotes from early January, according to Reuters' trade sources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Platts-Chinese-Independent-Refiners-Import-Less-Crude-In-January.html,"Feb 01, 2019 at 08:05 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 01, 2019",Platts: Chinese Independent Refiners Import Less Crude In January
