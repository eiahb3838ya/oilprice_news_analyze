2018-01-10,"This time last year, the oilfield service sector started showing the first signs of hope and optimism after the OPEC/Russia deal to cut crude oil production by 1.8 million bpd lifted prices to levels last seen years earlier.In the first five months of 2017, five oilfield services providers filed for an initial public offering, overtaking exploration and production listings by a wide margin, signaling returning optimism in the sector thanks to improved oil prices. The value of the five listings was also impressive: at $1.36 billion it surpassed the total raised through listings in 2013, when oil was trading at almost $100 a barrel. And yet some of the listings flopped, with the companies trading much lower than their issue price.Now prices are even higher than they were at the beginning of 2017. There is much stronger demand for fracking and maintenance services, and two companies that last year postponed plans for an IPO are now preparing to try again. One other fracking services provider, Liberty Oilfield Services, took the plunge and early this month announced the terms of its IPO, planning to offer 10.7 million shares and eyeing proceeds of up to $161 million.The other two still standing on the springboard are FTS International and Nine Energy Service. Reuters notes in a recent story that late last year, both FTS and Nine Energy amended the terms of their initial filings, leading analysts to suggest that they may be preparing to give listing another try despite last year’s lukewarm interest from investors that led Nine Energy and another IPO hopeful, BJ Services, to shelve their listing plans. At the time, last May, BJ Services eyed proceeds of $300 million and Nine Energy planned to pocket $100 million from its IPO.

As one oil analyst told Bloomberg’s Alex Barinka in May 2017, oilfield services is a very general term that includes a wide variety of different things, from fracking to sand and water supply. It’s difficult to navigate the complex landscape, so investors are staying with the big names, which just became bigger after GE’s takeover of Baker Hughes. According to Rob Thummel, the newcomers on the capital market would need to convince potential investors that there is something that distinguishes them from the herd.EIA’s latest Short-Term Energy Outlook could help with investor sentiment: The authority has forecast that U.S. crude oil production will hit its highest average daily in history this year, at 10.3 million barrels, and it only continue to grow from there, eventually reaching 11 million bpd in late 2019. This will need a lot of wells drilled and fracked, and that’s where the independents could come in.The only risk is, of course, the oil price. For now, the going is good with Brent almost touching $70 a barrel and WTI firmly climbing towards $65 a barrel, so drillers can afford the now much more expensive services of Nine Energy, BJ Services, and their likes. But how long will the good going keep?Saudi Arabia and Russia are no doubt watching U.S. shale developments like hawks, biding their time to pick the best moment to exit the production cut deal. Certainly, neither of them would be particularly happy when prices fall—which they will—but they might decide to risk this instead of having the U.S. produce 11 million barrels daily without doing something about it such as, you know, turning their own taps on full-blast.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Expect-A-New-Wave-of-Oilfield-Service-IPOs-In-2018.html,"Jan 10, 2018 at 14:29 | Irina Slav","Jan 10, 2018",Expect A New Wave Of Oilfield Service IPOs In 2018
2018-01-10,"OPEC’s oil production and supply cuts—now in their second year—have claimed a victim. It’s an industry that’s vital for the crude oil exports of oil-producing countries: supertanker shipping.The supertankers, or very large crude carriers (VLCCs), are vessels capable of carrying around two million barrels of oil. As OPEC and its non-OPEC allies work to remove a combined 1.8 million bpd off the market to draw down the global glut, the number of supertankers voyaging from the Middle East to Asia, for example, has dropped.This decreased demand coincides with a period of new-build vessels being delivered and adding to the global supertanker fleet, thus creating an excess supply of supertankers at a time when crude oil trade out of the Middle East is down. Moreover, the oil futures market is currently in backwardation (the situation in which front-month prices are higher than those for months further in the future), which makes hoarding oil in supertankers at sea uneconomical and frees more vessels, adding to the overcapacity of the global fleet.All these factors led to a slump in supertanker average daily earnings in 2017, to their lowest since 2009 and to below initial analyst expectations.According to Clarkson Research, the average VLCCs earnings dropped to $17,794 per day in 2017, from $41,888 in 2016, a 57.5-percent slump. The average 2017 earnings were the lowest since at least 2009, according to Clarkson data cited by Bloomberg.  Just before the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts began in January 2017, analysts had revised down in December 2016 their forecasts for tanker earnings by 12 percent for 2017, expecting the worst year since 2013.As it turned out, 2017 was the worst year for VLCC earnings since at least 2009.Related: The World’s Most Expensive OilProspects for the supertanker market in 2018 are also grim, especially if OPEC and allies decide at their June meeting to stick to the production cuts until the end of this year. The cartel and its friends will be reviewing mid-year the state of the oil market, and might choose to revisit the cuts if they see the market has balanced.On top of that, newly built tankers will continue to add to the global fleet in 2018, albeit at a slower pace than in the past two years. Clarkson Research has estimated that the world’s supertanker fleet will grow by 4 percent in 2018, following 5.3-percent growth in 2017 and a 7.4-percent increase in 2016.“If OPEC lifts the output cut in its revision in June, the rates would improve as more oil will be pumped to the market,” Olivier Jakob, managing director at Switzerland-based Petromatrix, said in an interview for Bloomberg. “But if it doesn’t, then the rates would suffer the whole year,” Jakob noted.Overcapacity will continue to suppress any material improvement in the global shipping industry in 2018, Fitch Ratings said in a report last month.  “The tanker shipping segment is the most exposed following a glut of new vessel deliveries in 2017. We expect demand for tankers to grow by around 4 percent in 2018, helped by rising global oil consumption, higher U.S. exports and declining oil inventories,” Fitch said. “But this would still only broadly match the expected growth in tanker supply. Rates therefore may not fall further, but a sustained increase is unlikely,” the rating agency added.  According to shipping industry association BIMCO: “Not until we see global oil stocks at a much lower level, can we expect a renewed interest in seaborne oil trading activities that will lift oil tanker demand from its current subdued level. However, the first half of 2018 may pass by before that happens.”BIMCO expects tanker demand growth this year to continue last year’s trend—growing imports in the Far East and growing exports from the U.S. This is set to benefit the VLCC market and to some extent Suezmax tankers, the association said in its preview for the 2018 market.    Related: Oil Prices Slip After Lower Than Expected Crude DrawTanker fleet growth is expected to slow down, and demand for OPEC crude oil is expected to increase in the second half of this year, Eirik Haavaldsen at investment bank Pareto Securities told Bloomberg.“The first half will be weak though, and probably weaker than the first half of 2017,” Haavaldsen said.The supertanker industry is in for another challenging year amid fleet oversupply and OPEC crude oil undersupply.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Biggest-Loser-Of-The-OPEC-Deal.html,"Jan 10, 2018 at 14:11 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 10, 2018",The Biggest Loser Of The OPEC Deal
2018-01-10,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute took markets by surprise with a massive, 11-million-barrel inventory draw, the Energy Information Administration reported the draw was actually much smaller, at 4.9 million barrels.Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Platts had forecast a draw of 3.5 million barrels, with gasoline stockpiles seen to have increased by 2.3 million barrels in the first week of January. Gasoline stockpiles, according to the EIA rose by a hefty 4.1 million barrels in the reporting period.The analysts noted that a build in fuel inventories is usual for this time of year, but this time it was likely to be smaller than usual because of the unusually cold weather. Still, gasoline inventories in the prior week, to December 29, 2017, rose by 4.8 million barrels.The EIA also said that refineries processed 17.3 million barrels of crude daily in the week to January 5, producing 9.5 million barrels of gasoline, versus 9.7 million bpd in the last week of December 2017, which should explain the gasoline build.A day before the release of the weekly inventory figures, the EIA shook markets with the latest edition of its Short-Term Energy Outlook, in which the authority forecast U.S. oil production would reach 10.3 million barrels daily this year and rise further to 11 million bpd in late 2019. This would make the country the world’s largest crude oil producer, as long as Saudi Arabia and Russia continue pumping at their current levels.The EIA also revised upwards its global oil demand outlook by 100,000 bpd that helped push prices higher even before the release of the API estimate.When the EIA released the weekly inventory figures, WTI was trading at US$63.35 a barrel, up by 0.62 percent. Brent crude was changing hands at $69.00, up 0.26 percent.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Slip-After-Slower-Than-Expected-Crude-Draw.html,"Jan 10, 2018 at 09:44 | Irina Slav","Jan 10, 2018",Oil Prices Slip After Lower Than Expected Crude Draw
