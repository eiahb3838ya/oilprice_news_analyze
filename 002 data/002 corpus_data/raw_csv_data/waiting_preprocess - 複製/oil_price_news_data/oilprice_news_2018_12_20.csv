2018-12-20,"Even before the latest oil price plunge that sent WTI Crude prices to below $50 a barrel, analysts had expected the explosive growth in the U.S. shale patch to cool off a bit next year - at least until the Permian pipeline constraints ease in the latter half of 2019.U.S. shale is set to continue to raise crude oil production, but as WTI prices dipped to below the psychologically important threshold of $50 a barrel, analysts started to calculate which areas may have already fallen into the red with spot prices lower than breakevens.To be sure, U.S. oil production is expected to continue to increase next year, but the longer the U.S. benchmark oil price stays below or around $50, the slower the growth will be.This week’s fresh price plunge could make more U.S. shale drillers cut capital expenditure for next year and more of them may cut deeper, considering that few had anticipated such a steep drop in oil prices just two and a half months ago, when WTI was above $70 when the market feared a supply crunch due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran.Yet, even in the face of this week’s plunge that sent WTI below $50, some analysts say that the glory days for U.S. shale are not over.“In short, as much as the recent price slump has injected a fresh dose of uncertainty, it is unlikely to derail the U.S. shale engine,” according to Stephen Brennock, oil analyst at PVM Oil Associates. “The fact is that U.S. tight oil supply is expected to expand by at least 1 million bpd in 2019. In doing so, it will go a long way to cementing America’s newfound position as the world's biggest oil producer,” CNBC quoted a Wednesday research note by Brennock as saying. “For now, when it comes to the U.S. shale patch, the glory days are far from over,” said Brennock.

In the monthly Drilling Productivity Report from this week, the EIA estimates that the seven shale areas will boost their combined production by 134,000 bpd from December to 8.166 million bpd in January, with the Permian leading the way, followed by the Eagle Ford and the Bakken.In this month’s Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), EIA sees total U.S. crude oil production averaging 10.9 million bpd in 2018, up from 9.4 million bpd in 2017, and expects crude production to average 12.1 million bpd in 2019.If oil prices stay stubbornly low, however, the current forecast of 1.2-million-bpd production growth next year may be too optimistic. Many wells in the Permian may still be in the profit at below-$50 oil, but many others outside top-tier acreage—which were easily making money with $60 oil—won’t. Areas in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford will also struggle with oil in the low $50s or below.This week, while WTI at Cushing is above $45, the price of WTI Midland in the heart of the Permian slumped to $40.Even before the latest major price correction, analysts had expected U.S. shale drillers to scale back capital budgets for 2019, considering that the price slump could restrain cash flow generation at a time when investors push for more returns at the expense of oil production growth.Just this week, Diamondback Energy announced its 2019 capital and production guidance, which reflects “an operating plan focused on disciplined growth within cash flow and a growing dividend in the current commodity price environment.” Diamondback plans to operate between 18 and 22 drilling rigs, compared to 24 operated drilling rigs today, reducing rig count by three rigs immediately, the company said on Tuesday.

As a result, and as a sign of our commitment to capital discipline, we are reducing our planned 2019 activity to levels where we can operate within cash flow,” Diamondback’s CEO Travis Stice said, noting that future activity will depend on the commodity price trend in 2019.According to Francisco Blanch, head of global commodity and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, WTI Crude will average $59 a barrel next year, which would be sufficient to warrant U.S. shale growth of 1.2 million bpd-1.3 million bpd.“If we stay at these levels around $50 a barrel WTI, we’re going to grow sub-1 million barrels a day,” Blanch told CNBC this week.U.S. shale will still grow next year, but the oil price range will determine the pace of that growth.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/50-Oil-Wont-Kill-US-Shale.html,"Dec 20, 2018 at 15:40 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 20, 2018",$50 Oil Won’t Kill U.S. Shale
2018-12-20,"U.S. pipeline infrastructure is more vulnerable to cyberattacks than desirable because of insufficient oversight in the cybersecurity department, a report commissioned by two members of Congress has suggested.Reuters reported this week that the report, requested by Senator Maria Cantwell and Representative Frank Pallone and conducted by the General Accountability Office, revealed the Transport Security Administration, a unit of Homeland Security, does not have a procedure in place that can be used to update cybersecurity standards for pipelines. These updates are necessary to reflect revisions in cybersecurity standards that are seen by experts in the field as essential.Indeed, the cybersecurity field is a very dynamic one, with attackers unfortunately proving repeatedly they are not just keeping up with cybersecurity efforts but sometimes even being a step ahead of them. This is what necessitates updates to existing standards, and an update implementation procedure that makes for fast adoption of these updates.Oil and gas pipelines are critical infrastructure and as such they are among the top targets of cybercriminals, according to experts. What the report by the GAO found was that the Transport Security Administration trusted pipeline operators to evaluate their networks and report whether they have critical facilities that could become a target for cybercriminals.That’s not good enough to say the least: the TSA collected the self-evaluations in order to classify parts of operator’s networks as more or less vulnerable, but it turned out that as much as a 33 percent of the operators of the 100 biggest pipeline systems in the United States denied having critical facilities. What’s more, the Transport Security Administration did not verify the information supplied by pipeline operators.“Protecting our pipelines, and the people who live and work near them, must be a top priority for our government and I hope this report will prompt the Trump administration to start treating this challenge with the urgency it deserves,” Senator Cantwell said in a release following the report.  Related: Major LNG Shortage Increasingly LikelyPipeline cybersecurity is certainly a top concern, especially with the growing automation and digitization of various functions that gives cybercriminals more potential entry points into a network. Work is being done but, if we are to believe the GAO report, not enough, which is the case for other industries as well in the opinion of most cybersecurity professionals.Still, earlier this month, the Transport Security Administration released a Cybersecurity Roadmap that covered all transportation sectors, including pipelines. In a recent overview of the situation in Lexology, Norma M. Krayem noted that unlike other comparable industries, pipeline networks have so many agencies overseeing them, a debate about which of them should be in charge of cybersecurity has slowed down the actual implementation of cybersecurity measures.The roadmap, Krayem said, was the document that put an end to the debate: the TSA is the agency in charge of the cybersecurity and physical security of pipeline systems, so that’s one thing that is settled. Now, what remains is the more important task: put actual cybersecurity standards and procedures in place to secure this part of the U.S. critical infrastructure.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/A-Shocking-Amount-Of-Crucial-US-Pipelines-Still-Lack-Cybersecurity.html,"Dec 20, 2018 at 12:59 | Irina Slav","Dec 20, 2018",A Shocking Amount Of Crucial U.S. Pipelines Still Lack Cybersecurity
