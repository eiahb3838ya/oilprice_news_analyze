2018-11-20,"Wood Mackenzie isn’t pulling any punches. “The warning signs are there – the industry isn’t finding enough oil.”And its latest report continues in the same ‘spade is a spade’ vein: “A supply gap opens up in the mid-2020s, reaching 3 million b/d by 2030, 9 million b/d by 2035 and a formidable 15 million b/d by 2040. Barring technology breakthrough, we’ll need new oil discoveries.”And then the crucial phrase:“The problem is that the recent rate of commercial volumes found gives little confidence that there will be enough new discoveries to fill the gap.”It warns that the only solution at this stage is a significant hike of at least 20% in annual investment. It unapologetically lays the finger of blame on the gradual reduction in investment during the current cycle.Without a commitment to drive new discoveries, there will be consequences. Prices would of course rocket. Companies’ growth targets would be under the spotlight and would inevitably lead to increased numbers of mergers and acquisitions.However it may even be too late to avoid difficulties altogether. Given that the average length of time between discovery and peak production is the best part of a decade, we’re already running short.But it urges action nonetheless.Firstly: sort out capital availability: “the duty to shareholders’ interests cannot be myopically short-term.” In recent times the focus has shifted from growth to profitability and returns. Energy stocks aren’t what they once were on Wall Street.Next: the reward has to justify the risk. It’s a fact that the checks and balances the industry developed post-crash means greater returns – ‘double-digit...in 2017, the highest for more than a decade.” So exploration is now better placed to deliver ROI.And finally, head to the frontier. At the start it pays tribute to the delivery from Guyana, and names Suriname, Mexico, Senegal, Australia and others are being the “most eagerly watched potential play opening wells”.By Precise ConsultantsMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-It-Too-Late-To-Avoid-An-Oil-Supply-Crisis.html,"Nov 20, 2018 at 14:32 | Precise Consultants ","Nov 20, 2018",Is It Too Late To Avoid An Oil Supply Crisis?
2018-11-20,"Saudi Aramco has changed its mind about a bond sale of about US$40 billion that would have funded the bigger part of its planned acquisition of a majority stake in local petrochemicals giant Sabic. The Wall Street Journal reports that the oil major had been concerned about requirements for disclosure as well as the volatility and uncertain outlook for oil prices, according to unnamed sources familiar with the developments.Aramco announced plans to acquire up to 70 percent of Sabic in a deal expected to be worth about US$70 billion. The seller is the Saudi sovereign wealth find, the Private Investment Fund. The deal would have expanded Aramco’s downstream business substantially, which would have made it more attractive for potential investors if its initial public offering ever took place, which senior officials recently said it would.Yet US$70 billion turned out to be too hefty a price even for the world’s biggest oil company in terms of resources. Talk at the time surrounded Aramco’s plan to use US$20 billion of its own cash and borrow the rest in a combination of various large long-term loans and smaller short-term bridge loans. The shorter-term loans could be replaced with bond issues after a year or a year and a half, several sources told Reuters last month.Yet the public disclosure condition of international bond sales has made Aramco think twice. As the WSJ reports, bond issuing requires disclosure of three years of audited financial results as well as detailing any obstacles that could affect the bond sale. Aramco, however, is notoriously opaque when it comes to financial results and everything else. While its executives have repeatedly made assurances that Aramco would start reporting its financial results and disclose information about its operations ahead of the IPO, now that this has been postponed until 2021 at least, the company seems to not see any need to stick to its disclosure pledge.  Related: The Impending Endgame In Oil MarketsYet disclosure is not the only factor stopping Aramco from tapping international bond markets. The company’s only asset is oil and oil has not been doing so well in the past few weeks. In fact, over the past month, crude oil benchmarks dived down so sharply they lost over a fifth of their value over the four-week period. What must have additionally stung the oil industry in general and Aramco in particular was the fact that virtually everyone expected a price rise during that time as U.S. sanctions against Iran came into effect. Instead, amid assurances, including from Saudi Arabia, that there will be enough oil, prices went the other way.There aren’t many options left for the acquisition of the 70 percent in Sabic. As per a Reuters report from October, a leveraged buyout was also on the table as Aramco discussed strategies with advisers JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley. The other option is debt. And yet the lack of enthusiasm for bond issuance is likely to have reverberations: opening up the Saudi bond market was one facet of the sweeping economic reforms that Crown Prince Mohammed has been pursuing over the last couple of years.What’s more, Aramco’s unwillingness to disclose financial reports and other information is unlikely to sit well with prospective investors, if we assume the IPO is really still an option. This unwillingness, after all, was one of the main factors that caused a rather lukewarm interest among investors during Prince Mohammed’s roadshow the he undertook to promote the IPO. Finally, the combination of unwillingness to disclose information and the uncertainty surrounding oil prices, might make it harder to borrow. True, this is Aramco we’re talking about and Aramco’s reputation means a lot for bankers. Still, after the backlash Saudi Arabia received after the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi—something unthinkable a few years ago—chances are bankers might have become more cautious when approving loans.

2018-11-20,"OPEC will very likely agree to cut oil production at its upcoming meeting in early December, although the size of the cuts is yet to be decided, Ahmed al-Kaabi, Governor for OPEC of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), told the local Al Bayan newspaper on Tuesday.The OPEC-Non-OPEC Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee (JMMC) is still assessing the state of the oil market and will share with the group its findings before the meeting in Vienna on December 6-7, al-Kaabi added.The UAE is committed to comply with any decision of OPEC, the official noted.Two weeks before the meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC partners, speculation has intensified that the cartel and its de facto leader Saudi Arabia may be willing to make another U-turn in oil production policy and decide to cut production next year, just months after increasing output to offset expected losses from Iran and Venezuela.While Saudi Arabia says that there may be a need of cutting oil production by 1 million bpd, Russia—the leader of the non-OPEC partners in the deal—looks more non-committal, at least for the time being. Last week, reports emerged that Russia may prefer to stay out of any fresh oil production cuts.Russia’s only hints to the market so far are that it is discussing potential oil production cuts with local producers and will continue talks to come up with a position by the December meeting, as Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Monday.Despite the flurry of various reports from many sides within the cartel that an OPEC cut is in the making, oil prices plunged on Tuesday morning, depressed by the stock market sell-off and renewed concerns about oil oversupply. WTI Crude was plunging 5.24 percent at $54.20, while Brent Crude was plummeting 4.15 percent at $64.02 at 10:22 a.m. EST.

2018-11-20,"Albertan oil producers need to become warier of overbooking already filled to capacity oil pipelines creating what’s commonly called “air barrels” as these contribute to the huge discount Canadian crude is trading at to WTI and other benchmarks. This is the message from Alberta’s Premier Rachel Notley, as reported by the Calgary Herald.The oil industry in Alberta has been scrambling to find a way out of the discount that has eaten deeply into producers’ bottom lines. Since new pipelines are far from likely to come into operation in the foreseeable future, other options are being considered, including, most recently, deliberately cutting production, OPEC-style, to prop up prices.Producers, however, are divided on this. While Cenovus is all for government-initiated cuts in production, Suncor, an equally large producer, is against it.“We’re probably producing about 200,000 or 300,000 barrels per day of oil in excess of our ability to get that oil out of the province, either by pipelines or by rail,” Cenovus’ CEO Alex Pourbaix told Canadian media earlier this month.On the other hand, “Our position is that government intervention in the market would send the wrong signals to the investment community regarding doing business in Alberta and Canada. And we really do need to take a long-term view and allow the market to operate as it should,” a Suncor spokeswoman said.The provincial government, meanwhile, is considering closer scrutiny of pipeline and railway shipments in order to see which producers are guilty of creating “air barrels”. It could then hold them accountable. The problems with this approach are that it cannot be deployed immediately and that it will have a limited scope, as the provincial government could only give itself the powers to track shipments within Alberta itself.While the industry and the government are trying to come up with some sort of solution to the price problem, Western Canadian Select was trading at US$15.20 a barrel at the time of writing, compared with US$56.96 a barrel for West Texas Intermediate.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Alberta-To-Fight-Air-Barrels-As-Prices-Continue-To-Plunge.html,"Nov 20, 2018 at 09:30 | Irina Slav","Nov 20, 2018",Alberta To Fight “Air Barrels” As Prices Continue To Plunge
