2018-10-03,"Are Saudi Arabia and Russia helping Trump out by agreeing to increase oil production?A new report from Reuters says that Russia and Saudi Arabia “struck a private deal” in September to increase production in order to suppress oil prices. Intriguingly, the pair apparently phoned the U.S. before the Algiers meeting in late September to relay the details of their plan.The report is an indication that Saudi Arabia was trying to respond to pressure from President Trump to lower oil prices. If the White House was informed about the secret private deal, it didn’t seem to resolve Trump’s concerns.Just a few days after the Algiers meeting, Trump blamed OPEC for high oil prices at the UN General Assembly in New York.Also, the secrecy behind the private deal is interesting. It demonstrates that the Saudis do not want to be perceived as doing Trump’s bidding. “The Russians and the Saudis agreed to add barrels to the market quietly with a view not to look like they are acting on Trump’s order to pump more,” one source told Reuters.However, the downside of keeping the strategy secret is that if the oil market doesn’t know about it, or the fact that Saudi Arabia and Russia decided to ramp up production, then the effect on prices is muted. After all, Brent surged to $85 per barrel in recent days, evidence that oil traders are not convinced about OPEC’s strategy.It may not be surprising then that the Reuters report came out when it did. Was that a deliberate strategy by the Saudis to leak the details to the press in order to inform the market? Who knows, but it came shortly after Brent rose its highest level in four years, which seems unlikely to be a coincidence.

That is up sharply from the 10.4 mb/d it produced in August, and the increase offers some evidence to back up the story that Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to boost output weeks ago, and may have told American officials about it. Al-Falih also said that production would be “slightly higher” in November compared to October levels.Russia added 150,000 bpd in September, pushing output up to a new post-Soviet record high at about 11.35 mb/d. “I would expect Russia’s oil production will hover at around 11.4 to 11.6 million bpd until the end of 2018 and may increase further to 11.8 million bpd later on in 2019,” a source at a major Russian oil company told Reuters. Those are serious numbers, and should be taken with a grain of salt, but they offer a window into the thinking in Moscow.Nevertheless, the White House still does not appear to be completely mollified. At the end of September, Trump reportedly called the Saudi King, and although the nature of that conversation was not disclosed, most oil watchers believed that the call was an attempt to pressure the Saudis into increasing oil supply.

You might not be there for two weeks without us. You have to pay for your military, you have to pay.’” Whether or not he actually said this to the King is questionable, but the fact that he appears to be insulting the Saudi monarchy in public offers more evidence that he wants them to lower oil prices from today’s highs.It remains to be seen if Trump can convince the Saudis to take a more aggressive line, although it should be noted that Saudi Arabia’s decision to increase production by 300,000 bpd from August levels is not trivial. Qatar’s Minister of Energy and Industry Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada defended the current OPEC strategy on Wednesday. “OPEC is not trying to manipulate the price, it's trying to bring the market to balance,” he told CNBC.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-And-Russia-Make-Secret-Oil-Deal.html,"Oct 03, 2018 at 16:07 | Nick Cunningham","Oct 03, 2018",Saudi Arabia And Russia Make Secret Oil Deal
2018-10-03,"A delay in port repairs following a tanker collision is putting additional pressure on already pressured Venezuelan crude oil exports, Reuters quoted anonymous sources close to PDVSA as saying this week. It seems that Venezuela’s woes are only multiplying as time goes by, although news from official Caracas sources seems more upbeat. Oil, however, appears at the forefront of Venezuela’s plight.A dock at Venezuela’s biggest oil port, Jose, was closed in late August after a tanker collided with it. At the time, Reuters reported that the repairs would delay the delivery of 5 million barrels of crude, destined for Rosneft, which, according to the news outlet, could put a strain on relations between the Russian company and PDVSA, which have a money-for-oil agreement. This is only the latest in PDVSA’s troubles with its oil exports.Besides a steady decline in production, Venezuela’s state-run oil company earlier this year ran into problems with its storage capacity and export terminals in the Caribbean as U.S.-based ConocoPhillips took an aggressive approach to enforcing a court ruling that awarded it US$2 billion in compensation for the forced nationalization of two projects in Venezuela. The company this summer seized several of PDVSA’s assets on Caribbean islands, which made it difficult for the Venezuelan state company to meet its export obligations. Having few options, PDVSA eventually caved, settling with Conoco.Dock repairs are further complicating matters. PDVSA is supposed to deliver to Rosneft some 4 million bpd of crude under the latest bilateral agreement signed this April. On top of that, it normally exports crude for U.S. Valero Energy and Chevron from the same dock, the South dock of the Jose port, which is responsible for processing processes as much as 70 percent of the country’s crude oil exports.Not to anyone’s surprise, the delay in resuming shipments is largely a result of insufficient funds, partially thanks to U.S. sanctions, which have essentially closed nearly completely the door to foreign funding. China, not bound by these restrictions, recently agreed to a US$5-billion lifeline for the Venezuelan government and its oil industry, but these billions will take time to become available. Given the multitude of problems that PDVSA is having, it would be a tough job to allocate these funds so that there is enough for everything.

Just this week the government announced the official launch of the petro on international markets in hopes of offsetting the effects of U.S. sanctions by using this oil-and gold-backed cryptocurrency. President Nicolas Maduro said at the launch that the petro would be legal tender for everything in Venezuela, including as a substitute for the dollar.""All Venezuelans will have access to the Petro and through it to make international purchases,"" Maduro said.Venezuela also plans to boost its oil exports to China as part of plans to transform its economy and get back on its feet. To this end, it will work with Chinese oil companies to improve production. Maduro said in July that PDVSA would boost oil production by 1 million bpd from June levels by the end of the year, although he admitted that this goal would be difficult to achieve. Venezuela pumped 1.45 million bpd in August, and the year-to-date average stands at 1.544 million bpd. This is a far cry from the figure from five years ago, when its daily average was 2.9 million bpd. It’s a matter of a short time to see if the petro and Chinese money will be enough to reverse the decline in production and exports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Venezuelas-Oil-Exports-Are-Falling-Even-Faster-Than-Expected.html,"Oct 03, 2018 at 15:52 | Irina Slav","Oct 03, 2018",Venezuela’s Oil Exports Are Falling Even Faster Than Expected
2018-10-03,"Saudi Arabia will pump 10.7 million bpd of oil in October and will slightly raise this level in November, Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said at an energy forum in Moscow on Wednesday.The comments by the key oilman in OPEC’s largest producer and exporter come just a few days after Brent Crude prices hit earlier this week $85 a barrel—a four-year high—amid concerns that OPEC and allies are not doing enough to offset declining Iranian oil exports and plunging Venezuelan production.Saudi Arabia is currently pumping 10.7 million bpd, al-Falih said today. This is just shy of the Kingdom’s all-time high production of 10.72 million bpd, set in November 2016, just before OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC allies started the production cut deal in January 2017.Asked about the Saudi plans for November production, when the U.S. sanctions on Iran’s oil return, al-Falih said that the November output would be “slightly higher” from the October level, which he expects to average 10.7 million bpd.According to the monthly Reuters survey of OPEC supply, Saudi Arabia pumped 10.53 million bpd in September, up by 50,000 bpd from August. OPEC’s secondary sources and the Saudi self-reported production put Saudi Arabia’s oil production in August at 10.4 million bpd. OPEC will release the September production figures next week.Related: Citi: Brent-WTI Spread Could Widen To 5-Year HighAt the Russian energy forum today, the Saudi minister also praised the “very healthy” oil market fundamentals and dismissed the criticism of U.S. President Donald Trump who has called out OPEC several times, blaming the cartel for the high oil prices.Saudi Arabia is also in weekly communication with Russia to discuss the global oil market and the oil production policy, al-Falih said.Earlier today, Reuters reported that Saudi Arabia and Russia had agreed to a private deal last month to quietly increase production between September and December to rein in the rising oil prices, allegedly keeping the United States in the loop about their plans.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Energy-Minister-Saudi-Arabia-Is-Boosting-Oil-Production.html,"Oct 03, 2018 at 11:45 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 03, 2018",Energy Minister: Saudi Arabia Is Boosting Oil Production
2018-10-03,"Crude oil prices fell after the Energy Information Administration reported an 8-million-barrel build in U.S. crude oil inventories for the week to September 28. Although expected by some analysts and industry observers, the build was substantial enough to hurt prices.A day after the American Petroleum Institute reported a modest inventory build of less than a million barrels, EIA’s figures are likely to push prices further down in the next couple of days as the oil market writhes in the throes of supervolatility brought about by the impending U.S. sanctions against Tehran and the uncertainty surrounding other producers’ capacity to increase production quickly enough to offset any supply loss, despite new assurances from Riyadh Saudi Arabia will boost its output in October and November.Yet demand is also beginning to worry analysts and traders: with Brent crude at over US$80 and climbing closer to US$85 a barrel, some of the world’s biggest importers, notably India, would be quick to start curbing their intake. With forecasts about the benchmark hitting US$100 a barrel before the end of December, chanced are importers are bracing up for a fatter bill that will affect their economic growth prospects and future oil demand.Demand in the United States is also seen to weaken in the last three months of the year, as it usually does during the winter season because of refinery maintenance season and less driving. As a result, analysts have been warning of inventory builds in both crude and fuels.  Related: Citi: Brent-WTI Spread Could Widen To 5-Year HighThe EIA reported a 500,000-barrel decline in gasoline stockpiles for the final week of September, compared with a 1.5-million-barrel build a week earlier.
