2019-01-14,"Recently, there has been some concern about the ability of U.S. shale, and in particular, the Permian Basin, to continue the meteoric increases in production that have characterized the past decade's boom.Growth in U.S. shale production since 2010 has led to a scenario no one ever imagined even a few years ago. America is now an energy exporter, sending cargoes of oil and LNG around the world.(Click to enlarge) Figure.-1, Source: EIA, Chart by AuthorThe data shows a rapid production ramp from 2010 as horizontal drilling and fracking technology replaced vertical wells. This continued and even accelerated through the end of Q-4, 2014 as DUCs (drilled but uncompleted wells) were brought online. The decline of Q-1, 2015 reflects the impact of the oil price drop that actually began in mid-2014. The new ramp beginning in 2017 reflected the new lower costs from suppliers and the effects of the improved well and frac designs.It was Schlumberger’s CEO, Paal Kibsgard who first commented on a decline in productivity that was being observed in multi-lateral completions, often called “child” wells. In their third quarter 2018 conference call with analysts he made some remarks that were likely misunderstood by them but subsequently received wide reporting in media outlets.The perception taken away from these remarks was that Kibsgard was saying that it was the quality of the reservoirs that was creating a fall-off in child well productivity that could lead to a decline in production down the road. That wasn’t what he meant however and in later remarks, that were largely skipped over, he explained how technology is favorably impacting the results the frackers are seeing it is applied. First, here is the quote from that sent everyone into a tizzy.“At present, our industry has yet to understand how reservoir conditions and well productivity change as we continue to pump billions of gallons of water and billions of pounds of sand into the ground each year. However, what is already clear to us is that unit well performance normalized for lateral length and pounds of proppant pumped is dropping in the Eagle Ford as the percentage of child wells continues to increase. Today, the percentage of child wells drilled in the Eagle Ford has already reached 70 percent and in the 3-year period since this percentage broke the 50 percent level, we have seen a steady reduction in unit well productivity.” Related: Venezuela’s Crisis Threatens U.S. Control Over Oil Prices“In the Permian, the percentage of child wells in the Midland Wolfcamp basin has just reached 50 percent and we are already starting to see a similar reduction in unit well productivity to that already seen in the Eagle Ford suggesting that the Permian growth potential could be lower than earlier expected. Therefore, assuming that oil demand will remain robust despite the trade war worries and market concerns around economic weakness in the emerging markets, we believe that the level of E&P investment must increase both internationally and in North America first of all to counter the multiyear drop in investments and second to develop and deploy the new technologies needed to overcome the emerging shale oil production challenges,” according to an earnings call transcript.What changed beginning in 2017?Let’s acknowledge that shale fracking is still a relatively new oil province. As shown in Fig.-1, prior to 2010 shale regions contributed a minor amount to U.S. total production. Given that, it’s only fair to agree the initial period involved some trial and error to see what worked, provide some data for analysis and final adjustment.Key changes that were made by the majority of the fracking companies were:- Extending the lateral section by 60-80 percent, to where these lengths now routinely run 9,000-10,000’.- More sand per foot (PPF) of an interval with current designs calling for as much as 2,500 PPF. Over a 10,000 foot interval that’s a huge volume of sand and water.- Closer well spacing. Operators have an obvious incentive to avoid well construction costs. Spacing the wells closer to each other can accomplish this goal.What Kibsgard was actually addressing though was that while all of these might be beneficial initially, there were problems arising that the application of technology could address. His remarks in response to an analyst question:“No. I think it can absolutely be solved through technology. A lot of this has to do with the conformity of the frac to make sure that we frac every cluster that we perforate and we have diverse technologies that we have been promoting to the market for several years with some off-take, but I think this is likely to accelerate and it’s also about how you ensure that your frac stays within the allocated rough volume that you have for the well, which is more of a far-field conformance that you are looking for and we have technologies in terms of how we design the frac fluid to address that too. So, all of these things I believe are addressable, but it requires a bit more of a reservoir focus on how the wells are drilled, how the wells are fracked, and we need a little bit more data to make sure that we do the right things here. But the measurements are available, the analysis and interpretation of the measurements are available and the remedies that we need to do to the frac fluids are also available. It’s just a matter of adopting these technologies. We have them all ready to go.”The message Kibsgard really meant to convey was that while changes implemented by operators in the previous year were good, after all they were making more oil, over time there might be a price to pay in lost production. He was saying there was available technology that wasn’t being fully deployed to ensure optimal long-term reservoir EURs (Estimated Ultimate Recovery). Technology that could give the operators a better understanding of the reservoir they were producing.One of the direct outcomes of the oil price collapse of the last few years is the ironclad determination of operating companies to tightly rein in costs, as has been discussed. This was vital to the resurgence in drilling and completions we saw commence in 2017. But, a consequence of this tight-fistedness is the difficulty in convincing them that technology is worth paying for.And, that of course, is the rub. Technology has to be paid for initially for it to deliver on its promise of improved results. Fortunately, it seems many operators are getting the message.(Click to enlarge)Figure-2, SourceOne of the big problems that the industry has started to recognize in conjunction with the more aggressive reservoir treatments were “frac hits”. These effectively cannibalize the production from the parent well by the proximity of the child well. Shown in Fig.-2 is a modeling example of the closeness of well spacing impairing the integrity of the completions.Worth mentioning also are the needless consumption of scarce resources, water and sand, that not optimizing well construction entails. Wood MacKenzie published a study on frac hits recently that was quoted in an article published in Desmog“Closely spaced child well performance presents not only a risk to the viability of the ongoing drilling recovery but also to the industry’s long-term prospects. Virtually every operator believes child well performance is a material issue, but there is no consensus on how to best address it.”The good news!Oil operators have been regularly improving and beating their own oil production forecasts. In a random survey for this article the recent results of several large U.S. Shale operators were tallied. All showed consistent and, in some cases, dramatic quarter over quarter increases in oil tallies.Several other oil companies have been reviewed recently as well including BP, Chevron, and Occidental Petroleum. All have met or exceeded the production increases of the companies in the chart below. In particular, OXY one of the larger Permian producers increased oil liftings by 54 percent year over year.(Click to enlarge)Source: U.S. SEC 10Q filings, Chart by authorThe map below from the U.S. Geophysical Society, USGS, reveals a recent reassessment of the extent of the Delaware sub-basin in the Permian. What it suggests is that this basin is twice the size of previous estimates, with total estimate for hydrocarbons of all forms running as high as 100 billion barrels.(Click to enlarge)SummaryThis is good news for American shale producers. It shows that rather than entering a period of stagnation and early decline a few years hence due to poor reservoir conditions, the industry is just getting its legs under it.Further, it shows that technology can play an absolute role in maximizing ultimate recoveries from shale wells. This can have a big impact on both lessening our increasing energy dependence on foreign sources, and providing a source of export dollars to other countries.There are tremendous resources available as the graphic below suggests, and it is up to the producers to extract it efficiently, and for maximum benefit to the nation.(Click to enlarge)SourceBy David Messler for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Fears-Of-US-Shale-Demise-May-Be-Overblown.html,"Jan 14, 2019 at 13:41 | David Messler","Jan 14, 2019",Fears Of U.S. Shale Demise May Be Overblown
2019-01-14,"Oil majors will spend US$208 billion on offshore drilling and other oilfield services this year, but not all sector players are positioned to benefit from the higher spending, Bloomberg reported last week, citing Rystad Energy’s head of oilfield service research, Audun Martinsen.Bigger oilfield service providers, unsurprisingly, would have a better chance at making the most of the recovery in offshore drilling, especially those with expertise in deepwater projects, according to Martinsen, among them UK-based TechnipFMC and Subsea 7.All in all, Martinsen told Bloomberg that Big Oil will probably approve about 110 offshore projects this year, up from 96 last year and 43 in 2016. That’s also slightly more specific than what Rystad forecast for offshore oil in a December report. What the forecast suggests is that optimism remains robust despite the oil price drop in the last quarter of 2018.Thanks to this optimism and relatively high prices, there is good news for the oilfield services sector, too. “The offshore service market is like a super tanker: It takes time to accelerate. The uptick in new projects in 2017, 2018 and now 2019 will be enough to turn revenue growth positive to mid-single digits as offshore capex is set to increase due to the recent years of capital commitments. And on top of that comes expected increase in operating expenses,” Martinsen said in the December report.The industry itself is cautious about the immediate future. “With oil prices trading below $60/bbl, there continues to be some uncertainty on 2019 E&P spending, particularly offshore,” according to the chief executive of a Norwegian oilfield surveyor firm TGS Nopec Geophysical, as quoted by Bloomberg.  Related: China’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil MarketsWhat’s more, there is still surplus offshore drilling and exploration capacity. One Wood Mackenzie analyst told Bloomberg that despite a moderate increase in demand for drilling vessels this year, some 30 percent of deepwater rigs may remain idled this year. That’s 5 percentage points down from the number of rigs idled in 2018, but still quite a lot of capacity.Judging by these expectations and projections, the recovery of the oilfield services sector will continue at a rate much slower than the exploration and production industry. Companies with greater exposure to the Middle East would benefit from the rise in offshore investment there, with Rystad expecting 30 percent of all new projects to be approved this year to be in this region, with another 25 percent in South America and 15 percent in Africa and Asia combined. The remainder of new offshore projects will be in Europe and North America combined, Rystad said.Related: Chevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyThat should be good news for oilfield service providers focused on the United States, but a Reuters report from December has suggested they are facing challenges as well. U.S. oil producers, the report said, are still trying to do more with less, which has affected negatively oilfield service providers’ bottom lines despite the stable increase in production. Fewer frack crews and fewer rigs are in the plans of several companies for this year--what’s more, they are unwilling to pay more for the crews, rigs, and other equipment they plan to use this year. And, not to put too fine a point on it, offshore drilling in the U.S. is even slower to recover than elsewhere.These trends suggest growing consolidation in a sector already pummeled by the 2014 oil price crisis. Apparently, the recovery we saw a couple of years back when oil prices started climbing and producers--chiefly in the United States--started boosting production again, was temporary, or at least uneven.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Majors-Bet-Big-On-Offshore-Drilling-In-2019.html,"Jan 14, 2019 at 12:42 | Irina Slav","Jan 14, 2019",Oil Majors Bet Big On Offshore Drilling In 2019
2019-01-14,"The mood in the crude oil and oil product futures market turned decisively sour in the fourth quarter of 2018 as building crude oil oversupply and signs of slowing global economic growth rate hit investor sentiment.Hedge funds and other money managers liquidated a lot of bullish positions in crude oil and in middle distillates in October, November, and December.  By the end of 2018, the net long position—the difference between bets that prices will rise and bets on a drop—in U.S. diesel futures had flipped to a net short position, where bets on a drop prevail over bets on price increases.The overall bearish position in diesel is consistent with the market behavior before and during economic slowdowns or recessions in the past two to three decades, Reuters market analyst John Kemp argues.Middle distillates—such as diesel, jet fuel, and gasoil—are more closely associated with economic cycles than, say, gasoline, because diesel and the other middle distillates are predominantly used in manufacturing, mining, farming, and freight transportation.The bearish position on diesel futures could be a sign that money managers expect an economic slowdown or even a recession.Money managers began last year holding a record net long position in U.S. diesel—equivalent to 64 million barrels, according to data from exchanges compiled by Kemp.By the beginning of October, the net long position in diesel was still equivalent to 48 million barrels, pointing to the money managers’ expectation that the economy would continue to expand at a steady pace.  Related: Chevron And Occidental Join Bill Gates-Backed Tech CompanyBut by the end of November, the net long position in diesel vanished. By the middle of December 2018, the overall bullish position had already turned into a net short position equivalent to 8 million barrels, according to the latest data crunched by Kemp.The soured mood in the market coincided with a 40-percent slump in WTI Crude and Brent Crude between early October and end-December, when market participants started to worry that a global economic slowdown would hit manufacturing and trade, and by extension, oil demand growth this year.Just last week, the World Bank said it expects oil prices to average $67 a barrel this year and next, down $2 compared to projections from June last year. In its Global Economic Prospects report, the World Bank also revised down its global growth projections amid “darkening skies” for the global economy.The World Bank now sees global economic growth slowing down to 2.9 percent in 2019 from 3 percent in 2018, as international trade and investment weaken.“The outlook for the global economy has darkened. Global financing conditions have tightened, industrial production has moderated, trade tensions have intensified, and some large emerging market and developing economies have experienced significant financial market stress,” the World Bank said last week.Also last week, Fed chairman Jerome Powell said that the “U.S. economy is solid,” and the principal fear would be global growth which is somewhat slowing.Related: Italy Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration Permits“The question would be how much does that affect us,” the Fed’s chair said at the Economic Club of Washington, D.C.In the first two weeks of 2019, oil prices rallied on hopes that the U.S.-China trade talks could bridge some gaps in their differences. The start of the OPEC/non-OPEC production cuts and Saudi Arabia’s continued pledge to cut exports and basically “do whatever it takes” to balance the market also supported oil prices which returned into a bull market last week.Powell’s comments that the bank would be “patient” and watch carefully how the U.S. economy evolves this year before deciding on more interest rate hikes, also helped to sustain oil prices last week.Going forward, money managers and all market participants and analysts will be closely watching the signs about the pace of global economic growth to try to guesstimate the rate of global oil demand growth in 2019.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Bearish-Bets-On-Diesel-Tell-A-Worrying-Story.html,"Jan 14, 2019 at 12:33 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Jan 14, 2019",Bearish Bets On Diesel Tell A Worrying Story
2019-01-14,"The Permian Basin was once a hotbed of small, independent prospectors, wide-eyed wildcatters, and small companies hoping to strike it rich. Now, it is brimming with supermajors clamoring to buy out the region’s smaller operators and pump out the basin’s vast reserves of crude with the kind of breakneck efficiency that only massive corporate backing can achieve. Ten years ago, in 2008, United States oil production bottomed out at about 3.8 million barrels a day. Today, 3.8 million barrels are produced in a day in the Permian Basin alone.For a bit of perspective, the entire state of California, which recently beat out the United Kingdom as the fifth biggest economy in the world, has around 10 active drilling rigs. The Permian Basin alone has nearly 500. Exxon Mobil and Chevron, the United States’ top energy moguls, have both made the Permian Basin their focus, prioritizing their investments in West Texas over all their other projects worldwide, while European supermajors including Royal Dutch Shell and BP are also working diligently on growing their presence in the Permian.As of last year, Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, became the most active driller in the Permian basin with 38 drilling rigs running in the region that extends from West Texas to southeastern New Mexico. The Midland, Texas-based Concho Resources (previously the most active driller in the Permian before being surpassed by Exxon Mobil) comes in second with 34 rigs. Concho Resources significantly expanded their presence in the Permian Basin last year when they acquired competing company RSP Permian for $8 billion. San Ramon, California-based Chevron takes third place in regional drilling activity with more than 20 rigs in the Permian.Chevron has recently begun ramping up the development of their holdings, and now says that their Permian Basin production spiked a whopping 80 percent in less than a year, up to its current level of about 340,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Displaying a similar bravado, Exxon Mobil has said it plans to produce more than 600,000 barrels a day in the Permian Basin by the year 2025.  Related: Italy Looks To Block Oil, Gas Exploration PermitsEven the leading independent firms in the Permian Basin, Houston’s Occidental Petroleum and Dallas’ Pioneer Natural Resources, are both up to producing around 300,000 barrels per day now. These high production numbers and huge operations, however, simply aren’t enough to make independent companies competitive in West Texas. Occidental Petroleum and Pioneer Natural Resources are just no match for the corporate companies now throwing their full weight around in the Permian Basin. Even the biggest independent producers simply can’t compete with the scale and diversification of an international supermajor.As the crude glut paranoia persists and oil prices remain low, supermajors with deep pockets like Exxon and Chevron can still depend on profits coming from their refining and petrochemical holdings to soften the blow of reduced cash flow in the production sector, but independent companies don’t have that cushion. As a result, many smaller firms are being snapped up by supermajors looking to increase their presence in the Permian. Midland-based Endeavor Energy is just one company currently on the market, and Shell, Exxon Mobil and Chevron reportedly are among the top bidders, eyeing the company for a sale of at least $8 billion.Currently, Shell only has a modest presence in the area, but has expressed a desire for growth and has been increasing production by around 30 percent a year. New Shell Oil President Gretchen Watkins was quoted saying, “the Permian is certainly an area of focus for us, and one where I can see us expanding over the next little bit here.”With the veritable black-gold rush spreading its fever over West Texas, some reporting has even speculated that the Permian could become the most productive oil field in the world. While it was long thought impossible that any field would ever surpass Saudi Arabia’s 5-million-barrel-per-day Ghawar oil field, the Permian is closing that gap in a hurry, with no signs of slowing. With a skyrocketing production rate, massive and growing drilled but uncompleted (DUC) oil well inventory, and what are estimated to be massive untapped resources, the Permian Basin is on track to exceed even the wildest expectations--but it’s safe to say that independent companies shouldn’t expect to be part of that renaissance for long.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/How-Supermajors-Are-Transforming-The-Permian.html,"Jan 14, 2019 at 12:23 | Haley Zaremba","Jan 14, 2019",How Supermajors Are Transforming The Permian
2019-01-14,"Despite renewed hopes that a fresh trade deal could be reached between the U.S. and China by the two sides’ self-imposed March 2 deadline, it may still not be enough to offset the negative impact on China’s economic growth already being felt. Sources told Reuters last week that Beijing is planning to lower its economic growth target to 6 percent, The analysis comes as China saw its exports fall unexpectedly in December by 4.4 percent, the most in two years, with imports also falling 7.6 percent in their biggest decline since July 2016. Since exports fell in December, in spite of government efforts to boost growth (including higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts), exports could also falter for several months going forward as domestic growth slows. Ratings agency Moody’s also said in a note that “producers price inflation had decelerated for six consecutive months,"" adding to other signs of cooling industrial activity (in China) amid weakening global demand.Largest trade surplus in a decadeAt the same time as China released its December export data, the country also said that its trade surplus with the U.S. in 2018 grew by 17 percent to a staggering $323.32 billion, a figure likely to put more pressure on Beijing during ongoing trade talks with the U.S. Exports to the U.S. rose 11.3 percent on-year in 2018, while imports from the U.S. to China rose 0.7 percent over the same period.Perhaps, even more troubling for the U.S. as it continues to pressure China over a host of trade and intellectual property rights problems is that even though China's trade surplus with the U.S. spiked last year, it’s overall trade surplus actually dropped to its lowest since 2013- indicating serious and ongoing systemic trade relationship issues with the U.S. These numbers should give even more leverage to U.S negotiators s they hammer out a trade deal with their Chinese counterparts.  Related: Maduro Clings To Power As Venezuela’s Oil Collapse ContinuesA CNBC report said that beyond the tariffs battle with the U.S., China’s economy has been facing its own domestic headwinds. Even before Trump kicked off the latest escalation in trade tensions, CNBC said, Beijing was already trying to manage a slowdown in its economy after decades of breakneck growth.Headwinds for global oil marketsChina's recent export data forecast that the worse may be just around the corner could still weigh heavily on global oil markets, despite oil prices recently recouping much of the ground it lost from mid-October to the end of last year.On Monday, oil prices fell by nearly 1 percent, with global oil benchmark, London-traded Brent crude futures dipping below the psychologically important $60/barrel price point. U.S. oil benchmark, NYMEX-traded West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down around 0.9 percent at $51.12/barrel. Some analysts, citing the recent data coming out of China, are forecasting that the upside for oil prices will be in the mid-$60s/ barrel range for Brent and around $55/barrel for WTI. However, it’s expected that China’s growth could stall in the first half of the year, the bigger factor for both China's growth and global oil markets hinges on the outcome of ongoing trade talks between Washington and Beijing.If some sort of deal can be reached to not only eliminate the risk of President Trump raising current tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese good from 10 percent to 25 percent as well as placing another $267 billion worth of Chinese goods under tariffs, global economic growth will tick upward, including in emerging markets, with a knock-on effect on increasing oil demand, which will support higher oil prices. However, in a worst-case scenario, where a trade deal can’t be reached or, the outcome for global economic growth and oil demand will be a bearish oil market that will also see pain for oil producers all the way from Saudi Arabia to Russia, to Canada, to the U.S. and back again.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinas-Slowing-Economic-Growth-Could-Wreak-Havoc-On-Oil-Markets.html,"Jan 14, 2019 at 11:30 | Tim Daiss","Jan 14, 2019",China’s Slowing Economic Growth Could Wreak Havoc On Oil Markets
2019-01-14,"There is no need for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to schedule an extraordinary meeting before April, Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister, Khalid al-Falih, told media, as quoted by Reuters.At the same event, an industry conference taking place in Abu Dhabi, Al-Falih also said the market was moving in the right direction and prices will recover soon enough. He added, however, that OPEC and its partners are ready to do more if this was called for.Brent and West Texas Intermediate are down again today, after a pickup last week, with Brent crude trading at US$59.71 a barrel at the time of writing, down 1.27 percent, and WTI trading at US$50.85 a barrel, down 1.43 percent from Friday’s close.“If we look beyond the noise of weekly data and speculators’ herd-like behavior, I remain convinced that we’re on the right track, and that the oil market will quickly return to balance,” AL-Falih said, adding that secondary data sources tracking OPEC production had found that the cartel had pumped 600,000 bpd less in December than in the previous month.The possibility of an extraordinary meeting was first voiced by the Oil Minister of the UAE, Suhail al-Mazrouei, who said OPEC might need to meet again to discuss tweaks to the cuts before April if 1.2 million bpd was not enough to prop up prices.“What if the 1.2 million barrels of cuts are not enough? I am telling you that if it is not, we will meet and see what is enough and we will do it,” Mazrouei said in late December. “The plan (to cut oil production) is well studied but if it does not work, we always have the power in OPEC to call for an extraordinary meeting. If we are required to extend for (another) six months, we will do it...
