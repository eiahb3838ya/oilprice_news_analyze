2019-01-09,"A combination of lower shipping costs and lower domestic demand will boost U.S. crude oil exports to Asia, Reuters reports, citing sources from the commodity trading and shipping industries.Freight costs for shipments scheduled to arrive in Asia in late March and April this year are US$0.50 lower per barrel of oil than they were for shipments scheduled to arrive at refineries in December as buyers were in a rush to secure crude ahead of the Iran sanctions that went into effect in early November.Since the end of October last year, chartering a Very large Crude Carrier from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port has fallen by some 40 percent to US$5 million, Reuters Eikon data suggests.U.S. exports of crude will also enjoy the support of a still sizeable discount of West Texas Intermediate to Brent crude, which is close to US$10 a barrel. WTI is among the most popular U.S. light crude grades with Asian buyers. Other attractive grades include Midland and Eagle Ford in the light crude segment, and Mars and Southern Green Canyon in the heavier segment. “There is the potential for Q2 U.S. crude exports to Asia to be higher year-on-year if the WTI/Brent spread remains in the range it has in recent months and with the lower freight rates,” Reuters quoted a Genscape oil analyst, David Arno, as saying.

Chinese traders and refiners are still cautious about buying U.S. crude until the trade problems between the world’s two biggest economies are resolved, but if they are, chances are U.S. crude exports would get an additional boost.Also, if Washington refuses to extend the Iranian crude oil import waivers it granted in November to eight large buyers—including China and India—they will need an alternative source of crude and it might just be the United States.

2019-01-09,"The Energy Information Administration reported a crude oil inventory draw of 1.7 million barrels for the first week of 2019, after a 6.9-million-barrel build in the last week of 2018. Inventories remain over the five-year seasonal average, the authority said.In gasoline, however, the EIA reported a hefty addition of 8.1 million barrels, a day after the American Petroleum Institute depressed oil prices further by estimating a 5.5-million-barrel increase in gasoline inventories and a 10.2-million-barrel build in distillate fuel inventories. According to the EIA, distillate fuel inventories went up by as much as 10.6 million barrels in the week to January 4.West Texas Intermediate recovered to above US$50 a barrel this week on the news—as announced by President Trump on Twitter—that U.S.-China trade talks were going well, which sparked hope an end was in sight for the trade war that has weighed on international oil prices.The bilateral talks have gone into their third day today, which was unscheduled, but signs continue to be positive: Reuters quoted U.S. officials as saying the negotiations currently concerned increased Chinese imports of U.S. farm produce and energy commodities. However, Beijing has said it will not make “unreasonable concessions” adding it expected to not be the only side making compromises.If, however, the sides fail to reach an agreement by March 2, the U.S. will effect a 15-percent increase in tariffs currently of 10 percent on Chinese goods worth US$2 billion. The impact of this move on oil prices would undoubtedly be devastating.Amid this return of optimism, the EIA reported refineries in the United States had processed an average of 17.6 million barrels daily of crude last week, producing 9.4 million bpd of gasoline and 5.6 bpd of distillate fuels. This compares with daily gasoline production of 9.5 million bpd and distillate fuel production of 5.6 million bpd.At the time of writing, Brent crude traded at US$60.35 a barrel, up by 2.78 percent from yesterday’s close, with West Texas Intermediate changing hands for US$51.37 a barrel, up 3.19 percent on Tuesday.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Slip-On-Bearish-EIA-Report.html,"Jan 09, 2019 at 09:45 | Irina Slav","Jan 09, 2019",Oil Prices Slip On Bearish EIA Report
