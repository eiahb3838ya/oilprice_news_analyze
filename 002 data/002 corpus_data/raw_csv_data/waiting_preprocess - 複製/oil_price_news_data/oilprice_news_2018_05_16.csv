2018-05-16,"Geopolitics has taken over the oil market, driving oil prices up to three-year highs. The inventory surplus has vanished, and more outages could push oil prices up even higher. Yet, there are some signs that demand is starting to take a hit as oil closes in on $80 per barrel.In the IEA’s May Oil Market Report, the agency said that OPEC might be needed to step in and fill the supply gap if a significant portion of Iran oil goes offline. Saudi Arabia suggested shortly after the U.S. announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal that OPEC would act to mitigate any supply shortfall should it occur.But while geopolitical fears helped push Brent up to $79 per barrel in recent days, the underlying fundamentals are also mostly bullish.Venezuela’s production is plummeting, and output is 550,000 bpd below it's agreed upon target as part of the OPEC deal. Conservative estimates suggest that the country could lose several hundred thousand barrels per day over the course of 2018, but there are several massive threats to PDVSA’s operations that could make that forecast look optimistic.ConocoPhillips continues aggressive action to obtain control of PDVSA’s assets after an international arbitration court awarded it $2 billion in awards.  Related: The Most Underappreciated Story In The Oil MarketThere is a great deal of confusion about what Conoco’s actions mean for Venezuela’s oil production, but the asset seizures could be pivotal. Reuters reports that the American oil major is now trying to seize two cargoes of crude and fuel near a terminal in Aruba run by Citgo, a subsidiary of PDVSA. The cargoes are holding 500,000 barrels of oil and 300,000 bpd of jet fuel, gasoline and diesel.On top of that, Venezuela is set to hold a presidential election on May 20, an event that could be met with more painful U.S. sanctions. Conoco’s actions, combined with a crackdown by the U.S. Treasury, could send Venezuela’s oil production deeper into a death spiral.The big question is if supply will be lost in Iran, which, coupled with the supply losses in Venezuela, could severely tighten the oil market. “The potential double supply shortfall represented by Iran and Venezuela could present a major challenge for producers to fend off sharp price rises and fill the gap, not just in terms of the number of barrels but also in terms of oil quality,” the IEA wrote in its report.OECD crude inventories fell in March by 27 million barrels, putting total stocks at a three-year low and, crucially, 1 million barrels below the five-year average. That data point is worth emphasizing: OPEC has claimed for more than a year that it was trying to erase the inventory surplus, and at least according to IEA data, that mission has now been accomplished.Still, the group may not be ready to take their foot off of the accelerator. They meet in a few weeks in Vienna to figure out their next steps. But with inventories now back at average levels, there is some upward pressure on oil prices, particularly with more outages looming in 2018.However, the cure for higher oil prices tends to be higher oil prices. The IEA lowered its demand forecast for 2018 by 40,000 bpd – not a massive revision, but notable because it offers some signs that demand will slow as prices rise. Some other reports back up this notion. There are reportedly spot cargoes for oil from West Africa, Russia and Kazakhstan that are going unsold, forcing steep discounts. “While recent data continue to point to very strong demand in 1Q18 and the start of 2Q18, we expect a slowdown in growth in 2H18.” Up until now, demand growth looked strong, but “the recent jump in oil prices will take its toll.”  Related: Rising Fuel Prices Could Offset Tax Cuts(Click to enlarge) “On balance, the report is tending more to the negative side. Demand for oil has been revised downwards for the second half of the year from April,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Tamas Varga told Reuters.The IEA noted that the global economy is still “doing well,” and that “underlying demand growth remains strong around the world.” That suggests demand won’t suddenly fall off of a cliff. “Still, the fact is that crude oil prices have risen by nearly 75% since June 2017,” the agency cautioned. “It would be extraordinary if such a large jump did not affect demand growth, especially as end-user subsidies have been reduced or cut in several emerging economies in recent years.”By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/IEA-High-Oil-Prices-Taking-a-Toll-On-Demand.html,"May 16, 2018 at 17:09 | Nick Cunningham","May 16, 2018",IEA: High Oil Prices “Taking A Toll” On Demand
2018-05-16,"It’s been a week since President Donald Trump announced that he would withdraw from the Iranian nuclear deal reached in 2015 and impose so-called powerful economic sanctions against the Islamic Republic over its nuclear development.“This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,” Trump said in an 11-minute address from the Diplomatic Reception Room of the White House on May 8. “It didn’t bring calm, it didn’t bring peace, and it never will,” he added.The U.S. Treasury stated that it was giving companies three to six months to wind down their contracts, including purchases of Iranian crude oil. U.S. sanctions on Iran block American firms from doing business in the country, but even more controversial, it also prohibits foreign companies that do business there from accessing the entire U.S. banking and financial system.Digging in its heelsIran, for its part, has stated that it will remain in the deal as have EU members that were part of the original deal hammered out by then-President Barack Obama. Shortly after the sanctions announcement last week, Obama said that Trump’s withdrawal would leave the world less safe, confronting it with “a losing choice between a nuclear-armed Iran or another war in the Middle East.”A few days later, the French government, which had lobbied with Trump to not pull out of the accord, said that Europe was prepared to introduce measures to nullify the effect of Trump imposing sanctions on any non-U.S. firm that continues to do business with Iran.One reason France is adamant over the Trump announcement comes from French oil major Total’s recent $5 billion deal to extract gas from Iranian fields. The 20-year deal was reached with National Iranian Oil Co. and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) last year to develop phase 11 of the massive South Pars offshore gas field. South Pars is considered the world’s largest natural gas field and could help Iran also become a major gas exporter, both pipeline gas into Europe as well as LNG exports once necessary infrastructure is put in place.  Related: Will $100 Oil Kill The U.S. Economy?However, the U.S. is firing back at EU resistance. John Bolton, Trump’s newly installed National Security Advisor, said that “the Europeans will see that it’s in their interests to come along with us” rather than continue with the 2015 deal, under which major European corporations have signed billions of dollars of contracts in Iran.How much impact?While the politics of Trump’s sanctions decision plays out not only across the Atlantic with U.S. traditional allies but in the Middle East, other ramifications have to be examined, including just how much sanctions would curb Iranian oil exports – and that answer depends on who you ask.Some analysts have predicted that re-imposed sanctions on Iran would remove around 600,000 barrels of oil per day, which would of course tighten global oil supplies which are already being stretched thin among the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut put in place at the start of last year.Other analysts see that figure a bit lower, initially removing around 200,000 barrels per day (bpd) and within six months increasing to 500,000 bpd.Yet, in a worst-case scenario for tightening oil markets but a boon for both OPEC and non-OPEC producers alike looking to capitalize on higher oil prices, commodities data provider S&P Global Platts cites analysts that predict 1 million bpd will be removed from the market due to re-imposed Iranian sanctions.Asian oil markets impactThree of Asia’s top buyers of Iranian oil will be impacted, yet in different ways. Long-time U.S. allies Japan and South Korea are expected to reduce their oil procurement from Iran, while China will increase its purchases of Iranian oil, Mriganka Jaipuriyar, Associate Editorial Director, Asia & Middle East Energy News & Analysis for S&P Global Platts, told OilPrice.com.  Related: Expert Analysis: What’s Next For Russian Oil“This is expected to benefit Chinese state-owned refiners, who could find themselves in a favorable position to buy abundant supply of Iranian crude oil at attractive prices,” she said.Jaipuriyar added that since South Korea and Japan are U.S. allies they “would be keen to abide by the Trump administration's foreign policies as they require U.S. support and influence in their quest to completely denuclearize North Korea and improve diplomatic and economic ties with Pyongyang this year.” She added that both countries are also more capable of diversifying their crude sources.China, however, particularly amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., will likely take advantage of the demand gap left by South Korea and Japan.Any increase in Iranian oil purchases by China will also pit Iran, OPEC’s third largest producer, against regional rival Saudi Arabia and Russia, the world’s top oil producer, for market share in China, the world’s largest oil importing country. Iran, for its part, will likely offer incentives to lock in more Chinese markets share, especially in light of Saudi Arabia recently raising the official selling price (OSP) of its Arab Light crude to Asia, a move that has caused Chinese state-run Sinopec, Asia’s largest refiner, to trim its Saudi oil imports, a development that I discussed in an April 17 post.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Looks-To-Capitalize-On-Cheap-Iranian-Oil.html,"May 16, 2018 at 11:34 | Tim Daiss","May 16, 2018",China Looks To Capitalize On Cheap Iranian Oil
2018-05-16,"A day after the American Petroleum Institute’s crude oil inventory report put a restraint on oil prices, the Energy Information Administration pushed prices up again by reporting a draw of 1.4 million barrels for the week to May 11.This follows a combined inventory build of 8.4 million barrels in the prior two weeks. Analysts had expected a modest inventory build of 90,000 barrels.The EIA said refineries processed 16.6 million barrels of crude daily, with gasoline production averaging 10.5 million barrels, compared with 9.9 million bpd a week earlier. Distillate production stood at 5.0 million barrels daily last week, unchanged on the week.Gasoline inventories were down by 3.8 million barrels last week, after a total 2-million-barrel build in the prior 14 days. Distillate inventories decreased by 0.1 million barrels, after a combined 7.7-million-barrel draw over the prior two weeks.This week’s API report seems to have served as a wake-up call for traders after lots of upbeat media reports about strong crude oil demand, helped by EIA’s latest drilling productivity report, which estimated that shale oil production in the Lower 48 would jump by a record 144,000 bpd this month, to 7.178 million bpd.EIA’s latest weekly petroleum report will certainly fuel the bullish sentiment on the oil market even though some analysts are noting that financial demand for crude oil greatly exceeds physical demand, with spot oil prices at the deepest discount to futures in years.  Related: Could This Be The Next Proxy War In The Middle East?Still, even more cautious analysts admit that the OPEC+ production cut deal has served its purpose and global oil supply is a lot tighter than it was just two years ago. This has supported a 70-percent price rise in Brent over the past 12 months, and the benchmark could rise further as OPEC keeps on the same course.Meanwhile, U.S. and Canadian crude is trading at substantial discount due to pipeline capacity shortage that is making it difficult for crude from the Permian and Alberta to reach refineries.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Rebound-On-Crude-Inventory-Draw.html,"May 16, 2018 at 09:45 | Irina Slav","May 16, 2018",Oil Prices Rebound On Crude Inventory Draw
