2018-12-12,"Now nearly a week removed from the OPEC+ agreement, confidence in the efficacy of the deal is becoming shaky.Immediately after OPEC+ announced cuts of 1.2 million barrels per day (mb/d), a flurry of reports from oil analysts and investment banks congratulated the group on a job well done. After all, the 1.2 mb/d figure was larger than the market had anticipated.However, reality is beginning to set in. First, the cuts might not be realized in January, despite the promise. Russia indicated that it was going to slow walk the cuts, phasing in an initial 50,000 to 60,000 bpd in reductions in January. This is significant because Russia is the main actor in the non-OPEC cohort. The non-OPEC group is expected to slash output by 400,000 bpd, but if Russia is only going to do its part gradually over the next few months, the non-OPEC cuts might not reach the promised levels anytime soon. Moreover, because there are no country-specific allotments, it will be hard to hold any producer accountable.That undermines confidence in the deal. “Compared to early last week, the outcome was rather disappointing, the whole process wasn’t convincing, and it’s still uncertain whether they will actually cut,” ABN Amro senior energy economist Hans van Cleef told Bloomberg.While oil traders are suddenly doubting the integrity of the deal, even if OPEC+ were to adhere to its promised cuts, it still might not be enough. That’s because there are other factors that could leave the market oversupplied. Cracks in the global economy are growing, demand is showing signs of strain, and supply continues to rise.The EIA just issued its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, and the agency still expects significant production growth from U.S. shale despite the downturn in prices. The EIA lowered its forecasted 2019 WTI prices by $10 per barrel from its previous report, yet it kept its supply forecast unchanged – it still thinks that U.S. oil production will rise from 10.9 mb/d in 2018 to 12.1 mb/d in 2019, despite the significant downward revision in prices.

The muted market reaction seen thus far comes as no surprise to us.”Rystad says that the cuts agreed to in Vienna provide a “soft floor” beneath oil prices for now, and the group can still succeed if it extends the cuts through the end of 2019. The OPEC+ coalition is set to evaluate the progress of the cuts in April and might decide to extend the cuts in June if they feel the market needs more time. “Most likely, OPEC will be forced to conduct production management sporadically over the next few years, unless US shale supply grows even faster than we currently expect. OPEC members have their work cut out for them in the years to come,” Rystad’s Tonhaugen said.  Related: 2019: A Pivotal Year For OPECThe supply surplus could still be eliminated by unplanned outages. Libya just lost 400,000 bpd because of encroaching militias, according to the National Oil Corp. Venezuela and Iran are also set to continue to lose output, while Nigeria remains a risk. These events are impossible to predict, and they could quickly erase any supply overhang.For now, though, the oil market is not convinced that the OPEC+ cuts will be sufficient to significantly increase oil prices, despite the initial euphoria surrounding the Vienna agreement.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-The-OPEC-Deal-Wont-Cut-It.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 15:00 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 12, 2018",Why The OPEC+ Deal Won’t Cut It
2018-12-12,"Chevron announced last week its capital and exploratory budget for 2019, which sees the first annual increase in spending since the 2014 oil price crash.While most of the investment is geared toward short-cycle projects that could start bringing in cash flows within two years, the U.S. supermajor continues to channel a significant portion of its upstream investment into a major capital-intensive project to boost the production of a supergiant oil field in western Kazakhstan.Chevron will invest US$4.3 billion in 2019 in the Future Growth Project at the Tengiz field which lies deep beneath the western Kazakhstan steppe—the deepest producing supergiant oil field and the largest single-trap producing reservoir in existence. The investment in boosting production at the giant oil field will take most of Chevron’s US$5.1 billion upstream program for major capital projects in 2019. For this year, Chevron had allocated US$3.7 billion to the Tengiz field expansion project.The Kazakhstan field expansion and the U.S. shale patch are the two pillars of Chevron’s capital spending for next year—growing shorter-cycle shale production and continuing investments in a supergiant oil field that is expected to pump oil for decades.For 2019, Chevron has earmarked US$3.6 billion for expanding its production in the Permian and another US$1.6 billion will be invested in other shale plays in the United States. That makes a total of US$5.2 billion for U.S. shale, which is substantially higher than this year’s shale budget of US$4.3 billion.  Related: Will China Turn Its Back On U.S. LNG?“Our 2019 budget supports a robust portfolio of upstream and downstream investments, highlighted by our world-class Permian Basin position, additional shale and tight development in other basins and our major capital project at TCO in Kazakhstan,” Chevron chairman and CEO Michael K. Wirth said, commenting on next year’s budget.Chevron holds 50 percent in the operator of the Tengiz field, Tengizchevroil (TCO), in which the other shareholders are Kazakhstan’s state-held energy firm KazMunayGas with 20 percent, ExxonMobil Kazakhstan with 25 percent, and LukArco with 5 percent.The so-called Future Growth and Wellhead Pressure Management Project (FGP-WPMP) is planned to increase crude oil production at Tengiz by about 260,000 bpd, and was estimated to cost US$36.8 billion when Chevron approved the expansion project back in 2016.The FGP-WPMP, with first oil planned for 2022, is expected to boost the Tengiz crude oil production capacity by about 260,000 bpd, and the field’s total production will increase to around 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day, Chevron says.Tengiz and Kazakhstan operations continue to be a priority for Chevron, while the U.S. major is considering selling its interests in the oil industry of another former Soviet republic—Azerbaijan, as it is re-aligning its global operations to its new priorities after the downturn.  Related: The Solar Tech Flying Under The RadarChevron is looking to sell its 9.6-percent stake in the giant Azeri oil field Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) in the Caspian Sea and its 8.9-percent interest in the BTC pipeline, which carries oil from the ACG field and condensate from Shah Deniz across Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.Chevron is currently reviewing its global asset portfolio and has “decided to initiate the process of marketing, with a view to a potential sale, of our Chevron affiliate interests in the Azeri Chirag and Deep Water Gunashli (ACG) project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline,” the company said in a statement to Reuters last week.The U.S. oil and gas major is not breaking from the Big Oil pack when it comes to re-aligning priorities for the next few years—betting big on shorter-term cash-flow generators like the U.S. shale patch and high-grading the global portfolio to boost production at major oil assets for decades to come.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chevron-Bets-Big-On-Supergiant-Oil-Field.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 12:21 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 12, 2018",Chevron Bets Big On Supergiant Oil Field
2018-12-12,"OPEC expects demand for its crude oil to average 31.4 million bpd in 2019, down by 100,000 bpd from last month’s forecast, which suggests that the cartel would need to strictly stick to the new production cuts and rely on continued declines from exempt members Iran and Venezuela if it wants to prevent an oversupply.In its closely watched Monthly Oil Market Report, OPEC said on Wednesday that demand for OPEC crude in 2019 was revised down by 100,000 bpd compared to the previous report to stand at 31.4 million bpd—down by 1.0 million bpd lower than the 2018 level.OPEC’s crude oil production in November, on the other hand, averaged 32.97 million bpd, down by 11,000 bpd compared to October, as Saudi Arabia massively increased its oil production to an all-time high, while Iran’s production plunged. Crude oil production in Saudi Arabia surged by 377,000 bpd from to 11.016 million bpd in November, according to OPEC’s secondary sources, while Iranian production plummeted by 380,000 bpd to below 3 million bpd—2.954 million bpd. The other notable increases were in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and in Kuwait, who, together with Saudi Arabia, moved in to anticipate a plunge in Iranian oil exports when U.S. sanctions on Tehran’s oil returned.After Iran, the second-largest oil production slump in November came from Venezuela, whose crude production plunged again, by 52,000 bpd to stand at 1.137 million bpd.  Related: Global Market Turbulence Caps Oil PricesOPEC’s December MOMR was the first in five months which didn’t cut forecasts for the world oil demand growth for 2018 and 2019, although the cartel pointed out that risks are more skewed to the downside for next year. In 2018, global oil demand is seen rising by 1.50 million bpd, while demand in 2019 is seen up by 1.29 million bpd.“Rising trade tensions, monetary tightening and geopolitical challenges are among the issues that skew economic risks even further to the downside in 2019. The upside appears limited, but is mainly resulting from a resolution of trade-related issues and the possibility of slower than currently anticipated monetary policy normalization by G4 central banks,” OPEC said.Non-OPEC oil supply growth for 2019 was revised down by 80,000 bpd to 2.16 million bpd, due to a lower forecast for Canada with Alberta’s mandatory production cut, and a downward supply forecast for the 10 non-OPEC participants in the OPEC+ deal in the first half of 2019.

2018-12-12,"This year’s crude oil futures trading activity is on track for a record high, as trading volumes in China’s new yuan-denominated futures contract is offsetting lower activity in the world’s top benchmarks and most active contracts, Brent and WTI, Reuters reports, citing data from exchanges.The Chinese oil futures, launched in March this year on the ShanghaiInternational Energy Exchange (INE), are still seen mainly as a Chinese market for Chinese traders who don’t trade on market fundamentals. The futures contract struggles to become truly international for market participants, while inconsistent trading volumes are not helping international traders to use the Shanghai futures as a financial hedge.Analysts have also flagged storage costs in China as one of the problems that traders could face in the delivery mechanism of the Chinese oil futures contract. Storage costs in China are much higher than elsewhere. The reason for the higher cost is limited storage capacity availability and the requirement that the cargo be stored at a specific storage facility rather than at any available.Nevertheless, in its first year of launch, the Chinese crude oil futures contract has already taken a 6-percent market share from the most active contracts, WTI and Brent.According to data from exchanges quoted by Reuters, the trading volumes of Brent and WTI dropped to 207.2 million lots of 1,000 barrels each this year through December 10, compared to 220.17 million lots traded last year. Trading volumes in WTI and Brent are set to decline in 2018 for the first time since 2013.But the Shanghai crude oil futures volume trade of 13 million lots until December 10, added to the WTI and Brent trading volumes, will push the oil futures trading globally to a record high this year.“If a new exchange achieves 6 percent market share vs the two incumbents within the first year of trading that’s fairly impressive,” John Driscoll, director of Singapore-based consultancy JTD Energy, told Reuters.To compare, the year in which the Brent futures contract started trading in 1988, Brent took a 3.1-percent share from then-dominant WTI contract.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Pushes-Global-Oil-Trading-To-All-time-High-In-2018.html,"Dec 12, 2018 at 11:52 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 12, 2018",China Pushes Global Oil Trading To All-time High In 2018
2018-12-12,"OPEC+ will need to stay 700,000 bpd below its agreed targets of 31.8 million bpd through 2019 in order to bring a recovery in Brent prices to the $70 level, Rystad Energy says.The OPEC countries and Russia agreed on December 7 to cut oil production by 1.2 million bpd in 2019 – slightly larger than the 1.0 million bpd cut expected by many observers.“The OPEC+ agreement predictably came up short of what Rystad Energy argued would be required to fully balance the market in 2019.

2018-12-12,"Crude oil prices remained steady today after the Energy Information Administration confirmed an API estimate of a crude oil inventory draw but a much smaller one than API’s 10.18 million barrels. The authority reported crude oil inventories in the United States had gone down by 1.2 million barrels in the week to December 7, the second weekly draw after a string of weekly increases, after a draw of 7.3 million barrels a week earlier.Oil prices have proved stubborn in the last couple of weeks, moving up and down by too little for the comfort of those who would like to see them higher in light of some strong tailwinds such as OPEC’s agreement to cut production and a major field outage in Libya.Yet it seems the relentless increase in U.S. production is countering these tailwinds. Daily output is likely to have continued rising last week, but the actual numbers will become public at a later time, when the EIA processes production data from companies in the sector.In gasoline, the EIA said inventories had gone up by 2.1 million barrels in the first week of December, with daily production at 10.5 million barrels, versus 9.7 million bpd a week earlier.In distillate fuel, the authority reported a daily production rate of 5.5 million barrels and an inventory decline of 1.5 million barrels. A week earlier, refineries churned out 5.6 million bpd of distillate fuel. In total, refineries last week processed 17.4 million bpd of crude, down from a week earlier.Analysts seem to be beginning to worry the supply cut announced by OPEC+ would not be enough to compensate projections for slowing demand growth as pressure increases on emerging economies.What’s more, Russia said it will reduce its production slowly and gradually, justifying the decision with challenging winter conditions, which means the reduction in global supply will not be felt as quickly as it would have otherwise, serving to relieve some of the worry. Acting fast on these concerns, Reuters reports, money managers have reduced their long positions on both Brent and WTI to three-year lows since the beginning of December.
