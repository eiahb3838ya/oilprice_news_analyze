2018-05-02,"“$60 is like the new $100,” Dallas Fed economist Michael Plante told Reuters last month, commenting on the effect of the oil prices on the Texas economy.Oil production in the Permian—the only U.S. shale play whose output didn’t decline during the downturn—is now booming and is fueling the economic growth in West Texas cities of Midland and Odessa. Employment is near all-time highs, unemployment is at record lows, home sales, building permits, and hotel revenues are surging. Wages are up, and so are prices.Long-time residents are aware of the fact that the boom won’t last forever, but right now, the economy is booming, as is oil production in West Texas.The EIA estimates that the Permian production hit 3.11 million bpd in April and is set to rise to 3.183 million bpd in May—the highest increase among the main U.S. shale plays.According to the latest Dallas Fed Energy Survey, executives from 65 exploration and production firms put the average breakeven prices to profitably drill a new well at $47 a barrel for Midland in the Permian—the lowest among all U.S. oil basins. For existing wells, the survey found that Midland’s average oil price to cover operating expenses was $25 a barrel, with responses ranging from just over $10 to as much $50 per barrel oil. Midland’s average breakeven for existing wells is again the lowest in the United States.

Midland ranked fourth in terms of midsize cities with the highest growth.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said in March in its county employment and wages summary that Midland, Texas, had the largest percentage increase in employment between September 2016 and September 2017—10.4 percent—well above the national job growth rate of 1.0 percent. In Midland, the biggest jump in employment was in natural resources and mining, which gained 4,526 jobs in the year through September 2017—a 24.4-percent increase.More recent data, as of February 2018, shows that Midland employment increased by 9.1 percent in February from a year ago, and unemployment rate dropped to 2.5 percent from 3.8 percent in February 2017. Taxable spending, car purchases, hotel and motel receipts, sales of existing homes, and permits for new homes all surged this year compared to last.The record low unemployment, however, is a headache for business owners—not only in oil and gas—who struggle to find enough local staff for construction projects and restaurants, for example, Midland Mayor Jerry Morales told Reuters.The unemployment rate in Odessa, Texas, dropped to 3.2 percent in February from 5.4 percent in February 2017. The oil industry remains “in sharp recovery mode in the region, though, and is pushing general economic growth to ever higher – and soon to be record – levels,” according to economist Karr Ingham at InghamEcon.“And Midland-Odessa direct oil & gas employment, which did decline during the contraction, is rapidly increasing and has very nearly reached the pre-downturn high point and should do so in the coming month or two,” according to Ingham.Yet, the rig count, drilling permits, well completions, and prices remain well below the peak 2014 levels. But this “is not to suggest the industry is in the midst of a slow recovery as it tries to crawl its way back to the salad days of the previous expansion; it does suggest that efficiencies have improved so greatly that those levels of activity are not presently needed to produce more petroleum in the Permian Basin than has ever been produced before,” said Ingham.  Related: Cheap Hydrogen Could Soon Become A Reality The record Permian production, however, has started to create bottlenecks in the biggest U.S. shale play—as a shortage of crews, frac sand, roads, trucks, pipeline takeaway capacity, and increased natural gas volumes out of oil wells threatens to slow down oil production growth.According to S&P Global Platts assessments, Midland WTI crude averaged at an $8.25 a barrel discount to Houston WTI crude in April, surging from a $2.82 per barrel discount in February. Companies such as Noble Energy and Encana Corporation seek to reduce their exposure to Midland, Texas, crude prices.Despite possible growth slowdown ahead, Midland and Odessa’s economies are for now feeling the Permian boom.“The recovery from the downturn is swift and magnificent. And the ‘recovery’ phase is nearing its end –that will be accomplished when the Midland-Odessa Regional Economic Index reaches and exceeds its prior peak and moves into previously uncharted record territory,” Ingham said in mid-April.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Texas-Sees-Unparalleled-Economic-Boom-From-Oil-Prices.html,"May 02, 2018 at 17:16 | Tsvetana Paraskova","May 02, 2018",Texas Sees Unparalleled Economic Boom From Oil Prices
2018-05-02,"China has become the world’s largest oil importer, and despite establishing the largely successful yuan-denominated oil futures, Beijing will have to grapple with an overlooked geopolitical and economic consequence as it seeks to quench its thirst for oil and gas.As China relies more on both foreign crude oil imports and imported gas in the form of LNG and piped gas from neighboring countries, the outflow of petro-dollars or in this case petro-yuan will see the country contend with the decades-long dilemma that the U.S. faced; a massive transfer of capital to foreign oil producers.Worse yet, for the U.S. at the time of its foreign oil import dependence, the transfer of funds was often to less-than-friendly Middle Eastern oil producers, including Saudi Arabia who in the 1970s and 80s could arguably have been called a quasi-friend or at least an ally of convenience. The U.S. needed Saudi oil as American oil production continued to decline while U.S. oil consumption spiked to unprecedented levels. For their part, the Saudis needed, and still do, the U.S. Navy’s 5th to keep open vital shipping lanes including the world’s most important maritime chokepoint, the Strait of Hormuz, to allow the export of massive cargoes of crude to foreign markets.China’s insatiable oil thirstChina surpassed the U.S. in annual gross crude oil imports in 2017 by importing 8.4 million barrels per day bpd compared with 7.9 million bpd of U.S. crude oil imports. China had become the world's largest net importer (imports less exports) of total petroleum and other liquid fuels in 2013. New refinery capacity and strategic inventory stockpiling, combined with declining domestic production, were the major factors contributing to its recent increase in imports.In 2017, an average 56 percent of China's crude oil imports came from OPEC producing members. This declined from a peak of 67 percent in 2012, while Russia and Brazil increased their market share of Chinese imports more than any other country, from nine to 14 percent and from two to five percent respectively.  Related: Can India Break Its Oil Addiction?Moreover, imports from Russia, which passed Saudi Arabia as China's largest source of foreign crude oil in 2016, totaled 1.2 million bpd last year, while Saudi Arabia accounted for 1.0 million bpd. OPEC countries, and some non-OPEC countries, including Russia, agreed to reduce crude oil production through the end of 2018, which allowed other countries to capture Chinese market share in 2017.Of course, in the past decade, U.S. overreliance on Saudi and OPEC oil has been offset in large part due to the wonders of the U.S. shale oil and gas boom that has seen Saudi oil imports to the States reduced recently to multi-decade lows, not seen since the 1980s.The question now is: Will China find itself in the same foreign oil dependence quandary as the U.S. did from the early 1970s until the past decade? All signs indicate that the answer to this question is a resounding yes.The sheer size of China’s economy, its prolonged run of economic growth, its massive population and its own oil and gas production problems create a scenario that will not only make Beijing more reliant on oil from unstable or geopolitically volatile regions, including Iran, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, and other OPEC producers, but also from Russia, particularly pipeline oil and gas imports from that country.China needs U.S. oil & gasThese dynamics also point to the advantage that U.S. oil exports offer for not only China but the entire Asia-Pacific region. Security of supply must be implemented into Beijing’s oil import mix strategy, even if it is a tough pill to swallow for the country as it exchanges trade war barbs with Washington.Not only do U.S. shale oil and LNG production offer enhanced security of supply, as well as a sophisticated regulatory system and developed pipeline infrastructure, there are also price incentives that are competitive over its oil and gas exporting rivals.For starters, the price spread between West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and Brent crude and other global benchmarks presents an incentive for China and others to procure more U.S. light, sweet crude for its refineries. Even if some of those refiners are not configured to process light grades, it can be used as a blend with other crude types, yielding higher profitable finished products like jet fuel, gasoline, kerosene and others.As far as U.S. LNG goes, the fact that exported American LNG is indexed to Henry Hub pricing is an also attractive selling point for U.S. supplies of the super-cooled fuel. Despite a recent pivot from longer tem LNG contracts to shorter contracts and pure spot trading, the fact remains that the bulk of LNG volumes sold in the Asia- Pacific region, which accounts for two-thirds of all global LNG demand, is still predominately tied to an oil-indexation pricing formula.In November, China imported a record amount of crude oil from the U.S., some 289,999 bpd; admittedly a small market share in light of the 9.01 million bpd of crude which the Middle East imported that month.Yet, U.S. crude's discount to Brent will continue to drive more American oil imports., particularly since that price spread is based on more barrels being pumped in the U.S., (amid higher global oil prices) which is projected to soon overtake Russia as the world’s top oil producer at 11 million bpd. Russia and OPEC members’ output, for their part, will likely hold steady or dip further if the OPEC/non-OPEC production cut is extended past 2018.  Related: How Oil Hedging Could Cost Companies $7 BillionU.S. oil production rose to a record 10.264 million bpd in February, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday.Growing Brent/WTI price spreadOn Friday, the Brent-WTI price spread neared $7, widening further to encourage U.S. producers to export crude to customers overseas. In March, the spread stood at only $3 per barrel. Some of the price divergence not only comes from more U.S. output, but geopolitical worries, mostly from tensions in Syria, Yemen and the ongoing jockeying for position in the region between Riyadh and Tehran, even causing the Saudis to consider a pro-Israeli pivot in bilateral relations, also putting upward pressure on Brent and other benchmark prices.Michal Meidan, head analyst for Asian energy policies and geopolitics at research consultancy Energy Aspects told CNBC late last year, ""I think the U.S. certainly is poised to capture a lot of that growth. ""There is a huge amount of interest in U.S. crude to Asia broadly but to China specifically.""All of this comes full circle as Beijing sends massive amounts of wealth to fill the coffers of foreign oil producers, in essence helping (in time) to offset the trade imbalances with the U.S. and others and in effect helping these producers wrest by geopolitical and economic leverage away from Beijing.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinas-Growing-Oil-Demand-Has-Created-A-Geopolitical-Dilemma.html,"May 02, 2018 at 16:57 | Tim Daiss","May 02, 2018",China’s Growing Oil Demand Has Created A Geopolitical Dilemma
2018-05-02,"After yesterday the American Petroleum Institute served a not so pleasant surprise to oil bulls by reporting a 3.43-million-barrel increase in crude oil inventories in the United States, the Energy Information Administration confirmed the bad news, estimating a 6.2-million-barrel increase in U.S. oil inventories for the week to April 27.Refineries processed 16.6 million bpd of crude producing 10 million barrels per day of gasoline and 5 million barrels of distillate. This compares to 9.9 million bpd of gasoline and 5 million bpd of distillate a week earlier.Gasoline inventories increased by 1.2 million barrels last week, after an 800,000-bpd increase a week earlier. Distillate stockpiles were down by 3.9 million barrels, compared with a 2.6-million-barrel decline a week previously.WTI traded at US$67.27 a barrel at the time of writing, with Brent crude at US$72.90. WTI was slightly up from yesterday’s close, while Brent was down a third of a percentage point.Oil markets anticipate that President Trump will decide to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal, which would lead to a spike in prices, although how high a spike it will be is anyone’s guess: the decision has been expected for a few weeks already.However, Trump might just surprise everyone by deciding to stay in the deal despite alleged evidence that Iran lied about its nuclear program, which was revealed publicly by Israel’s PM Benjamin Netanyahu. If this happens, prices will definitely correct downwards.Booming U.S. production will also have a negative impact on price developments when the EIA releases its full weekly petroleum report later in the day. Last week, the daily average stood at 10.59 million barrels, making the U.S. the second-largest producer globally, behind only Russia with 11 million bpd. Yet it is possible that the U.S. will overtake Russia relatively soon: since the start of 2018, daily production has grown by more than a million barrels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Slip-On-Large-Crude-Inventory-Build.html,"May 02, 2018 at 09:42 | Irina Slav","May 02, 2018",Oil Prices Slip On Large Crude Inventory Build
