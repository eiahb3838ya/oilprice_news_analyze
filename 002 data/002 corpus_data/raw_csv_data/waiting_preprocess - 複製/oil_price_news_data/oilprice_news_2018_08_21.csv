2018-08-21,"The U.S. shale industry is gearing up to spend more this year, despite assurances to maintain capital discipline.In the second quarter, shale companies signaled their intention to lift capex. Part of the reason is that costs are on the rise, so some drillers have to spend more to produce the same amount of oil and gas. That was an unexpected development, and one that shareholders are not happy about.A survey of 33 shale companies by Rystad Energy found that while the group revised up spending by about 8 percent, they only increased their expected production levels for this year by 1.4 percent. “This disconnect might suggest that the shale industry requires more capital than before to achieve healthy production growth,” Rystad said in a new report.There are some signs that the Permian, for instance, is running into some productivity problems, raising the possibility that the highly touted “efficiency gains” over the past few years are reaching their limit.On the other hand, the industry is also spending more because they have plans to increase drilling activity, which could lead to higher output next year. “[W]hile a part of increased spending is due to service cost inflation, a significant part of the incremental budget is also planned to be used for additional drilling throughout 2H 2018 to support more intensive completion activity and production growth in 2019,” Rystad Energy said in its report.  Related: Venezuela Takes Unprecedented Action To Stabilize CurrencyThe largest spending increase came from companies focused on the Permian basin, which is not surprising given both the frenzied pace of drilling in West Texas as well as the reports that the basin is suffering from bouts of cost inflation. Occidental Petroleum stood out from the bunch, with an announced increase in spending by $900 million. Occidental said it was going to deploy two additional rigs, as well as “pre-build facilities for 2019 activity,” Rystad says, “supporting higher production in the short to medium term.”Pioneer Natural Resources was another notable upward revision in spending from the second quarter. The Texas-focused shale company hiked spending guidance by $400 million with a plan to add four more rigs for 2019. The higher spending is also the result of a plan to increase completion activity, plus cost inflation.But it wasn’t just the Permian that is attracting higher levels of spending. Anadarko Petroleum said it would hike capex by $450 million across the DJ Basin and the Permian. Anadarko cited cost inflation, longer laterals, and higher non-operating activity. Meanwhile, the Bakken and Oklahoma-focused Continental Resources increased spending by $400 million for higher completion levels and additional drilling.With so much additional spending pouring into the shale patch, one would think that the industry would revise up its expected volumes of oil and gas. But collectively, the group is only expecting to produce an additional 1.4 percent.Some small companies reported the largest jump in output, including Jagged Peak Energy (+12 percent), Matador Resources (+9 percent), and QEP Resources (+8 percent). Their success is the result of “greater than planned performance of wells, underpinned by continued increase in drilling and completion efficiency,” Rystad Energy concluded. They are also growing from a relatively small base.Those upward revisions were offset by the disappointing results from a handful of other companies. Resolute Energy rounded out the bottom of the survey, revising down expected production by 5 percent, “due to less than expected oil content” from its wells so far this year. Noble Energy revised its forecasted production down by 3 percent, as it decided to defer completion on some of its drilled wells, the result of “industry constraints” in the Permian.Related: The “Weakest” EIA Report In YearsNotably, however, “none of the well-established Permian operators reported a planned decrease in completion activity in the basin this year,” Rystad said.Overall, cost inflation is playing a pivotal role in driving up spending budgets, but Rystad cautioned not to take that conclusion too far. Much of the spending increase is also laying the groundwork for higher production down the road. “While higher cost inflation played a role in the uptick in investment budgets, as evident from 2Q earnings reports, the majority of incremental capital expenditure is still planned to be directed to a larger number of intensive long-lateral completions and facility build-outs,” Rystad said.The reason that the revisions to the guidance for 2018 look so unimpressive is that these investments may only result in production increases next year. That approach makes sense given that pipeline constraints in the Permian won’t be resolved until late next year. A lot of companies are doing the upfront work on drilling, but deferring completions until 2019 when new pipelines come online and Midland differentials rise. In other words, shareholders may groan at some of the figures that came out of second quarter earnings reports, but most shale executives expect things to improve next year.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Spending-Boost-Fails-To-Raise-Production-In-The-Permian.html,"Aug 21, 2018 at 16:02 | Nick Cunningham","Aug 21, 2018",Spending Boost Fails To Raise Production In The Permian
2018-08-21,"When the long-awaited yuan-denominated oil futures launched earlier this year, opinions were split: one camp argued with passion that the days of the petrodollar were numbered, its demise a certainty. The other camp argued with just as much passion the yuan has yet to catch up with the dollar as an international currency, and the Chinese futures had basically as much of a chance as a snowflake in Hell.Now, six months later, opinions remain split, but now the two camps have some facts and figures in their arsenal. For example, a figure for the pro-petroyuan camp was the record surge in trading volume in June, to 137.5 million tons of crude for delivery in September. This translates into 137,503 lots, compared to a combined 2.6 million lots for Brent and WTI together, though, so the yuan contract still has a way to go to catch up.The anti-petroyuan camp, however, seems to have a bit more going for it after six months of trade. Bloomberg cites traders as saying that the exchange rate of the yuan coupled with storage costs make the Chinese oil contract still a high-risk endeavor.The yuan has been falling in recent months on the back of slowing economic growth and the tariff spat with the United States. There is a lot of space for surprises, however, and unpredictability is not something low-risk traders like, so exchange rates are one thing that could put them off the yuan contract.Storage costs in China are another problem. They are much higher than elsewhere: US$0.95 per barrel per month in the Shanghai International Energy Exchange compared with US$0.05 per barrel per month at the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port, Bloomberg reports. The reason for the higher cost is limited storage capacity availability and the requirement that the cargo be stored at a specific storage facility rather than at any available.  Related: The “Weakest” EIA Report In YearsSo, in light of these unpleasant facts, what does the yuan-denominated futures contract have going for them? Well, apparently, they could make sellers richer than if they choose to trade Middle East grades. The yuan contract last week traded at a considerable premium to all other oil futures, with the premium to the Middle East benchmark at US$3.35 per barrel. That makes a profit of US$6.7 million for a cargo, according to Bloomberg calculations—certainly not a small sum. But is it worth all the risks?Perhaps it is and perhaps it isn’t, but it looks like it is still too early to say. The seriousness of the risks, after all, is relative. This was evidenced in the record-high trading interest in yuan futures in early June that some observers, quoted by S&P Global Platts, attributed to the heightened price volatility in the Brent and WTI benchmarks. On the other hand, storage costs are a fixed problem that is not about to go away. It’s a risk that traders have probably already learned to factor into their calculations. Exchange rates are another cesspool of volatility, but volatility is a double-edged sword. Economic data from China may still surprise positively as it has before, despite the tariffs.Ultimately, however, the question of whether the petrodollar will be replaced by the petroyuan is moot. The reason for this is simple: the dollar is the international reserve currency because most oil is traded in dollars, says international relations professor and China expert Douglas Bulloch. It is the international reserve currency because of the size and nature of the U.S. economy. Therefore, the only way for China to succeed in having its currency stand a fighting chance against the greenback is to continue opening up its economy. Oil trading is only part of that.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Chinese-Oil-Futures-Remain-High-Risk-Endeavour.html,"Aug 21, 2018 at 15:01 | Irina Slav","Aug 21, 2018",Chinese Oil Futures Remain High-Risk Endeavour
2018-08-21,"Oil prices rose slightly on Tuesday morning as analysts think that reduced supply from Iran could have a more significant impact on oil markets than previously thought. (Click to enlarge)Chart of the Week(Click to enlarge) - The U.S. port district of Houston-Galveston recently became a net exporter of crude oil, the first time on record.- In April, exports exceeded imports by 15,000 bpd, a figure that jumped to 470,000 bpd in May.- The Houston-Galveston port area has made up more than half of the share of U.S. oil exports, a figure that jumped to 70 percent in in May as exports surged.Market Movers• Whiting Petroleum (NYSE: WLL) said that it cut completion costs by reducing the volumes of proppant it uses in fracking wells, bucking the industry trend. “New diversion techniques are allowing us to complete better performing wells while using about 30% less proppant, reducing capex by $400K/well,” CEO Brad Holly said during a presentation.• Total SA (NYSE: TOT) has walked away from the $5 billion South Pars gas project, but is having trouble unloading its stake. Total has essentially given up on trying to get a waiver on sanctions from the U.S. government. • Several days of strikes at oil and gas platforms in the North Sea run by Total SA (NYSE: TOT), which interrupted production, have ended.Tuesday August 21, 2018Oil prices edged up Monday and at the start of trading on Tuesday. “Prices are being supported by the prospect of lower oil supply from Iran,” Commerzbank said in a note. Also, the sharp fall over the past few weeks may have run its course, taking some steam out of the market, which reduces some of the downside risk. Still, concerns about the health of the global economy, and the recent rout in emerging market currencies, raises the threat of lower-than-expected demand.China using oil tankers from Iran. In order to get around U.S. sanctions, China is reportedly seeking to use oil tankers from Iran for its purchases. “Chinese buyers of Iranian oil were beginning to shift their cargoes to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) for nearly all their imports,” Reuters reported. The move could keep Iran’s oil exports from falling more than they otherwise would.Saudi Arabia suffers capital flight. According to Bloomberg and JPMorgan Chase, Saudi Arabia is set to see $65 billion in capital flee the country this year, or about 8.4 percent of GDP. The figure is down from the $80 billion that was withdrawn last year, but is still significant. Analysts attribute the political risk of the whims of the Saudi monarchy, and the “dimming of optimism surrounding Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 economic plan,” Bloomberg writes.ConocoPhillips and PDVSA reach settlement. PDVSA agreed to repay $2 billion to ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) to settle claims related to international arbitration decision from earlier this year. PDVSA has agreed to pay the American oil company $500 million within 90 days, followed by quarterly payments over the next four and a half years. The hefty payment could be hard to meet for PDVSA, but the settlement could restore operations at the oil company’s facilities in the Dutch Caribbean, which could slow the decline in oil exports. On a related note, PDVSA reached a settlement with NuStar Energy LP (NYSE: NS), which should allow the Venezuelan oil company to regain control of a storage facility on the island of St. Eustatius.  Related: Venezuela Takes Unprecedented Action To Stabilize CurrencyCitgo asks court for delay in share auction. Earlier this month a U.S. federal judge ruled that Citgo was the “alter ego” of PDVSA (as a subsidiary), which means they are essentially the same entity. The ruling has exposed Citgo to asset seizure by creditors hunting down PDVSA. The result could be an auctioning off of Citgo’s shares. Citgo is now appealing the decision and asking for a delay in the auction.  Trump administration argues conserving fuel no longer needed. The Trump administration argued in a policy statement that the U.S. no longer needs to conserve fuel because of the abundance of oil and gas production. The argument was used to justify weakening fuel economy standards.Bakken producers flaring at high levels. The inability to gather and process all of the natural gas that is coming out of the shale fields in North Dakota has resulted in high levels of flaring. According to S&P Global Platts, shale drillers flared nearly 17 percent of the gas produced in June, or 388 million cubic feet per day. It was the third straight month that producers failed to comply with the 15 percent limit on gas flaring.DOE selling 11 million barrels from SPR. The U.S. Department of Energy is selling 11 million barrels of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve ahead of the November deadline for U.S. sanctions on Iran. The proposed sale of sour crudes are slated for October 1 through November 30.Alaska North Slope is a “Super Basin.” A new report from IHS Markit finds that the North Slope of Alaska is poised to become a “Super Basin.” Much of the oil and gas reserves have been out of reach because of a variety of barriers, but production has the potential to increase by 40 percent over the next eight years. The North Slope holds an estimated 38 billion barrels of oil equivalent in remaining recoverable resources (about 16.8 billion boe has been produced to date).

Brazil announced a relaxing of local content rules for the Libra oil field, paving the way for $16 billion in investment, the government says. Brazil has requirements for offshore pre-salt projects, setting a minimum percentage of equipment and services that come from domestic sources. Critics say the requirements inflate costs and delay projects. For the massive Libra field, Brazil has decided to relax those requirements in order to push the project along. The Libra field is being developed by Petrobras (NYSE: PBR), Total SA (NYSE: TOT), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) and China’s CNPC and CNOOC.Virginia governor is advised to scrap permits for natural gas pipelines. An advisory council to Virginia Governor Ralph Northam recommended that he rescind crucial Clean Water Act certifications for the $6.5 billion Atlantic Coast pipeline and the $3.7 billion Mountain Valley pipeline. The two projects are crucial arteries that will move Marcellus shale gas to the U.S. southeast. Both are under construction.U.S. gasoline demand stagnates. Higher retail gasoline prices have translated into flat growth in demand in the U.S. this year, after several years of growth. U.S. traffic rose by only 0.3 percent in the second quarter, year-on-year, after several years of annual growth rates of about 2 to 3 percent, according to Reuters. Gasoline prices are up more than 55 percent from their low point in February 2016. The EIA expects gasoline consumption to remain unchanged this year.By Tom Kool of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Edges-Higher-On-Iran-Fears.html,"Aug 21, 2018 at 13:25 | Tom Kool","Aug 21, 2018",Oil Edges Higher On Iran Fears
2018-08-21,"Indonesia recorded a substantial decline in crude oil imports in June, official statistical data quoted by S&P Global Platts showed, as the country boosted domestic production.At 833,630 metric tons, the June crude oil imports were 48.8 percent lower than the amount imported in May, as local state energy company Pertamina focused its efforts on growing domestic production amid a falling rupiah that made imports costlier, S&P Global Platts notes.Earlier this month Reuters reported that Pertamina will get access to an additional 225,000 bpd of crude as part of a government plan seeking to reduce its dependence on imports. The plan involves foreign oil field operators in Indonesia selling all their production to the state.Indonesia, which is the biggest energy consumer in Southeast Asia, and also the biggest oil producer in the region, pumps about 775,000 bpd, of which Pertamina currently receives 550,000 bpd, while the rest is sold abroad. Now, with all local production going to the state company, Pertamina will be able to reduce its crude imports by 60 percent.  Related: Oil Markets Are In For A Bumpy RideAt the same time, the state company is trying—and being encouraged by the government—to expand its local operations by replacing foreign operators as part of a growing resource nationalism drive in the region and elsewhere. In early August, Pertamina took over one of Indonesia’s largest oil blocks, in Sumatra, from Chevron, whose contract expires in 2021.The state company outbid the supermajor, which had offered US$88 billion in investments through 2041, although the exact size of its “better proposal” as quoted by the Nikkei Asian Review was not revealed. According to a statement from the energy ministry at the time, Pertamina’s takeover of the Rokan field will increase its share in domestic oil production from 23 percent to 60 percent in 2021.Earlier this year, Pertamina took over a major gas block previously operated by Total and Inpex.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Indonesia-Books-Sharp-Drop-In-Oil-Imports.html,"Aug 21, 2018 at 11:10 | Irina Slav","Aug 21, 2018",Indonesia Books Sharp Drop In Oil Imports
2018-08-21,"The Texas Gulf Coast oil terminals sent abroad more crude than they received in April, the Energy Information Administration said this week. During that month, crude oil exports from the Houston-Galveston port district exceeded imports by 15,000 bpd. Over the next month, the advantage of exports over imports welled further, to an impressive 470,000 bpd.Total U.S. oil exports in may hit a record of 2 million bpd, with Houston-Galveston’s share of the total at a record-breaking 70 percent, from an average of about 50 percent since the middle of 2017, the EIA said.The bulk of crude oil exports from the Houston-Galveston area went to China, Canada, Italy, and the UK, with exports to China averaging 300,000 bpd in both June and July. This month, however, not a single crude oil cargo has been loaded for China, according to media reports, amid growing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.Meanwhile, however, Texas is on track to become the biggest oil producer after Russia and Saudi Arabia, according to production estimates by HSBC, quoted by CNN. If the estimates turn out to be correct, the Lone Star State will be pumping almost 6 million bpd in 2019.RBC goes further, expecting production in Texas to boom to more than 6.5 million barrels daily over the next seven to ten years. Not everyone is so optimistic, however. Skeptics believe the shale oil boom in Texas led by the Permian Basin, will peak at much lower levels than 6 million bpd, not least because of the substantial debt loads of many shale drillers in the area.Until this happens, oil production in the state is growing: over the 12 months to June it added 27 percent to 4.3 million bpd, according to the latest report from the Texas Alliance of Energy producers.
