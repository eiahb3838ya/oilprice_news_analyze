2018-08-09,"Canadian oil producers are once again suffering from a steep discount for their oil, causing the largest spread between Canadian oil and WTI in years.Western Canada Select (WCS) recently fell below $40 per barrel, dropping to as low as $38 per barrel on Tuesday. That put it roughly $31 per barrel below WTI, the largest discount since 2013.The sharp decline in WCS prices is a reflection of a shortage of pipeline capacity. Much of the talk about pipeline bottlenecks these days focuses on the Permian basin, and the unfolding slowdown in shale drilling, which could curtail U.S. oil production growth. But Canada’s oil industry was contending with an inability to build new pipeline infrastructure long before Texas shale drillers.However, the problem has grown more acute over the last 12 months. Even as pipeline takeaway capacity hasn’t budged, Canadian oil production continues to rise. Output could jump by around 230,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2018, followed by another 265,000-bpd increase in 2019, according to the International Energy Agency.(Click to enlarge) As more supply comes online, the pipelines are filling up, and there is little relief in sight. Until Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement is completed – targeted for late 2019 – midstream capacity won’t expand. Enbridge recently received a crucial permit from the state of Minnesota, through which the pipeline will traverse, even though state regulators questioned the need for the pipeline. Environmental groups and Native American tribes affected by the pipeline have vowed to mount a resistance to the replacement and construction of the Line 3, echoing the protests of the Dakota Access Pipeline from two years ago.

If there's a threat to that, then there's a direct threat to the people.”It is unclear how this will play out, but the opposition could delay the project beyond the expected start date. That means that the discount for WCS will stick around.And because there is little, if any, empty space on Alberta’s pipelines, not only will the WCS discount linger, but the benchmark could suffer from higher volatility. “The Western Canadian oil patch is operating on the edge of available takeaway capacity, which makes discounts especially sensitive to shifts in supply (e.g. Syncrude ramping up from its outage), demand (e.g. higher-than-anticipated Midwest refinery maintenance) or marginal transport capacity (e.g. rail capacity spread too thin),” Rory Johnston, a commodity economist at Scotiabank, told Oilprice.com.In theory, Alberta could build more refining capacity to process Canadian oil rather than scrambling to find pipeline space or selling at a steep discount, but refineries are expensive, and they would not resolve the problem of takeaway capacity. “The majority of hydrocarbons produced in Western Canada need to be exported--building additional refineries domestically to get around crude oil pipeline bottlenecks would simply shift it to a product pipeline capacity challenge,” Johnston said. “One way or another, those barrels still need to get to end consumers--either by pipeline, rail, barge, or truck.”  Related: Oil Prices Hit 7-Week Low As Trade War Heats UpShipping oil by rail to the U.S. Gulf Coast can cost as much as $20 per barrel or more, according to Scotiabank, double the rate for shipping by pipeline. But with the WCS discount as large as it is, the economics could still work out. However, rail companies have been hesitant to invest in new rail capacity for shipping oil, especially if the business opportunity of doing so only lasts for another two or three years. Still, crude-by-rail shipments have climbed significantly this year, hitting a record high 198,788 barrels per day in May, the latest month for which data is available. However, even if rail economics look attractive, the lack of sufficient capacity means that rail won’t be able to entirely bridge the gap.With midstream capacity stubbornly stuck without a near-term solution, the Canadian government has moved to essentially nationalize the Trans Mountain Expansion project, buying it from Kinder Morgan after the U.S.-based company moved to scrap the expansion plans.But on that front as well, Ottawa continues to receive bad news, following its desperate bid to take over the project. The Canadian Press reported on August 7 that expanding the project will cost $1.9 billion more than previously thought, and will take a year longer than expected, putting the start date off until late 2021.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Canadian-Oil-Crisis-Continues-As-Prices-Plunge.html,"Aug 09, 2018 at 17:29 | Nick Cunningham","Aug 09, 2018",Canadian Oil Crisis Continues As Prices Plunge
2018-08-09,"An initiative to expand the setback distance required for oil and gas drilling in Colorado just received a boost, potentially making the November ballot. The stricter drilling requirements could have significant implications for Colorado shale drilling, and the industry is decrying the measure as a “ban” on new drilling.Initiative 97 would require oil and gas wells to be a minimum of 2,500 feet away from “occupied structures,” which means houses, and “vulnerable areas,” which includes parks, public spaces and fresh water, among other areas. That distance is much greater than the current distance of just 500 feet for “occupied structures,” and 1,000 feet for “high occupancy buildings,” such as hospitals and schools.In other words, shale drillers would have to place their wells at a much greater distance from local communities.The campaign to impose stricter drilling requirements on the oil and gas industry gained urgency last year after an explosion from a flow line attached to a vertical well run by Anadarko Petroleum (and drilled by a previous owner) killed two people and injured two others. Earlier this year, Anadarko settled with the victims and survivors on undisclosed terms.The flow line was thought to be abandoned, but it was uncapped, and the well was only 170 feet from the victims’ house. Following the disaster, Anadarko temporarily suspended operations at 3,000 vertical wells across northern Colorado out of “an abundance of caution,” some of which were subsequently brought back online after inspections.  Related: $90 Oil Is A Very Real PossibilityThe incident is not directly related to the drilling of new wells within close proximity to houses and buildings, but it sparked ire against the oil and gas industry. An explosion in a residential area, stemming from a gas line, has led to growing opposition to a drilling presence right up against homes and businesses. And because drilling activity has increased so dramatically in recent years, public resistance has also increased in corresponding fashion.The industry is obviously opposed to the setback measure, but organizers in favor of greater setback requirements apparently secured enough signatures to put the measure up for a statewide referendum in November. “The November election in Colorado is likely an inflection point for the state’s oil and gas industry,"" according to a July research note from Height Securities LLC. In addition to the ballot measure, control of the state legislature and the governor’s mansion could potentially be in the hands of the Democrats, although what that means for the industry is still unclear. The leading candidate for governor, Congressman Jared Polis, has softened his opposition to oil and gas, after previously supporting bans on fracking.Nevertheless, the ballot measure requiring greater setbacks could have a dramatic effect. In Weld County, Colorado, where much of the drilling in Colorado’s DJ Basin takes place, the greater setback distances would put roughly 78 percent of the surface land off limits to drilling, according to the Colorado Oil & Gas Conservation Commission, a state regulator. Overall, roughly 54 percent of the state’s total land mass would be off limits. By forcing drillers to move away from buildings and neighborhoods, many fewer locations would be available to drill.The industry paints the setback requirements in apocalyptic terms. “That is effectively a ban on the industry,"" Dan Haley, president of the Colorado Oil & Gas Association, told Bloomberg in a July interview. “You’d basically have no new wells drilled in Colorado.""  Related: The Shale Boom That Will Never HappenThe share prices of companies that are active in Colorado’s DJ Basin are lagging behind some of their industry peers. Goldman Sachs notes that the stocks of companies like Extraction Oil & Gas Inc., SRC Energy Inc., PDC Energy Inc., Noble Energy Inc. and Anadarko Petroleum – all with a sizable drilling presence in the DJ Basin – are underperforming a broader ETF of shale companies by 4 to 12 percent. In fact, Extraction Oil & Gas Inc. and PDC Energy Inc. appear to be the most exposed to this referendum, “based on our assumed value for their undrilled DJ Basin resources as a percent of total company value,” Goldman Sachs wrote in a note.It is not a certainty that the measure will qualify for the November ballot. Previous initiatives aimed at increasing setback provisions came up short. In 2014 several proposed initiatives were withdrawn after the industry and local and state governments reached a compromise to setup the Oil & Gas Task Force. In 2016, an initiative to grant local communities authorities to institute greater setback distances did not qualify for the ballot after not receiving enough signatures ahead of the deadline.But after last year’s explosion, the issue is resonating a lot more with state residents. Moreover, the setback provisions will not be the only thing on the ballot. The high-stakes midterm elections promise to turn out a lot of voters, with the enthusiasm more clearly evident on the left of the political spectrum.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/A-Major-Setback-Looms-For-Colorado-Shale.html,"Aug 09, 2018 at 14:07 | Nick Cunningham","Aug 09, 2018",A Major Setback Looms For Colorado Shale
2018-08-09,"January 1, 2020 is just seventeen months away when the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will no longer permit use of heavy sulphur marine fuels without treatment of sulphur oxide emissions (SOx). The move to treat SOx from vessel emissions is expected to reduce “global air pollution, human health issues and environmental problems”. Suffice it to say, the rate of SOx scrubber installations appears to be lower than expected.The IMO anticipates 3,800 vessels will undergo scrubber installation by 2020. But in May 2018, DNV GL reported just 817 vessels ordered or installed with scrubbers. In August 2018, Argus Media reported 842, 306 of which “have the option to install, but without a date specified.” Paltry compared to a total of 60,000 international dry bulk, container, tanker and commercial vessels.Ships without these scrubbers will be required to use fuels with sulphur content not in excess of 0.5 percent from the current 3.5 percent, and, within Emission Control Areas, mostly in North America and Europe, the limit will be just 0.1 percent.Two compliance options are available to ship owners: Install scrubbers to continue using high sulphur marine fuels or pay more for middle distillate fuels like marine gasoil (MGO) and diesel that complies with the new regulation.Of course, neither solution comes without additional cost.Installation of a scrubber ranges from roughly $1.1 to $5.7 million USD and usually takes between 10-20 days to complete. However, the cost does not account for out-of-service revenue loss or the amount of planning required, which can take up to a year.Wood Mackenzie estimates that ship owners avoiding scrubbers will see fuel bills increase by as much as 25 percent as fleets are adjusted to more expensive, IMO 2020 compliant marine distillates.  Related: China’s Oil Futures Jump To Record HighSo why would ship owners risk higher fuel bills? Because additional regulations are on the horizon.IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee recently adopted an initial strategy for tackling greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), which appears to target carbon intensity and total GHG emissions. One goal presented, courtesy of an American Bureau of Shipping brief, is “to reduce the total annual GHG emissions by at least 50 percent by 2050 compared to 2008 whilst pursuing efforts towards phasing them out.” It appears the IMO is not yet finished with implementing even more stringent emissions regulations.The concern is that future IMO GHG regulations would make emissions intensive marine fuels obsolete, along with the need for scrubbers. So, what is a ship owner to do? Modifying all, or part, of the fleet to satisfy one regulation may be risky when additional regulations are being developed. Passing on scrubber installation and evolving the business to less emissions intensive fuels may be the preferred path of the majority of ship owners.Currently, about 4 million barrels per day of high sulphur marine fuels are consumed by the global fleet. But, there are signs that refiners are making changes.Earlier this month, the US Energy Information Administration and International Enterprise Singapore reported that stockpiles of high sulphur marine fuels are at a 3-decade low in the US, and a 9 year low in Singapore. Since the majority of international vessels won’t have scrubbers before January 1, 2020, low inventories of high sulphur marine fuels indicate that refineries are shifting volumes toward middle distillates.Middle distillates accounted for roughly 35 million barrels per day of oil consumption in 2017, according to the latest BP Statistical Review, an increase of about 4 million barrels per day from 2007.The IMO 2020 sulphur regulation is expected to increase demand for distillates, but also demand for low-sulphur crudes like Brent. This presents a challenge.  Related: Canada Frees Itself From Saudi Oil ImportsGlobally, heavier crudes are in short supply at the moment. Venezuela’s production continues to plummet, Mexico’s production is stagnant, Canadian production is expected to be bottlenecked by pipeline constraints for a few years, and there are suggestions that Saudi Arabia’s spare production capacity may not be able to fill the current gap caused by increasing demand and loss of supply. This is problematic as heavy crudes tend to produce greater middle distillate yields than lighter crudes.Likewise, Morgan Stanley suggests the IMO 2020 sulphur regulation coupled with economic growth scenarios will make markets for Brent tighter, with annual demand growth at 0.6 million barrels per day. Since new barrels of oil reaching markets are increasingly light (and not heavy), “more shale oil is required to produce a refined product.”Ship owners will be paying close attention to middle distillate capacity additions and availability of low sulphur crude blends over the next seventeen months. The ‘wait-and-see’ approach of some ship owners may turn into a stampede for scrubbers if IMO 2020 compliant fuels cannot be sufficiently supplied.By Justin Ziebart for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Shockwave-In-Shipping-Could-Send-Brent-Soaring.html,"Aug 09, 2018 at 10:52 | Justin Ziebart","Aug 09, 2018",Shockwave In Shipping Could Send Brent Soaring
