2019-02-05,"Hedge funds and other money managers have started to shake off the gloomy expectations of a global recession and waning oil demand growth that had seized market participants for most of the fourth quarter last year.Over the past weeks, fund managers have run to cover a lot of short positions as OPEC’s new production cuts and U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s oil have given a bullish push to the market.Money managers have been lifting their combined net long position—the difference between bullish and bearish bets—in Brent Crude for most of 2019 so far.Yet, the primary driver for the increase in the net long position was the closing of the many shorts from late 2018, rather than a renewed bullishness that oil prices will be rallying.Bullish cues such as OPEC’s resolve to rebalance the market with another round of cuts and uncertainties about Venezuela’s oil exports have supported oil prices in recent weeks, and short-sellers have run to cover bearish bets. The flight of the bears has resulted in an increased net long position, but the market will need clearer bullish signals for the bulls to return and wager on rising oil prices, analysts say.For the week ended January 29, fund managers raised their net long position in Brent Crude by 30 million barrels to 233 million barrels, according to data from ICE Futures Europe compiled by Reuters market analyst John Kemp.

However, the rise in the net long position since early December has been primarily the result of closing of the shorts, rather than a clear sign that bulls are back.Between December 11 and January 29, short positions declined by more than 60 percent from 122 million barrels to 48 million barrels, but longs increased by only 27 million barrels, as fund managers are less bearish but surely not enthusiastically bullish on the price of oil.Due to the U.S. government shutdown, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) won’t have caught up with up-to-date WTI Crude positioning data until next month.“Speculators have continued to increase their net long in ICE Brent, having bought 29,769 lots over the last reporting week, leaving them with a net long of 232,703 lots- the largest position held since early November. As we have seen in recent weeks, the increase in the spec net long has been largely driven by short covering rather than fresh longs,” Warren Patterson, Head of Commodities Strategy at ING, said on Monday, commenting on the latest positioning report.Short positions in Brent Crude dropped in the week to January 29 to their lowest number since late October 2018, according to ICE Futures Europe data compiled by Bloomberg.

With most of the sanction threat already priced in and the United States granting waivers to the biggest Iranian buyers along with concerns that global economy is heading for a slowdown, oil market participants started to fear an oversupply, which resulted in a bear market in oil and prices plunging by 40 percent between early October and Christmas Eve.With short covering and the realization that the Q4 sell-offs may have been excessive, oil prices booked their best January ever, gaining around 18 percent—the largest gain for that month of the year on record.Earlier in February, oil prices hit their highest in more than two months as OPEC’s cuts, sanctions on Venezuela, and signs of slowing U.S. crude oil production with a declining U.S. rig count provided bullish signals to market participants.The bulls, however, may need clearer signals from the global economy to start building long positions in oil again. Signs of steady economic growth and progress in the U.S.-China trade talks could be the key drivers for bulls to come back to oil. Conversely, warning signs of economic slowdown in the world or slowdown in any key economy, as well as a failure in the trade talks and a renewed trade war, could wake up bears again.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Drop-Shorts-On-Crude-Oil.html,"Feb 05, 2019 at 17:01 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Feb 05, 2019",Hedge Funds Drop Shorts On Crude Oil
2019-02-05,"A Reuters report last week examining China's renewed oil and gas exploration and production push should make the country’s oil majors, Beijing energy planners, and just about everybody else in the country’s Oil Patch breathe a collective sigh of relief - but at the end of the day, the question has to be asked, will it still be enough?First the good newsFirst the good news: China’s national oil companies are raising spending on domestic oil and gas drilling to the highest levels since 2016. This push comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping calls for the country to boost energy development to enhance national energy security. A few months ago, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), one of China's largest oil majors with some $428.62 billion in revenue in 2017, announced an oil discovery at Mahu in the Junggar basin which has 400 million tonnes of oil in place, one of the largest oil finds onshore China in years. Approximately 100 million tonnes will be technically recoverable. Annual output at Mahu will reach over 3 million tonnes per year in three years, a demonstrative addition to the 10-million tonne per year Xinjiang field.Also, a few months ago PetroChina, CNPC’s listed arm, struck sizeable oil and gas flow in exploration well Zhongqiu-1 in the Tarim basin, in the Xinjiang region, in northwestern China. Zhongqiu-1 tested a daily natural gas flow of 330,000 cubic meters and condensate of 21.4 cubic meters. The well is located in the southern part of Kuche trough in the Tarim basin, part of a 5,200 square-km exploration zone.

Production at CNPC’s flagship shale gas play Chuannan in Southern Sichuan hit a daily record of 20.11 million cubic meters in late December, up from 12 million cubic meters in October, the Reuters report said, citing CNPC data. CNPC also struck high volumes of gas flows at four exploration wells at Dagang, near Beijing, that could lead to a sizeable gas field called Lianhua.More good newsCNOOC, China's largest offshore driller, also has joined the act. The state-run firm discovered 348 meters of gas bearing deposit and 25 meters of oil-bearing structure and tested daily gas flows of 6.4 million cubic feet. Bozhong 29-6, also in the Bohai Sea, is an oil find with potentially 100 million tonnes of oil reserve in place. CNOOC completed eight appraisal wells by August 2018.Lingshui 17-2, 93-miles (150 km) off China’s southernmost province of Hainan is CNOOC’s single-largest fully-owned deepwater find. CNOOC made a final investment decision in March 2018 and total investment is estimated at $2.98 billion (20 billion yuan). Energy consultancies Wood Mackenzie and IHS Markit estimate that the block, at an average water depth of 1,450 meters (4,750 feet), has recoverable reserves of 2.5 trillion cubic feet.The rest of the storyDespite Beijing’s push to ramp up oil and gas development, it will not be enough to offset the projected increase of both hydrocarbons, while aging fields and infrastructure will still be an impediment for China's goal of greater energy security and self-sufficiency. In other words, the U.S. goal of energy independence is out of reach for China in the foreseeable future, at least in the era dominated by fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, at the end of last year, China surpassed South Korea as the second largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) and is projected to bypass Japan within the next few years to become the top global LNG importer, a dynamic unthinkable just a few years ago.China's increase gas usage comes amid Beijing’s mandate that gas make up at least 10 percent of the country’s energy mix by 2020, with further earmarks to 2030, in an effort to clean up rampant air pollution, particularly in its major urban centers. China, already the world’s largest oil and coal importer, will see its gas imports approach the level of the European Union by 2040, the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasted last year.China's oil and gas push also has geopolitical overtones amid Beijing’s ongoing development in disputed areas in the South China Sea. As China continues its buildup and militarization of artificial islands in the area, against growing international scorn and among concern from its neighbors in the region, it will nonetheless be tempted to drill for more oil and gas in these areas it now claims as sovereign territory.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/China-Faces-An-Uphill-Battle-For-Energy-Independence.html,"Feb 05, 2019 at 16:15 | Tim Daiss","Feb 05, 2019",China Faces An Uphill Battle For Energy Independence
