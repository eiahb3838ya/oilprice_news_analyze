2018-10-26,"Crude markets had a panic attack in August and September that sent prices soaring. Sanity is now returning. Prices have fallen but are likely to move even lower over the next few months.The panic attack was caused largely by Trump’s August 7 announcement that sanctions would be re-imposed on Iran. Anxiety about the effect on oil supply and prices was reasonable but the reaction was hysterical.From August 15 to October 1, Brent December futures spreads increased $3.01 (175 percent) from $1.72 to $4.73. Brent prices increased $15.53 (22 percent) from $70.76 to $86.29 (Figure 1).(Click to enlarge)Figure 1.

By October 24, spreads had fallen from $4.73 to $1.52, less than when the price rally began. Front-month Brent price decreased from $86.29 to $76.17. Prices and spreads recovered slightly on October 24 closing at $76.89 and $1.76, respectively.It seems unlikely that the correction is over. The timing depends on how long it takes for markets to fully recover from what Vitol’s Ian Taylor calls the supply fear factor. After 6 weeks of fear, markets must adjust to the reality that the “oil market is adequately supplied for now.”Related: EIA: Market Tightens As Outages From Iran, Venezuela Pile UpClearly markets are concerned about more than just Iran. Falling or uncertain output from the problem children Venezuela, Libya and Nigeria, and take-away constraints from the Permian basin are critical.Iran, however, is different because it is a completely artificial supply crisis. It was a choice made by Donald Trump and his advisors. Markets are used to the uncertainty of its problem children but not to the apparent certainty of an executive decision. The reaction was consistent with the cause—certain and linear.It was also wrong.World liquids production has, in fact, increased 2.91 mmb/d so far in 2018. Much of that increase came from producers other than U.S. & OPEC (Figure 2).(Click to enlarge)Figure 2. World liquids production has increased +2.91 mmb/d TYD 2018.

Based on that trend line, the September Brent average price of $78.89 was approximately $4.50 over-valued. Today’s front-month price of $76.23 is still over-valued by about $2.00.Data further suggests that OECD and U.S. C.I. may have reached a minimum and will continue building later in 2018 and into 2019.“We expect an oversupply in 2019, we may have to go back to the reduction,” Saudi Energy Minister, Khalid al Falih commented in late September.Positive oil supply growth began in the first quarter of 2018 and price generally lags the shift to positive growth by several quarters (Figure 4). This is important because it signals a probable lessening of or end to the upward movement of oil prices that began in early 2016.(Click to enlarge)Figure 4.

Year-to-date supply growth is about 2 mmb/d.The last time a secular shift like this occurred was in early 2014. The previous deficit shifted to supply growth in the first quarter of 2014. Prices, however, remained above $100 until the third quarter. Brent begin to fall in earnest and then collapsed during the fourth quarter of 2014.I am not suggesting that another oil price collapse is going to occur in 2019. I am saying that data indicates that lower rather than higher oil prices are more likely going forward.By Art Berman for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Why-Oil-Prices-Could-Still-Go-Lower.html,"Oct 26, 2018 at 17:23 | Arthur Berman","Oct 26, 2018",Why Oil Prices Could Still Go Lower
2018-10-26,"Is the oil market tightening too much or is a glut on the verge of making a comeback?There were a series of mixed messages from both OPEC and the IEA in recent days, offering a muddy outlook for the oil market. First was the TASS interview with Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih. His main message was that Saudi Arabia has enough spare capacity to cover for any shortfall related to Iran, although he noted that any further unexpected outages – from, say, Venezuela, Libya or Nigeria – would test the cartel’s abilities.Libya appears to be doing its part for now. Mustafa Sanalla, the head of Libya’s National Oil Corp., said that Libya is aiming to increase production to 1.6 million barrels per day by the end of 2019, which would mark the highest level since the Arab Spring and civil war began in 2011.Al-Falih remains confident that the market is well-supplied. But separately, he said that OPEC is in “produce as much as you can mode.” Meanwhile, a technical committee working within OPEC suggested that it would prepare options for 2019, which could include a production cut in order to prevent a supply glut from re-emerging. OPEC+ announced plans to increase production by 1 million barrels per day in June, but the deterioration of the global economy in recent weeks “may require changing course,” the committee said.Related: Will Big Oil Ever Win Back Investors’ Trust?Despite his confidence in the TASS interview, al-Falih sounded a bit more concerned about too much supply when he spoke to Saudi media, admitting that he was worried about rising inventories. “We (have) entered the stage of worrying about this increase,” Al-Falih said. Indeed, the U.S. has seen a sharp increase in inventories lately. Crude stocks are up more than 28 million barrels since mid-September.At the same time, the International Energy Agency is concerned about not having enough supply on hand. The head of the agency urged OPEC to increase production in December when the group meets. “Global oil markets are going through a very sensitive period -- global economic growth as well,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said in a Bloomberg interview in London Thursday. “If the oil producers care about the health of the growth of the global economy, which I believe they do, they should take the steps to further comfort the market.”Birol said that without more supply, the global economy will enter a “red zone.” Birol conceded to al-Falih’s point that the oil market might be well-supplied right now, however “the next few months might be difficult if the producers don’t increase production or give the signal for it,” he said.Related: Russia’s Oil Output Won’t Go Much HigherMeanwhile, the head of the IEA’s oil division, Neil Atkinson, warned on twitter that supply outages are still a concern.Producers have already done a lot to ensure the market is well supplied but further likely falls in supply from Venezuela and Iran and ongoing uncertainty about Libya mean that more will be needed if we are to avoid damage to the global economy. https://t.co/QR8EVC9fq1The oil market seems to be at a confusing juncture, with supply outages and limited spare capacity threatening to send prices up, which in turn, would endanger the global economy. The flip side is that the market seems well-supplied, at least for now. Rising inventories and a slowdown in demand might even amount to leading indicators of a returning supply surplus.Perhaps the Saudi oil minister’s shift in tone was strategic, coming in response to the recent fall in oil prices. Hinting at a supply glut, and possible OPEC action in response, could jolt oil prices back up. After all, Iran sanctions are about to take effect, which means supply is set to tighten in the next few weeks. “Thus the words of Saudi representatives can be interpreted as a signal that the country regards a price level of approx. $80 per barrel as comfortable, and would target this price level,” Commerzbank said in a note. “This makes the oil price a political issue once again, and as such can hardly be explained by fundamental developments alone. More pronounced price reactions to the daily news and increased volatility are therefore probable.”Whether or not the oil market is out of balance – either because of too much supply or because of too little – is a matter of perspective. To some degree, that is always the case, but with so many mixed signals floating around the market, the outlook seems especially perplexing right now.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-The-Oil-Supply-Glut-Set-To-Return.html,"Oct 26, 2018 at 17:23 | Nick Cunningham","Oct 26, 2018",Is The Oil Supply Glut Set To Return?
2018-10-26,"U.S. West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil futures are set to finish lower for the third straight week. What began as a simple pullback in a prolonged uptrend is rapidly becoming a sell-off controlled by factors outside the realm of the traditional fundamentals.Oil traders usually have the tools to control specific risk or diversifiable risk. This is the type of uncertainty that arises with the commodity you invest in. This unsystematic risk is usually reduced through diversification. When unsystematic risk arises for typical crude oil investors, they have several choices including taking profits, moving stops to protect profits, or spreading their positions with other futures contracts. There is no panic and usually the process is orderly.In the case of crude oil, investors started to book profits when uncertainty developed over whether there would be a supply shortage.Crude oil prices rallied over $13 per barrel from late August to early October on the thought that the sanctions against Iran, which start on November 4, would cause a global supply shortage. As of October 3, some analysts were calling for $100 crude oil.The case for this occurring began to weaken in early October when Saudi Arabia and Russia pledged to offset any shortfall in supply. This fueled the initial stages of the pullback, which was a normal move in any bull market until “systematic risk”, also known as “market risk” or “un-diversifiable risk” hit the market.Systematic risk started to become a factor in the crude oil market on October 10 – 11 when concerns over rapidly rising U.S. Treasury yields fueled a steep drop in U.S. equity markets. This sent volatility to heightened levels which spread across all markets including currencies and commodities. Other factors contributing to the increase in volatility including lingering concerns over the U.S.-China trade dispute, simmering tensions between the European Union and the Italian government over budgetary issues and Saudi Arabia’s involvement in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.All of these factors make great headlines, but the real reason for the sell-off in my opinion was the liquidation by the hedge funds. Government data showed the hedge funds were net long as we approached the October highs. Data since then shows the hedge funds have reduced their long positions and increased their short positions.What may have started as simple profit-taking because of a gradual change in the fundamentals regarding a potential oil shortage (unsystematic risk) blossomed into aggressive liquidation due to the unexpected stock market volatility (systematic risk). The surprise drop in equity markets led to margin calls which may have forced the hedge funds to dump profitable crude oil positions in order to raise much needed cash. This changed what was a normal correction on the longer-term charts into a change in trend on the shorter-term charts.Once the volatility settles, crude oil traders will be faced with another dilemma. On Friday, the narrative shifted to concerns about the market being oversupplied soon while losses in the global equity markets steepened, increasing worries about demand.Some analysts maintain the fundamentals in oil remain broadly bullish because of the U.S. sanctions against Iran’s oil exports. However, no one can ignore that U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose last week for the fifth consecutive week, while gasoline and distillate inventories fell, according to the Energy Information Administration.  Related: What’s Behind The Latest Oil Price Plunge?These assessments show up on the charts with the main trends up on the monthly and weekly charts and down on the daily charts.Looking at the charts of various time periods, it looks like the crude oil sell-off is likely to continue until the crude oil market finds value. This is not likely to occur until the stock market volatility slows and investors can return to focusing on the traditional fundamentals.What I would really like to see is a divergence between the stock market and crude oil. At this time, they seem to be moving in lock-step. Perhaps we’ll see this start taking shape as we approach the start of the sanctions on November 4.Technical AnalysisOne way to deal with the volatility is to strip it out of the charts by looking at the longer-term charts then working down to the daily charts. You have to remember when dealing with charts is that they represent past data. The charts identify points that can provide information on the trend as well as support and resistance levels. However, the turns in the market are controlled by the buying volume and selling volume. So it is suggested that you watch the price action and read the order flow at each key support or resistance level in order to determine if the buyers or sellers are in control.If you can’t do it day-to-day then read the CFTC’s Commitment of Traders Report. This will tell you to some degree the positions of the large speculators or hedge funds. They tend to operate on “The Herd Theory” so when one decides to buy, they’ll all start buying.Monthly Technical AnalysisMonthly Nearby WTI Crude Oil(Click to enlarge) The main trend is up. The last major bottom occurred in June 2017 at $41.34. However, momentum is shifting to the downside with the formation of a technical chart pattern called a closing price reversal top. This chart pattern does not mean the trend is changing. It indicates the selling is greater than the buying at current price levels. It does, however, often lead to 2 to 3 month corrections.If you look at the 16-month rally from $41.34, you’ll see that it consists of a series of higher-highs and higher-lows, which is essentially the definition of an uptrend.Throughout the 16-month rally, there have been three, one-month pullbacks. They have created minor bottoms at $63.57, $61.62 and $56.40. If these bottoms are violated, the minor trend will change to down. This will represent a change in the 16-month pattern.The short-term range is $41.34 to $76.85. If the minor trend changes to down then its 50% to 61.8% retracement zone at $59.10 to $54.90 will become the best downside target or value zone. Since the main trend is up, this zone will likely attract buyers.  Related: The Quiet Swing Producers: Iraq, Libya, NigeriaThe main range is $125.77 to $38.27. Its retracement zone at $82.02 to $92.35 is our primary upside target.In summary, momentum is shifting to down on the monthly chart. However, the main trend remains intact. Traders using this chart are interested in the long-term trend and will be looking for value on the pullback.Weekly Technical AnalysisWeekly Nearby WTI Crude Oil",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Real-Reason-For-The-Big-Sell-Off-In-Oil.html,"Oct 26, 2018 at 17:23 | Jim Hyerczyk","Oct 26, 2018",The Real Reason For The Big Sell Off In Oil
2018-10-26,"Libya is one of the most unreliable oil producers in OPEC and outside it. Production outages are a frequent occurrence as various armed groups vie for power over the country’s oil riches. Yet despite continued political instability and a deep economic crisis, Libya’s National Oil Corporation has ambitious goals: by the end of 2019, its chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg recently, NOC plans to pump 1.6 million bpd of crude, the level of production from the times before the 2011 civil war.And that’s not all. Further down the road, Sanalla has said earlier, plans are to boost production to 2 million bpd by 2022 and even more later. As doubtful as this may seem at first glance, NOC may have good reason to make these plans.Earlier this year some of Libya’s largest fields suffered outages resulting from militant attacks, pipeline blockades, and even excessive heat in late May. These outages caused the expected slumps in daily production to some 660,000 by the summer, but since July, the rate reached at the end of last year (around 1 million bpd) has been restored.The latest sign yet that things in Libya may be on the mend was the announcement by BP and Eni that they will start drilling at a field they share in early 2019. BP won two exploration licenses in Libya back in 2007, but the 2011 civil war interrupted its plans for the country. Eni agreed to buy a 42.5-percent interest in BP’s exploration and production sharing agreement with NOC earlier this month, and they are now ready to start drilling in the offshore block.Of course, challenges—and pretty serious ones—remain, turning Libya into an important swing producer as far as global supply is concerned. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for December, but the situation remains so tense that the UN envoy to Libya, Ghassan Salame, said earlier this month that the vote might not take place.Related: China’s Oil Addiction Is Its Main Weakness As A SuperpowerWhat this comment amounts to is a warning that Libya is still a powder keg ready to explode at any moment. Yet it seems there is now some insulation around this keg. Despite their squabbles, all the political and military factions in the Northern African state that has the largest oil reserves on the continent seem to realize jeopardizing oil revenues is counterproductive for everyone.This was demonstrated most clearly earlier this year after a prolonged fight for the Oil Crescent terminals between the LNA, which has controlled them since 2016, and militant groups eager to challenge the LNA’s dominant position. Once again the LNA won, but this time, unlike last, it handed control to the terminals to the non-recognized NOC, affiliated with the eastern government, equally unrecognized by the UN. This surprising move pushed prices up immediately, but soon after, the LNA and the official NOC settled their differences; after all, held-up cargos for export yield no revenues.So, it looks like the National Oil Corporation is getting better at dealing with production outages and challenges to its control of the country’s oil industry. While December could bring more price volatility if those in charge of the elections decide to go through with them, possibly sparking more conflicts, this might be short-lived as all those benefiting from oil exports get used to the fact that they all need these exports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-Libyas-Latest-Oil-Production-Target-Too-Ambitious.html,"Oct 26, 2018 at 17:22 | Irina Slav","Oct 26, 2018",Is Libya's Latest Oil Production Target Too Ambitious?
2018-10-26,"Baker Hughes reported a 1-rig increase for oil and gas in the United States this week, bringing the total number of active oil and gas drilling rigs to 1,068 according to the report, with the number of active oil rigs increasing by 2 to reach 875 and the number of gas rigs decreasing by 1 to reach 193.The oil and gas rig count is now 159 up from this time last year.Crude oil rallied somewhat on Friday, but not enough to erase three weeks of bearish activity in the industry that stripped roughly $10 off barrel prices. The slight uptick on Friday came as confused markets wrestle with two opposing ideas: the narrative that paints the oil market as having oil supply troubles as the Iranian sanctions loom, and poor equities performance yesterday combined with the narrative that future oil demand may not be as robust as previously thought.At 12:18pm. EDT on Friday, volatile WTI crude prices were up 0.39% (+$0.26) at $67.59. Brent crude was up 0.64% (+$0.49) at $77.37 per barrel. While up on the day, WTI is still down almost $10 per barrel from early October.Canada’s oil and gas rigs for the week increased by 9 rigs this week after losing 4 rigs last week, bringing its total oil and gas rig count to 200, which is 9 rigs more than this time last year, with a 1-rig increase for oil rigs, and an 8-rig increase for gas rigs.EIA’s estimates for US production for the week ending October 19 were for an average of 10.9 million bpd for the second week in a row, off the forever high of 11.2 million bpd for the week of October 5.By 1:09pm EDT, WTI was trading up 0.40% (+$0.27) at $67.60.
