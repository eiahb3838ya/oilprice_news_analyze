2018-05-11,"Like many other energy companies, Abu Dhabi National Energy Company—known as TAQA—suffered from the effects of low oil prices for three years. And now, like the international oil majors, TAQA is benefiting from the oil price rally, which allowed it to boost its profits.But unlike almost all oil majors who continue to stick to strict capital discipline (with Exxon one notable exception), the Abu Dhabi company is now investing more across its businesses to grow its existing assets and increase profits.TAQA reported this week a 42-percent yearly jump in its Q1 net income, to US$30 million (110 million UAE dirhams), and a 5-percent increase in revenues.“TAQA is concentrating on optimizing its assets in the oil and gas business, while studying growth opportunities in the power and water sector,” chairman Saeed Mubarak Al Hajeri said in a statement of the company. TAQA has oil and gas assets in North America, Europe, and Iraq.Higher oil prices helped TAQA to return to an annual profit for 2017, after it had booked its biggest loss ever for 2016, following billions of dollars of write downs on oil and gas assets in response to the lower oil prices.TAQA returned to profit last year and boosted revenues by 4 percent on the back of higher commodity prices. The company’s realized oil price was 27 percent higher last year compared to 2016, and the realized gas price was up 25 percent.Following several years of deep cuts, TAQA boosted its 2017 capital expenditure (capex) by 24 percent, “in line with the commodity price recovery, to protect and sustain the value of global assets,” it said in the 2017 results presentation in March. The company increased investment in core assets to maximize cash flows.  TAQA’s targeted capex for 2018 is US$572 million (2.1 billion dirhams).Commenting on the Q1 results and plans for this year’s investment, chairman Al Hajeri told Bloomberg in an interview on Thursday:“We have moved now from an environment of cost-saving to an environment of investment across the business.”“We are investing heavily on producing more profit from our business,” TAQA’s chairman said.“Our investment will be focused on growing the existing assets. We don’t have plans to make any acquisitions.”The current strategy is to hold onto the assets and continue to grow them, Al Hajeri told Bloomberg.“We run the business as if we’re holding them long term,” he said.

2018-05-11,"Due to the oil price rally, Russia expects its oil and gas revenues to jump fivefold compared to the expected revenues set in its 2018 budget, according to the Finance Ministry that now expects Russia to post a budget surplus for the first time since 2011.Oil and gas exports account for around 40 percent of Russia’s federal budget revenues.Russia’s revenues from oil and gas sales are now expected at US$44.4 billion (2.74 trillion Russian rubles) for 2018, up from US$8.5 billion (527.6 billion rubles), according to a budget amendment by the Finance Ministry.Due to the unexpectedly high oil prices, Russia is currently on track to book a first budget surplus since 2011, at 0.45 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), compared to previous expectations for a 1.3 percent of GDP deficit. The previous forecasts, however, were based on assumptions that the Urals crude blend would average around $40 a barrel. Between January and April, the price of Urals has averaged $66.15.The additional oil revenues that Russia has earned above the Urals price assumption of $40 a barrel will be allocated to reserves instead of to spending, TASS news agency reports.Analysts commented on the proposed budget amendment that Russia will have more revenues while it continues to plan for expenditures close to the original budget law.
