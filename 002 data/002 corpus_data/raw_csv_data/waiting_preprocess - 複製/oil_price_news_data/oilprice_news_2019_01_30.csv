2019-01-30,"The U.S. campaign for regime change in Venezuela could drive up oil prices.The oil markets barely budged last week when the Trump administration first recognized Juan Gauidó as President of Venezuela, and prices hardly moved even after follow-up reporting showed that the U.S.’ effort to topple Nicolas Maduro was a lot more coordinated than it may have seemed at first glance. Oil prices also largely shrugged when American sanctions on PDVSA were announced earlier this week.However, by Tuesday, oil traders finally woke up to the fact that the U.S. campaign to topple Maduro by essentially issuing an embargo on Venezuelan oil exports could lead to major disruptions in the market. WTI and Brent both rose sharply.Even as U.S. sanctions simply bar American entities from doing business with PDVSA, the measures could wreak havoc on Venezuelan oil exports. U.S. refiners import around 500,000 bpd of Venezuelan oil. American sanctions also dictate that any revenues from oil sales would be put into an escrow to be managed by the government of Juan Gauidó. Maduro would obviously not want to fund his opposition, so oil exports to the U.S. will essentially cease going forward.Those shipments can be rerouted to other buyers around the world, but PDVSA will have to endure a heavy discount. Even then, there are only so many refiners capable of processing Venezuela’s heavy oil.

To date, PDVSA has been importing diluent from the U.S. That will no longer be allowed, so it is unclear how Venezuela will manage this disruption. “If Venezuela fails to find a substitute, oil production will have to be scaled back,” Commerzbank wrote in a note.On top of that, Venezuela’s shipments to the U.S. were the only ones that earned the country hard currency. The bulk of its shipments elsewhere – mainly to China and Russia – are sent as repayment for past loans. In other words, PDVSA does not take in cash for its oil shipments to those countries. Presumably, additional shipments to China, Russia or India in lieu of the lost market in the U.S. Gulf Coast could be sold for cash, but Maduro’s government is without leverage, which means the discounts will be painful.There is also a power struggle underway to take control of PDVSA. Maduro still has control, but the jockeying for control of both the operations and the bank accounts may throw up unexpected disruptions. The company is already in serious disrepair.Looking out over the medium-term, some of the analysis around the crisis in Venezuela has been described as bearish for oil prices, since a new government could end the mismanagement of PDVSA and revive oil production in relatively short order. But that is magical thinking. “Even in the event of a peaceful transition of government, we would not expect rapid growth in the output of Venezuelan crude in the near term; it is likely to take years to stabilize output, let alone reverse declines,” Standard Chartered analysts led by Paul Horsnell wrote in a note. For U.S. refiners, the disruption could be significant. As Standard Chartered points out, the importance of Venezuelan oil comes down to the quality and proximity of the heavy crude, rather than the volume. Venezuelan oil has some of “the lowest degree of potential substitutability by other crude oils,” the investment bank wrote.Canada offers one of the few alternatives, but is constrained by a lack of pipelines. Canada itself has had to incur production shut-ins because of a shortage of pipeline space. In any event, Canadian oil largely flows to the Midwest, and as such, cannot really replace missing barrels on the Gulf Coast.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin did not appeared worried about the potential outages in Venezuela, noting that “many of our friends in the Middle East will be happy to make up the supply.”His confidence could be misplaced. The U.S. burned some bridges last year with its “friends in the Middle East,” by demanding that they increase oil production in the wake of sanctions on Iran, only to issue a bunch of waivers, leading to a crash in oil prices. Riyadh probably won’t be as trusting this time around.Indeed, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said this week that Saudi Arabia would lower its oil production to 10.1 million barrels per day (mb/d) in February and keep it at that level for the duration of the six-month OPEC+ deal. So far, there are no signs that the Saudis have a desire to help out Washington again.The result could be significant upward pressure on oil prices. “The expected decline in Venezuelan oil production and the problems in Libya will make it easier for OPEC – albeit inadvertently – to rebalance the oil market by cutting production,” Commerzbank concluded.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Major-Risk-That-Oil-Markets-Are-Underestimating.html,"Jan 30, 2019 at 17:21 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 30, 2019",The Major Risk That Oil Markets Are Underestimating
2019-01-30,"The latest oil price decline has been blamed on several things, including anxiety about the state of the global economy, the sanction waivers Washington granted Iran’s biggest crude oil buyers, and, of course, fast-rising oil production in the U.S. shale patch. But while all these were indeed factors pressuring prices, one other factor has been a strong headwind but has stayed out of the spotlight: U.S. gasoline consumption.Reuters’ John Kemp brought into the spotlight this week, citing a report from the Energy Information Administration that found gasoline consumption in the world’s largest user of crude oil remained flat on the year over the first ten months of 2018. That’s right, gasoline consumption did not move between January and October last year, despite an economy firing on all cylinders and a three month-driving season, plus relatively low prices for much of the period.The average daily consumption of the fuel, Kemp reports, hovered around 9.34 million barrels. This was 20,000 bpd lower than the average for 2017. What’s more, the EIA expects gasoline consumption to have declined by 40,000 bpd over full-2018.This, the data suggests, is attributable less to any economic growth patterns and more to a consistent decline in traffic growth, Kemp notes, adding that there are two chief factors at play when it comes to growth in traffic: the economy and oil prices. While the former, the Reuters analyst goes on, has been positive for traffic growth, this has not been the case with oil prices for much of the last 25 years, and that has discouraged traffic growth over the long term.  Related: U.S. Seeks To Cripple Venezuela’s No.1 “Vehicle For Embezzlement’’Yet in the past, slow traffic growth was not accompanying by a booming shale oil industry. In its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook, the EIA estimated U.S. crude oil production to have expanded by 1.6 million bpd in 2018 from the previous year, to 10.9 million bpd. Towards the end of the year, production ramped up to more than 11.7 million bpd. Most of this production is light crude, the kind of crude that is refined into gasoline.Earlier this month Reuters reported excess supply of gasoline in the United States coupled with slow demand has pressured refiners margins, noting refining margins for the fuel in the U.S. sank to US$45.70 a barrel last week. The drop followed the fourth weekly increase in gasoline inventories in the country, all of them quite hefty, leading to an all-time high of gasoline supplies, at 259.6 million barrels as of January 18. Over the four weeks to January 18, the Energy Information Administration reported that gasoline inventory builds reached a combined 26.6 million barrels.Now that’s quite a build in gasoline inventories and provides useful context for price movements. These are unlikely to become a lot more lively this year despite OPEC’s cuts, and this time it won’t be U.S. gasoline consumption driving them. It will be the global economy and U.S.-Chinese relations.The former, according to an earlier report by Kemp, would determine oil demand growth: “The extent of the slowdown depends on whether global growth starts to accelerate again, settles into an extended soft patch, or falls into an outright recession. The difference between each of these three scenarios amounts to several hundred thousand barrels per day (bpd) of consumption growth, dwarfing all other influences on oil prices in 2019.”The latter, U.S.-China relations, are going nowhere, it seems. Just when reports on the topic began to turn more optimistic, the U.S. indicted Chinese electronics conglomerate Huawei on charges of industrial espionage, violations of the Iranian sanctions, money laundering, and bank fraud. Naturally, this did not sit well with Beijing, which called the charges unfair and politically motivated.Meanwhile, U.S. refiners will in all likelihood be forced to continue overproducing gasoline as they increase their middle distillates production in response to growing demand—should this demand remain growing, of course—so the overhang in gasoline will stay and continue to keep a lid on prices. This is good news for drivers, but whether it will be good enough for a pickup in traffic remains to be seen.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Softer-US-Gasoline-Demand-Weighs-On-Oil-Prices.html,"Jan 30, 2019 at 17:15 | Irina Slav","Jan 30, 2019",Softer U.S. Gasoline Demand Weighs On Oil Prices
2019-01-30,"The Aramco IPO fog has been partly cleared up, after Amin Nasser, Aramco’s CEO, opened up to the press during a meeting at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. What some already expected has now become clear, Aramco’s much anticipated Initial Public Offering (IPO), will be mainly targeting downstream assets. Even though Nasser did not explicitly state this, looking at remarks made previously by Saudi Minister of Energy Khalid Al Falih, the picture is clear. As Al Falih clearly stated, the only one having ownership rights of Saudi crude oil and gas reserves in the Kingdom is Saudi Aramco, no other player will be involved.During a private meeting in Davos, Nasser indicated to mainstream Saudi news outlet Arab News that the Aramco IPO will be held in 2021, which is several years later than was expected after the announcement by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Originally, the IPO was expected at the end of 2019, but the new date is more feasible and practical for a couple of reasons.  Ongoing diversification efforts of Aramco the last years, as shown by its multi-billion downstream spending spree the last months in Asia (especially Pakistan and South Korea) have put the IPO on hold. At the same time, Aramco is fully engaged in setting up external financing for the slated SABIC acquisition, which would make it in one go the world’s largest downstream company. For the Kingdom, a downstream IPO would not only remove transparancy issues with regards to commercial operations of Aramco, price settings and reserve questions, but would also make it easier to involve foreign partners. Downstream assets also could and will include international assets, partly to support higher interest of investments funds and sovereign wealth funds.  Related: Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsNasser still did not refer to a full-downstream IPO, but the signals are clear. The Kingdom has changed tax rules, made a new concession agreement, changed Aramco into a joint stock company, and introduced a lot of fiscal reforms to facilitate a listing, but skepticism about the transparency of the Saudi “national oil company” still exists. The first next step still is the acquisition of SABIC, and the financing of this $70 billion deal. Advisors have already been contracted, while the Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF, the main shareholder of SABIC, is positive on the sale.At the same time, as stated above, Saudi minister of Energy Khalid Al Falih has reiterated that Aramco will retain exclusive rights to develop Saudi Arabia’s oil reserves. Al Falih said “there is no intention whatsoever to chip away at Aramco’s exclusivity and its concession”. This is seen by some investors as a very large risk, even if third party assessments have now shown full reserves of the company. Still, for Riyadh, the position of Aramco and ownership of the oil reserves, is of national security. Saudi Arabia’s current geopolitical position, and the growing investment attractiveness, is still directly linked to the company’s oil reserves. As shown by current developments, the oil giant is focusing on downstream JVs, even within the Kingdom, but there’s no eagerness in upstream JVs. Security of the Kingdom, and its Royal Family, Al Saud, depends 100% on the oil revenue base. With total reserves audited at a total of 268.5 billion barrels, no moves are to be expected to change this situation. Without full transparency in reserves and commercial pricing decisions (as Aramco is still to be considered a NATIONAL oil company), the only way for an IPO is downstream.Riyadh also will need to have the full ownership of oil and gas reserves in the Kingdom to leverage the latter for its multi-billion or even trillion investment schemes being presented. Without this, no major diversification can be executed and the position of the ruling royal family will also be directly affected. A cash machine like Aramco’s upstream department is simply too valuable to be offered to the markets.By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Only-Way-For-The-Aramco-IPO-Is-Downstream.html,"Jan 30, 2019 at 11:05 | Cyril Widdershoven","Jan 30, 2019",The Only Way For The Aramco IPO Is Downstream
2019-01-30,"As international prices inched up in the aftermath of Washington’s latest sanctions against Venezuela, the Energy Information Administration reported a build in crude oil inventories for the week to January 25. At 900,000 barrels, the build is modest, and follows an increase of 8 million barrels in the previous week.Gasoline inventories reversed four weeks of builds. In the week to January 24, these shed 2.2 million barrels. In the previous four weeks, cumulative gains in gasoline reached 26.6 million barrels.There has been growing worry that United States refiners are producing excessive amounts of gasoline, which has pressured their profit margins as the oversupply combines with sluggish demand. Last week, refineries churned out 9.9 million barrels daily of gasoline, compared with 9.6 million bpd a week earlier.In distillate fuels, the EIA reported a 1.1-million-barrels inventory decline and average daily production of 5 million barrels, versus 5.2 million bpd a week earlier.Meanwhile, events in Venezuela are firmly in the spotlight. Earlier this week, the U.S. announced new sanctions on the state oil company, PDVSA, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin noting the company could avoid repercussions if it recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate—albeit interim—president of the country.  Related: Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Pledge Deeper CutsAt the same time Guaido said he would be announcing new boards of directors for both PDVSA and its U.S. unit, Citgo, further increasing a sense of confusion already overwhelming Venezuela. The Maduro government responded with a freeze of his bank accounts and a travel ban, following which U.S. national security adviser John Bolton threatened “serious consequences” if anything happened to Guaido, whom Washington, along with Canada and a number of South American governments embraced as the legitimate president of Venezuela.Although price reactions to the deteriorating situation have been limited, they have been positive. However, from the perspective of drivers, the news about higher oil prices is not so good, and neither is it good for refiners, as demand for gasoline remains slow in growing.
