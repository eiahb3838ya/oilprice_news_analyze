2018-04-02,"Each month, I publish reports on ten to fifteen publicly traded upstream oil & gas companies. Part of each report is my estimation of what the company would sell for in a negotiated transaction. I’ve been doing this for almost twenty years and during that time there have been several oil price cycles. The one that started in mid-2014 includes one of the most severe declines in crude oil prices in the last century. It has lasted much longer than the average cycle, which is about two years.(Click to enlarge)I have been working in the oil & gas industry for more than 40 years, so I have lived through several boom and bust periods for upstream companies. Here are a few observations:• Oil price cycles tend to overshoot on both the upside and the downside. The price of oil never stays at the “Right Price” for very long because a small over-supply can push the price quite low and a small under-supply can cause a big price spike. During the early months of this cycle, crude oil prices dropped below $30/bbl.• Once oil supply & demand get out of balance, there is no quick fix. This is an extremely capital intense business and it takes years to set up funding and mobilize the resources for major upstream projects.• Since the Arab Oil Embargo in 1974 there has not been a prolonged period of stable oil prices and I doubt there ever will be again. We are in the 9th inning of this cycle and we are warming up for the next “boom” period of higher oil prices.• The end of a down cycle is marked by an increase in M&A activity. I think we saw the first of several big mergers announced on March 28, 2018.Let’s take a look at where we are on the price of crude oil first. Then I will look at the $9.5 Billion merger of Concho Resources (CXO) and RSP Permian (RSPP). I will try to explain how Concho arrived at the offer price and why the deal makes sense for both companies.Oil PriceThe price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was on a fairly steady uptrend from the end of June, 2017 through January, 2018. The price of oil dropped more than 10% in the first half of February and then began what turned into a classic wedge formation. Wedge patterns usually signal that a significant breakout is coming, up or down. With oil supply/demand clearly tightening, it was a good bet that the breakout would be to the upside. WTI began a push higher on March 16, 2018, testing the January high.  Related: The Ultimate Renewable Energy HybridIn my opinion, the International Energy Agency’s monthly “Oil Market Report” (3/15/2018) was the catalyst for the breakout. You can find a summary of the IEA report here:(Click to enlarge)90% of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere and more of them drive cars, trucks and SUVs each year.Demand for oil is seasonal and April is the beginning of a big increase in global demand. The summer driving season is becoming more and more the “High Season” for oil demand. Fewer homes burn oil for space heating each year and there are more SUVs on the road each year. China and India are the primary sources of rising global demand for oil. Refiners do most of their annual maintenance projects in February and early March, so they can ramp up production of transportation fuels in the second quarter. Summer blends of gasoline also require more crude oil.At the end of December, 2017 U.S. refinery utilization was up to 96.7%. In February, 2018 the utilization rate dipped below 88%, but it is now ramping back up. In last week’s EIA report the U.S. refinery utilization rate was 92.3% for the week ending March 23. By mid-April, the refinery utilization rate must be over 95% if summer demand for transportation fuels is to be met.All of the major U.S. hydrocarbon liquids inventories are at historically low levels. The U.S. and all of the OECD countries, whose economies depend heavily on these commodities, should have at least 30 days of supply. EIA reported the following levels of liquid inventories in the U.S. as of March 23, 2018. All of them are lower than the previous week.• Crude oil: 26.1 days of supply• Gasoline: 25.6 days of supply• Jet Fuel: 23.2 days of supply• Distillates: 32.1 days of supply• Propane: 24.8 days of supplyRefined products inventories have been low since Hurricane Harvey shut down more than 30 percent of U.S. refining capacity for over two months. The U.S. has struggled to get back to 30 days of supply for most of these critical refined products. The world’s largest economy is heading into the peak period of demand for transportation fuels with very little cushion.Last year, global demand for products made primarily from oil increased by 2.3 million barrels per day from the first to the second quarter. A similar spike in demand is expected this year. In their March “Oil Market Report”, IEA said that global demand for oil will exceed supply within sixty days.(Click to enlarge)“Stocks (of crude oil and refined products), and specifically OECD stocks, remain the most-cited indicator of oil market re-balancing. In this Oil Market Report, we note that in January they increased month-on-month for the first time since July. However, the increase of 18 million barrels was half the average level for January seen in the past five years. Indeed, the surplus of total OECD stocks against the five-year average fell for the ninth successive month to 50 million barrels, with products showing a very small deficit.” – IEA Oil Market Report, March 15, 2018BIG NUMBERS: Here is where I need to remind you that we live in a world that will soon be consuming over 100 million barrels per day of oil based products. The “surplus” of 50 million barrels is just twelve hours of supply.IEA goes on to say: “…market re-balancing is clearly moving ahead with key indicators - supply and demand becoming more closely aligned, OECD stocks falling close to average levels, the forward price curve in backwardation at prices that increasingly appear to be sustainable - pointing in that direction. In our chart, we assume for scenario purposes that OPEC production remains flat for the rest of 2018, and on this basis there will be very small stock builds in 1Q18 with deficits in the rest of the year. With supply from Venezuela clearly vulnerable to an accelerated decline, without any compensatory change from other producers it is possible that the Latin American country could be the final element that tips the market decisively into deficit.”Related: An Oil Price Rally Is LikelySince the IEA report was publish on March 15th there have been more signs of oil market tightening:• Petrobras, Brazil’s No. 1 oil producer announced that February liquids production was 2,080,000 barrels per day, down 1.0% month-to-month, the fifth consecutive monthly decline.• Government data shows that Colombia's oil production in February was down 4.8% year-over-year amid intensified pipeline sabotage, with negative read-through for Ecopetrol.• According to media reports, production at the Kashagan Field, an offshore oil field in Kazakhstan’s zone of the Caspian Sea (Eni, Shell, Total, Exxon are among the partners) has fallen from 300,000 barrels per day to 180,000 barrels per day just since March 20. The field, discovered in 2000 that is located in the northern part of the Caspian Sea, is considered the world's largest discovery in the last 30 years.• On March 29: Ecopetrol warned of potentially ''drastic sanctions'' by Colombia's environment minister, following an oil spill in Santander province earlier this month.The point here is that when the global oil market tightens (as it clearly is), unplanned supply disruptions can have a significant impact on the price of oil.Everyone now knows that Venezuela is going over the cliff, but what if the supply growth from the U.S. shale plays is not quite as robust as EIA keeps telling us? What if President Trump rips up the previous administration’s Iranian Nuke Deal? What if there is a forest fire in Canada that shuts in production? “Stuff Happens” and it often happens when we least expect it.Conclusion: Oil price cycles tend to over-shoot the mark. The “right price” for oil is probably around $70/bbl, but if there is any unplanned disruption in the supply chain it will go a lot higher in a hurry because for the rest of the year demand for oil will exceed supply.Increased M&A Activity Marks the End of Oil Price CyclesOn March 28, 2018 Concho Resources Inc. (CXO) and RSP Permian, Inc. (RSPP) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Concho will acquire RSP in an all-stock transaction valued at approximately $9.5 billion, inclusive of RSP’s net debt. This is the largest upstream merger since the oil price decline began in June, 2014. I believe it marks the “official end” of this oil price cycle and will only be the first of several more significant transactions.Concho and RSP Permian are running a total of 27 drilling rigs in the Permian Basin, arguably the most important oil & gas resource play on this planet. In my opinion, the Permian Basin in West Texas and Southeast New Mexico is the most valuable real estate in the United States.(Click to enlarge)Increased M&A activity marks the end of oil price cycles because the “Big Fish” take the opportunity (and they have the capital) to scoop up the “Little Fish”. RSP Permian is not really a Little Fish, but it is a great fit for Concho.On March 3, 2018 I published a profile on RSP Permian with my estimated “Fair Value” of $52.00/share. Based on Concho’s share price the day before the merger was announced, they are buying it for approximately $49.00/share, so I think the RSP shareholders got it at a fair price. Plus, this is a tax free exchange into another company that has 30% to 40% upside if oil prices stay over $65/bbl.I’m sure that multiple reports will be published that say Concho overpaid for RSP, but we won’t really know for several more years. Most of RSP’s leasehold fits in nicely with what Concho had and it gives them another 1,500 low-risk high-return horizontal drilling locations in the Permian Basin. Plus, RSP is currently producing approximately 47,000 barrels of crude oil, 11,000 barrels of NGLs and 54,000 Mcf of natural gas per day (67,000 BOE per day), which generate over $270 million per quarter gross revenues.“If (the merger is) successful, the acquisition adds approximately 92,000 net acres to Concho’s already vast Permian Basin portfolio (45,000 net Delaware Basin acres and 47,000 net Midland Basin acres). We estimate the deal value at ~$75,000 per net undeveloped acre; a significant premium to recent public deals in the area (~$35-45K on average). It could generate higher valuations for other operators in the basin and help close the gap between recent private and public deal valuations.” – Raymond James, March 29, 2018 Energy Industry BriefSo the question that I’m getting from our subscribers is “Which upstream companies are the next most likely targets?”Here is a list of the small and mid-cap companies that I follow closely along with my “Fair Value Estimate” for each of them. This does not mean any of them will be acquired and some of them may be buyers. I will say that the companies with large blocks of contiguous leasehold, most of which is held by production, are the most attractive takeover targets. I list them in alphabetical order, without any indication as to which ones I believe have the best chance of being acquired. Frankly, no one really knows, but I’m sure that most of these companies are on the “radar screens” of large-caps with deep pockets.Remember that oil price cycles tend to overshoot the mark by a wide margin. This one is definitely headed in that direction.By Dan Steffens for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Poised-To-Rise-As-Cycle-Comes-To-An-End.html,"Apr 02, 2018 at 17:27 | Dan Steffens","Apr 02, 2018",Oil Prices Poised To Rise As Cycle Comes To An End
2018-04-02,"Caution, capital discipline, cash flow, shareholder returns – these buzzwords are thrown around a lot these days, much more so than details about aggressive production growth. After years of a debt-fueled shale boom, drillers are under intense pressure to only spend within their means. For years, investors and shareholders have been demanding prudence from shale companies rather than growth-at-all-costs. But over the past year, the changes have finally become visible in the shale patch.Shale profits have been elusive, but the industry could post positive cash flow essentially for the first time this year. The turnaround is the result of cost-cutting, lowering breakeven costs, and a rally in oil prices over the past year.But that doesn’t meant that Wall Street is still in love with the shale industry, at least not the way it used to be. After getting burned by shale drillers for years, major investors are now demanding restraint…and returns on investment. “Don’t just drill, drill, drill,” Kevin Holt of Invesco, told the FT. “You have got to have a value proposition.”That was the message sent repeatedly over the past year, but there is now a body of evidence to suggest that the investors, rather than shale executives, are increasingly in control. The stock prices of shale companies have increased when cash is returned to shareholders, whereas drillers that have continued to pursue a growth-model have been punished by Wall Street.Last year, Anadarko Petroleum was one of the first to use its extra cash to launch a share buyback program. Its share price jumped on the news.  Related: An Oil Price Rally Is LikelyThe experience of other companies that have continued to ramp up spending has been starkly different. Concho Resources just announced a pricey acquisition of RSP Permian for about $9 billion, a purchase that would make it the largest producer in the Permian.Such a strategic move might have been rewarded in the past, but the company’s share price lost 9 percent immediately after the announcement – a signal from shareholders that they no longer want splashy moves. The FT notes that a sample of the 10 top U.S. shale companies have declined by 20 percent this year, but the ones that have prioritized shareholders have only lost 5 percent.“What we are trying to do in this cycle is say: don’t make the same series of mistakes as in the past,” Kevin Holt of Invesco said in the FT interview.It isn’t just small- and medium-sized shale companies that are coming around to a more disciplined approach. The WSJ notes that the share price of ConocoPhillips has outperformed its larger competitors ExxonMobil and Chevron. The difference is that Conoco has downsized since the collapse of oil prices began in 2014, selling off costly assets in order to improve its balance sheet and dish out rewards to shareholders. In 2015, the company even announced an exit from the offshore sector, stating that it would end exploration and focus its money on onshore shale.ExxonMobil and Chevron have also sold some assets, but have purchased others, and continued to expand through the three-year oil market bust. In fact, Exxon recently announced a massive increase in long-term spending – its capex will jump by 25 percent beginning in 2020. It is in the midst of large-scale development of its offshore oil discoveries in Guyana, and it also recently announced plans for a major refinery expansion along the U.S. Gulf Coast.Related: Iraq Approves Oil Production Capacity BoostThe huge outlays were met with a selloff in Exxon’s share price, a clear sign that aggressive growth has fallen out of favor with Wall Street. Instead, investors are looking for something more stable and conservative. “The oil-and-gas industry is on its way to transitioning to a more mature market in the U.S.,” Tim Beranek, an asset manager for Cambiar Investors, told the WSJ. “Over the last decade, with the evolution of shale, it was an emerging industry and attracted a lot of growth investors. Now, the shareholder base just wants return on capital.”Oil prices are significantly higher than they were a year ago, but energy stocks writ large are not. That suggests investors are either down on energy more broadly, or don’t trust the oil price rally. Still, the companies that are keeping their spending in check are the ones most favored by Wall Street.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Wall-Streets-Favorite-Shale-Stocks.html,"Apr 02, 2018 at 17:16 | Nick Cunningham","Apr 02, 2018",Wall Street’s Favorite Shale Stocks
2018-04-02,"The Permian has been stealing headlines and analyst attention over the past year, and rightly so, as it’s the only U.S. shale play that continued to grow even when all others suffered during the downturn.But higher oil prices over the past few months have prompted drillers to grow production not only in the Permian, but also in the older and more developed plays such as the Bakken in North Dakota and Montana.The Bakken crude oil production has started to grow again and is expected to beat in the first half of 2018 its own production record of 1.23 million bpd from December 2014.The Bakken was one of the first U.S. shale basins in which drillers started to pump oil via fracking. Its advantage is that the geology is better known than that of the Permian. Its disadvantage, compared to the Permian, is that its sweetest spots may have already been pumped out. Another disadvantage is that the Bakken has higher breakevens than the top areas in the Permian, making its production more susceptible to oil price swings.Yet, the Bakken oil production is currently rising, although the growth is overshadowed by the Permian boom.The number of active drilling rigs in North Dakota is currently at 60, data by the North Dakota Industrial Commission shows. This is way below the 190 active rigs in early April 2014, but double the 29 rigs in April 2016.  Related: Iraq Approves Oil Production Capacity BoostThe EIA expects production in the Bakken to rise this month by 12,000 bpd to 1.223 million bpd, although the growth pace would be much slower than that in the Permian.The Bakken production is set to beat in H1 2018 the December 2014 record of 1.23 million bpd, Lynn Helms, director of the North Dakota Mineral Resources Department, told Bloomberg earlier this year.“Everything points to more rigs, more frack crews, more activity in North Dakota,” Helms said.Continental Resources, one of the largest operators in the Bakken, said in February that its Bakken net production reached an all-time high in Q4 2017 averaging 165,598 boepd, up 58 percent over Q4 2016.In January, Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm told CNBC that Bakken’s “demise was over-exaggerated” and that “the Bakken is back stronger than ever”.“The technology’s worked better there than it has anywhere else. We’re still in the third inning of the Bakken development,” Hamm said.Another shale pioneer and tycoon, Mark Papa, disagrees—he thinks that the Bakken may have little prime spots left.Papa, currently chairman and CEO at Permian-focused Centennial Resource Development, said in a presentation in November 2017 that “Even in a constructive oil price environment, US oil growth will be more tepid than most people are predicting.” The primary reason for his not-so-rosy prediction is the “lack of remaining Tier 1 geologic quality drilling locations in the Bakken and Eagle Ford” and a lack of new substantial resource plays to boost the Bakken and Eagle Ford.The Bakken and Eagle Ford production will grow, but much less than expected, Papa said.Despite expectations of growth in the Bakken, operators will not be rushing to it, like they have been doing in the Permian, analysts say.  Related: The Petrodollar Isn’t Dead Yet“I wouldn’t say it’s back. I would say you have core players in the Bakken that are running with it, that it was their baby and that’s going to drive it,” Trisha Curtis, president and co-founder of energy analytics and advising firm PetroNerds, told Investor’s Business Daily last week.While activity is rebounding in the Bakken, it “will be incredibly sensitive to price, the most sensitive of the big three oil plays,” Benjamin Shattuck, research director for Wood Mackenzie’s Lower 48 unit, told Investor’s Business Daily.According to the Dallas Fed Energy Survey from March 2018, the average breakeven price to profitably drill a new well in the Bakken is $50, according to executives from 65 E&P firms. The range of responses was $40-$60, the narrowest range of all, narrower than even the Midland in the Permian which has the lowest average breakeven point at $47, but the range of responses varies from $20 to $70.At the current oil prices at WTI at around $65, the Bakken has good chances to beat its production record this year, if oil prices hold on to around the $60 handle.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-Bakken-Is-Booming-Once-Again.html,"Apr 02, 2018 at 16:36 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Apr 02, 2018",The Bakken Is Booming Once Again
2018-04-02,"Baghdad has approved an increase in Iraq’s crude oil production capacity to as much as 6.5 million bpd by 2022. This compares to a current production capacity of below 5 million barrels and production rates—as reported by the local energy ministry—of around 4.4 million bpd as per its OPEC quota.Crude oil export income accounts for the bulk of government revenues and is likely to continue to do so for the observable future as diversification options are few and the funds needed for a shift away from oil can only come from oil.This huge dependence on crude revenues has made Iraq the focus of doubts around compliance with the 2016 OPEC+ production cut deal, with many expecting that the cartel’s number-two producer will be the first to start cheating.Indeed, Iraq has fallen consistently short of complying with its quota of 4.35 million bpd, but its underperformance has been more than offset by Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. Iraq was also the hardest OPEC member to convince that the cuts were necessary. Now the country is in line, apparently sticking to whatever OPEC decides in terms of further extensions of the deal. At the same time, however, it is planning a tender for 11 new fields later this month.  Related: EV Revolution Could Cost Thousands Of JobsThe tender, to take place in mid-April, will offer fields in the eastern and southern parts of Iraq. According to the energy ministry, 13 foreign oil companies have signed up for the event, at which the fields will be announced.Meanwhile, Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luiebi recently told media that Iraq’s proven crude oil reserves could be much higher than previously estimated. Last year, Iraq updated the estimate for its proven reserves to 153 billion barrels from 143 billion barrels, but if Luiebi is right, the figure could actually be double the 2017 estimate. This would make Iraq the country with the largest proven oil reserves in the world.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iraq-Approves-Oil-Production-Capacity-Boost.html,"Apr 02, 2018 at 09:42 | Irina Slav","Apr 02, 2018",Iraq Approves Oil Production Capacity Boost
