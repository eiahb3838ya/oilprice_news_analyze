2018-11-02,"The decision facing President Donald Trump is not an easy one, a problem not of his own choosing and one that the politically charged president would rather not have to deal with.To sanction or not sanction Saudi Arabia over the alleged killing last month of prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi (that often criticized in his Washington Post columns the royal family and Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman) will dictate U.S.-Saudi relations more than any other development since the 1973 Arab oil embargo that sought to punish Washington and its western allies over its support of Israel in the Yom-Kippur War.The fallout and disapproval has taken on a life of its own in both diplomatic circles and among global media outlets after news initially broke that Jamal Khashoggi had been killed in the Saudi consultant in Istanbul in early October. Not that politically charged killings are anything new, unfortunately, but the problem in this instance was the inconsistencies in the Saudi narrative from the onset.Changing narrativeSaudi officials initially rejected assertions that Khashoggi had even been killed. On October 15, Trump said Saudi Arabia's King Salman denied any involvement, and the president suggested that ""rogue killers"" could be responsible for the killing. The next day, Trump said criticism of Saudi Arabia was another case of ""guilty until proven innocent."" And the following day, he said he'd contacted Turkish officials and requested audio and video related to the case, ""if it exists.""However, amid all of the uncertainty and political posturing, Turkey pushed its investigation. The Associated Press on October 16 quoted a high-level Turkish official as saying police who entered the consulate found ""certain evidence"" that Khashoggi was killed there. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that Turkish officials had shared with the U.S. and Saudis details of an audio recording said to prove that Khashoggi was beaten, drugged, and then killed minutes after entering the consulate.On the 16th, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo traveled to Saudi Arabia to discuss the case with the Saudis, who (according to Pompeo) pledged to conduct ""a thorough, transparent, and timely investigation."" By the 18th, and under even more pressure both at home and abroad, Trump said that he believed that Khashoggi was dead. ""It certainly looks that way to me,"" he told reporters, and added that there would be ""very severe"" consequences if investigations into Khashoggi's disappearance conclude the Saudis are responsible.  Related: World’s Cheapest Natural Gas Market Could Be Facing A ShortageOn October 19, after more than two weeks of denials, Riyadh released a statement acknowledging Khashoggi's death, stating that had he died in a fistfight in the consulate, adding that 18 people in connection with the killing had been arrested.Two days later, on FOX news, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said that Khashoggi was killed as a result of a ""rogue operation,"" adding that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had no prior knowledge of the incident. He also described the killing as a “murder.”Trump, for his part, amid the best bilateral relations between Washington and Riyadh in decades, still stood by his Saudi allies, all the while pledging to safe guard the countless number of American jobs that would be lost if the U.S. canceled arms sales with the Saudis. Trump also said that he wasn’t satisfied with the Saudi account over Khashoggi’s death.One of worst cover-ups in historyHowever, the next day, Trump described the killings as one of the worst cover-ups in history and said he'd leave any ramifications against the Saudis up to Congress. Pompeo said the U.S. would take “appropriate actions” against people it could identify that took part in Khashoggi’s murder, including revoking visas and economic reprisals.However, the narrative kept changing as more dismal reports came from Turkish investigators came out, including a report that Khashoggi had been strangled shortly after entering the consulate and that his body had been dismembered.Diplomatic row continuesTurkey is now demanding that the Saudis disclose the location of Khashoggi’s body after the Saudis admitted that the journalist had been murdered. “This case cannot be covered up, and we are expecting close cooperation from Saudi authorities on the investigation we are conducting transparently and meticulously,” Turkey’s Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told reporters on Thursday.There have numerous other developments over Khashoggi’s murder, including (not surprisingly) squabbling among EU members, some who want to stop arms sales to the Saudis while others push for their continuance, as well as Canada's statement that their arms sales to the kingdom would continue. Noted diplomatic and corporate leaders also pulled out of the much-heralded Future Investment Initiative (FII), which began in the Saudi capital on October 23.However, the impact over the incident that will have the greatest impact both geopolitically and in global oil markets, is how the U.S. will ultimately respond. Trump, for his part, now has little choice but play along with Congressional critics that are calling for a tougher line as well as possible economic reprisals. The Saudis, who have learned the fine art of public relations and media management since their ill orchestrated and poorly managed oil embargo against the West some four plus decades ago, have maintained that politics and economics will remain separate, in essence that even if sanctions are taken against them over the killings of Khashoggi it would not impact their oil production.  Related: Energy Earnings Pull Trinidad And Tobago From RecessionYet, if economic sanctions hit and hit hard and if they are protracted, the official Saudi line will likely change and see Riyadh and their closest Arab allies push back. And, the greatest weapon they still have is the so-called oil weapon. Though global oil markets are now shifting once again from concern about a supply crunch as new U.S. sanctions hit Iran's energy sector in a few days, worries are now growing that amid soft demand from global economic woes will continue to exert downward pressure on prices and an ensuing oil supply overhang could develop. However just the prospect of the Saudis withholding oil production as a backlash for possible sanctions would be enough to roil global oil markets who act and over react on geopolitical developments, particularly coming from Riyadh.Moreover, if Saudi Arabia did indeed withhold barrels from global oil markets in retaliation against sanctions from the U.S. and its allies, global oil markets would be impacted even more, playing into the hands of Tehran, who all along has maintained that the world could not do without Iranian oil production at full throttle.The decision facing President Trump as more developments come forth over Khashoggi’s killing has no easy answer for neither him, the U.S., the Saudis or global oil markets.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads FromOilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/This-Major-Cover-Up-Could-Wreak-Havoc-On-Global-Oil-Markets.html,"Nov 02, 2018 at 17:27 | Tim Daiss","Nov 02, 2018",This Major Cover Up Could Wreak Havoc On Global Oil Markets
2018-11-02,"Last week’s Commitment of Traders report showed yet another round of massive selling of ICE Brent and NYMEX WTI contracts by hedge funds. NYMEX WTI net length fell from 240k contracts to 206k contracts (-14% w/w) while ICE Brent net length held by funds decreased from 409k contracts to 361k (-12%.) On a combined basis net length between the two contracts stands at its lowest mark in 14 months and gross short positions held by funds have more than doubled in the last four weeks.At first glance this seems like a highly bearish set of circumstances for oil, right? The world’s speculators- many of them energy experts- seem aggressively bearish on crude. A closer look, however, reminds us that the pros don’t always get it right and that a bearish flush of headlines can frequently clear the way for the next move higher in prices. For example, gross short positions in NYMEX WTI (meaning the total amount of bearish positions held by funds) currently stand at 64k contracts. The last time this measure exceeded 50k contracts was back in July, just in time for oil to rally from $70 to $86 over the next two months. In 2017 gross shorts reached a 5yr high 180k contracts which perfectly coincided with a 2yr low in prices at $58. Even more notable was a 6yr low in hedge fund net length in January of 2016 which preceded oil’s rally from $26/bbl to $52 over the coming 5-month period. Going back just one more year to 2015 funds liquidated their net length by 30%…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Hedge-Funds-Are-Bearish-A-Bullish-Sign-For-Oil.html,"Nov 02, 2018 at 15:46 | Editorial Dept","Nov 02, 2018",Hedge Funds Are Bearish.

2018-11-02,"You have probably seen and read dozens of articles foretelling the impending fall of the Maduro regime in Venezuela. A civil war brought about by the populace’s pauperization and dearth of everything, a traditional Latin American coup d’etat organized the increasingly powerful Venezuelan military etc. – the scenarios are manifold, but we pretty much agree on the outcome. So far, all these predictions have sprung to life but that is not because they are founded on incorrect premises, more like the Venezuelan government becoming ever-flexible to prolong its rule for another couple of months or years. In the meantime, as we speak about Iran sanctions, Russia and Saudi Arabia wanting to institutionalize OPEC+ and other relevant issues, Venezuela is sinking ever lower.According to Kpler data, loadings from Venezuela in the first two decades of October were down to 0.99 mbpd, falling some 300 kbpd from September 2018 alone. Even if we are to allow some space for inaccuracies and the difficulty of tracking all flows correctly, all data sources point to the same trend – if in the beginning of 2018 the average weekly loading volume oscillated between 10 and 12 million barrels, now it moves strictly within 6-7 million barrels. To put it into blunter terms, Venezuela’s production volume has fallen back 70 years to 1940s levels. Oil workers in Venezuela have to cope with problems completely unknown or forgotten…					    ",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/An-Epitome-Of-Gloom-Venezuelas-Oil-Output-Is-Still-Plunging.html,"Nov 02, 2018 at 15:39 | Editorial Dept","Nov 02, 2018",An Epitome Of Gloom: Venezuela’s Oil Output Is Still Plunging
2018-11-02,"Drilling for oil and gas in Canada will likely decline by 5 percent in 2019, the Petroleum Services Association of Canada has forecast, blaming pipeline capacity shortages and the resultant discount in Canadian heavy to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark for the outlook.The PSAC said it expected oil and gas companies to drill 6,600 new wells next year, which would be down from 6,980 this year and the lowest number of new wells in three years. Yet over the year, drilling will increase, the PSAC forecast, as the volume of oil transported by rail, for lack of enough pipelines, continues to grow.On the good news front, the discount at which Western Canadian Select trades to West Texas Intermediate is seen to narrow from the current over US$50 a barrel to about US$24.50 a barrel, with the average WTI price for 2019 projected at US$69 a barrel.The National Energy Board of Canada recently released a report forecasting that oil and gas production will continue to increase while domestic consumption declines thanks to energy efficiency. Natural gas, along with hydropower and other renewable sources, will come to account for a bigger share of the country’s energy mix while oil production grows for exports.In the next 20 years, NEB expects crude oil production to grow by as much as 58 percent while natural gas production expands by 33 percent, both helped by improving extraction technology that will maintain the industry’s competitiveness.Not all believe, however, in this competitiveness. In fact, industry executives are quite disgruntled about the discount at which WCS is trading to WTI as well as by the high carbon taxes they are obliged to pay. The combination of factors has eaten into their bottom lines and will likely continue doing it as no new pipeline projects are coming on line any time soon and producers are forced to resort to costlier oil-by-rail options.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Gas-Drilling-In-Canada-Set-For-A-Decline.html,"Nov 02, 2018 at 14:23 | Irina Slav","Nov 02, 2018","Oil, Gas Drilling In Canada Set For A Decline"
