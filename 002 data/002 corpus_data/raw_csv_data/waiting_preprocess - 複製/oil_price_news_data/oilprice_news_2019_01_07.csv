2019-01-07,"There is a growing pile of evidence pointing to a slowdown in the U.S. shale industry, as low prices take their toll.The rate of hydraulic fracturing began to decline in the last four months of 2018, a sign that U.S. shale activity began to slow even before the plunge in oil prices. According to Rystad Energy, the average number of fracking jobs declined to 44 per day in November 2018, down from an average of between 48 and 50 for the five-month period between April and August 2018.“After reaching a peak in May/June, fracking activity in the Permian Basin has gradually decelerated throughout the second half of 2018,” Rystad Energy senior analyst Lai Lou said in a statement.“Looking at preliminary data for November, we see evidence that seasonal activity deceleration has likely started in all major plays except Eagle Ford,” Lou added. “There has been a considerable slowdown in Bakken and Niobrara in November, our analysis shows.” Rystad said that much of the slowdown can be attributed to smaller companies.The drilling data echoes that of the Dallas Fed, which reported last week that drilling activity began to slow in the Permian in the fourth quarter. Whether measuring by production, employment, business activity, equipment usage rates – a wide variety of data from the shale industry points to an unfolding slowdown.  Related: OPEC Is Losing Its Stranglehold On Oil PricesMoreover, independent data also suggests that a lot of shale drillers are not profitable with oil prices below $50 per barrel. Breakeven prices on the very best wells can run in the $30s or $40s per barrel, but industry-wide all-in costs translate into much higher breakeven thresholds. The rig count has also already plateaued after growing sharply in the first half of 2018.Still, it is a little too early to fully understand what low prices might do to the industry.That does not mean that shale drillers are down and out. Many analysts are still predicting sizable production growth this year, and very few have yet to significantly downgrade their supply forecasts.Goldman Sachs lowered its price forecast price for oil this year, but still struck a somewhat optimistic tone in a note on January 6, arguing that the selloff has “overshot current and forward fundamentals.” On the one hand, “spot prices will continue to recover with Brent backwardation set to return by summer as inventories eventually revert to 5-year average levels,” Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. On the other hand, “long-dated WTI deferred prices will gradually decline to $50/bbl as low-cost US production becomes unconstrained and producers resume hedging.”Goldman says that the inauguration of new pipelines will open up new supply. It also cites the fact that the shale industry has consistently produced well above expectations. All the while there is “little observed cost inflation,” the investment bank concluded. Goldman has a three-month Brent forecast at $62.50 per barrel and a six-month price target at $67.50 per barrel, both down from its previous forecast of $70.  Related: Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?In the long-term, Goldman says that U.S shale will keep the marginal cost of supply at roughly $50 per barrel.The investment bank says that the stocks of U.S. shale companies are oversold, but that investors are still wary. “We have begun to see consolidation, though arguably in shale more is needed,” Goldman analysts wrote in a separate report.There is a several-month lag between major price movements and dramatic changes in drilling activity and rig counts. The market downturn only began in late October, and we are only now seeing the early signs of an impact from the oil field. Gloomier data could be forthcoming as the data gathering catches up with the reality on the ground. That could potentially mean a drop in the rig count, plateauing production, or other signs of trouble in the months ahead.The flip side is that oil prices are already trending back up. WTI is hovering at the $50-per-barrel threshold, up more than 15 percent from the December low. The shale industry could hit a rough patch in the first half of 2019, but there is also a chance that things steadily improve as the year wears on.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Evidence-Mounts-For-Shale-Slowdown.html,"Jan 07, 2019 at 16:23 | Nick Cunningham","Jan 07, 2019",Evidence Mounts For Shale Slowdown
2019-01-07,"The EastMed gas pipeline between Cyprus, Greece and Israel will revolutionise the economies and geo-politics of the region. The project comes from an emerging alliance between the three countries who must move forward cautiously in the face of neighbouring States’ opposition.Eastern Mediterranean: the Bigger PictureOn December 20th, the Prime Ministers of Cyprus, Greece and Israel converged on the southern Israeli city of Beersheba. All three parties publicly committed to signing a high-level agreement in the near future. Such an agreement would solidify one of the longest and deepest underwater gas pipeline in the world.It is expected to deliver approximately 10 billion cubic meters (BCM) of natural gas to the European Union (EU) through Greece and Italy. The EU is keen to support the project and diversify its natural gas imports away from the heavily sanctioned Russian Federation and declining North Sea gas production. The EastMed project would fulfil roughly 10-15% the EU’s projected natural gas needs. The United States is also supporting the project as it sees the growing trilateral alliance as a bulwark of democracy and stability in a largely authoritarian and war-torn region.A New Regional AllianceThis development is also the culmination of an alliance that has been years in the making. The last decade has seen growing cooperation between Cyprus, Greece and Israel as all three countries have been supporting one another in various strategic areas. This includes deepening military ties in the face of an increasingly unstable and conflict prone Eastern Mediterranean. These developments are specifically aimed at Turkey, a neighboring state that has become increasingly aggressive and authoritarian. Turkey is threatening to derail the project within the context of ongoing Cypriot Conflict.  Related: Canada’s Natural Gas Crisis Is Being IgnoredThe project will be the culmination of a strategic alliance between three smaller countries who are faced with increasingly more aggressive competitors and crisis’s in the region. Turkey, Russia and Iran are all increasingly active in the region looking to forward their own interests. As the United States continues to play less of a role on the ground Cyprus, Greece and Israel will be able to create positive reinforcement through bilateral relations or the newly created secretariat economically, politically and militarily.Who Stands to Benefit?The domestic economies of the individual states within the trilateral alliance stand to benefit immensely from the project. Cyprus is estimated to have roughly 4.5 BCM of natural gas in the Aphrodite Field which is currently being developed within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a huge sum. Israel is estimated to have significantly larger amounts within its EEZ in the form of the Leviathan and Tamar fields. Both of these small countries will benefit immensely from being able to export to the massive EU market through Greece. The latter’s own economy will likely see a boost from the investment needed to support the infrastructure of the pipeline. There is also the possibility of linking the pipeline to the operational Egyptian Zohr Field.The EU will benefit from being able to diversify its energy sources. It would allow the EU to guarantee some energy security to its Member States as North Sea production falls. An over reliance on Russian natural gas also places the EU in a difficult position, because it continues sanctioning Russia over its activities in Ukraine and the meddling in the democratic processes of EU Member States. The EU will likely try to lower market prices on natural gas which have been steadily rising the last few years. In the long run, the EastMed Pipeline may provide nearly double the expected output of 10 BCM for export if ongoing offshore exploration provides positive outcomes.Who is Missing Out?Turkey and Russia are both set to lose out given current developments. Greece and Turkey have a historically difficult relationship which has recently flared up within the context of the 2016 Coup and Refugee Crisis. Cyprus and Turkey continue to butt headsover the northern half of the island following the 1974 War. Israel and Turkey were once close allies. The rise of Erdogan and the AK Party over a decade ago made Turkey a major patron of Hamas. The Mavi Marmara Incident has contributed to the deterioration in ties between the two sides. Turkey would have been the natural route for the Pipeline, but the ongoing disputes show why this will never happen.  Related: Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?Russia is the main supplier of natural gas to the EU and a historical ally of Greece. If the EU is able to continue to diversify its energy needs away from the Russian gas giants – of which the EastMed is a small but important first step – Russia will lose leverage over the EU within the context of both gas prices and geopolitical issues between the two sides. The historically close relationship between Russia and Greece is also in jeopardy. The pipeline project is heavily supported by the United States; when we couple this with Russia and Turkey’s warming ties, Russia appears to be losing a historically important relationship in an increasingly strategic region.Possible ObstaclesTwo major obstacles to the project are present in the form of the Lebanese based Hezbollah and Turkey. Hezbollah is Israel’s arch-foe, the two sides fought an all-out war in 2006, a conflict neither side wishes to repeat. This is something Hezbollah is attempting to use for its own advantage threatening to strike at Israel’s sea-based gas fields. Israel is preparing for this outcome, but Hezbollah’s missile arsenal is vast and powerful; any escalation in conflict, especially given the ongoing Operation Northern Shield may lead to disruptions in the project.President Erdogan has made it very clear that he is vehemently against any development of the Cypriot gas fields within the EEZ without some form of resolution to the conflict. This has materialized with Turkish naval action in the past and with the beginning of own explorations in the EEZ. Turkey has used military force in the past and ongoing developments in the region -specifically the US withdrawal from Syria following a phone call with Erdogan – has emboldened Turkey. Aggressive action by Turkey to safeguard its own interests cannot be discounted.By Global Risk InsightsMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Who-Are-The-Biggest-Winners-In-The-East-Med-Gas-Game.html,"Jan 07, 2019 at 13:50 | Global Risk Insights ","Jan 07, 2019",Who Are The Biggest Winners In The East-Med Gas Game?
2019-01-07,"Libya plans to pump 2.1 million bpd of crude oil by 2021 if the security situation improves, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla, said as quoted by Reuters this weekend.The ambitious plan would represent a doubling of the current rate of production in the North African country: according to Sanalla, Libya’s output currently stands at 953,000 bpd. That’s less than what the country produced earlier this year, prior to the latest blockade of the largest field, Sharara, which removed more than 300,000 bpd from the total daily average. However, it’s more than what Libya pumped in the summer when violent clashes at its oil terminals crushed oil production by almost half from the 1 million bpd earlier in the year.Sharara, on which NOC declared force majeure in mid-December, has yet to resume production when the security conditions for workers improve, Sanalla said, adding that incidents such as the blockade by tribesmen and members of the Petroleum Facilities Guard demanding payments to lift the blockade, are discouraging foreign companies from returning to Libya and helping it to expand its oil production.However, Sanalla said, BP will be returning to the country and so will Russian companies, which he declined to name. Last October, BP’s chief executive Bob Dudley told Reuters that BP and Eni will begin exploratory drilling in Libya in the first quarter of next year. BP has 85 percent in an offshore oil and gas block in the North African country, and earlier this year the Italian major struck a deal with BP to buy half of it. “I’m not sure about this year since it takes time to set up offshore rigs but Q1 for sure,” Dudley said at the time.Chinese companies might also join BP and the Russians in Libya, according to Sanalla. He announced at a news conference that he would visit China by the end of March this year to discuss investment opportunities.

2019-01-07,"Shale drilling activity in the US likely dropped to 44 jobs per day in November 2018, Rystad Energy’s analysis of preliminary data suggests.We conclude that nationwide fracking activity was mostly stable from April 2018 to August 2018 at an average daily level of 48 to 50 fracked wells. However, the fracking rate has slipped some since and remains between 44 and 46 in the period of September to November 2018.“After reaching a peak in May/June 18, fracking activity in the Permian has gradually decelerated throughout the second half of 2018,” says senior analyst Lai Lou.(Click to enlarge)“A key observation is that as we move into November, there is evidence that seasonal activity deceleration might have started in all major plays except Eagle Ford”, Lou adds. “There has been a considerable slowdown in Bakken and Niobrara in November based on our estimation.”The latest FracFocus update, a national US database, was released on January 1. It provides sufficient visibility on fracking operations across the US in November 2018, yet the uncertainty range for November remains significant, as indicated by the figure above.Some major operators are bucking the general slowdown. The largest operator, ExxonMobil, experienced a strong uptick in October, making it one of the months with the highest number of fracked wells in this period. Energen Corporation is also unaffected by the slowdown.(Click to enlarge)“In general, many of the key operators have exhibited a largely flat trend from June to October 2018, which implies that the market-wide deceleration in fracking activity has a more significant implication for smaller operators in contrast to the major players in the Permian”, Lai said. “In terms of absolute numbers, the reduction in the number of jobs for top 10 operators collectively is around 10% from June to October while the corresponding percentage for the remaining operators is as high as 48% in the same timeframe.”Rystad Energy’s analysis is based on currently available data. Underreporting implies that the reduction in percentage will be smaller then what we see as of today.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Has-US-Fracking-Activity-Peaked-Already.html,"Jan 07, 2019 at 10:05 | Rystad Energy ","Jan 07, 2019",Has U.S. Fracking Activity Peaked Already?
2019-01-07,"Historically the Mediterranean hasn’t been the focus of oil and gas producing companies. With the exception of Algeria and Libya which owe their energy industry to the Sahara region. Recent discoveries, however, have put the Eastern Mediterranean in the spotlight. In the case of Cyprus, the unresolved division of the island and overlapping claims with Turkey have created an extra layer of complexity when it comes to attracting international energy companies. Despite close political relations between Qatar and Turkey, Qatar Petroleum has joined ExxonMobil in a joint venture concerning gas exploration in the EEZ of Cyprus. Ankara, however, has remained strikingly silent on Doha’s participation.The potential of the Eastern MediterraneanOver the years major natural gas discoveries in the Eastern Mediterranean have turned the fortunes of the littoral states. Especially Israel stands to benefit as almost all of its energy needs are met by foreign producers such as Russia and Azerbaijan. The recently discovered gas fields in its EEZ are sufficient to meet the country’s needs while at the same time surplus gas is exported. Egypt, on the other hand, became a net importer of LNG in 2014 due to rising consumption and a slump in domestic production. The discovery of the massive Zohr gas field has significantly changed Cairo’s energy outlook. Egypt is slated to become a regional gas hub.On February 8, 2018, Eni announced the discovery of the Calypso gas field in Cyprus’ EEZ which confirms the extension of the ‘Zohr like’ play. This find was especially significant for Nicosia as it makes it more likely that Cypriot gas can be developed on its own. Previous discoveries such as Aphrodite are regarded too small which needed to be aggregated with non-Cypriot gas in order to become profitable. Cyprus’ difficult relations with Turkey and the northern Turkish inhabitants of the island are a serious impediment for the quick development of the gas fields.Turkey playing hardball While most of the littoral states have announced multiple discoveries, Turkey is missing out. Ankara has put pressure on gas exploration in Cypriot waters due to two reasons: first, it maintains that also the Turkish inhabitants of the island should benefit from gas production. Second, the Turks claim certain parts of Cyprus’ EEZ due to the apparent extension of the continental shelf. For this reason, Turkish naval vessels blocked an exploration ship leased by Eni in February 2018 in block 3.  Related: 2019 Could Make Or Break OPEC(Click to enlarge)Exxon and Qatar Petroleum have joined forces in exploratory work in block 10. In a statement, the Turkish government has said: ""ExxonMobil’s gas exploration in the so-called block 10 licensed by South Cyprus does not contribute to the stability of the country or the region and may change specific and delicate balances in relation to resolving the Cyprus issue”. Washington, however, has warned Turkey on several occasions not to obstruct Nicosia in its legitimate actions. Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Wess Mitchell said: ""Turkey's view on the gas exploration and drilling efforts of Cyprus is a minority one, and the United States would not take a friendly view in any harassment in Cypriot waters, especially those involving U.S. vessels"".  Related: Why Goldman Just Drastically Slashed Its Oil Price PredictionDespite Turkey’s fierce rhetoric aimed at international energy companies, Qatar Petroleum has escaped Ankara’s ire due to three reasons: first, ExxonMobil is the lead operator while Qatar Petroleum is a junior partner. Second, the exploratory ships are Exxon's which Doha doesn't have much say over. Lastly and most importantly, drilling is taking place in one of the few areas which aren't claimed by Ankara.However, Turkey's opposition to Qatar's participation is expressed behind closed doors. As long as Doha doesn’t extend its cooperation in areas which are more difficult to ignore by Ankara, the Turks will be able to overlook Qatar Petroleum's cooperation with Exxon. Furthermore, Turkey is also aware that it shouldn't erode Doha's sovereignty. The close cooperation between the countries is caused by the Saudi led bloc's blockade of Qatar and its attacks on the tiny country's sovereignty. Therefore, for now, Ankara will remain opposed to gas production in Cypriot waters while avoiding confrontation with Qatar over its economic interests. By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Energy-Experts-Are-Watching-This-Hotspot-In-2019.html,"Jan 07, 2019 at 09:47 | Vanand Meliksetian","Jan 07, 2019",Energy Experts Are Watching This Hotspot In 2019
