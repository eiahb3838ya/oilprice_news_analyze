2018-02-22,"Saudi Arabia’s Aramco has considered the possibility of shipping U.S. crude via its Motiva unit to Asia, a source in the know has told Bloomberg. The company decided that for the time being, the option is economically unviable, but could reconsider its viability in the future.Two sources from Asian refiners said that Aramco had talked with them about their interest in U.S. crude shipments, indicating the Saudi oil company was considering ways of getting in on the shale oil boom that is increasingly being referred to as a second shale revolution.Aramco’s Motiva operates the biggest oil refinery in the United States, in Port Arthur, with a capacity of over 600,000 bpd. It is through this business that it would ship U.S. crude should it decide to do so. Yet earlier this week, Bloomberg notes, West Texas Intermediate rose above the Dubai benchmark for the first time in more than a year, which may have led to Aramco dropping its plans for shipping U.S. crude to Asia.Trading in non-Saudi crude is part of Aramco’s expansion plans ahead of its initial public offering, scheduled for the second half of this year. There is no reason why U.S. crude should not be included in these plans, especially as rising U.S. shale production has asserted itself as the biggest threat to OPEC producers in general.

Trading in U.S. oil with Asian refiners would be a way for Aramco to recoup some of the losses it has suffered as a result of its lowered production.Last month, as part of this trading expansion strategy, Aramco began swapping Saudi crude for oil products made in other countries, Bloomberg reported in late January. The company’s CEO of Aramco’s trading arm told the news provider that Aramco had been supplying crude oil to refineries in the Mediterranean—where there is a lot of spare refining capacity—and in exchange was getting finished products to sell on.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-Looks-To-Profit-From-The-US-Shale-Boom.html,"Feb 22, 2018 at 10:31 | Irina Slav","Feb 22, 2018",Saudi Arabia Looks To Profit From The U.S. Shale Boom
2018-02-22,"After a surprise crude oil inventory draw reported by the American Petroleum Institute, the Energy Information Administration strengthened the good mood by confirming the draw, and a much larger one than API’s 907,000 barrels.The authority reported inventories had fallen by 1.6 million barrels in the week to February 16. This is the first inventory draw in four weeks, after the EIA reported a combined build of 10.5 million barrels for the period January 22 to February 9.At 420.5 million barrels, the EIA said, crude oil inventories are in the lower half of the seasonal average, which should stimulate optimism despite a consistent growth in production in the shale patch and upcoming refinery maintenance season that will certainly affect inventories.Gasoline production, the EIA also said, was higher in the week to February 16, at 10.1 million barrels daily, from 9.6 million bpd a week earlier. Inventories of the fuel rose by 300,000 barrels, versus a 3.6-million-barrel build a week earlier. This is the third weekly gasoline inventory increase in as many weeks.Meanwhile, oil prices have been depressed by a stronger U.S. dollar, propped up by the minutes of the last FOMC meeting released by the Federal Reserve on Wednesday. The minutes suggested the Fed remains hawkish on the U.S. economy, especially after the much higher than expected January inflation reading, so it is on track to lift interest rates at least three times by the end of the year.Higher interest rates are bullish for the dollar and what is bullish for the dollar is usually bearish for the commodities that are traded in it, and oil is the most notable example of this inverse relationship. At the time of writing, ahead of the EIA release, Brent crude traded at US$65.39 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate changed hands at US$61.98 a barrel, up 0.37 percent and 0.49 percent, respectively.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Oil-Prices-Rise-After-EIA-Reports-Crude-Draw.html,"Feb 22, 2018 at 10:11 | Irina Slav","Feb 22, 2018",Oil Prices Rise After EIA Reports Crude Draw
