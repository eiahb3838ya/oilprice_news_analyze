2018-01-17,"Crude exports out of Colombia in recent years have averaged just over 600,000 barrels per day, with exports typically highest in January, before gradually descending through the year. To start this year, however, export volumes have dropped off considerably, as unrest rises up in the country once more.Exports are currently at 540,000 bpd so far this month, considerably adrift of year-ago levels:(Click to enlarge) The drop in exports comes amid the end of a temporary ceasefire between the Colombian government and the National Liberation Army (ELN), which expired last Tuesday (January 9) after 101 days. A number of attacks on energy infrastructure across the country have subsequently followed, as well as kidnapping. We have issued a number of impact alerts to our clients in the last week highlighting the most pertinent events. The Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline experienced multiple attacks on January 10. The Caño Limón – Coveñas pipeline runs from the Caño Limón oil field to the port of Coveñas, where the vast majority of Colombian crude exports leave the country. Two days later, the Colombian army foiled an attempted bomb attack on electricity towers in northwestern Colombia.  On January 13, Ecopetrol stopped pumping on its Transandino pipeline following a bomb attack on the pipeline in Nariño, Colombia. The pipeline moves crude from the Orito field in the Putumayo basin to the port of Tumaco.  As the chart below illustrates, exports leave from both Coveñas and Tumaco - but overwhelmingly from the former. There are two predominant export grades: heavy sour Castilla blend accounts for a half of all export volumes, while medium sour Vasconia accounts for 40 percent.

Not only is the U.S. the leading destination for Colombian crude exports, but the U.S. is the leading source of crude flows into Colombia. Colombia is one of the top ten leading destinations for U.S. crude, discharging an average of 22,000 bpd of U.S. crude last year (approximately one cargo a month), with light sour Thunderhorse being the crude of choice. Ecopetrol's Manomal refinery has already received one cargo of US crude this month, while a second cargo was loaded on January 10th at PAA's St James terminal, set to be delivered in the coming days.(Click to enlarge)By Matt SmithMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Colombias-Crude-Exports-Fall-Amid-Unrest.html,"Jan 17, 2018 at 10:23 | Matt Smith","Jan 17, 2018",Colombia’s Crude Exports Fall Amid Unrest
2018-01-17,"China’s state-owned oil and gas giant CNPC has just added fuel to already strong optimism on oil markets by forecasting that crude oil demand in China will jump by 4.6 percent this year to 12 million barrels per day.In imports, the news is even better for producers: CNPC sees net crude oil imports at 7.7 percent above 2017 levels, to 451 million metric tons, or about 9.06 million barrels per day. The forecast is based on estimated GDP expansion of 6.7 percent, slightly down from 6.9 percent in 2017.Last year, China overtook the United States as the world’s largest oil importer, with its dependency on imports reaching 67.4 percent. This year, this could climb further to 68.8 percent, even if there is a recovery in domestic production.There is some bad news for refiners in the rest of Asia, however. CNPC’s Economics and Technology Research Institute, which compiled the report, expects net oil product exports (export minus imports) this year to soar by almost a third to 46.8 million tons, with diesel exports shooting up by 47 percent thanks to higher export quotas.The domestic Chinese market is in a glut of oil products, so higher quotas are very likely to be allowed to relieve it. However, this will undermine the margins of other Asian refiners who are already facing an uphill battle because of more expensive crude oil.  Related: The Labor Shortage In The Shale BoomAdding insult to injury, Chinese refiners have plans to add some 36 million metric tons in annual refining capacity, which equals about 723,000 bpd. The country’s total, then, will reach 808 million tons annually, or 16.23 million barrels daily.Most of this additional capacity will come from the teapots, whose role in China’s energy market is becoming increasingly prominent. With this additional capacity, the independent refiners will come to account for a third of the country’s refining capacity, which by 2020 will rise to 36 percent.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/CNPC-Expects-Robust-Oil-Demand-Growth-In-China.html,"Jan 17, 2018 at 09:27 | Irina Slav","Jan 17, 2018",CNPC Expects Robust Oil Demand Growth In China
