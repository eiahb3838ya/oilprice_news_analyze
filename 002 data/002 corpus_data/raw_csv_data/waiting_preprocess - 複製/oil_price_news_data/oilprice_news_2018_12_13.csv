2018-12-13,"The oil industry engaged in a secret public relations campaign to undermine U.S. fuel economy standards, according to a new investigation from the New York Times.One of the main actors was the largest oil refiner in the country, Marathon Petroleum. Marathon, along with others, ran a “stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards,” the NYT reported. The campaign argued that the U.S. no longer needs fuel economy standards because it is now such a massive producer of oil.“With oil scarcity no longer a concern,” Americans should be given a “choice in vehicles that best fit their needs,” a draft letter that was sent to members of Congress said. The Trump administration took up the talking points in its official justification for the proposed watering down of fuel economy standards.Much of the debate about the corporate average fuel economy standards (CAFE), which were set to rise to over 50 miles per gallon by 2025, focused on the position of the auto industry. But California still has the authority to set its own fuel economy standards, something that the Trump administration is now contesting as it seeks to freeze federal standards at 37 mpg beginning in 2020.The auto industry has been the dog that caught the car – it initially pressed the Trump administration to weaken the fuel economy standards, but realized that the aggressive rollback would leave the industry with a patchwork of state levels regulations, led by stricter standards in California. Different standards for different states would require automakers to produce different cars for different markets, a reality that would be more problematic than the more stringent nationwide standards.However, while media coverage focused on this back-and-forth between major automakers, environmentalists and the Trump administration, it appears that oil refiners were waging a stealth PR campaign to convince the public that the standards are no longer needed. Marathon teamed up with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), according to the NYT investigation, where they pushed facebook ads, and lobbying at the state and federal level. They trumpeted a resolution calling the fuel efficiency standards “a relic of a disproven narrative of resource scarcity.”  Related: Saudi Arabia Can Outwait The Khashoggi CrisisThe motivation is obvious: more efficient vehicles, including hybrids and increasingly electric vehicles, will cut into gasoline sales from refiners. While automakers have to worry about complying with state level fuel standards, refiners simply want to sell more fuel. Marathon’s CEO Gary Heminger told investors in early December on a conference call that the rollback in fuel economy standards would mean the refining industry would sell an additional 350,000 to 400,000 bpd of gasoline.By 2030, freezing the auto standards, as proposed, would lead to increased U.S. oil demand by between 221,000 and 644,000 bpd, according to the Rhodium Group.Some experts argue that the gutting of auto emissions standards would likely result in the largest impact on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions out of any other initiative pursued by the Trump administration, including the rolling back of methane limits, gutting the Clean Power Plan, or opening up vast new acreage for more oil and gas drilling.The cleaning up of the electricity sector – more renewable energy, and a coal-to-gas switch – is happening on its own, due to pricing pressure from cheaper and cleaner sources of energy. Transportation is a tougher nut to crack and stricter federal standards have been critical to improving fuel economy.But oil refiners were never going to sit on the sidelines and let federal regulations cut into their sales.  Related: No, The U.S. Is Not A Net Exporter Of Crude OilAmy Myers Jaffe, a Senior Fellow on Energy and the Environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, summed up the New York Times investigation on twitter:Marathon Petroleum, biggest US refiner, wants you to use more of its product, pay more for gasoline, drive car w inferior tech, lose future jobs to China, enhance Saudi/OPEC power, harm US national security  https://t.co/NWbMtcDB47The oil industry argues that regulations are not needed because the U.S. is such a large producer of oil. This sentiment has permeated much of the political establishment as well, and helps explain the sudden indifference to the selling off of the strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) after decades of rigorous safeguarding of the stockpile. Washington seems to think that producing more oil insulates the country from supply risks.But it doesn’t matter how much oil the U.S. produces, motorists are always going to be vulnerable to price swings so long as they burn a lot of fuel. Even recent data demonstrates this to be true. U.S. gasoline demand actually declined in the third quarter compared to a year earlier, a sharp drop off due to the run up in global crude oil prices. The fact that the U.S. was breaking oil production records did very little to insulate drivers from the price spike. It’s true that U.S. shale has contributed to lower global prices, but removing the most effective demand-side policy from the toolbox is really self-destructive.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Oil-Industrys-Dirty-Little-Secret.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 16:14 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 13, 2018",The U.S. Oil Industry’s Dirty Little Secret
2018-12-13,"The OPEC+ agreement succeeded in at least putting “a floor under prices,” according to a new report from the International Energy Agency. The global supply surplus is not resolved, and would likely reemerge if OPEC+ let up on its production cuts. But the agreement was welcomed by the IEA in its December Oil Market Report, where the agency noted that oil prices had been extremely volatile in the few months prior to the meeting in Vienna last week.“Recently, prices have been volatile; in early October Brent crude oil prices reached $86/bbl on concerns that the market could tighten as Iranian sanctions were implemented,” the IEA wrote. “Then, thirty-seven days later, they fell back to $58/bbl as producers more than met the challenge of replacing Iranian and other barrels. Such volatility is not in the interests of producers or consumers.”The agency kept its 2018 demand figures steady, but noted that the trend is negative. “Demand will grow by 1.3 mb/d although there are signs that the pace is slackening in some countries as the impact of higher prices lingers.”The oil market is now dominated by the “Big Three,” the IEA said, referring to Russia, Saudi Arabia and the United States. Combined those three countries produce 40 percent of global supply. “While the US was not present in Vienna, nobody could ignore its growing influence,” the IEA wrote.  Related: One Houston Gas Player Is Changing The LNG Business ForeverThe U.S. has been rapidly cutting into its own net import dependence on crude, and recently exported more oil and refined products than it imported. For much of this year, the U.S. imported an average of 3.1 mb/d, according to the IEA, a figure that is vastly lower than the more than 11 mb/d it imported regularly a decade ago. In the last week of November, the U.S. had a net export tally of 211,000 bpd. “As production grows inexorably, so will net imports decline and rising US exports will provide competition in many markets, including to some of the countries meeting in Vienna last week,” the IEA stated.Heading into 2019, there is a floor beneath prices with the OPEC+ agreement, but the path to the upside will be a bumpy one. The IEA sees non-OPEC supply growing by more than total global demand next year, which clearly lays out the challenge facing OPEC+. If non-OPEC producers (mainly the U.S.), are set to grow output by 1.5 mb/d in 2019, but demand is only set to rise by 1.4 mb/d, OPEC+ will strictly comply with the production cuts, perhaps for the full year, in order to head off a growing surplus.Moreover, the pace of shale growth continues to confound analysts. This year, shale output is expected to exceed initial estimates by some 1 mb/d. That doesn’t meant shale producers will continue to over perform; pipeline bottlenecks could slow growth, lower prices could curtail drilling activity, and financial pressure could also take a toll.Still, it is a reminder that, at a minimum, shale output is hard to predict. New pipelines are expected come online at the end of next year, which will clear the way for more drilling, completions and shipments to refineries and to the Gulf Coast for export.Other non-OPEC producers probably won’t be as fortunate. Alberta has already put in place mandatory production curbs. The non-OPEC coalition party to the OPEC+ deal have signed on to output limits. Many of the world’s conventional producers are suffering from declines. Brazil is expected to be one of the few non-OPEC countries outside the U.S. that could add supply in 2019, and not by huge amounts. “Thus the US alone is likely to be responsible for the increase in non-OPEC supply, which probably makes the IEA’s forecasted rise of 1.9 million barrels per day too optimistic,” Commerzbank wrote.  Related: Saudi Arabia Can Outwait The Khashoggi CrisisStill, unexpected outages could tighten up the market with little notice. Just days ago, Libya saw roughly 400,000 bpd go offline, much of which came from the country’s massive El Sharara field, because militias were threatening the National Oil Corp.’s operations. Local communities have been protesting the lack of benefits they see from the oil fields. “Regardless of the outcome of this particular dispute, El Sharara will remain particularly vulnerable to disruption,” Hamish Kinnear, MENA analyst at Verisk Maplecroft, said in a statement. “Whereas most of Libya’s major producing fields are located in the LNA-controlled oil crescent, El Sharara is situated in the remote and contested south west.”There are also plenty of other variables that inject a ton of uncertainty into the oil market as we head into 2019. “2019 will be no less challenging than last year for the oil market. The global economy is losing momentum, which could have a dampening effect on demand trends,” Commerzbank said in a new report. “Because the US government is unlikely to extend the granted exemptions from its Iran sanctions in early May, Iranian oil exports will presumably decrease further.”Trade wars, supply growth, economic uncertainty, sanctions, political upheaval and unexpected outages – the IEA may hope for less volatility, but 2019 does not appear to be shaping up that way.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/IEA-OPEC-Put-A-Floor-Under-Prices.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 15:51 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 13, 2018",IEA: OPEC+ Has Put “A Floor Under Prices”
2018-12-13,"Last week Bloomberg created quite a stir with this story: The U.S. Just Became a Net Oil Exporter for the First Time in 75 Years. I have seen a number of follow-up stories that praised the significance of this development, but others laughed it off as misleading or incorrect.There is some truth to both viewpoints. Yes, the headline is somewhat misleading and requires some context. But there continues to be a trend in the direction of energy independence for the U.S. So, today I want to break down the numbers so readers can understand the truth about U.S. petroleum production, consumption, and exports.Domestic Crude Production Has SurgedThe Bloomberg story is based on data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Each week the EIA publishes detailed statistics on U.S. oil production, consumption, exports, and inventories in a report called the Weekly Petroleum Status Report. So, let’s go straight to the source.For the week ending 11/30/18, the EIA reported that the U.S. produced 11.7 million barrels per day (BPD) of crude oil. That represents a 2 million BPD increase from the year-ago number. This number is generally accepted even by those who believe the Bloomberg headline was misleading.Further down in the report, the category of Products Supplied is listed at 20.5 million BPD. This is approximate U.S. crude oil consumption for the week. Thus, as some skeptics of the story suggested, the bottom line is that the U.S. is burning more than 20 million BPD while producing less than 12 million BPD. Thus, the conclusion for some was that the U.S. isn’t close to being energy independent.Other SupplyBut there is important context between these numbers. First, the 20.5 million BPD is a fairly accurate representation of U.S. consumption, but there is a large U.S. production number that isn’t included in the crude oil production numbers.  Related: Will China Turn Its Back On U.S. LNG?There is a line item called Other Supply, which consists primarily of natural gas liquids (NGLs) and fuel ethanol. This category represents a significant input to refiners in addition to the 11.7 million BPD of production (and the 4.0 million BPD of net crude oil imports). Other Supply represented 6.9 million BPD of production, and it mostly ends up as feedstock for refiners or petrochemical production. (Note that this category also includes “Refinery Processing Gain” of 1.2 million BPD, which results from refiners making products that are of a lower density than crude oil).So, Domestic Production of crude oil plus Other Supply is equal to (11.7 + 6.9) = 18.6 million BPD — which is still about 2 million BPD less than the U.S. consumes.Growing ExportsHowever, these numbers don’t account for exports. During that particular week, the U.S. imported 7.2 million BPD of crude oil, and exported 3.2 million BPD. Thus, net crude oil imports were 4 million BPD.But product exports are a different story. During that week the U.S. imported 1.6 million BPD of finished products, while exporting 5.8 million BPD (which includes some ethanol and NGLs). Net U.S. exports of finished products were 4.2 million BPD. (The U.S. became a net exporter of just finished products in 2011).The U.S. also exports crude oil. President Obama repealed the 40-year old crude oil export ban in 2015, and crude oil exports have soared since. As an aside, the reason the U.S. simultaneously imports, and exports crude is that some of what we produce isn’t a good match for our domestic refineries. So we export some domestic crude and import crude that is a better match for our refineries.Fact CheckSo, here’s a summary of the important inputs to the balance that resulted in the Bloomberg claim:• U.S. crude oil production – 11.7 million BPD• Other supply (NGLs, ethanol, processing gain) – 6.9 million BPD• U.S. crude oil imports – 7.2 million BPD• U.S. crude oil exports – 3.2 million BPD• U.S. finished product imports – 1.6 million BPD• U.S. finished product exports – 5.8 million BPD• U.S. petroleum consumption – 20.5 million BPD  Related: Analysts: Output Cuts To Balance Oil Markets In 2019So the Bloomberg headline results from a net crude oil import number of 4.0 million BPD and a net finished product export number of 4.2 million BPD. So, indeed when you consider crude oil and finished products, for the week ending 11/30/18, the U.S. was a net exporter of 0.2 million BPD of crude plus finished products. (For perspective, this average over the previous four weeks was 2.0 million BPD of net imports).Verdict: Remarkable Achievement, But False HeadlineSignificantly, this is the first time this category of weekly crude plus finished products became an export number since the EIA began reporting this information in 1991. This is a far cry from 2005, when that weekly number hit an all-time-high of 14.4 million BPD. As far as I can tell, Bloomberg is correct that this hasn’t happened in the past 75 years.But that’s not what the headline claimed. The headline said “oil.” The U.S. is still a net importer of oil to the tune of 4.0 million BPD.Further, total U.S. production of oil and other supply that is fed into refineries is 18.6 million BPD, while U.S. consumption is 20.5 million BPD. That still puts U.S. consumption at nearly 2.0 million BPD more than we produce. (It’s actually a little worse than that, because not all NGLs end up as refinery feedstock).So the bottom line is that we aren’t net exporters of crude oil, and we aren’t energy independent. But, the U.S. has trended in that direction for over a decade. Regardless of whether it remains that way, this is undoubtedly a remarkable achievement. I know a lot of people — including myself — would have scoffed at such a prediction in 2005.By Robert RapierMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/No-The-US-Is-Not-A-Net-Exporter-Of-Crude-Oil.html,"Dec 13, 2018 at 11:32 | Robert Rapier","Dec 13, 2018","No, The U.S. Is Not A Net Exporter Of Crude Oil"
