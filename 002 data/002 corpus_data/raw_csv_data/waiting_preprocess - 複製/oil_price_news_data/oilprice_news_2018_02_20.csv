2018-02-20,"Higher drilling costs could threaten the recent surge in United States shale production. Halliburton said last week that its earnings could be negatively impacted because of bottlenecks related to the supply of frac sand used in shale drilling. The Wall Street Journal reported that Halliburton’s shares were briefly halted on February 15 after Halliburton’s CFO Chris Weber told an audience at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit that the company’s first quarter earnings could take a hit by a whopping 10 cents per share.The reason, he said, was because of delays by Canadian rail companies that would slow the delivery of frac sand. Halliburton saw its shares drop by more than 2 percent on a day that saw broader gains to the S&P 500.Frac sand is integral to growing shale production, increasingly so these days with more and more sand pumped down into a well. Shale drillers have credited the heavy doses of sand with squeezing out more oil and gas from the average well. Demand for frac sand surged from 34 million tons in 2012 to 61.5 million tons in 2014. Consumption fell in the ensuing years as drilling dried up when oil prices collapsed, but frac sand consumption surpassed previous highs in 2017 as drilling resoundingly came back.

It is high quality, but expensive, particularly because it has to be shipped by rail to Texas shale fields. The FT reported that frac sand could cost $120 per short ton on at the Texas well head in 2017, essentially triple what it costs at the mine in the northern U.S.That led to new investment in frac sand mining in Texas, where “brown sand” could be produced. The quality was not as good, with finer grains, but Texas brown sand could cost a third less than its northern cousin, and it is located much closer to drilling operations.But as the mines in Texas are still in the process of coming online, the U.S. shale industry’s dependence on far away suppliers continues. And because drilling is ramping up, and the average shale driller is using more proppant than ever before, sand supplies are feeling the strain.“During the fourth quarter, we also saw cost inflation in sand and trucking. The price of sand escalated over the last few months of 2017,” Jeff Miller, Halliburton’s President and CEO, told investors on an earnings call in January. “[B]ut I believe that increasing sand capacity, particularly from localized mines combined with our supply chain strategy will reduce the cost throughout 2018.”He went on to try to reassure investors. “Now, these headwinds were anticipated, are transitory, and are not a surprise at this point in the cycle,” Miller said.

Therefore, sand cost should go down in 2018 as regional sand mines come on line and capacity is increased,” Halliburton’s CEO Jeff Miller said last month. “This will not happen overnight, but we are working with our customers and suppliers to ensure that we can provide desired profit at a reasonable cost.”In the meantime, drilling operations could face some obstacles. The WSJ reported that Evercore ISI warned in a research note that “customer frustration is rampant given the impact to production. Most other pressure pumpers will likely see similar headwinds, further hampered by the cold weather Texas experienced in January.” Canadian National Railway Co. said that it halted all new frac-sand shipments for a week in Minnesota and Wisconsin during some brutally cold winter weatherIt will be a while before the impact on oil production, if any, becomes clear. But Halliburton’s warnings indicate some near-term problems for shale drillers.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Frac-Sand-Shortage-Threatens-Shale-Boom.html,"Feb 20, 2018 at 16:57 | Nick Cunningham","Feb 20, 2018",Frac Sand Shortage Threatens Shale Boom
2018-02-20,"It has been an appalling few years for Brazil’s energy patch. Weaker oil prices, sweeping corruption scandals and the worst economic downturn ever have sharply impacted the nation’s oil industry — but improvement might finally be in sight.The aforementioned factors triggered a steep decline in investment, notably from foreign energy majors, preventing Brazil from fully exploiting its sizable oil reserves of 13 billion barrels.The key problem is that a large portion of those reserves are held in its offshore deep-water pre-salt oilfields; that means they can be complex and costly to fully exploit.However, the potential held by the pre-salt belt is tremendous. Its basins have some of the highest drilling success rates globally, and the national petroleum agency, the ANP, believes that if effectively exploited, the pre-salt area could easily double Brazil’s oil reserves.Industry insiders estimate that the largest oil field in the pre-salt acreage, the Libra field, alone, has recoverable oil resources of up to 15 billion barrels. For these reasons, during 2017, pre-salt production became a major driver of Brazil’s growing oil output. And for the first time ever, in December 2017, it was responsible for over half of the nation’s total oil output.Despite 2017 oil production rising by 4% year over year, offshore drilling activity and the number of discoveries declined significantly. This occurred due to the near-collapse of Petrobras (NYSE:PBR), which was mandated as the sole operator in the pre-salt belt. After gorging itself on debt and becoming embroiled in a far-reaching corruption scandal, it slashed spending on exploration as well as drilling activities as it focused on shoring up its balance sheet and resolving costly litigation.  Related: Why Commodity Coins Are Gaining PopularityOther factors which deterred investment were high operating costs created by local content rules, costly logistics and overbearing regulation. These, in conjunction with substantially lower oil prices, made Brazil’s pre-salt fields an unattractive investment for foreign energy companies. By December 2017, the volume of active rigs was less than half of what it was two years earlier, while the number of development wells completed during 2017 was a seventh of what it was in 2015.Nonetheless, after years of mismanagement, there are signs that this is about to change, and the world is on the cusp of witnessing the emergence of a Latin American petroleum superpower.A combination of reforms, including a formalized bidding process, relaxed local content rules, and the elimination of Petrobras’ exclusive rights to operate in the pre-salt area have made it far more appealing for foreign oil companies to invest in Brazil’s energy sector. This, in conjunction with firmer oil prices, falling lifting costs, and high demand for the commercially appealing light sweet crude produced from the pre-salt area has stimulated considerable interest among foreign businesses.The first pre-salt auction in four years and under the new regulatory regime occurred in October 2017. Six of the eight exploratory blocks on offer received bids. More promising, many foreign energy majors including Statoil (NYSE:STO), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) and BP (NYSE:BP) participated. The next auction is slated to occur in March 2018, with 70 blocks in the offshore Ceará, Potiguar, Sergipe-Alagoas, Campos and Santos basins and on-shore basins of Parnaíba and Paraná on offer.One of the earliest pioneers of investing in Brazil’s pre-salt fields, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), which didn’t participate in the October 2017 auction, is considering taking part in March 2018. The energy major previously stated that it intends to ramp up activity in Brazil, having reached a preliminary agreement with Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) to drill six wells in the Frade field in 2019.  Related: Offshore Oil Is Poised For Significant GrowthLet’s not forget about Petrobras, which owns and operates around 30% of all the pre-salt projects. There are signs that the Brazilian state-controlled energy major is on the cusp of emerging from the maelstrom of crises that swept across the company over the previous two years. This will free it up to focus on boosting its drilling activity and production. Petrobras says it intends to invest over $60 billion between 2018 and 2022 to target production growth through a combination of exploration, well development and infrastructure improvements.The appreciable level of interest — as well as investment — coming online for the pre-salt area will drive material increases in oil reserves and production over the coming years. Because of their low operating costs, the pre-salt oil fields are extremely appealing to oil companies in an operating environment where Brent is trading at less than $70 a barrel.Shell is confident that it can produce oil for as low as $40 per barrel from its pre-salt holdings, while the Libra field, which commenced production in November 2017, is estimated to have breakeven costs of a mere $20 per barrel.The tremendous scale of the potential production increases is highlighted by ANP estimates that oil output from the Libra field alone will reach 1.4 million barrels daily.With the pre-salt region measuring 800 km by 200 km and containing three oil basins, there is considerable scope for the area’s oil output to grow. That means as the pre-salt acreage is developed, Brazil’s oil production will undergo enormous growth, further expanding global oil supplies in a market battling an existing supply glut.While that will weigh on oil prices, it will be boon for Brazil’s economy — and see it become a major player among petroleum-producing nations.Matthew D.

2018-02-20,"Delays in budget payments to the National Oil Corporation of Libya could threaten the country’s oil production, NOC’s chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement. “The entire sector is suffering from these problems because of delays in the finance ministry disbursing budgets to the corporation for this year,” the statement read.Libya’s oil production averaged more than 1 million bpd in January, for the first time topping the million-bpd-mark for a full month since July 2013, data provider Genscape estimated earlier this month.Last month Libya produced 1.083 million bpd of crude oil, and 1.133 million of total liquids, Genscape said, adding that its oil production monitoring showed that oil fields in Libya appeared to operate relatively consistently in January, without steep, significant dips below the average production levels due to weather or pipeline attacks.While this is still well below the 1.6 million bpd the North African country produced before the civil war that toppled Muammar Gadaffi, it is substantially more than the 200,000 bpd it pumped in 2016.Production outages are still plaguing the industry as the political situation in the country remains highly volatile with various militant factions warring amongst themselves and sabotaging oil infrastructure as a means of making a political point.These are unlikely to cease anytime soon, according to BMI Research, which recently warned that Nigeria and Libya are at a high risk of oil industry disruption because of upcoming elections.The research firm’s analysts believe the Libyan elections, tentatively planned for this year, could be delayed until 2019, so the risk of disruptions to oil production will be particularly heightened towards the end of 2018, as “militant factions across the country will need to align support with their favoured presidential candidate and will likely turn to disrupting oil infrastructure to gain leverage,” the analysts told Rigzone.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Payment-Delays-Could-Jeopardize-Libyas-Oil-Production.html,"Feb 20, 2018 at 09:23 | Irina Slav","Feb 20, 2018",Payment Delays Could Jeopardize Libya’s Oil Production
