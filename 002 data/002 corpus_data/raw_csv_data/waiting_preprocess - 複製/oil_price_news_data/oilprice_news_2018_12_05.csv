2018-12-05,"The oil market is understandably in a state of suspense this week, eagerly fixated on the events unfolding in Vienna. But regardless of what happens, the market is in for a potentially rough ride as we head into 2019, with a series of economic headwinds threatening demand.The S&P 500 is set to peak, corporate earnings are expected to slow, inflation could edge up and U.S. fiscal stimulus is set to fade, according to a recent 2019 forecast from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The report lays out a series of predictions for next year, many of which center around global economic uncertainty.The main themes of the report are of a slowing economy in the U.S., combined with already slow growth elsewhere. Global GDP growth is expected to dip from 3.8 percent this year to 3.6 percent in 2019.In Europe, political and economic stress continues. France has recently been rocked by fuel tax protests. Brexit negotiations are entering a critical phase and Italy is fighting with Brussels over its budget deficit. Germany saw its GDP contract in the third quarter, as did Japan.China is also facing slower growth. The trade war could flare up once again after the much-heralded Trump-Xi truce expires in three months. In fact, as the details on the most recent trade ceasefire faced more scrutiny, the deal started to look a little hollow. Trump took to twitter, perhaps after he realized that China’s concession were not rock solid, and said that he was “a Tariff Man,” warning them to follow through.

The Fed has been steadily hiking interest rates while the European Central Bank has held off.The dollar has gained significantly this year as a result, which has ultimately spread volatility throughout emerging markets, weakening currencies and contributing to a flare up in financial stress. Many breathed a sigh of relief when U.S. Fed chairman Jerome Powell seemed to revise his outlook recently, noting that interest rates are close to what the central bank views as “neutral.” Just a month ago he said that rates were very far from neutral. The slight change in wording suggests the Fed could take a less hawkish view on monetary policy, which could be good for growth and may support a weaker dollar.As such, it’s not all bad news. BofAML says that emerging markets are so oversold that they could see a big rebound in 2019, helped along by a weaker dollar.

OPEC+ is trying to get a handle on a burgeoning supply glut, which has been made worse by downward revisions in demand. Still, global oil demand has been affected much less than might be implied by the bout of economic volatility that has unfolded recently. The IEA has twice revised its 2018 figures down, but only by around 200,000 bpd. In its November Oil Market Report, the agency noted that “a deteriorating outlook for the global economy is largely offset by the fall in Brent crude oil prices.” In other words, oil prices fell because a worsening economy implied lower demand, but lower prices themselves helped keep demand aloft.As a result, oil prices might not necessarily fall from current levels even though the economy could take a turn for the worse. “We forecast Brent and WTI crude oil prices to average $70 and $59 per barrel, respectively in 2019,” BofAML concluded.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-This-The-Most-Crucial-Factor-For-Oil-In-2019.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 16:10 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 05, 2018",Is This The Most Crucial Factor For Oil In 2019?
2018-12-05,"The explosive production growth in the U.S. shale patch has surprised even the most optimistic forecasters, but the huge jumps in output belies and obscures the financial state of the industry, which is a bit more complicated than the production figures might suggest.Shale companies scrambled to cut costs during the oil market downturn between 2014 and 2017, and they successfully lowered their breakeven prices significantly. When OPEC+ agreed on its initial production cut deal, which started at the beginning of 2017, the higher prices that resulted from the agreement allowed U.S. shale to rebound in a big way. Surging production over the past two years suggested that the shale industry was stronger than ever.This year was supposed to be the year that the money started rolling in – with cost cuts in hand and higher oil prices lifting all boats, shale drillers were supposed to be in the clear. But profits have been elusive.To be sure, some companies have posted significant earnings. The oil majors, in particular, are earning more money than they have in a long time. But the bulk of the shale industry is still struggling. According to the Wall Street Journal, the 30 largest shale companies earned a rather marginal $1.7 billion combined in 2017.The latest meltdown in prices, however, puts a lot in the industry right back into hot water. The problem is that despite boasts of low breakeven prices, many shale companies have failed to take a comprehensive look at the all-in costs of producing oil, as the Wall Street Journal points out.  Related: Is This The Next Disaster For Canadian Drillers?It wasn’t uncommon over the last few years to hear shale executives brag about how their wells were profitable even with oil under $40 per barrel. But often those figures didn’t include the cost of land acquisition, or transportation. Or, while individual wells might make a return, the company was ignoring the cost of producing in other less desirable locations. At the end of the day, much of the industry was not turning a profit, even when oil prices traded north of $50 per barrel.According to the Wall Street Journal and consulting firm R.S. Energy Group, true breakeven prices that incorporate costs such as land acquisition come out to about $51 per barrel in the Permian, $57 per barrel in the Eagle Ford, and $64 in the Bakken.That means that the latest downturn in oil prices is likely putting the industry under strain. WTI is now trading in the low-$50s per barrel.On top of that, the pipeline bottlenecks are having a negative effect on finances, even though the robust production figures reported by the EIA suggest that the constraints have only had a marginal impact on production.There are conflicting signals on how much the Permian, for instance, is seeing a slowdown because of pipeline issues. “The widely-predicted movement of activity and capex out of the Permian Basin while off-take capacity is constrained is yet to materialise,” Standard Chartered analysts wrote in a note, adding that “oil rigs in the Bakken have only risen by six y/y, Eagle Ford oil activity is up 13, while the combined Delaware and Midland Basin oil rig count is up 95 y/y.”  Related: Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach DealBut Schlumberger, the largest oilfield services company in the world, said this week that it expects drilling activity to slow down significantly in the fourth quarter, with sales for its services in North America expected to drop by 15 percent, compared to the prior quarter. The recent downturn in prices is hurting drillers, which comes at a time when budgets are mostly exhausted anyway.“We are seeing a significantly larger drop in activity than we expected, which is leading to a larger drop in pricing than we anticipated,” Patrick Schorn, executive vice president at Schlumberger said in an investor presentation, according to Bloomberg. “We continue to see the weakening of the hydraulic fracturing market as temporary, with the expectation of a gradual recovery taking place over the first half of 2019.”The financial strain may also be a hiccup that the industry can overcome. Wall Street has showered drillers with cash over the past decade or so. The near-zero interest rate environment allowed for a debt-fueled drilling boom. In other words, unprofitable production barely slowed down the industry in years past. It’s not clear that the latest fall in prices would seriously deter more drilling, even if companies are not making a profit.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Shale-Struggles-As-Oil-Prices-Drop.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 14:02 | Nick Cunningham","Dec 05, 2018",U.S. Shale Struggles As Oil Prices Drop
2018-12-05,"Since the oil industry started to recover from the 2014 price crash, U.S. supermajors ExxonMobil and Chevron have been re-aligning their global operations with their longer-term priorities, betting more on the shale patch at home and on several strategic projects worldwide.The companies are now looking to exit Azerbaijan, including the country’s biggest oil field and some pipeline infrastructure. This would mark the withdrawal of U.S. companies from the Azeri oil industry a full 25 years after western majors, including five U.S. firms, signed what is known as “the Contract of the Century” in the former Soviet republic.  As part of a re-prioritization of its global operations, ExxonMobil is looking to sell its minority stake in the giant Azeri oil field Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) in the Caspian Sea, hoping to obtain as much as US$2 billion for its interest, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing banking and industry sources.Chevron, for its part, is reviewing its global asset portfolio and has “decided to initiate the process of marketing, with a view to a potential sale, of our Chevron affiliate interests in the Azeri Chirag and Deep Water Gunashli (ACG) project and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) Pipeline,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.Chevron has an 8.9 percent stake in the BTC pipeline, which carries oil from the ACG field and condensate from Shah Deniz across Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey.Chevron also owns a 9.6-percent stake in the ACG oil field, and is currently the third-largest shareholder behind field operator BP and Azeri state firm SOCAR. Exxon holds 6.8 percent in the field, while the other foreign partners in the venture include the operator BP, INPEX, Equinor, TP, ITOCHU, and ONGC Videsh.  Related: Putin Looks To Capitalize On Waning U.S.-Saudi RelationsAzeri-Chirag-Gunashli was Azerbaijan’s first offshore oil Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) contract with Western majors, and was hailed as “the Contract of the Century”. The country and a consortium of foreign oil companies signed a 30-year deal in 1994 to develop the field. Exxon was part of the initial group of companies that signed the contract with Azerbaijan, which also featured four other U.S. companies at the time— Amoco, Unocal, Pennzoil, and McDermott. Last year, the deal was extended to 2050.Production at the giant Azeri field averaged 596,000 bpd in the first half of 2018, accounting for around 75 percent of Azerbaijan’s total oil production.The field has received U.S. support, and U.S. companies have been involved in its development as it was seen as a giant resource that could undermine Russia’s dominance in European energy supply. But the promise of possible new finds near the giant field never materialized, and Azerbaijan tightened its grip on energy assets via SOCAR.Approached by Reuters, Exxon spokeswoman Julie King declined to comment on the company’s plans for Azerbaijan, just saying that “we don’t comment on market rumors or speculation.”In recent years, Exxon has shifted its global focus to offshore exploration in Guyana, where it has found major reserves of oil—including a tenth find announced earlier this week—with plans to start producing from the Liza Phase 1 development of up to 120,000 barrels oil per day by early 2020.  Related: Iran: Oil To Fall To $40 If OPEC Fails To Reach DealAccording to energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie, the Liza Complex now best compares to Brazil’s Lula-Iracema, one of the world’s largest deepwater finds. Guyana can “easily become the fourth largest oil producing nation in Latin America by the next decade, with chances to outperform the countries preceding it. If Venezuela and Mexico fail to address production declines, Guyana could quickly surpass them to number two,” said Luiz Hayum, research analyst with WoodMac’s Latin America upstream oil and gas team.Chevron, for its part, is involved in giant oil projects in another country on the Caspian Sea, Kazakhstan, and holds major stakes in two giant oil fields—Tengiz and Karachaganak.Despite different priorities globally, both U.S. supermajors are betting big on their home shale patch, building up acreage and stakes and ramping up oil production in the Permian.Chevron reported its highest ever quarterly oil production of 2.96 million barrels of net oil-equivalent in Q3, thanks to rising Permian production.Exxon, for its part, reported increased Q3 production compared to Q2, thanks to the Permian.“We’re pleased with the increase in production from the second quarter of 2018 recognizing it reflects contributions from just one of our key growth areas, the Permian,” chairman and CEO Darren Woods said in the earnings release.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/US-Oil-Majors-To-Break-The-Contract-Of-The-Century.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 12:49 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Dec 05, 2018",U.S. Oil Majors To Break “The Contract Of The Century”
2018-12-05,"Every once in a while, a new technological development shakes up a conservative sector. In the oil and gas industry, the shale revolution has changed the business in multiple ways. The U.S. has been transformed from one of the world’s leading oil importers into the world’s largest producer of oil and gas. Fracking in the Permian basin has created bottlenecks as the existing infrastructure cannot cope with rising production. Producers are not able to get all the oil and gas to customers, creating a price differential with the WTI benchmark. On average, shale oil producers in the Permian basin receive $10 to $13 dollars less for each barrel compared to WTI levels.It is not only energy companies that are benefitting from rising production, pipeline manufacturers are also reaping the rewards. Globally, the U.S. ranks no. 1 in pipelines planned and under construction. Most of the oil and gas pipelines planned for 2019 and 2020 will connect the Permian Basin with consumers and export terminals in the Gulf of Mexico. However, the additional capacity will create another problem by moving the bottleneck from transportation to the facilities on the coast.Pipelines and more pipelinesWith the need for additional pipelines rising fast, Texas has become the epicenter of a booming industry. The Lone Star State produces 40 percent of the national oil production, production that the Energy Department estimates to be 11.6 million barrels per day. In Texas, companies are investing $40 billion in building or expanding 10,000 miles of pipeline, which is enough pipeline to reach from West Texas to China.Until the end of 2019, at least three large pipelines will be put into action, raising capacity by an additional 2 million barrels per day. However, this comes at a time when existing facilities have a limited unused capacity. The added pipeline infrastructure will exceed the available capacity at export facilities by a large margin. Several additional facilities have been announced, each in a different stadium of planning. However, it is likely that not all plans will come to fruition.  Related: OPEC Oil Exports Jump Ahead Of MeetingAccording to James Teague, CEO of Enterprise Products, ""anyone can build a terminal, but it's what's behind that terminal that determines its success."" In other words, success in the terminal business is as much about securing the barrels as it is about shipping them out. Some companies have an edge due to two reasons: early planning such as Trafigura or those with interests in production, transportation, and the terminals itself such Enbridge Inc.Determining successTrafigura is, to date, the only company that has submitted a formal permit application to build a deep-water terminal in the Corpus Christi area. Being the first to complete a facility would diminish the necessity of additional terminals as these facilities don’t come cheap - costing in the range of billions. However, being the first to apply doesn’t determine whether you’re also the first to finish the facility as environmentalists are trying to delay construction.Furthermore, the rate of success is also determined by supplies and the designated route of pipelines. The majority of export infrastructure is located in two regions: Houston and Corpus Christi. Companies in these areas are battling to become the country’s largest and most important location for moving American oil overseas. Each region shipped out more than $7 billion in crude during the first nine months of this year compared to just one billion two years ago.  Related: Gazprom’s Next Big Bet On European Gas MarketsFinally, a wild card for investors is the additional rise of shale oil production in the coming years. This could determine the construction of additional infrastructure to be commissioned in 2020.The China-U.S. trade war truceThe recent decision of the U.S. and China to halt all trade-related hostilities for 90 days is good news for the global economy and especially good news for the American oil and gas industry. First, the trade war negatively affected the global economy, which in turn reduced the growing demand for oil. The positive news coming from the sidelines of the G20 summit in Buenos Aires has improved the outlook for global energy demand, at least for now.Furthermore, the construction of pipelines and export facilities requires buyers to make investments profitable. China is the largest growth market for oil and gas. Beijing could agree to buy more American energy to reduce the trade deficit. However, the truce of the G20 summit is not a peace agreement. Therefore, American energy companies could be facing a bumpy year in 2019.By Vanand Meliksetian for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-US-Pipeline-Industry-Is-Booming.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 10:48 | Vanand Meliksetian","Dec 05, 2018",The U.S. Pipeline Industry Is Booming
2018-12-05,"OPEC’s meeting this Thursday in Vienna may not lead to an agreement to start reducing production, Iran’s OPEC governor said, as quoted by S&P Global Platts. Hossein Kazempour Ardebili said there were tensions between members of the cartel, with some unhappy about others’ large production increases in recent months.""The cooperation agreement is unlikely to be renewed,"" Ardebili said. “At least some member states will not join it, in which case any renewal will be out of the question.""Increasing the heat further, the official said some OPEC members might even decide to follow in Qatar’s footsteps and leave OPEC altogether.The reason, according to Ardebili, is their limited production capacity, especially spare capacity. ""Some producers have limited production capacity. Therefore, they may be faced with lower demand for production, while on the other hand, they lack any spare capacity for increased production, if need be,"" he said, adding ""That strengthens the possibility of exit by minor member states. That is not impossible.""Qatar, which produces around 600,000 bpd, announced its decision to leave OPEC earlier this week, citing a focus on natural gas and maintaining its number-one position as gas exporter in the world.The cartel is meeting tomorrow to discuss production cuts that may range from 1 to 1.4 million bpd. Russia and another nine non-members will join the talks. There have been reports citing Moscow officials that while last time Russia did not mind its cut quota, which stood at 300,000 bpd out of total cuts of 1.8 million bpd, this time the country may not be so willing to cut so much.“We think 1 million bpd (cuts) is more realistic, not 1.4 million bpd ... But who is going to do this is another question,” the source said, as quoted by Reuters.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Iran-Dont-Count-On-A-New-OPEC-Deal.html,"Dec 05, 2018 at 10:31 | Irina Slav","Dec 05, 2018",Iran: Don’t Count On A New OPEC Deal
