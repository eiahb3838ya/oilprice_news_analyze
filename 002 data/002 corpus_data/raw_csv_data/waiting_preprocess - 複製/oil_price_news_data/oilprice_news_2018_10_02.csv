2018-10-02,"The world’s two most important oil benchmarks are on two different tracks, and may see a larger divergence in the months ahead.WTI has typically traded at a discount to Brent, although the differential widens and narrows depending on specific dynamics affecting the two benchmarks. Back in 2012, when the shale bonanza really began to explode, the midstream sector was ill-prepared for such a dramatic ramp up. The result was a bottleneck that forced WTI to trade at a discount in excess of $20 per barrel for a short period of time. New pipelines resolved the backlog and the discount narrowed in the ensuing years.In 2018, however, surging production in the Permian has resulted in yet another midstream bottleneck. As a result, the WTI discount has bounced around between $3 and $8 per barrel relative to Brent. In September, the differential jumped to $9.(Click to enlarge) In fact, the two benchmarks may very well continue to diverge in the months ahead as they experience different market pressures.U.S. shale output continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than in months past. Permian takeaway capacity is all but tapped out, which could result in localized glut of supply. Oil located in Midland, Texas in the heart of the Permian has already been trading at a double-digit discount to WTI in Houston, and that dynamic will only magnify as we head into 2019.Meanwhile, Brent, which more closely reflects the international market, is suffering from the opposite problem. As Iranian supply continues to plunge – Iranian oil exports are down some 1 million barrels per day from the April peak – the global oil market has tightened to its greatest extent since 2014. Now, there are questions about Saudi Arabia’s spare capacity and its ability to offset the outages in Iran.The result is that WTI and Brent are on diverging paths, which could widen the differential to as much as $15 per barrel, according to Citigroup, roughly twice as high as today. As Permian production continues to grind higher, more oil could end up in storage in Cushing. As inventories climb, WTI will suffer downward pressure.

It would supercharge the business case for new pipelines coming out of the Permian, although some analysts think that the midstream market in Texas is getting pretty crowded with several pipelines under construction. Such a heavy discount could also incrementally slow drilling in the shale patch. At the same time, new modes of transit could open up, with an expansion of trucks and rail moving oil from West Texas to the Gulf Coast (although trucks and rail are also facing their own constraints).A more obvious effect of a $15-per-barrel discount for WTI would be an acceleration of U.S. crude oil exports. U.S. crude discounted by that much would be very attractive to buyers around the world, so U.S. exports would likely rise even higher than today’s levels. If WTI were discounted by $15 per barrel relative to Brent, the limiting factor for exports would be inadequate export infrastructure, not willing buyers.  Related:  How Much Spare Capacity Does Saudi Arabia Really Have?Gulf Coast refiners would also enjoy buying up crude and churning out gasoline and diesel, which they could export at much higher prices that are more closely linked with Brent. Even better, refiners inland would have a better chance of buying the heavily discounted oil trapped behind the pipeline. WTI may be discounted to Brent by $15 per barrel, but Midland crude would be discounted by at least as much relative to WTI in Houston. The result would be a windfall for mid-Continent refiners.However, this is a temporary story. There are several reasons why the discount would not last long. The biggest and most obvious reason is that the Permian pipeline bottleneck is expected to be fleeting. By late next year, new capacity will start coming online to ease the backlog. That will allow more oil to reach the Gulf Coast either for refining or for export, narrowing the price differentials.A second reason would be that a surge in exports would help force WTI and Brent back together, although the degree to which this matters is up for debate. More U.S. crude oil exports will help even out the imbalances in what are essentially different markets for crude oil, just as any arbitrage eventually closes.By Nick Cunningham of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/WTI-Discount-To-Brent-Could-Explode.html,"Oct 02, 2018 at 16:57 | Nick Cunningham","Oct 02, 2018",WTI Discount To Brent Could Explode
2018-10-02,"Rising U.S. oil production, coupled with the Permian pipeline capacity constraints, are set to lead to a build-up in Cushing, Oklahoma, inventories that will put further pressure on the benchmark U.S. oil price, widening its discount to Brent Crude to as much as $15 a barrel—which would be the widest WTI discount to the international benchmark since December 2013, according to Citigroup.“As U.S. production grows, the likelihood is overwhelming that a lot of the valves to get into the Gulf Coast are going to close,” Ed Morse, global head of commodities research at Citigroup, told Bloomberg in a recent interview.Before the planned pipelines in the Permian enter into service by the fourth quarter of 2019, the inventories at Cushing could rise to 70 million barrels by April next year, compared to 20 million barrels in stockpiles now, according to Morse.While Permian oil is finding it increasingly difficult to get to the U.S. Gulf Coast, the route to Cushing is not as constrained. This would push inventories higher and widen the WTI Crude discount to Brent Crude, Morse told Bloomberg.As of 2:21 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, the discount of WTI Crude to Brent Crude was at $9.59 a barrel.Over the past two months, the WTI discount to Brent has surged and doubled since the middle of July. On the one hand, WTI prices are depressed by Permian takeaway capacity constraints. On the other hand, Brent Crude has been increasing thanks to the drop in Iranian oil exports and expectations of further losses of Iranian barrels combined with OPEC’s inability to fully offset those losses.According to preliminary tanker tracking data compiled by Bloomberg, observed exports of Iranian crude oil and condensate plunged in September to 1.72 million bpd, down by 260,000 bpd month-on-month and the lowest level since February 2016.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Citi-Brent-WTI-Spread-Could-Widen-To-5-Yr-High.html,"Oct 02, 2018 at 13:24 | Tsvetana Paraskova","Oct 02, 2018",Citi: Brent-WTI Spread Could Widen To 5-Year High
2018-10-02,"The Aramco IPO saga continues, with the Saudi oil giant soon to enter the international financial markets for a $50 billion loan.International sources are reporting that the world’s largest oil company will look for around $50 billion from international banks, largely to be used to finance a majority stake in Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC).International banks have been approached by Aramco in the last couple of weeks, as the state-owned oil giant is looking to acquire a majority stake, currently held by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund Public Investment Fund (PIF).SABIC holds a market value of around $100 billion at present. The Saudi PIF holds a 70 percent stake in SABIC, which would mean that Aramco would need to finance the rest from its own reserves, which are an estimated $20 billion. The statements come just shortly after Aramco’s CEO Amin Nasser reiterated that his company is still committed to the IPO.It is still not clear when the financing is going to take place, but financial sources expect that it will be end of 2018 or beginning of 2019. Saudi sources have stated that no banks have been mandated for the financial package deal, even though U.S. banks JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have been asked to advise on the acquisition. In addition to its cash holdings, which have increased substantially in the last couple of months, Aramco is slated to be looking at a combination of a large, long-term syndicated loan and short-term, bridge loans that would be replaced after about 12 to 18 months with bond issues, for the $50 billion.As the media has already reported, Saudi Arabia is sure to try and set up the deal via bonds, as it is looking to expand its bond market. International interest is already growing, but could be given a boost by the new deal. It remains unclear how far Aramco will be able to put an international bond sale in place as such a deal would require a credit rating and necessitate the disclosure of financial information in a prospectus. These details have, until now, been very hard to obtain as the company (and the Kingdom) are very wary of divulging it to the press or international investors.  Related: $200 Billion Saudi Solar Megaproject Might Never HappenAt the same time, as we all know, the Aramco IPO proposal has been put on hold due to transparency and data information issues. Hence the eagerness by Aramco (and its stakeholders - aka the Royal Family) to approach the deal as a normal bank loan first.However, for international banks the $50 billion loan might not be very tempting, as Aramco could be pricing its debt on a par with the government, demanding ultra-thin margins.The reality, however, is sure to be different. When asked by Aramco, the majority of international banks will be more than willing to issue the loan. The opportunity to have the world’s largest oil company on your list of clients is tempting. Banks know that taking part in this may be a commercially less interesting loan, but future mandates for capital market transactions will be up for grabs.  Related: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait Discuss New Oil Production In Neutral ZoneFor Aramco, the acquisition (and possible merger) of SABIC is a significant aim. Not only will the acquisition form a giant integrated oil company, it will also open the posibility of a continuation of the IPO saga. The decision to change the first IPO plan to a downstream Aramco IPO is a real possibility, presenting no real issues to Aramco with regards to transparency or reserve valuations.The time is right for a debt deal, as the attractiveness of Saudi Arabia is increasing along with oil prices. In September, the Saudi SWF raised $11 billion at the same pricing point as the Kingdom’s sovereign debt. After the inclusion into the FTSE and MSCI Emerging Markets Index, JP Morgan has also considered including the Kingdom on in its very own JP Morgan Bond Index. This fund is slated to bring another influx of cash to the Kingdom of around $11 billion. It now seems that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s target of reaping around $100-150 billion from the Aramco IPO is superfluous. Without taking the goose with the golden eggs to the market (Aramco), his strategy to attract investment interest in the Kingdom is already bringing rewards. A possible Aramco (SABIC) IPO will be yet another vicrtory for Saudi Arabia without the downsides involved in the orignal IPO plan.By Cyril Widdershoven for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/The-50-Billion-Deal-That-Could-Revive-The-Aramco-IPO.html,"Oct 02, 2018 at 12:13 | Cyril Widdershoven","Oct 02, 2018",The $50 Billion Deal That Could Revive The Aramco IPO
2018-10-02,"Usually when referring to the so-called oil weapon, analysts are talking about the decades old policy of major oil producing nations withholding production to tighten supplies and drive prices up, often driven by geopolitical motivations.The most nefarious example of this came in 1973 when middle eastern producers, led by Saudi Arabia, cut oil imports to the U.S. and a number of Western countries. Two other embargoes took place in both 1956 and 1967 with less than stellar results. Their objective, especially in 1967 and 1973, was to force countries that supported Israel to change their foreign policies and to also put pressure on Israel to withdraw from the territories it occupied during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, often called the Six Day War.What appears to have faded from public memory is that the U.S. has used the oil weapon more than OPEC producers, including oil embargoes on Japan before World War II; then on the Soviet Union in the 1960s; and in various forms on South Africa, Burma, Serbia, Haiti, Libya, Iraq, Iran, and Sudan over the last twenty years or so.However, oil embargoes, including the most remembered and politically and economically explosive embargo of 1973, seldom work. After the 1973 embargo, the U.S, Japan and several European nations that had suffered then record high oil and gasoline prices and a supply shock fought back, enacting fuel efficiency standards, the establishment of strategic petroleum reserves, and other measures that swung marginal power back to oil importing nations but more importantly reduced global oil demand for decades, in essence causing the embargo to backfire.Oil weapon possibility?Now, a take-off of this decades-old strategy - but this time by an oil consumer that could be trimming imports for political reasons - might be unfolding.Last week, citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters said that Chinese state-run oil major Sinopec, the country’s top refiner, was going to cut its Iranian oil imports by half this month after coming under intense pressure from Washington to comply with the U.S. ban on Iranian oil, which kicks in on November 4.The sources didn’t specify volumes but based on the prevailing supply contract between Sinopec and the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), Sinopec will reduce its loadings to about 130,000 barrels per day (bpd), equaling 20 percent of China’s daily average imports from Iran in 2017 - the deepest Chinese cut in Iranian oil exports in years.  Related: Europe Prepares For Natural Gas Price HikeWhile most analysts, including the Reuters report, claim that Beijing is ceding to U.S. pressure over Iranian oil imports, another motive may be lurking in the background.As China trims its Iranian crude imports, it will have a knock-on effect of exacerbating the prevailing supply worry for global oil markets, as well as the distinct possibility of a supply crunch going forward.Moreover, as more Iranian barrels are removed, upward pressure on global oil prices will persist, with the likelihood that the global oil price bench mark, London traded Brent crude, will breach the $90/barrel price point before the end of year. Some analysts are calling for prices around $100 per barrel, but it’s still too early to see if that will transpire.With Beijing locked in a bitter trade war with Washington that is already hurting economic growth, and with the knowledge that high oil and gasoline prices will sway voters in the upcoming mid-term Congressional elections, Beijing could be playing the oil card so Republicans lose their slim two seat lead in the Senate.Without a majority in the Senate, much of Trump’s policies thus far, including his hawkish view with China over trade as well as other issues will be in jeopardy. The Senate is currently composed of 51 Republicans, 47 Democrats, and 2 independents, both of whom caucus with the Democrats  Related: The Middle East Nuclear Race Is Reaching A Boiling PointFrom Beijing’s perspective, any set back to Trump’s trade war would be a win both abroad and at home. However, if the Republican party retains control of the Senate, it’s likely that Trump will impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports to the U.S., leaving Beijing exposed both economically and geopolitically.Trump’s accusationsThe White House has already claimed that China is trying to influence American voters by leveling sanctions against industries and states that support his candidacy. Last week, during his much criticized speech to the UN, Trump upped the ante even more, stating that China did not want “me or us [the Republican party] to win, because I am the first president ever to challenge China on trade.”“And we are winning on trade. We are winning on every level,” he added.By Tim Daiss for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Is-China-Levying-The-Oil-Weapon-Against-Trump.html,"Oct 02, 2018 at 10:34 | Tim Daiss","Oct 02, 2018",Is China Turning Trump's Oil Weapon Against Him?
2018-10-02,"Kuwait has not sent any crude oil to the United States for at least four weeks, EIA’s weekly petroleum reports for the last four weeks, which also include a weekly comparison, have revealed.The last week that saw Kuwaiti crude coming into the United States was August 24th, when 49,000 bpd were received at U.S. ports. This compares with 214,000 bpd a year earlier, suggesting that Kuwait is reorienting itself to the more lucrative Asian markets, Bloomberg reports, having calculated that Kuwaiti crude costs an average of US$80 a barrel in Asia, which is a dollar more than it costs in the United States.Kuwaiti oil is predominantly high-sulfur, which is what a lot of Asian refineries prefer to process and are willing to pay more for it, a source in the know told Bloomberg, asking to not be identified.So far so good for Kuwait, which is a relatively small producer, but the emirate is facing a production cap, Bloomberg notes, because of an ongoing dispute with ally Saudi Arabia about the fields that they share in the so-called neutral zone. On Sunday, Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed went on a visit to Kuwait to discuss the topic in light of growing pressure on Middle Eastern producers to ramp up production to offset a loss of supply caused by the U.S. sanctions against Iran.Joint oil production in the neutral zone was suspended in 2015, but earlier this month the Financial Times reported that the two countries were mulling over a restart amid rising oil prices and the matching rise in worry among large oil buyers.The neutral zone, the FT reported at the time, could be pumping half a million barrels daily in a few months, according to the International Energy Agency, which would add to more than 10 million bpd of Saudi production and almost 3 million bpd on Kuwaiti production based on the latest figures for July.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",https://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Kuwait-Stops-Exporting-Crude-To-US.html,"Oct 02, 2018 at 09:20 | Irina Slav","Oct 02, 2018",Kuwait Stops Exporting Crude To U.S.
