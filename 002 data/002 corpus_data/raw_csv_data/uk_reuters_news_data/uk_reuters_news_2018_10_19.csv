2018-10-19,"WASHINGTON/SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday threw his support behind speeding up water projects for agriculture and hydropower in the arid U.S. West, a move aimed to help build support for Republicans in tight congressional races in next month’s midterm elections. Trump signed a presidential memorandum that directs Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to  “reduce regulatory burdens” and expedite environmental reviews for projects in the West that provide water for farmers and power generation.  Water wars have divided the West for decades. The supplies have been fought over by cities, which tend to be mostly populated by Democrats, and agricultural interests, which tend to lean Republican. In addition, Trump’s push for water projects is aimed to win over voters in the region who oppose his crackdown on immigrants.  “For decades burdensome federal regulations have made it extremely difficult and expensive to build and maintain federal water projects,” Trump said at the signing of the memo. “Some of the best farmland in the world, by the way, can’t be used because they don’t have water, but they actually have a lot of water.” California fishermen were expected to oppose any relaxation of rules that protect populations of salmon and other fish.  Alongside Trump at the Scottsdale memo signing were Republican U.S. representatives from California Jeff Denham, Devin Nunes and Kevin McCarthy, the House majority leader. The memo allows the lawmakers to tell voters they pushed Trump to support water infrastructure.   It directs Zinke to submit assessments on wildlife at California’s Central Valley Project and the California State Water Project by Jan. 21, 2019.  David Bernhardt, the 49-year-old deputy secretary of the U.S. Interior Department, and a former lobbyist for water interests in the West, told reporters in a teleconference that Trump’s directive “might be the most significant action taken by a president on western water issues in my lifetime.” The directive “eliminates unneeded burdens while improving coordination and communication of very complex water storage and delivery systems,” Bernhardt said.  “This is all about getting the agencies to act as efficiently and as effectively as possible,” a senior administration official on the call said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Asked whether there was a relationship between Trump’s signing of the memorandum and the Nov. 6 elections in which Republicans are trying to maintain majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, Bernhardt said, “I’m certainly not the one who sets timing.”    Reporting by Timothy Gardner and Makini Brice in Washington, and Jeff Mason in Scottsdale, Ariz.; Editing by Matthew Lewis",https://uk.reuters.com/article/usa-trump-water/trump-backs-water-projects-in-u-s-west-as-election-nears-idUKL2N1WZ1I8,19 Oct 2018,"President

2018-10-19,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Friday on signs of surging demand in China, the world’s No. 2 oil consumer, although prices were headed for a second weekly decline on swelling U.S. inventories and concern that trade wars were curbing economic activity. Brent crude LCOc1 futures rose 49 cents to settle at $79.78 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures rose 47 cents to settle at $69.12 a barrel. For the week, Brent fell 0.9 percent, while U.S. crude lost 3.1 percent. Both contracts have fallen around $7 a barrel below four-year highs reached in early October. WTI’s discount to Brent WTCLc1-LCOc1 widened to its most since June 8, hitting $11.00 a barrel.  Refinery throughput in China, the world’s largest oil importer, rose in September to a record 12.49 million barrels per day (bpd), government data showed. The data fed hopes about oil demand in China, even though economic growth slowed in the third quarter to its weakest since the global financial crisis. An OPEC and non-OPEC monitoring committee found that oil producers’ compliance with a supply-reduction agreement fell to 111 percent in September from 129 percent in August, three sources familiar with the matter said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has led cuts from major oil producers since 2017 to shore up prices. “OPEC and non-OPEC production increases have not quite equaled the loss in Iranian supply, giving the market concern about whether or not they will be able to fulfill the shortfall,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. The market has been focused on U.S. sanctions on Iran, which take effect on Nov. 4 and are designed to cut crude exports from the country. Pressuring prices this week was U.S. government data showing crude inventories last week climbed 6.5 million barrels, a fourth straight weekly build and almost triple the amount analysts had forecast. [EIA/S] Rising supplies, particularly at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery hub for WTI, pushed the market into contango, in which nearby prices trade lower than forward prices. This happened on Thursday for the first time since May 22. On Friday, front-month U.S. crude futures traded at the biggest discount to the second month in nearly a year. Traders anticipated further inventory builds in Cushing as new pipelines come online. The U.S. oil drilling rig count, an early indicator of future output, rose by four to 873 this week, the highest since March 2015, General Electric Co’s (GE.N) Baker Hughes energy services firm said on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI Money managers cut net long U.S. crude futures and options positions in New York and London by 37,080 contracts to 259,375 in the week to Oct. 16, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday - the lowest level since Sept. 19, 2017.

2018-10-19,"(Adds energy ministry comment) By Anastasia Lyrchikova MOSCOW, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A power station in Crimea where Russia has installed two German-designed electricity turbines in contravention of sanctions was slightly damaged when a mishap occurred during testing, Russia’s energy ministry said on Friday. German engineering company Siemens says that Russia clandestinely delivered several of its turbines to Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, despite European sanctions which ban the supply of energy technology to Crimea. Siemens and its subsidiaries have said they will not play any role in installing the turbines, a complex task that, according to energy industry specialists, can easily go wrong without technology and know-how provided by the manufacturer. The energy ministry said in a statement the roof of the power station building in Sevastopol was slightly damaged in the incident. It said the turbines were not from Siemens. It said that they were modernised turbines that were the work of Russian specialists and Russian equipment. Power station staff were in August testing the station’s power-generating systems by forcing super-heated steam through them, which is discharged through exhaust pipes in the roof. It said the high temperature of the steam, and the way the exhaust pipes were installed, had caused heat damage to the roof. It said though that the problem was fixed and there was no impact on the timetable for completing work on the power station. The ministry provided to Reuters a satellite photo dated Aug. 26 which showed slight damage around vents on the power station roof. The energy ministry said the Sevastopol station, and a second power station in Crimea, where Siemens alleges another two of its turbines was installed without its knowledge, will be officially launched in November. Previous deadlines for the launch have been missed.

2018-10-19,"KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine secured a new $3.9 billion stand-by aid agreement with the International Monetary Fund on Friday, helping the country maintain financial stability and the trust of investors as it heads into a choppy election period next year.  The IMF announced the deal hours after the government decided to raise household gas prices by nearly a quarter, an outstanding IMF requirement. Ukraine’s prime minister had warned the country was headed for default without an IMF deal, but the gas price hike triggered fierce criticism from opposition politicians, giving a taste of the backlash that is likely to follow. The new agreement would span 14 months and replaces the previous $17.5 billion aid programme that has propped up Ukraine’s war-battered economy since 2015.  It is subject to Ukraine passing a 2019 budget in line with the IMF’s requirements and the approval of the IMF’s executive board, which is expected to take a decision later in the year, the IMF said.  “The new SBA ... will provide an anchor for the authorities’ economic policies during 2019,” an IMF statement said.  “... it will focus in particular on continuing with fiscal consolidation and reducing inflation, as well as reforms to strengthen tax administration, the financial sector and the energy sector.”   The new deal will allow the government, which must service a rising debt burden next year, to go to the market to issue new debt and would also pave the way for the European Union and other foreign donors to disburse more aid. Acting Finance Minister Oksana Markarova wrote it would provide a “safety net” and “enable our government to benefit from concessional financings from international financial institutions and continue increasing foreign currency reserves (currently standing at over USD 18bn).”  The government initially had agreed to raise gas prices but later backtracked, knowing the potential for voter anger during presidential and parliamentary elections.  “We have no other option to prevent extremely difficult events,” Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman said during a televised cabinet meeting earlier on Friday.  “If we are not able to continue cooperation with our international partners,” Groysman warned, then the country will not be able to service its debt.  “This may lead to the situation when Ukraine will be put into default,” he said, a return to the 1990s of “hyper-inflation, price increases, wage devaluation.” Ukraine’s eurobonds rose across the curve following the announcement of a gas price hike.  However, Olena Babak, a lawmaker from the opposition Samopomich party, told the 112 news channel that it would push Ukrainians into poverty. “This is a crime against Ukraine,” she said. Former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, who hopes to unseat President Petro Poroshenko in next year’s election, called the price hike a “genocide against the Ukrainian people” and asked for an emergency parliamentary debate.   The IMF joined efforts to rescue Ukraine from economic crisis following Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the outbreak of a Kremlin-backed separatist insurgency.   But IMF aid had effectively been frozen since April 2017 as Ukraine’s performance on reforms slowed down and due to the government’s refusal to raise gas prices, kept artificially low since Soviet times, to market levels. The spotlight will now be on discussions on the 2019 budget which parliament must vote on by the end of the year. One sticking point could be Ukraine’s plans for a change to how companies are taxed.  Groysman said household gas prices would be raised by 23.5 percent from Nov 1.

2018-10-19,"(Adds details on Khashoggi case, Fed monetary policy) By Howard Schneider MACON, Ga., Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials are monitoring the case of missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and the possibility that any sanctions against Saudi Arabia could disrupt oil markets, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic said on Friday. Asked about the risks to the U.S. economic outlook at a community group lunch in Macon, Georgia, Bostic mentioned geopolitical risks generally, the Brexit talks and “the Saudi Arabian situation and the question about whether what happened to that journalist is going to lead to sanctions that could impact oil markets.” His comments, the first by a U.S. central banker about the case, reflect how it has escalated from a diplomatic dispute between Saudi Arabia and Turkey to an international incident with the potential to roil financial markets. Khashoggi went missing after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain documents for a forthcoming marriage. Turkish officials believe he was killed in the building, but Riyadh has denied the allegations. Bostic singled out the possible fallout if the United States or other countries determine that top Saudi officials were behind Khashoggi’s possible murder and begin imposing penalties on Riyadh. “We don’t know what is going to happen,” Bostic said, “but one thing we will do is monitor the economy and these developments as closely as possible.” Oil prices rose about 1 percent on Friday on signs of surging demand in China, although the market was headed for a second week of losses on rising U.S. inventories and concern that trade wars were curbing economic activity. Bostic said he saw little risk to a U.S. economy that is “chugging along” with very low unemployment and inflation at the Fed’s 2 percent target. “To what extent can we keep that going? All the conversations I have suggest the answer is that there are no significant dark clouds on the horizon,” he said. Bostic did not comment on his current monetary policy views, though he recently said he was open to a further interest rate increase in December depending on how the economy evolves. The Fed has raised rates three times this year and is widely expected to lift borrowing costs again at its December policy meeting.

2018-10-19,"Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a second week in a row this week, raising the rig count to the highest level since March 2015. Drillers added four oil rigs in the week to Oct. 19, bringing the total count to 873,  General Electric Co’s Baker Hughes energy services firm said in its closely followed report on Friday. RIG-OL-USA-BHI The U.S. rig count, an early indicator of future output, is higher than a year ago when 736 rigs were active because energy companies have ramped up production to capture prices that are higher in 2018 than 2017. Due to transport constraints to remove oil from the Permian Basin, the largest oilfield in the United States, new drilling had stalled since June but has begun to edge up as a new pipeline is due to start up and help the bottleneck. On Friday, U.S. crude futures were trading around $69.36 per barrel, on track to fall for a second week in a row on rising U.S. inventories and concern that trade wars were curbing economic activity. So far this year, U.S. oil futures have averaged $67.24 per barrel. That compares with averages of $50.85 in calendar 2017 and $43.47 in 2016. Looking ahead, crude futures were trading around $69.42 per barrel for the balance of 2018 and at $69.25 for calendar 2019. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co this week said the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks have provided guidance indicating an 18 percent increase this year in planned capital spending. Cowen said the E&Ps it tracks expect to spend a total of $85.3 billion in 2018. That compares with projected spending of $72.2 billion in 2017. Analysts at Simmons & Co, energy specialists at U.S. investment bank Piper Jaffray, this week forecast the average combined oil and natural gas rig count would rise from 876 in 2017 to 1,031 in 2018, 1,092 in 2019 and 1,227 in 2020. Since 1,067 oil and gas rigs were already in service, drillers would not have to add any rigs for the rest of the year to hit Simmons’ forecast for 2018. Year-to-date, the total number of oil and gas rigs active in the United States has averaged 1,022. That keeps the total count for 2018 on track to be the highest since 2014, which averaged 1,862 rigs. Most rigs produce both oil and gas. U.S. crude oil output in 2018 is expected to rise 1.39 million barrels per day to 10.74 million bpd, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in its Short Term Energy Outlook (STEO).

2018-10-19,"LISBON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - A consortium led by Portugal’s EDP Renewables (EDPR) will invest 125 million euros ($144 million) over three years in a 25 megawatt (MW) floating offshore wind farm, EDPR’s principal shareholder Energias de Portugal said on Friday. The project, Europe’s second floating wind farm, involves anchoring three turbines on semi-submersible platforms at water depths of up to 100 metres. The wind farm will be in the Atlantic about 20 km (13 miles) off the coast of Viana de Castelo in northern Portugal. The farm’s total capacity of 25 MW will be enough to power 60,000 homes for a year. The turbines, each with 8.4 MW capacity, will be the most powerful turbines installed on a floating base at sea, the company said. “This is an absolutely pioneering and innovative project for renewable offshore energy,” Energias de Portugal CEO Antonio Mexia said in a presentation. The consortium, which includes Spain’s Repsol, has spent 23 million euros testing the platforms for two years. The tests showed the technology, known as Windfloat, could withstand waves up to 15 metres high. The European Investment Bank (EIB) is providing 60 million euros of the funding for the new wind farm. Offshore floating wind farms are an attractive alternative energy source because they open up areas of deep ocean to harness energy, unlike fixed offshore wind turbines that need to be installed in shallower coastal waters. Norway’s Equinor, formerly known as Statoil, launched the world’s first floating wind farm last year off the Scottish coast with capacity of 30 MW. It has said floating turbines could be used in areas where the sea was up to 800 metres deep. $1 = 0.8687 euros

2018-10-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Crunchy and tasty, yes, but could carrots also strengthen cement and cut carbon dioxide emissions for the building industry?  A group of researchers at Britain’s Lancaster University  has been using a household food blender to mix particles from the root vegetable with concrete to see if they can produce a  stronger and more environmentally sound product.     “We found out you could increase the strength of concrete by 80 percent by using a small amount of this new material,” lead researcher Mohamed Saafi told Reuters. The addition of carrots prevent any cracks in the concrete, the team said. It also means less cement is required, therefore lowering the global carbon dioxide (CO2) output. Cement is responsible for seven percent of total global CO2 emissions, according to International Energy Agency estimates. The carrot particles are provided by CelluComp, a Scottish-based company who work on the development of sustainable materials. CelluComp CEO Christian Kemp-Griffin explained that a carrot is made up nearly entirely of water but still stays rigid and crunchy because of cellulose, a fibrous substance found in all plants. “Those fibres have strength characteristics in them. It’s the building blocks of the strength of a vegetable,” he told Reuters. Cellulose is also found in wood, but is easier to extract from vegetables. With large amounts of vegetable waste available as a byproduct of agriculture, it is a cheap and environmentally friendly source of the fibres. “You can just pop a few of these fibres into other materials and it becomes an additive that gives performance characteristics,” he said. Only a tiny amount of cellulose is needed to alter the properties of cement because it changes the way water behaves during the process when cement hardens. “It’s not the physical fibre that’s causing the strength. It’s the way it holds water. Our material loves to hold onto water. There is a chemical reaction happening between the fibres and the cement.”  Saafi’s team will continue to test their mixtures, with sugar beets also being used as CelluComp can get large amounts of inexpensive beet pulp left over after sugar production.

2018-10-19,"(Repeats to show pix available) By Can Sezer IZMIR, Turkey, Oct 18 (Reuters) - A new $6.3 billion refinery set up by the Azeri state oil company in Turkey will reduce Ankara’s dependence on imports for processed oil products, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday. The new plant could also help to ease some of the pain from Turkey’s currency crisis, given that the lira’s 35 percent slump this year has driven up costs for the country’s energy companies and forced them to increase electricity and natural gas prices for both households and industrial customers. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the SOCAR Turkey Aegean Refinery (STAR) in the Aegean coastal province of Izmir, Erdogan hailed the plant as Turkey’s biggest step yet in Turkey’s drive to meet its energy needs. “This is aimed at saving around $1.5 billion annually in oil product imports and the reduction of foreign dependence for oil products,” he said. SOCAR Turkey aims to make an acquisition in natural gas distribution in 2019, a senior executive of the company told Reuters on Friday, adding that an offer has been made to German energy company EWE. The STAR refinery, which is wholly owned by Azeri state oil company SOCAR, will increase Turkey’s 28.1 million tonne annual oil processing capacity by a third, according to official data. Producing diesel, jet fuel, LPG, petroleum coke and xylene, the plant will supply 25 percent of Turkey’s processed oil product needs, SOCAR’s website says. The plant will still obtain raw oil from international markets, SOCAR officials said. SOCAR is the principal partner in the Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline (TANAP), which will carry natural gas from the Caspian Sea to Turkey and Europe.

The benchmark Italian bond yield rose to 4-1/2 year highs and the euro touched a 10-day low before rebounding as the European Union called Rome’s draft budget an “unprecedented” breach of EU fiscal rules. The selling of Italian assets subsided after European Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said he wanted to reduce tensions with Italy over its 2019 budget. The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread touched a 5-1/2 year high of 338 basis points. But stocks in China and the United States rose a day after posting sharp losses, putting a global stock index on track to post its first positive week in four. Strong earnings boosted shares on Wall Street as traders set aside concerns over growth in China and Europe, as well as political tension between the West and Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter. Fallout from the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul early this month, has compelled King Salman to intervene despite having given his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, vast powers. “There have been macro concerns but results have been the biggest driver this week, and today is no different,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR in New York. In late-morning trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 181.21 points, or 0.71 percent, to 25,560.66, the S&P 500 gained 21.83 points, or 0.79 percent, to 2,790.61 and the Nasdaq Composite added 63.43 points, or 0.85 percent, to 7,548.57. The pan-European STOXX 600 index rose 0.15 percent and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe shed 1.21 percent. Italy’s benchmark 10-year bond yield rose as high as 3.783 percent in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014. It last traded at 3.563 percent. Italian stocks were last trading flat on the day, while its bank stocks were last down -0.6 percent. Italy is the third-largest economy in the 19-country euro zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc. Emerging market stocks lost 1.30 percent. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan closed 0.68 percent lower. In currencies, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90 percent done although hurdles remained. Sterling was last trading at $1.3039, up 0.17 percent on the day. The euro recovered from one-week lows against the U.S. dollar as investors took profits on bets against the bloc’s currency. The dollar index fell 0.12 percent, with the euro up 0.38 percent to $1.1496. “The market has added to shorts considerably during the week and so I’m not surprised that the down move ended today,” said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy for BMO Capital Markets in New York. He said traders are “taking profit on a short that’s worked for them.” The Japanese yen weakened 0.29 percent versus the greenback at 112.56 per dollar. Oil prices rose on signs of surging demand in China, but the market remained concerned over rising U.S. inventories and trade wars that could curb economic activity. U.S. crude was up 87 cents, or 1.3 percent, at $69.52 per barrel and Brent was last at $80.15, up 86 cents, or 1.1 percent, on the day. U.S. Treasury yields rose as stocks rose on Wall Street.

2018-10-19,"(Reuters) - Schlumberger NV (SLB.N), the world’s largest oilfield services provider, reported a slight profit beat on Friday but cautioned that North American growth would slow due to transportation bottlenecks and hurt results next quarter. Although quarterly profits rose from a year ago, the company has been hit by slower-than-anticipated growth in the largest U.S. Permian Basin. Production has outpaced available pipeline takeaway capacity and driven prices lower, but Schlumberger expects the bottlenecks to be resolved in the next 12 to 18 months. “The North America land market is changing pretty rapidly,” Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said during a third-quarter earnings call.  The “rapid softening” in both hydraulic fracturing activity and pricing seen during the second half of the third quarter will continue at the same pace into the fourth quarter, he added.  Schlumberger, the first oilfield service provider to report earnings, is seen as a bellwether for the industry. The company warned investors last month that slowing activity in North America was affecting its business.  Shares of Schlumberger were up 2.3 percent at $59.76. The stock hit an 7-year low this week.   Schlumberger said “several key customers” were opting to stop using hydraulic fracturing fleets later this year and into January. “This is presenting terms challenges in terms of white spaces in the calendar,” Kibsgaard said.  The company reported a profit of $644 million, or 46 cents per share, up about 18 percent from a year ago. Analysts  anticipated earnings of 45 cents, excluding items, according to Refinitiv data. Schlumberger also echoed concerns cited on previous investor calls that poor oil and gas reservoirs and well performance in North America could prompt production gains to fall short of expectations.  Analysts from investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co said the results were within expectations but “unlikely to bring investors rushing off sidelines” and back into the sector. International revenue rose 1.3 percent to $5.22 billion, while revenue from North America jumped about 23 percent to $3.20 billion. “We may have seen the bottom in the international markets. The commentary seems more upbeat,” said Brian Youngberg, an Edward Jones analyst.  Total revenue rose to $8.5 billion from $7.91 billion a year ago.

2018-10-19,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - China’s State Power Investment Corporation is in talks to acquire two additional hydroelectric dams and two thermal plants in Brazil, a person with knowledge of the matter said Thursday. One of the hydroelectric dams is Usina Tres Irmaos, an 800 megawatt dam in Sao Paulo state, controlled by Brazilian infrastructure group Triunfo Participacoes e Investimentos SA (TPIS3.SA) (TPI), the person added, requesting anonymity to discuss private talks.  Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico first reported the talks over Tres Irmaos on its website on Thursday. State Power and Triunfo declined to comment.  But the source added a negotiation with Triunfo would not be easy, because the company was singled out by Brazilian prosecutors this month for not collaborating with a corruption probe investigating the its toll-road operations. The Chinese power company is expected to present a binding offer by the end of the month for control of the Santo Antonio hydropower dam, in the northern state of Rondonia. Talks to acquire the dam have gone on for almost two years. State Power is also considering a bid for two coal thermal plants that France’s Engie SA (ENGIE.PA) owns in the southern Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, the source said.  Engie, which put the plants up for sale six months ago, said the sale process is “ongoing”, without elaborating on bidders. Adriana Waltrick, State Power’s Brazil country head, told Reuters in May that the company wanted to keep investing in acquisitions after paying $2.25 billion for a license to operate the São Simao hydropower plant, previously run by state-owned Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais (CMIG4.SA).

2018-10-19,"(Updates with additional comment, background) By Asif Shahzad and Kay Johnson ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Pakistani conglomerate Engro Corp Ltd said on Friday it had “no obligation” to renegotiate a contract with the government for imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), a day after the new petroleum minister said it would seek new terms. A spokesman for Engro said the total contract, to process and supply up to 600 million cubic feet of LNG per day for 15 years, is currently worth about $228,000 per day or about $83 million per year. Engro’s stance sets up a potential conflict with the new government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has promised to scrutinize for corruption all deals made by the previous administration of ousted premier Nawaz Sharif. Engro said in a statement that the 2013 bidding for its Karachi terminal, Pakistan’s first, was done in a “auditable and transparent” tender process. The terminal came into operation in 2015. “The government does not have a contractual right to reopen/renegotiate its terms and we are accordingly under no obligation to renegotiate the same,” the firm said in a statement. It also said the government was miscalculating its net profits from the venture. Petroleum Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said on Thursday that the government would seek to renegotiate two LNG terminal deals, saying the previous government had agreed to pay too much. He cited a contractual clause allowing for renegotiation with mutual consent but hinted the government would take other action if Engro refused. “If they don’t come to renegotiation, then the further remedies that exist, we will definitely avail them,” the minister said. He did not name the company involved in the second LNG contract. It was unclear whether he was speaking of Pakistan’s other completed terminal or one of several new ones planned. The rapid adoption of LNG infrastructure has made Pakistan one of the industry’s fastest-growing markets in Asia, sparking interest from the world’s major energy producers and traders. It also helped ease electricity outages of up to 12 hours per day that had crippled industry and disrupted daily life for the population of 208 million people. Prime Minister Khan, however, is scrutinizing the deals. While in opposition, the former cricket star spearheaded a campaign accusing Sharif of corruption that led to the Supreme Court removing him from office last year. Sharif was convicted by an anti-corruption court and sentenced to 10 years in prison in July, just ahead of elections won by Khan. The three-time premier denies wrongdoing. Sharif’s former petroleum minister, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who became prime minister after Sharif was ousted, is also under investigation by the state anti-corruption body over an unnamed LNG deal. Abbasi has denied any wrongdoing. Sharif’s party officials say the corruption cases are part of a conspiracy by the judiciary and military to bring down their previous government and discredit their leaders. The army and courts deny any interference in politics.

2018-10-19,"TASHKENT (Reuters) - Russia and Uzbekistan began preliminary work on Friday on the first Uzbek nuclear power plant, a project Moscow estimates will cost $11 billion. The plant, to be largely financed by a soft loan from Russia, will allow Uzbekistan to use more of its natural gas for other purposes such as chemicals production or export.  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev pressed a symbolic button together at a ceremony in a conference hall in Tashkent to mark the start of geological surveying to decide on a location for the facility.  Uzbekistan expects to pour first concrete no earlier than 2020 because of the project’s complexity. The two-block, 2.4 gigawatt plant is expected to start producing power in 2028. Today, most electric power in Uzbekistan is generated by gas turbines, but the country wants to extract more added value from its gas reserves. The nuclear project launch was a highlight of Putin’s state visit to Tashkent, which saw the two sides also signed a number of other agreements, including in the energy sector. Russia’s Gazprom signed a production-sharing agreement for the Dzhel gas field where it aims to produce about 300 million cubic metres a year at peak, a small project by the region’s standards. LUKOIL, signed a memorandum on exploration work, and Russian businessman Andrei Filatov signed an agreement with an Uzbek state firm over a project to develop a gas field and build a chemical plant. Producing the same amount of energy as a nuclear power plant using modern gas turbines would consume more than 3.5 billion cubic metres of gas a year, according to Jurabek Mirzamahmudov, head of Uzbekistan’s nuclear energy agency UzAtom. “This is feedstock for one petrochemicals plant which could produce half a million tonnes of polymers,” he told reporters this week. Uzbekistan also exports gas by pipeline to Russia and China and the latter in particular has steadily increased energy purchases from Central Asia. Mirzamahmudov said it was possible Uzbekistan would add two more blocks to the plant in the future, doubling its capacity. So far, however, the cost is not final even for the first two blocks. Moscow has put it at $11 billion, but Mirzamahmudov said talks on the matter would start next year and Tashkent hoped the figure could be reduced.

2018-10-19,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2J76aKS By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas stocks are going into winter at the lowest level for fifteen years despite a slightly faster rate of injections into storage over the summer than in 2016 or 2017. Low inventories have encouraged hedge funds to build their largest position in futures and options for more than eight years and pushed benchmark prices to their highest level for almost nine months. But pressure on stocks and prices is being tempered by the development of El Niño conditions over the Pacific which should lead to a relatively mild winter for much of the country. Higher prices will encourage power producers to run gas-fired units for fewer hours in the coming weeks and increase generation from coal, which has been languishing at multi-decade lows. The resulting switch from gas to coal should help boost gas stocks faster than normal in the remainder of the injection season and limit drawdowns in the early stages of the winter heating season, conserving scarce stocks. If the winter starts with prolonged cold periods in November and December, however, the gas market could come under severe pressure, with prices spiking. Working gas stocks in underground storage reached 3,037 billion cubic feet (bcf) on Oct. 12, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“Weekly natural gas storage report”, EIA, Oct. 18). Stocks have risen by 1,688 bcf since the injection season started on April 1, compared with increases of 1,586 bcf in 2017 and 1,325 bcf in 2016 (tmsnrt.rs/2J76aKS). Even so, gas stocks are the lowest level since 2003, and the market has struggled to eliminate the deficit to the five-year average that developed during the long cold winter of 2017/18. Until a few weeks ago, most traders appeared unconcerned by low inventories and benchmark futures prices were stuck below $3 until the final week of September. Since then, hedge funds and other money managers have turned strongly bullish, increasing their net long position in futures and options by nearly 1,500 bcf over the last three weeks. Portfolio managers’ net long position is the highest for 35 weeks, according to position records published by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Fund managers now hold more than five bullish long positions betting on a further rise in prices for every bearish short position, the most lopsided bullish ratio for more than eight years. The accompanying jump in gas prices should encourage owners of gas-fired generation units to conserve fuel stocks. Prices would probably have jumped even further but for the relatively mild winter being forecast for 2018/19 as a result of El Niño conditions developing over the Pacific. The U.S. government puts the probability of El Niño developing by the end of the year at around 70-75 percent. El Niño typically brings warmer temperatures into the northern United States but colder, wetter and stormier weather in the south. In a mild El Niño, which this one seems likely to be, the weather impact can be masked by other developments (“Relationships between climate variability and winter temperature extremes in the United States”, Higgins et al, 2002). Nonetheless, the U.S. government is forecasting average or above-average temperatures across the entire country this winter (“Winter outlook favours warmer temperatures for much of the U.S.”, NOAA, Oct. 18). The U.S. gas market is now delicately poised between low stocks and the likelihood of a winter that it is warmer than average and warmer than either 2016/17 or 2017/18. Lopsided bullish hedge fund positioning in natural gas poses the main downside price risk if fund managers try to realise some of their profits and close out some of their positions. On the other hand, the market is relying on a relatively mild winter to eke out the meagre inventories, so any period of prolonged cold could send prices sharply higher.

She added the government did not yet have analysis of the impact any model may have on state dividends from CEZ, which put 12.4 billion crowns ($550 million) into state coffers last year. “No nuclear power unit is being built in the world without certain participation of the domestic government, so we will also have to find some participation even here,” she said. The world’s main six nuclear power builders are all vying for the expansion deal, long under discussion in the Czech Republic since CEZ cancelled an original tender in 2014 when the state refused to provide price guarantees. CEZ has maintained it cannot undertake such a risky project without state backing or some guarantees safeguarding investment returns. The state has debated various financing models that include possibly a break-up of CEZ that would give the state coal and nuclear assets while spinning off the “new energy” businesses to shareholders. Or the state could acquire and develop the nuclear project itself. A third option is CEZ undertaking the project through a subsidiary and guaranteeing it itself, which Prime Minister Andrej Babis has backed, saying it is big enough to manage it. “The minimum guarantee would be ... CEZ would guarantee (the project) with its assets and the Czech state would be the second in line in this guarantee,” Novakova said. “This is the option the government would like the most in this moment.” She said agreement must be found with shareholders in CEZ, which has remained active in the debate. “The government will decide how this (tender) process looks and I do not feel any resistance from the side of CEZ, they are cooperating,” she said when asked on what could happen if the two sides end up disagreeing on the financial model. The project to expand CEZ’s nuclear power plant fleet is the biggest investment ever into Czech energy. CEZ operates two plants at Dukovany and Temelin that together covered 38 percent of Czech energy needs last year. Novakova said a detailed analysis on the estimated cost will follow the decision on financing. She said among options, a model like Hungary is using to build new reactors - in which Russia’s Rosatom builds the unit, funded by a 10 billion euro loan from Russia - is not preferred. But she added she could not rule out “a partial supplier model of financing”.

2018-10-19,"LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Crunchy and tasty, yes, but could carrots also strengthen cement and cut carbon dioxide emissions for the building industry? A group of researchers at Britain’s Lancaster University has been using a household food blender to mix particles from the root vegetable with concrete to see if they can produce a stronger and more environmentally sound product. “We found out you could increase the strength of concrete by 80 percent by using a small amount of this new material,” lead researcher Mohamed Saafi told Reuters. The addition of carrots prevent any cracks in the concrete, the team said. It also means less cement is required, therefore lowering the global carbon dioxide (CO2) output. Cement is responsible for seven percent of total global CO2 emissions, according to International Energy Agency estimates. “Our preliminary results show that adding about half a kilogram of carrot nanomaterial will reduce about 10 kilograms of cement per one cubic metre of concrete,” Saafi said. The team have also tried sugar beet fibres in cement mixtures, with all their vegetables coming from food waste. They will continue to test their mixtures alongside their commercial partners, a Scottish company which makes paint using root vegetable fibres.

2018-10-19,"* Graphic: World FX rates in 2018 tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh * Italian 10-year bond yield hits 4 year high * Italian-German spread hits 5-1/2 year high * Euro recovers after falling to 2-mth low on Italy worries * MSCI ACWI set for longest losing streak since 2015 By Ritvik Carvalho LONDON, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Investors shed Italian bonds on Friday, driving their yields to 4-year highs while the euro fell to a 2-month low as the European Union called Rome’s draft budget an “unprecedented” breach of EU fiscal rules. U.S. stocks were set for a higher open, however, as a handful of major U.S. corporations beat results forecasts, offsetting concerns about political and growth risks in Europe, China and Saudi Arabia. Late on Thursday, the European Commission told Italy that planned government spending was too high, its structural deficit would rise instead of fall and public debt would not fall in line with EU rules. Italy is the third-largest economy in the 19-country euro zone, and a crisis there could unsettle the entire bloc. While it isn’t unusual for the EU to ask member countries for clarification on points of their budget plans, the sending of a formal letter and the tone of the comments were particularly strong, analysts said. “The letter was more sharply worded than usual. It described the budget as ‘an obvious deviation’ from prior commitments, on an ‘unprecedented’ scale,” Deutsche Bank research strategist Jim Reid said in a note to clients. Top euro zone officials insisted Italy’s budget plan did not pose a “Greek-like” threat to European financial stability, but the row nonetheless led money market investors to start pushing back expectations for the timing of a European Central Bank rate rise. Italy’s benchmark 10-year bond yields rose to 3.74 percent in early trade on Friday, the highest since February 2014. They last traded at 3.71 percent. Italian stocks fell 0.7 percent, while its bank stocks were last down 2.2 percent. The budget dispute initially weighed on the euro, which fell to a two-month low, before recovering by afternoon trade in Europe, last up 0.2 percent on the day. The closely watched Italian/German bond yield spread hit a fresh 5-1/2 year high of 338 basis points. Portuguese and Spanish bonds, that have been resilient so far through the Italian budget worries, were also sold, with several analysts suggesting that this was the first sign of contagion from Italy. Analysts at MUFG said that if BTP (Italian government bond) yields moved notably higher “correlations could well strengthen and this would provide further downside pressure for the euro”. Stock markets all round were a bit lacklustre: data showing China’s economy growing at its slowest pace since 2009 weighed on shares in Asia, although Chinese shares staged a recovery after the securities regulator announced a series of measures to aid the market. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.2 percent after earlier falling as much as 0.9 percent ahead of the China GDP reading. Australian shares fell 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei average ended 0.6 percent lower for its third straight week of declines. Stocks in Europe managed a modest rise at the start of trading, but fell back into the red. The pan-European STOXX 600 index was down 0.1 percent. The MSCI All-Country World Index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, was down 0.1 percent on the day. It was set for a fourth weekly loss on the trot, which would make it its longest weekly losing streak since the end of 2015. 1609 out of 2767 stocks on the index are in a bear market (58 percent of the total), up from 1557 last week, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note on Friday. In currencies, the dollar index, a gauge of the greenback’s value against major peers, was 0.1 percent lower at 95.863. Meanwhile, the British pound rose after EU negotiator Michel Barnier said a Brexit deal with the United Kingdom was 90 percent done although hurdles remained. Oil prices ticked higher after falling on Thursday. U.S. crude was up 0.6 percent at $69.04 a barrel and Brent crude was trading at $79.94 per barrel, 0.8 percent higher. Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,227.55 per ounce.

2018-10-19,"(Adds background) By Paulina Duran SYDNEY, Oct 19 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Energy and Minerals Group (EMG) has cut the size of the Australian IPO of its coal miner Coronado Global Resources and priced it at the bottom of the offered range, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Shares in Coronado were priced at A$4.00 each and the IPO was cut to 20 percent of the company, the sources said, raising about A$773 million ($550 million). EMG had aimed to sell a stake of up to 30 percent in the initial public offering at a price between A$4.00 and A$4.80 per share. “The Coronado Global Resources book build closed today and is well covered,” a spokeswoman for the company said. “No further information will be provided at this stage.” The IPO gives the company an enterprise value of about A$3.86 billion, making it the biggest coal mining float in Australia since Yancoal Australia listed in 2012 at the peak of the country’s mining boom. Coronado mainly produces metallurgical coal with annual output of 8.2 million tonnes from three U.S. mines and 8.5 million tonnes from the Curragh mine in Australia, which it bought from Wesfarmers Ltd in December for A$700 million. That makes it one of the biggest metallurgical coal producers outside the big diversified miners, competing with U.S. firm Warrior Met Coal Inc. It also produces 3.5 million tonnes a year of steaming coal, used for energy generation, at Curragh, which it sells to the Queensland state government’s power producer Stanwell Corp. Metallurgical coal prices are back where they were at the start of the year at around $195 a tonne, having jumped by 20 percent from the start of August when they plumbed a nine-month low. But according to the IPO prospectus, metallurgical coal prices are expected to decline in coming years due to new coal supply and lower Chinese demand. The proceeds from the IPO will be used to repay debt and will help the private equity firm realise part of its investments.

2018-10-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC is struggling to add barrels to the market after agreeing in June to increase output, an internal document seen by Reuters showed, as an increase in Saudi Arabia was offset by declines in Iran, Venezuela and Angola. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies agreed in June to boost supply as U.S. President Donald Trump urged producers to offset losses caused by sanctions on Iran and to dampen rising prices.  Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said OPEC and non-OPEC would pump roughly an extra 1 million barrels per day (bpd) following the June agreement. The OPEC document seen by Reuters adds to signs they have yet to deliver the full amount. OPEC says it is on course to do so, although it hasn’t given a timeframe. “It is a work in progress,” OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo said earlier this week. The internal document prepared by OPEC’s Vienna headquarters for a technical panel meeting on Friday showed that OPEC members, excluding Nigeria, Libya and Congo pumped an extra 428,000 bpd in September compared to May. The OPEC and non-OPEC technical panel called the Joint Technical Committee reviews producers’ compliance with their oil supply pledges. Top exporter Saudi Arabia pumped most of the extra oil, raising output by 524,000 bpd in September compared to May, the document showed. Other increases came from Iraq, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Iran, facing U.S. sanctions on its oil exports from Nov. 4, cut production by 376,000 bpd in September versus May, and has said OPEC and Saudi Arabia are not able to make up for a total loss of its exports.  “There is no spare capacity,” Iran’s OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said last month. Among other OPEC members, production fell by 189,000 bpd in Venezuela and by 17,000 bpd in Angola. The non-OPEC nations cooperating with OPEC pumped an extra 296,000 bpd since May, the OPEC document showed. Russia increased output by 389,000 bpd, although Kazakhstan, Mexico and Malaysia posted declines.  Nigeria, Libya and Congo are not included in OPEC’s supply-limiting pact. Including them brings the increase in OPEC’s  output in September to 628,000 bpd.

December spot LNG LNG-AS fell to $10.40 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), the lowest since mid-August. November cargoes were valued at below $10 per mmBtu, trade sources said. Oil prices are set for a second weekly drop amid high inventory, weighing on LNG prices as many contracts are oil-linked. Japan’s Inpex offered four spot cargoes over the second half of October through November from its giant Ichthys project in northwestern Australia, in a sign that it may be ramping up production, two industry sources said. It was not immediately clear if the cargoes were sold by Friday, but Inpex was due to load its first LNG cargo from the long-delayed project this week after earlier selling its first condensate cargoes, sources have said. Angola LNG and Sakhalin LNG each offered a cargo for November though details of the buyers were not immediately known. Australia’s Woodside Petroleum has also resold some of its U.S. term cargoes, an industry source said. Woodside has an agreement to buy LNG from Cheniere’s planned Corpus Christi export plant on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Chinese buyers were still largely absent from the spot market, traders said, as they look towards longer term supplies ahead of winter. Unipec Asia, the trading arm of Chinese oil major Sinopec, is in talks to buy more LNG from the Exxon Mobil Corp-operated Papua New Guinea project, possibly for a period of three years, sources said. “Everyone is worried about a winter shortage,” said one major LNG buyer in China, adding this is driving Chinese companies to lock in term supply ahead of winter when demand typically surges. Chinese gas distributor ENN Energy Holdings has begun operations on the first phase of its Zhoushan liquefied natural gas import terminal, aiming to ramp up winter supplies in eastern China. Meanwhile, commodities trader Trafigura sold a cargo for late December delivery into Japan to trading house Vitol Asia during price agency Platts’ trading process on Friday, sources said. The cargo was sold on a price linked to Britain’s National Balancing Point (NBP). Oil major BP also sold a cargo for delivery into South Korea for mid-December to Vitol Asia.

2018-10-19,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should bring forward a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans by eight years to 2032 to help the country reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, a parliamentary committee said on Friday. Britain hopes to become a world leader in electric vehicle technology and currently plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars and vans from 2040 as a part of efforts to meet its climate targets. “If we are serious about being EV (electric vehicle) world leaders, the government must come forward with a target of new sales of cars and vans to be zero emission by 2032,” said Rachel Reeves, Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, which authored the report. The report said the country should improve incentives for the uptake of electric vehicles and criticised a recent decision to cut grants for new plug-in hybrid electric vehicles from November. It also said the country’s infrastructure, to allow for the charging of electric vehicles, was not fit for purpose. “The government needs to get a grip and lead on coordinating the financial support and technical know-how necessary for local authorities to promote this infrastructure and help ensure that electric cars are an attractive option for consumers,” Reeves said. Britain has around 16,500 charging points but will need this to increase to at least 100,000 by 2020, a report from UK-based data company Emu Analytics said in May. Britain’s energy industry association, Energy UK, backed the call for an earlier start to the ban. “We firmly support the committee’s call for greater ambition and believe that an accelerated timetable for the roll out of Electric Vehicles (EVs) is both desirable and feasible,” it said. However, Britain’s Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said the 2040 ban was already ambitious and said meeting the target earlier would be almost impossible. “Zero emission vehicles make up just 0.6 percent of the market, meaning consumer appetite would have to grow by some 17,000 percent in just over a decade. This is unrealistic,” SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes said in a statement.

2018-10-19,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s environment ministry on Friday called out officials in a northwestern coal producing zone for lacking the “will” to fight pollution, the latest region to come under scrutiny in Beijing’s war on smog. In its latest review of how regions are complying with tougher pollution laws, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment singled out Ningxia for criticism on the day China said the country’s coal output hit its highest in nine months in September. Some districts and departments in Ningxia did not have the “will” or confidence to control pollution, inspectors said in a report in the China Environment News, a ministry publication. They said Ningxia’s economic and trade commission had submitted reports alleging that environmental protection was a “burden on industrial growth”. The commission blamed a tougher smog control and inspection regime for a slowdown in industrial activity, despite what inspectors said were “obvious errors” in the commission’s data. “They (the commission) tried to get rid of their responsibility and interfere with decision making,” the inspectors said.    Ningxia, a poor and drought-prone region, wants to exploit its reserves of coal and export electricity through a beefed-up power grid. But it has been forced to shut down 32 small coal mines and millions of tonnes of annual production capacity in sectors like steel and aluminum since a national clean-up campaign began in 2016. Ningxia is the latest region to be chastised by the environment ministry for failing to enforce anti-pollution measures. Three cities in Jiangsu were accused this week of exaggerating coal consumption cuts last year.      Hebei, the biggest steel producing region, came under fire on Thursday, with inspectors criticizing some officials for not rectifying previous failings in controlling pollution. Hebei’s dependence on fossil fuels remained high, with coal accounting for 83.6 percent of the province’s primary energy consumption, 23 percentage points higher than the national average, the ministry said. Officials have faced some form of punishment as a result of the latest round of poor environmental reviews. In the three regions reported so far, 1,439 officials were held responsible for violations, of which 707 were reprimanded and 183 detained.  The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is one of China’s most industrialized, with Hebei province producing nearly a quarter of the country’s steel. It has been on the front line of the country’s war on pollution for more than four years. The region is about to embark on another tough winter campaign against smog, with inspectors set to force industrial factories to curb output if they have not done enough to clean up their operations. Vice Premier Han Zheng said on Thursday authorities must ensure residents have enough heating this winter, even as thousands of households switch from coal to cleaner natural gas. Han, who leads a cross-ministerial committee to tackle pollution in the region, said it was “absolutely forbidden” to dismantle boilers and leave households without a source of heat, the Xinhua news agency said.    Parts of the region were left without heating last year after governments demolished coal-burning boilers but failed to secure enough natural gas as a replacement fuel. Hebei was home to four of China’s 10 cities with the poorest air quality, according to data for the first nine months of 2018. That is down from six cities in 2017.

Tokyo’s core consumer price index, which includes oil products but excludes fresh food prices, was seen rising 1.0 percent in October from a year earlier, the poll of 17 economists showed, in line with the 1.0 percent rise in September. The Tokyo index is released a month before nationwide core CPI for the same period. “Energy prices contributed to support Tokyo core CPI but the pace of recovery in prices of other items remained slow and will unlikely jump anytime soon,” said Yoshiki Shinke, chief economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. “We expect Tokyo core CPI index will stay around 1.0 percent year-on-year for a while.” The internal affairs ministry will issue the core CPI for Tokyo at 8:30 a.m. on Friday Oct. 26 Japan time (2330 GMT on Oct. 25). Latest data showed the nationwide core CPI rose 1.0 percent in September from a year earlier but remained at half the pace of the central bank’s elusive 2 percent target. BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda recently offered a slightly more upbeat view on inflation than three months ago. The central bank will hold its rate review on Oct. 30-31, when it issues new quarterly growth and inflation forecasts.

2018-10-19,"(Corrects milestone in 5th paragraph to world’s largest importer, not 2nd-largest) * Oil prices inch higher after losses on Thursday * Crude benchmarks set for second weekly decline * China refinery throughput hits record high in Sept * Sino-U.S. trade war, Saudi tensions weigh on sentiment By Roslan Khasawneh SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices nudged higher on Friday on signs of surging demand in China, the world’s second-biggest oil user, though prices are set to fall for a second week amid concerns of the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war is limiting overall economic activity. Brent crude oil futures were trading at $79.61 per barrel at 0645 GMT, up 32 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were up 26 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $68.91 a barrel. For the week, Brent crude was 1 percent lower while WTI futures were down 3.4 percent, putting both on track for a second consecutive weekly decline. Refinery throughput in China, the world’s largest oil importer, rose to a record high of 12.49 million barrels per day (bpd) in September as some independent plants restarted operations after prolonged shutdowns over summer to shore up inventories, government data showed on Friday. The refinery consumption may rise through the fourth quarter as several state-owned Chinese refiners return to service after maintenance. Undermining the strong refinery data, China did on Friday report its weakest economic growth since 2009 in the third quarter, with gross domestic product expanding by only 6.5 percent, missing estimates. The weak economic data raised concerns that the country’s trade war with United States is beginning to have an impact on growth, which may limit China’s oil demand. The trade war concerns combined with surging U.S. oil stockpiles reported on Thursday are capping the day’s price gains. U.S. crude stocks last week climbed 6.5 million barrels, the fourth straight weekly build, almost triple the amount analysts had forecast, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. “EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report was a complete shocker sending Oil markets spiralling lower amidst some concerning development for oil bulls,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading APAC at OANDA in Singapore. Inventories rose sharply even as U.S. crude production slipped 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 10.9 million bpd last week due to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael. Meanwhile, Iranian oil exports may have increased in October when compared to the previous month as buyers rush to lift more cargoes ahead of looming U.S. sanctions that kick in on Nov. 4. An unprecedented volume of Iranian crude oil is set to arrive at China’s northeast Dalian port this month and in early November before U.S. sanctions on Iran take effect, according to an Iranian shipping source and data on Refinitiv Eikon. So far, a total of 22 million barrels of Iranian crude oil loaded on supertankers owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) are expected to arrive at Dalian in October and November, the data showed. Dalian typically receives between 1 million and 3 million barrels of Iranian oil each month, according to data that dates back to January 2015.

The MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.3 percent after earlier falling as much as 0.9 percent ahead of the release of China’s latest GDP reading. Spreadbetters in Europe expect shares in Germany, where big exporters are sensitive to the health of China’s economy, to fall at the open, with the DAX seen opening down 0.15 percent. France’s CAC 40 is expected to open 0.04 percent lower, but the FTSE 100 is seen rising 0.24 percent. Australian shares fell 0.05 percent and Japan’s Nikkei average ended 0.6 percent lower for its third straight week of declines. China shares see-sawed but were up firmly in early afternoon trade following statements of government support for the market. The Shanghai index, which in the morning fell to its weakest level in four years, turned around to gain 2.3 percent around 0620 GMT. The blue-chip index surged 2.7 percent. The rebound in China followed weakness on Wall Street on Thursday, which had earlier set the tone for many Asian markets. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.27 percent, the S&P 500 lost 1.44 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.06 percent. As the Asian day wore on, investors in China shrugged off data showing that China’s economy grew 6.5 percent in the third quarter, its weakest pace since 2009 and below expectations, as a campaign to tackle debt risks and the trade war with the United States weighed on the economy. “Weakness is largely coming from the secondary industry- most notably manufacturing,” said Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ. “We may review our Q4 forecasts. Property investment continues to hold up which may provide some support.” Shares in China had initially sputtered at the open of trade, then firmed as investors digested statements from senior regulators pledging support for private firms and companies facing liquidity problems. China’s banking and insurance regulator also said on Friday that it may allow bank wealth management subsidiaries to invest directly in stocks. Kota Hirayama, senior emerging markets economist at SMBC Nikko Securities in Tokyo, said that downward pressure on Chinese growth in part reflected the impact of Beijing’s long-running deleveraging campaign. “The government has been aware of the negative impact from deleveraging and has swung towards easing around June, but the positive impact is yet to be felt,” he said. “There should be enough funding and if the funds trickle down to public works, we could expect to see positive impact in the next quarter.” But analysts cautioned that China’s economy would continue to face difficulties. “Looking ahead, economic outlook is not optimistic with exports facing further headwinds as U.S. tariffs kick in and demand from emerging countries ebbs,” said Nie Wen, an analyst at Hwabao Trust in Shanghai. China’s premier said this week that the economy faces increased downward pressure, but that government will take measures to stabilise growth amid the trade war. In the latest trade war volley, the U.S. has requested that a World Trade Organization dispute resolution panel look into tariffs imposed by China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico in retaliation to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium. Further fraying market nerves, the European Commission on Thursday said a draft 2019 budget from Italy was in “particularly serious non-compliance” with EU rules, setting the stage for a possible unprecedented rejection of the country’s fiscal plan. On Thursday, the flight to safe-haven assets partly dampened rising U.S. Treasury yields. On Friday, however, the 10-year yield rose to 3.1826 percent from the U.S. close on Thursday of 3.175 percent. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, rose to 2.8871 percent. The euro was up 0.1 percent at $1.1464, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was a touch higher at 95.925. The dollar was up 0.23 percent against the yen at 112.44 . Oil prices ticked higher after falling on Thursday. U.S. crude was up 0.4 percent at $68.92 a barrel and Brent crude was trading at $79.61 per barrel, also 0.4 percent higher. Spot gold gained 0.3 percent to $1,228.60 per ounce.

China has been given the go-ahead for a number of big coal mines as it tries to ease concerns about fuel shortages amid a crackdown on small outdated mines and tightened emission controls. Miners churned out 306.01 million tonnes of coal last month, up 3.2 percent from 296.6 million tonnes in August and up 5.2 percent from the same time last year, according to the data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Output over the first nine months of 2018 in the world’s top producer of the commodity reached 2.59 billion tonnes, up 5.1 percent from a year earlier. “The increase in coal output is not surprising as new mining capacity in the northwest was released on schedule,” said Cheng Gong, senior coal analyst at Zheshang Securities. Coal output from the region of Inner Mongolia last month jumped 11.3 percent from the same month in 2017, while Shaanxi province saw growth of 9.9 percent, according to NBS. By the end of June, China had a total of 3.49 billion tonnes of coal mining capacity, while another 976 million tonnes of capacity is still under construction, according to data from the National Energy Administration. “We expect to see more capacity being released in the coming months, which will further boost coal output in China,” said Cheng. Meanwhile, northern China will soon turn on coal- or gas-powered heating as temperatures drop sharply in the run-up to winter. The official heating season starts on Nov. 15. Benchmark thermal coal prices on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange have risen around 6 percent from early September.

China’s crude oil throughout rose to 12.49 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, up from 11.85 million bpd in August, according to Reuters calculations based on National Bureau of Statistics data. The higher processing rate came as China raised its crude oil imports to a four-month high Year-to-date processing volumes rose 8.1 percent on a year earlier to 452.54 million tonnes, or 12.1 million bpd, the data showed. China’s September domestic crude oil production fell 2.4 percent on a year earlier to 15.18 million tonnes, or 3.69 million bpd, according to the data. Output in the first nine months came in at 141.13 million tonnes, down 1.9 percent from a year earlier. That equates to 3.77 million bpd. Refinery output is expected to rise further in the fourth quarter as several state refiners resume operations after scheduled major overhauls. These include PetroChina’s 130,000-bpd Daqing refinery in the northeast and the newly upgraded 200,000-bpd Huabei plant. Natural gas production rose 8.5 percent in September from a year earlier to 12.2 billion cubic meters (bcm). Output for the year to date was 116.2 bcm, up 6.2 percent. PetroChina has stepped up drilling at top gas field Changqing, which makes up about a quarter of the national total, and is aiming for record output this year to help meet a winter demand spike. crude conversion tonne = 7.3 barrels

2018-10-19,"* China demand seen surging more than 40 pct this year -analyst * Potential 3-year deal under discussion -sources * PNG LNG looking to firm up last mid-term supply of 0.45 mtpa * ‘Everyone worried about winter shortage’ -China LNG buyer (Adds details and background) By Jessica Jaganathan SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Unipec Asia, the trading arm of Chinese oil major Sinopec , is in talks to buy more liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Exxon Mobil Corp-operated Papua New Guinea (PNG) project, five industry sources told Reuters. If agree, a supply deal would likely start ahead of an expected surge in China’s demand this winter and it will be for about three years, two of the sources briefed on the matter said. They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak with media. The exact volumes under discussion were not immediately clear but project holder Oil Search said in its half-yearly results statement in August that negotiations are ongoing to contract the project’s final batch of mid-term supply totalling 0.45 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa). Exxon’s existing LNG deal with Unipec from the PNG project, signed in 2009, is to supply about 2 mmtpa for 20 years. The overall PNG project has a total contracted volume of 7.5 mmtpa so far, according to Oil Search. The project has signed mid-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with PetroChina and oil major BP, and has sold 6.6 mmtpa under long-term contracts to Japanese trading giant JERA, Osaka Gas, Sinopec and Taiwan’s CPC Corp. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Exxon is also currently in talks with other potential buyers of Papua New Guinea LNG. Exxon holds a 33.2 percent stake in PNG LNG, while Oil Search has a 29 percent interest. Two PNG government-linked entities and Australia’s Santos Ltd hold smaller stakes. An Exxon spokeswoman in Papua New Guinea declined to comment, saying the company does not comment on commercial matters. A Sinopec spokesman did not comment. “Everyone is worried about a winter shortage,” said one major LNG buyer in China, adding this is driving Chinese companies to lock in supply ahead of winter when demand typically surges. For example, China’s Petrochina International inked a three-year agreement with the PNG LNG project in July for the supply of 0.45 million tonnes of LNG a year. It also signed a 22-year deal with Qatargas in September for 3.4 million tonnes of LNG a year.

2018-10-19,"ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - To combat worsening smog, Pakistan’s government has ordered all traditional brick kilns closed for 70 days starting Saturday, as it promotes new cleaner kilns that could cut pollution up to 70 percent. But the measure has produced an outcry both from kiln owners, who want incentives to make the switch, and from kiln workers who fear losing income. “How I will provide food to my three children during closure of the kilns?” asked Sumaira Bibi, 35, who with her 60-year-old husband frames up 1,200 bricks a day for a kiln near Islamabad, earning about $8. Under the government order, all traditional kilns must shut from October 20 until December 31 to cut smog that has blighted parts of Punjab province, and other areas of the country, in recent years. Pakistan has about 19,000 such kilns, said Shoaib Khan Niazi, president of the All Pakistan Brick Kiln Association. The government has also ordered that all kilns be converted to “zig-zag” technology, a design change that makes more efficient use of fuel, according to the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency. No deadline for the switch has been set. An internal zig-zag structure in kilns, combined with the use of an air blower, can cut the consumption of coal, slash emissions substantially and improve the quality of bricks produced, said Malik Amin Aslam, an adviser to Prime Minister Imran Khan on climate change issues. Traditional kiln owners, however, are demanding a shutdown of no more than a month, and insisting on government help to make the design change. Mehar Abdul Haq, a brick kiln owner in the Kasur district of Punjab province, said kilns should be shut for a maximum of 30 days or only on days when there is smog. He said about 20 kilns in Punjab are in the process of being converted to zig-zag technology, with five or six now operating using it. The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), a Nepal-based non-governmental organisation, has carried out two training programmes on the technology for kiln owners in Pakistan, aiming to cut smog and climate-changing emissions. But Haq said converting a conventional kiln to the new technology costs $15,000 to $20,000, a hefty investment. “We have demanded the government either give loans on easy terms or provide interest-free loans to convert to the technology - but in vain,” he said. EFFICIENT - BUT INCONVENIENT Niazi, of the brick kiln owner’s association, said a 70-day closure would cause unemployment not only at brick kilns but in the coal and construction industries. It would also drive up the cost of bricks in Pakistan, he said. He said an average of 100 to 150 people worked at each brick kiln. “Neither are we getting financial nor technical support from the government,” he said - though he admitted the zig-zag technology was environmentally friendly and energy efficient. The technology uses 30 to 40 percent less energy than traditional kilns, and cuts the costs of bricks produced by up to half, Niazi said. Naseem-ur-Rehman, a Punjab spokesman for Pakistan’s Environmental Protection Agency, said brick kilns were a major contributor to smog, along with vehicle emissions and burning of crop stubble. Smog is a particular problem from late October through mid-January in Pakistan. “We cannot end smog at all but we are trying to reduce it through steps at all levels,” Rehman said. The new technology has benefits for kiln owners as well, he said, including cost and time savings, and a reduction in sub-standard bricks produced. “What we are seeing is that this technology reduces carbon emissions more than 70 percent,” he said - which means those kilns using zig-zag technology will be allowed to operate during smog season. But other kiln owners should expect that “we will keep on shutting these kilns after intervals to force them to covert to zig-zag,” he said. Mome Saleem, an Islamabad-based environmentalist, said the closure of the kilns would help cut smog but other industries needed attention too. “The government should formulate an inclusive strategy to combat the smog instead of just shutting the kilns,” she suggested. Arif Jeewa, former chairman of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD), said a shutdown of brick kilns would have no impact on Pakistan’s commercial construction industry because it relied instead on cement blocks. Aslam, the Prime Minister’s adviser, said the government was moving now to try to avoid smog problems in the months to come. “We are shutting down brick kilns and factories that emit greenhouse gases in excess,” he said. “The closure will have an economic impact - but so does their continued and unabated operation, which has a huge environmental impact,” he said.

They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak with media. The exact volumes under discussion were not immediately clear but project holder Oil Search said in its half-yearly results statement in August that negotiations are ongoing to contract the project’s final batch of mid-term supply totalling 0.45 million tonnes per annum (mmtpa). The Papua New Guinea project has a total contracted volume of 7.5 mmtpa so far, according to Oil Search. The project has signed mid-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with PetroChina and oil major BP, and has sold 6.6 mmtpa under long-term contracts to Japanese trading giant JERA, Osaka Gas, Sinopec and Taiwan’s CPC Corp. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Exxon is also currently in talks with other potential buyers of Papua New Guinea LNG.

2018-10-19,"SINGAPORE, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices nudged higher on Friday but were set for a second weekly drop amid higher U.S. crude inventories, an ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war and concerns over the death of a prominent Saudi journalist. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery was up 27 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $68.92 a barrel by 0124 GMT. Front-month London Brent crude for December delivery was up 34 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $79.63 a barrel. For the week, U.S. crude was down 3.5 percent, while Brent was 1.1 percent lower, putting both on track for a second consecutive weekly decline. “EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report was a complete shocker sending Oil markets spiralling lower amidst some concerning development for Oil bulls,” said Stephen Innes, head of trading APAC at OANDA in Singapore. U.S. crude stocks last week climbed 6.5 million barrels, the fourth straight weekly build, almost triple the amount analysts had forecast, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. Inventories rose sharply even as U.S. crude production slipped 300,000 barrels per day to 10.9 million bpd last week due to the effects of offshore facilities closing temporarily for Hurricane Michael. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he presumes missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi is dead and that the U.S. response to Saudi Arabia will likely be “very severe” but that he still wanted to get to the bottom of what exactly happened. The United States and other Western nations are in a dilemma about how to respond because of lucrative business ties, including weapons sales to Riyadh. Meanwhile, Iranian oil exports may have increased in October when compared to the previous month as buyers rush to lift more cargoes ahead of looming U.S. sanctions that kick in on Nov. 4. An unprecedented volume of Iranian crude oil is set to arrive at China’s northeast Dalian port this month and in early November before U.S. sanctions on Iran take effect, according to an Iranian shipping source and data on Refinitiv Eikon. So far, a total of 22 million barrels of Iranian crude oil loaded on supertankers owned by the National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) is expected to arrive at Dalian in October and November, the data showed. Dalian typically receives between 1 million and 3 million barrels of Iranian oil each month, according to data that dates back to January 2015.

2018-10-19,"SHANGHAI, Oct 19 (Reuters) - Stocks in Asia fell on Friday as global sentiment soured on issues ranging from trade worries, Italy’s 2019 budget, higher U.S. interest rates and growth concerns in China that led to a slump in Chinese shares in the previous session. Early in the trading day, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was 0.4 percent weaker following losses on Wall Street overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.27 percent, the S&P 500 lost 1.44 percent and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 2.06 percent. Australian shares were down 0.6 percent, while Japan’s Nikkei stock index was 1.7 percent lower. “Markets continue to digest the combination of higher U.S. rates, ongoing trade tension and Chinese growth concerns,” analysts at ANZ said in a note. On Thursday, the flight to safe-haven assets partly offset a rise in U.S. Treasury yields sparked by worries about the pace of interest rate increases by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Early in Asia on Friday, the 10-year yield was higher at 3.1767 percent, compared with a U.S. close of 3.175 percent on Thursday. The two-year yield, sensitive to expectations of higher Fed fund rates, edged up to 2.8741 percent. Investors are looking to third-quarter GDP data out of China, due Friday, for indications of a slowing economy. The numbers are expected to show the weakest pace of growth since the global financial crisis amid a worsening trade war with the United States. China’s premier said this week that the country’s economic faces increased downward pressure, but said the government will take targeted measures to stabilise growth. The benchmark Shanghai Composite index touched its lowest level in nearly four years on Thursday before closing down 2.9 percent, dragged down by falling energy shares hit by cheaper oil and by widespread concern that plunging share prices could lead to a spike in margin calls. Chinese authorities have taken steps in recent days to alleviate market pressure, including asking creditors of one Beijing company to avoid forcing margin calls. In the latest trade war volley, the U.S. is requesting that a World Trade Organization dispute resolution panel look into tariffs imposed by China, the European Union, Canada and Mexico in retaliation to U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium. Further fraying market nerves, the European Commission on Thursday said a draft 2019 budget from Italy was in “particularly serious non-compliance” with EU rules, setting the stage for a possible unprecedented rejection of the country’s fiscal plan. The euro was flat at $1.1454, having lost 1.3 percent in a month, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was a hair higher at 95.940. The dollar was up 0.04 percent against the yen at 112.23 . Oil prices ticked higher after falling on Thursday. U.S. crude was up 0.3 percent at $68.86 a barrel and Brent crude was trading at $79.56 per barrel, also 0.3 percent higher. Gold also rose, with spot gold trading at $1,225.56 per ounce.

2018-10-19,"(Repeats column that ran on Thursday, with no changes) * Chart: tmsnrt.rs/2OAMfKf By John Kemp LONDON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Oil prices and calendar spreads have softened significantly this month as traders became more confident about the availability of supplies towards the end of the year and into early 2019. Iran’s exports have not declined as much as predicted a couple of months ago and it is now clear they will not fall to zero, even after U.S. sanctions are re-imposed next month. Refiners in Turkey, India and possibly China are reportedly negotiating with U.S. officials over waivers to enable them to continue purchasing at least some Iranian oil after Nov. 4. At the same time, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf producers have boosted their exports in response to the earlier rise in prices and pressure from the United States to cool the market. Traders, meanwhile, have become more cautious about the consumption outlook for the rest of 2018/19, with most indicators pointing to a loss of economic momentum outside the United States. As a result, most major forecasters are now predicting a significant acceleration in non-OPEC oil supplies in 2019 as well as slower growth in consumption, shifting the outlook from one of continuing deficits back towards a surplus. In part, the improved supply picture has come about because the surge in oil prices during August and September forced both the White House and Saudi Arabia to adapt their positions. The United States has softened its insistence on forcing Iran’s exports towards zero, while Saudi Arabia has ramped up its own exports in October and November to alleviate fears about a possible shortage. In effect, the oil market found the pain threshold for the U.S. administration, which lies at around $80 per barrel for Brent, and pushed prices high enough to enforce a partial course correction from policymakers. As the supply outlook has improved, traders have begun to scale back bets on a crude crunch occurring towards the end of the year. Hedge funds and other money managers sold futures and options linked to Brent prices equivalent to 21 million barrels in the two weeks ending on Oct. 9, after buying 172 million barrels over the previous five weeks. Portfolio managers have also sold contracts linked to WTI prices equivalent to 90 million barrels over the last five weeks, according to position records published by regulators and exchanges. Total hedge fund long positions in crude have fallen to 865 million barrels, from a recent high of 908 million in late September, while short positions have risen to 93 million barrels from 65 million. As hedge-fund buying has turned into selling, spot prices have come under pressure, with front-month Brent futures retreating from a four-year high of $86 on Oct. 3 to just over $80 on Wednesday and below that so far on Thursday. As hedge fund managers tend to concentrate their holdings in contracts close to expiry, which are more liquid, selling pressure has been most pronounced at the front end of the futures curve. Nearby futures prices have fallen much more heavily than contracts with longer to run before expiry, shifting the entire futures curve from a steep backwardation closer to flat. Brent’s six-month calendar spread has eased from a backwardation of more than $2 per barrel at the start of the month to just over $1 on Wednesday. (tmsnrt.rs/2OAMfKf). In the past, the Brent calendar spread has been a reliable indicator of the supply-demand balance, and the recent softening of the spread is consistent with an improved near-term outlook for global oil supplies.

2018-10-19,"(Reuters) - DowDuPont Inc (DWDP.N) said on Thursday it would write down the value of its agriculture business by $4.6 billion when it reports third-quarter results, as global seed makers face shifts in demand linked to the U.S.-China trade war. The charge sent DowDuPont shares down as much as 6 percent in extended trading. The company, in a regulatory filing, also said its agriculture unit would see reduced cash flow, hit by weak sales and margin growth in North America and Latin American markets. In a later statement, DowDuPont said the charge was non-cash and reflected the effect of previously reported market conditions. It said the charge would not affect full-year 2018 financial guidance for flat net sales in the agriculture business.  An escalating trade war between the United States and China is increasing uncertainty for players in the farm sector. In response to Trump administration tariffs on Chinese goods, Beijing this year imposed a 25 percent tariff on U.S. soybeans, the most valuable American farm export to China. China, the world’s largest importer of soybeans, has scaled back purchases of U.S. soy as a result, and is buying from Brazil instead. The shift has prompted Brazilian farmers to plant more soybeans, instead of corn. Some U.S. farmers may make the opposite choice in the spring.             The changes can affect DowDuPont because about two-thirds of its net seed sales are corn and 20 percent are soybeans. “The lower growth expectation is driven by reduced planted area, an expected unfavorable shift to soybeans from corn in Latin America, and delays in expected product registrations,” DowDuPont said in a filing.     DowDuPont also said low commodity prices and bigger-than-expected inventories would likely cause farmers to buy less-advanced seed technologies. The trade dispute has hurt U.S. crop prices, already under pressure from years of large harvests. This autumn, farmers are putting soy harvests into storage, rather than sell them to processors and merchants.  DowDuPont’s cash flow projection for the agriculture unit reflects the anticipated impact of events of 2018 and will result in a reduction in long-term forecasts of sales and profitability, the company said, without providing numbers. Analysts on average were expecting the company to report a profit of $1.6 billion, or 65 cents per share, for the three months ended September, according to Refinitiv data. The company’s shares were down 3.6 pct at $56.50 in after-market trading. Bayer Crop Science (BAYGn.DE) has said the trade dispute is making it difficult to predict 2019 earnings for its agriculture unit.

One of the hydroelectric dams is Usina Três Irmãos, 800 MW dam in Sao Paulo state, controlled by Brazil’s infrastructure group TPI- Triunfo Participações e Investimentos SA, the person added, requesting anonymity. Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico reported the talks over Tres Irmaos on Thursday on its website. State Power and Triunfo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. But the source added a negotiation with Triunfo would not be easy, because the company was singled out by Brazilian prosecutors earlier this month for not collaborating with a corruption probe investigating the company’s toll-road operation. The Chinese power company is also expected to present a binding offer by the end of the month for the control of the Santo Antonio hydropower dam, in the northern state of Rondonia. Talks to acquire the dam have been ongoing for almost two years. State Power is also considering a bid for two coal thermal plants that France’s Engie SA owns in the southern Brazilian states of Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul. Engie put the plants for sale six months ago. Engie did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
