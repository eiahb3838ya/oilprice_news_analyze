European shares opened higher, as investors hoped the U.S. and China might find a compromise to resolve their trade dispute. The pan-European STOXX was up 0.7 percent, with most markets across the continent gaining. The gains in Europe helped lift the MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, by 0.3 percent.

Asian stock markets seemed to welcome the news, with MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbing nearly 1 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 1.4 percent. Shanghai blue chips rose over 1 percent and Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower. EMini futures for the S&P500 were up 0.2 percent. Analysts gave a more lukewarm reception. “Trade talks between the US and China are to be resumed this month, and traders are cautiously optimistic, but just because the meeting has been lined up doesn’t mean anything will come of it,” said David Madden, chief markets analyst at CMC Markets in London. “Some traders view the (recent) weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency as a sign that Beijing will be more accommodating when it comes to negotiations.” Turkey’s lira fell nearly 1.8 percent, beyond 6 lira per dollar. Turkish sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Monday and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after Moody’s and S&P Global lowered their sovereign credit ratings on Friday . In addition, shots were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, compounding tensions between Turkey and the United States as a dispute over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor simmered .

Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers meet at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Friday to discuss stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and lethargic productivity gains . “The question is not only whether the Fed acknowledges the EM market volatility, but also the fact that its own policy signals are playing a part in the broader deterioration in global risk appetite,” wrote ING currency strategist Viraj Patel in a note to clients.

2018-08-20,"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Chinese buyers of Iranian oil are starting to shift their cargoes to vessels owned by National Iranian Tanker Co (NITC) for nearly all of their imports to keep supply flowing amid the re-imposition of economic sanctions by the United States.  The shift demonstrates that China, Iran’s biggest oil customer, wants to keep buying Iranian crude despite the sanctions, which were put back after the United States withdrew in May from a 2015 agreement to halt Iran’s nuclear program.  The United States is trying to halt Iranian oil exports to force the country to negotiate a new nuclear agreement and to curb its influence in the Middle East. China has said it is  opposed to any unilateral sanctions and has defended its commercial ties with Iran. The first round of sanctions, which included rules cutting off Iran and any businesses that trade with the country from the U.S. financial system, went into effect on Aug. 7. A ban on Iranian oil purchases will start in November. Insurers, which are mainly U.S. or European based, have already begun winding down their Iranian business to comply with the sanctions.   To safeguard their supplies, state oil trader Zhuhai Zhenrong Corp and Sinopec Group, Asia’s biggest refiner, have activated a clause in its long-term supply agreements with National Iranian Oil Corp (NIOC) that allows them to use NITC-operated tankers, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the matter.  They spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak publicly about commercial deals. The price for the oil under the long-term deals has been changed to a delivered ex-ship basis from the previous free-on-board terms, meaning that Iran will cover all the costs and risks of delivering the crude as well as handling the insurance, the sources said.          “The shift started very recently, and it was almost a simultaneous call from both sides,” said one of the sources, a senior Beijing-based oil executive.  In July, all 17 tankers chartered to carry oil from Iran to China are operated by NITC, according to shipping data on Thomson Reuters Eikon. In June, eight of 19 vessels chartered were Chinese operated. Last month, those tankers loaded about 23.8 million barrels of crude oil and condensate destined for China, or about 767,000 barrels per day (bpd). In June, the loadings were 19.8 million barrels, or 660,000 bpd.  In 2017, China imported an average of 623,000 bpd, according to customs data.  Sinopec declined to comment on the change in tankers. A spokesperson with Nam Kwong Group, the parent of Zhenrong, declined to comment.  NIOC did not respond to an email seeking comment. An NITC spokesman said it would forward a request from Reuters for a comment to the country’s Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance.  For a graphic on Iran's oil production, click tmsnrt.rs/2OQfHI5 Iran used a similar system between 2012 and 2016 to circumvent Western-led sanctions which were effective in curtailing exports because of a lack of insurance for the shipments.  It was not immediately clear how Iran would provide insurance for the Chinese oil purchases, worth some $1.5 billion a month. Insurance usually includes cover for the oil cargoes, third-party liability and pollution. “This is not the first time companies exercised the option... Whenever there is a need the buyers can use that,” said another of the sources, also a senior Beijing-based oil executive.  Term buyers of Iranian submitted their plans to NIOC earlier this month of how much crude they will lift in September, said two trade sources.  It typically takes about a month for Iranian crude to reach China. With the new shipping arrangement, Iranian oil cargoes to China are expected to stay at recent levels through October, said the four sources with knowledge of the tanker changes.

The Oil Ministry’s website SHANA also quoted Zanganeh as saying that Total had announced its plans to leave more than two months ago. Iranian officials had earlier suggested China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the South Pars gas project, lifting its interest to more than 80 percent from 30 percent now.

2018-08-20,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday stripped requirements for reducing greenhouse emissions from his centerpiece energy policy in the face of political opposition, although the country remains a signatory to the Paris Agreement. While stopping short of following the lead of U.S. President Donald Trump and withdrawing from the global climate accord, Australia removed requirements from its National Energy Guarantee plan that would have mandated that greenhouse emissions from its power industry decrease by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. As Australia’s east coast suffers through its worst drought in 60 years, Turnbull said he would seek to legislate emission reductions in the future. He added that his government would move legislation to reduce emissions when it had sufficient support from its own party. Despite the impasse, Turnbull said the government was committed to its Paris accord commitments. “The legislation to move forward with the emissions component of the National Energy Guarantee will not be able to pass the House of Representatives,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra. Turnbull has a parliamentary majority of just one. With several rank-and-file lawmakers vowing they would not support any legislated emission reductions, such mandates are likely to remain elusive until at least a year. The decision drew immediate scorn from critics who dismissed suggestions that a reduction could be achieved without mandated legislation. “The announcement is a setback for global action to reduce carbon emissions,” said Will Steffen, a climate scientist at the Australian National University. “Australia is a global lagger in meeting its emission targets,” he added. “Independent research shows emissions are creeping up over the last three years; I’m very skeptical that without immediate action, Australia can meet it commitments.”  Australia - one of the largest carbon emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal-fired power plants - is among nearly 200 countries committed to the Paris Agreement.  The United States in 2017 became the only signatory to withdraw from the accord. Australia’s National Energy Guarantee was supposed to end a decade of infighting about how Australia could boost power reliability while reducing carbon emissions. But by requiring Australia’s electricity sector to reduce emissions by 26 percent, old wounds were reopened which split the government along ideological grounds. Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who committed Australia to the Paris accord when he led the country, argue reducing emissions puts Australia at an economic disadvantage after the United States withdrew from the Paris accord in 2017.  The message resonates with rural voters, a key electorate for Turnbull, a social liberal who throughout his political career has voiced support for addressing climate change. “It’s a complete capitulation to the right-wing members of the Liberal Party of Australia, who want to perpetuate Australia’s coal economy,” said Robyn Eckersley, Professor and Head of Political Science at University of Melbourne. Turnbull’s move may relieve immediate pressure, though internal peace is seen as fragile as the government’s re-election prospects look dim. The change also drew criticism from Australia’s energy sector. “The stakes are too high for partisan and personal politics to spoil this opportunity to move energy policy into the 21st century,” said Andrew Richards, chief executive officer at the Energy Users Association of Australia. With Turnbull struggling to unite the party, local media reported Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton was considering a leadership challenge. Australia has seen five different leaders since 2009.   Turnbull, however, moved to quell the reports. “Peter Dutton was at our leadership group meeting this morning and he was at the Cabinet last night. He’s a member of our team. He’s given me his absolute support,” Turnbull said. A widely watched poll on Monday shows support for Turnbull  has crashed to its lowest level since December. The Ipsos poll published in Fairfax newspapers shows that although Turnbull is still personally more popular than opposition Labor leader, Bill Shorten, support for his Liberal-National coalition fell four points to 45 percent, 10 points behind Labor and enough for a crushing electoral defeat. Michiel Schaeffer, Science Director at Climate Analytics, a Berlin-based research group, predicted that Australia would eventually toughen climate action. “Against a backdrop of record drought in New South Wales and a very early bushfire season starting, fossil-fuel interests in Australia have again won out over the government moving forward on climate change,” he told Reuters in an email. “Yet despite all this, renewable energy continues to march inexorably forward, especially at state level,” he added. “Ultimately, climate action will be inevitable in Australia.” Reporting by Colin Packham and Erin Cooper in Sydney; Additional reporting by Alister Doyle in Oslo; Editing by Gerry Doyle",https://uk.reuters.com/article/climatechange-accord-australia/update-2-australia-weakens-commitment-to-climate-accord-after-government-fractures-idUKL3N1VB1XV,20 Aug 2018,"* Move comes amid reports PM faces potential leadership

2018-08-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Premier Oil (PMO.L) will press ahead with the development of the Tolmount gas field in Britain’s North Sea, which is expected to produce around 500 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas from late 2020. The approval of Tolmount is the latest in a series of moves by oil and gas companies showing their commitment to the North Sea, traditionally a high-cost environment which is experiencing a revival as costs have fallen. Premier expects to pay $120 million for the development,  which includes a minimal facilities platform and a pipeline commissioned from Saipem (SPMI.MI) leading to British energy group Centrica’s (CNA.L) Easington terminal. Construction for the project, in which Dana Petroleum [KOILCD.UL] holds 50 percent, is to start this year. “The sanction of our... Tolmount project marks a major milestone for Premier and underpins our medium term UK production profile,” Chief Executive Tony Durrant said. “Tolmount is one of the largest undeveloped gas discoveries in the Southern North Sea and is, in barrel of oil equivalent terms, similar in size to our Catcher project.” Centrica Storage Limited, a subsidiary of the British energy company, said it had been awarded a 120 million pound ($153 million) contract to process gas from the field which will extend the lift of its Easington gas terminal in Yorkshire until at least 2030. Centrica said it will modify the terminal so it can receive and process the gas from the Tolmount field starting in the winter of 2020 when it is scheduled to come on stream. The field is expected to produce gas for 10 to 15 years. Premier sees Tolmount’s peak production at 300 million cubic feet per day, or 58,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). This is enough to supply around 2.5 million homes. First output at Premier’s Catcher field marked a milestone for the company last December, boosting a 10 percent output hike for 2018. Shares in Premier, which is due to report first-half results on Aug. 23, rose 2 percent in early trading.

Wall Street rose and broad-based gains in Europe and Asia lifted the MSCI’s all-country world index, which tracks shares in 47 countries. The gauge has recouped last week’s losses sparked by the lira’s plunge, but not declines of the prior week when the Turkish currency began its fall. Mid-level U.S. and Chinese officials are expected to meet later this week in Washington to discuss their trade dispute. But it is unclear whether the talks will have any effect on the implementation of U.S. tariffs and retaliation by China. “Traders are cautiously optimistic, but just because the meeting has been lined up doesn’t mean anything will come of it,” CMC Markets chief markets analyst David Madden said. “Some traders view the (recent) weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency as a sign that Beijing will be more accommodating when it comes to negotiations,” he said. Six days of public hearings on the proposed U.S. duties of up to 25 percent will start Monday in Washington as part of the U.S. administration’s efforts to pressure Beijing for sweeping changes to its trade and economic policies. Tencent Holdings Ltd was the biggest contributor to MSCI’s global stock gauge, which rose 0.52 percent, and it was the top gainer on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, closing up 4.1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.57 percent and MSCI’s emerging markets index gained 1.15 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 96.59 points, or 0.38 percent, to 25,765.91. The S&P 500 gained 7.5 points, or 0.26 percent, to 2,857.63 and the Nasdaq Composite added 8.67 points, or 0.11 percent, to 7,825.00. Turkey’s lira fell 3.2 percent to a session low of 6.2 against the dollar and then pared some losses to trade 1.48 percent lower at 6.0990. While the lira late last week clawed back sizable losses after touching all-time lows of just over 7 to $1 a week ago Monday, it has now declined about 26 percent so far in August. Turkish sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Monday and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after Moody’s and S&P Global lowered their sovereign credit ratings on Friday. In addition, shots were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, compounding U.S.-Turkish tensions as a dispute over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor simmered. In a week light on economic data, investors are turning their attention to central banks. The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its August policy meeting on Wednesday, which will be scrutinized for new signs of whether four interest rate hikes are likely this year. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates a third time this year in September, though doubts remain over another hike in December. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak on Friday at the annual economic symposium in August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “It’s really going to be all about the minutes and Powell at Jackson Hole on Friday,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. U.S. President Donald Trump complained to donors in New York’s Hamptons about Powell’s rate hikes, according to Bloomberg News, leading the dollar index to a session low. The index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.2 percent. The euro rose 0.25 percent to $1.1466 and the Japanese yen strengthened 0.25 percent versus the greenback at 110.23 per dollar. Benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year notes rose 14/32 in price to push yields down to 2.8208 percent, a six-week low. Oil futures rose after weeks of declines as investors grew more concerned about an expected fall in supply from Iran due to U.S. sanctions and worried less of a U.S.-Sino trade war hurting economic growth. Brent crude futures rose 38 cents to settle at $72.21 a barrel while U.S. crude settle 52 cents higher at $66.43 per barrel. U.S. gold futures for December delivery settled up $10.40 at $1,194.60 an ounce as a stronger Chinese currency made the metal cheaper for buyers in China, the world’s biggest gold consumer.

2018-08-20,"SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian beer maker Ambev plans to add 1,600 Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) electric trucks to its fleet, making it the largest fleet of its kind in Brazil, and which would be exempt from new fixed minimum freight fares for diesel truckers. Ambev said ownership of the vehicles, which will replace older trucks, will be with 20 logistics companies that distribute Ambev’s products. It declined to name the companies.    Roberto Cortes, Chief Executive of Volkswagen’s bus and trucks operation in Brazil, told Reuters that negotiations with Ambev had long preceded the new policy, which came into effect this month. The timing was “pure coincidence,” he said, though he acknowledged the rule could lead clients to rethink their fleets. Ambev’s plan, which had not yet been firmed up, follows a truckers strike in May that severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports for nearly two weeks and forced the government to promise changes.  This month the government signed those promises into law, including a minimum fare for freight to be paid to diesel truckers, which is now higher than the current market rate. Electric vehicles are exempt from the price minimums.   “It’s obvious that a strike of that nature calls attention to the need of having products that are alternatives to diesel trucks,” Cortes said. “Still, we are not expecting any sales directly caused by this decision.”      Volvo AB and the Mercedes-Benz truck unit of Daimler AG have received inquiries from companies considering another option to avoid price minimums: buying their own truck fleets instead of relying on third-party contractors. Brazil’s largest logistics company, JSL, expects its truck rental unit to grow as it rents out vehicles directly to companies, another exemption from the new rule, JSL Chief Financial Officer Denys Ferrez said, although the company has not received any firm orders.   With the electric trucks, about 35 percent of Ambev’s fleet will be electric, which the companies said will save about 30,000 tons of carbon emissions per year. It expects the 1,600 trucks will be delivered by 2023. (The story corrects to show Ambev will not buy the trucks directly in headline, first paragraph.)

But it is unclear whether the talks will have any effect on the implementation of U.S. tariffs and retaliation by China. “Traders are cautiously optimistic, but just because the meeting has been lined up doesn’t mean anything will come of it,” CMC Markets chief markets analyst David Madden said. “Some traders view the (recent) weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency as a sign that Beijing will be more accommodating when it comes to negotiations,” he said. Six days of public hearings on the proposed U.S. duties of up to 25 percent will start Monday in Washington as part of the U.S. administration’s efforts to pressure Beijing for sweeping changes to its trade and economic policies. Tencent Holdings Ltd was the biggest contributor to MSCI’s global stock gauge, which rose 0.35 percent, and it was the top gainer on Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index, closing up 4.1 percent. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 0.57 percent and MSCI’s emerging markets index gained 1.18 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 104.81 points, or 0.41 percent, to 25,774.13. The S&P 500 gained 7.78 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,857.91 and the Nasdaq Composite added 4.22 points, or 0.05 percent, to 7,820.55. Turkey’s lira fell to a session low of 6.2 against the dollar and was last down about 2.3 percent. While the lira late last week clawed back sizable losses after touching all-time lows of just over 7 to $1 a week ago Monday, it has now declined about 26 percent so far in August. Turkish sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Monday and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after Moody’s and S&P Global lowered their sovereign credit ratings on Friday. In addition, shots were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, compounding U.S.-Turkish tensions as a dispute over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor simmered. In a week light on economic data, investors are turning their attention to central banks. The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its August policy meeting on Wednesday, which will be scrutinized for new signs of whether four interest rate hikes are likely this year. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to raise rates a third time this year in September, though doubts remain over another hike in December. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell is due to speak on Friday at the annual economic symposium in August in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “It’s really going to be all about the minutes and Powell at Jackson Hole on Friday,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies in New York. U.S. President Donald Trump complained to donors in New York’s Hamptons about Powell’s rate hikes, according to Bloomberg News, leading the dollar index to a session low. The index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, fell 0.16 percent to session lows after the media report, while the euro rose 0.2 percent to $1.146. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.19 percent versus the greenback at 110.32 per dollar.

2018-08-20,"OSLO (Reuters) - Sweden’s nuclear energy regulator SSM has asked plant operators to produce plans in the coming months to shield their reactors from harmful hot weather, its director told Reuters on Monday. A number of Swedish reactors had to shut down or reduce output as the summer heatwave sent temperatures to record highs in July, with the sea water that is used to cool them becoming much warmer than normal, exceeding safety levels. The last time that SSM, the Swedish radiation safety authority, asked operators to produce plans to modify their reactors was after Japan’s Fukushima disaster in 2011. The cost of those changes, which are due by 2020, was in the hundreds of millions of euros. “We really have to take into consideration what happened this summer ... We have asked them orally to come with suggestions. Of course there will be a cost. I do not know how much at this stage,” said SSM chief Mats Persson said. The cost of post-Fukushima modifications to Swedish nuclear plants reached as much as 100 million euros (£89.6 million) per reactor, Persson said. Persson said the regulator had asked Vattenfall [VATN.UL] and Uniper subsidiary OKG to consider how they could shield their Swedish reactors and notify SSM in the autumn to enable it to make a decision on the best options.   “I hope we will have results by the end of this year ... It is important that we don’t come to the same situation again,” he said. Vattenfall, which operates seven reactors in Sweden, shut a 900 megawatt (MW) unit - one of the four located at its Ringhals plant - in July as water temperatures rose above 25 degrees Celsius. [POW/OUT] The company’s second plant at Forsmark consists of three BWRs and Vattenfall had to reduce output by 30-40 megawatt per reactor as the sea water in the area climbed to more than 23 degrees Celsius. Sweden’s biggest reactor - the 1.4 GW Oskarshamn 3 - was not affected and should be less vulnerable to very hot summers because of the depth from which it takes its sea water, a spokesman for operator OKG has said.

2018-08-20,"WARSAW, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Poland, unlike Germany, strongly opposes Russia’s plan to build a new gas pipeline across the Baltic Sea, and shares U.S. opinion that the project would help strengthen Moscow’s market position, Polish foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz said. Berlin has given political support to the building of a new, $11 billion pipeline to bring Russian gas across the Baltic Sea called Nord Stream 2, bypassing traditional routes through Ukraine, despite qualms among other EU states. In July U.S. President Donald Trump publicly criticised Germany for supporting the pipeline deal with Russia. “I would like to underline that Poland’s stance differs here from the German one. We see this dispute as an existing one between the U.S. and Germany,” Czaputowicz said at a joint statement with his German counterpart Heiko Maas. Poland buys most of the gas it consumes from Russia but has taken steps to reduce that reliance. “In this U.S.-Germany dispute we are at the U.S. side, as its arguments are more convincing and besides, we have raised them before,” Czaputowicz also said in a broadcast speech. He reiterated Poland’s concerns that Nord Stream 2 was a harmful and political project that will strengthen Russia’s dominant position in the gas market and be a threat to Ukraine. “I know about these objections but the German government does not share them,” Maas said. The foreign ministers spoke in Harmeze, south of Poland, near the Auschwitz Nazi death camp, which Maas visited earlier on Monday. Reporting by Agnieszka Barteczko and Anna Koper; editing by

2018-08-20,"JUBA, Aug 20 (Reuters) - South Sudanese lawmakers approved a 75 percent increase in public spending in the 2018/2019 budget on Monday, though ministers did not spell out where the cash would come from in an economy ravaged by nearly five years of civil war. Finance Minister Salvatore Garang Mabiordit told parliament that the planned budget of 81.6 billion South Sudanese pounds ($626 million) was “based on our own resources” - not on expected grants or loans from donors. South Sudan’s only significant economic resource is oil, but fighting has forced operators to shut down many fields and output is less than half its pre-war level of 245,000 barrels per day. Fighting broke out between troops loyal to President Salva Kiir and his former deputy turned rival Riek Machar in late 2013, less that three years after South Sudan declared independence from Sudan amid celebrations and promises of support from major world powers. Earlier this month, Kiir granted an amnesty to rebels including Machar after a series of failed peace deals and broken ceasefires - and there have been no reports of major fighting since. But the ethnically charged violence - which has killed tens of thousands of people and forced nearly four million to flee their homes, according to U.N. figures - has left the finances of the world’s youngest country in tatters. Inflation has been in the triple digits at various stages during the conflict, with hyperinflation persisting for several years due in part to its depreciating currency. The minister said 40 percent of approved spending would go on salaries, which he said previously up 50 percent of spending, without specifying when. He did not say how much would be spent on the military and other security costs, typically the largest expenditure category, saying only that “peace is expensive” without giving details. In the previous fiscal year, Mabiordit said, the country’s 400 MPs had each received loans from the government of $40,000 to buy cars. Such loans had not been included in this year’s budget, he said.

2018-08-20,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran urged Europe on Monday to speed up efforts to salvage a 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and major powers that U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned in May, saying French oil group Total has formally pulled out a major gas project. Efforts by the remaining signatories - EU members Britain, France and Germany plus China and Russia - to avoid the agreement’s collapse are struggling as Washington has said any firms dealing with Teheran will be barred from doing business in the United States. “Europeans and other signatories of the deal have been trying to save the deal ... but the process has been slow. It should be accelerated,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi said. “Iran relies mainly on its own capabilities to overcome America’s new sanctions,” he told a news conference broadcast on state TV. European states have been scrambling to ensure Iran gets enough economic benefits to persuade it to stay in the deal, which Trump said was “deeply flawed”.  Washington imposed new sanctions on Iran in August, targeting its trade in gold and other precious metals, purchases of U.S. dollars and its car industry. The European powers, China and Russia say they will do more to encourage their businesses to remain engaged with Iran. But the threat of the U.S. sanctions has prompted many major companies to pull out of Iran. Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zanganeh said France’s Total (TOTF.PA) has formally left a contract to develop Iran’s South Pars Gas project. “The process to replace (Total) with another company is underway,” he was quoted as saying by state TV. Total, which signed the deal in 2017 with an initial investment of $1 billion, confirmed that it had notified the Iranian authorities of its withdrawal from the deal after it failed to obtain a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Iranian officials had earlier suggested that China’s state-owned CNPC could take over Total’s stake in the offshore project. CNPC, which already has a 30 percent stake in the deal, is an experienced onshore oil and gas producer, but is relatively new to offshore drilling. “As for the future of Total’s share, we have not been informed of an official CNPC position, but as we have always said, CNPC, a Chinese state-owned company, has the right to resume our participation if it decides so,” Total said in an emailed statement. Most of CNPC’s experience lies in its subsidiary China Petroleum Offshore Engineering Company (CPOE), which has worked in shallow waters off north China. “Once Total quits, that will trigger CNPC to take over automatically, according to the contract,” a senior Chinese industry source with knowledge of the deal told Reuters. “But the question is not about if CNPC is going to take over as the operator, but if CNPC could deliver and advance the project without Total.” China also faces challenges supplying equipment such as large-scale compressors needed for developing the giant gas project, as leading manufacturers could be barred from supplying to Iran under U.S. sanctions. Carmakers PSA (PEUP.PA), Renault (RENA.PA) and Daimler (DAIGn.DE) are also among those to suspend or drop plans to invest in Iran along with Deutsche Bahn [DBN.UL] and Deutsche Telekom [DTEGn.DE] Working to maintain financial channels with Tehran and facilitate Iran’s oil exports, the European Union has taken steps to counter the renewed U.S. sanctions, including forbidding EU citizens from complying with them or related court rulings. Washington has said Iran’s only chance of avoiding the sanctions would be to accept Trump’s offer to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal. Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected the offer. “We do not want to revisit that nuclear deal. We want the United States to implement that (2015) nuclear deal” Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN on Sunday. The United States will impose tougher sanctions in November which will target Iran’s oil sales and banking sector.   Iran’s rial currency has lost about half of its value since April because of a weak economy, financial difficulties at local banks and heavy demand for dollars among Iranians who fear the effects of sanctions. Under the 2015 deal, most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in return for curbs on the country’s nuclear programme.

2018-08-20,"NYAL, South Sudan (Reuters) - At the muddy airstrip in Nyal, an opposition-held town in war-ravaged South Sudan, thousands of people have come to collect the first food supplies to have been dropped there in three months. Supplies were dropped on Sunday and Monday by the United Nations World Food Programme, which said it expected 30,000 people will have come by the time it has delivered the final drop on Tuesday. The food was shared out before the people went back home through the marshy surroundings of the Sudd swamp carrying supplies on their heads or in boats. The UN has been dropping food supplies in Nyal every three months since 2014. The town is unsafe to reach by road, with attacks on humanitarian agencies common. An annual study on trends of violence against humanitarian groups ranked South Sudan as the world’s most dangerous country for aid workers. Nyal and the dozens of nearby islands in the swamp have become an adopted home for thousands of people since war began in 2013 following a dispute between President Salva Kiir and his former vice president turned rebel leader Riek Machar.  Tens of thousands of people have been killed, a third of the population have fled their homes and the country’s oil-dependent economy has been wrecked.        Earlier this month, Kiir and Machar signed a ceasefire and power-sharing agreement in Khartoum — the latest internationally-brokered attempt to end war in a country that gained independence in 2011 after a bitter struggle.

2018-08-20,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin still hopes to pull Moscow’s ties with Washington out of a deep crisis, but nobody will go into mourning if this ambition is not reciprocated by the United States, the Kremlin said on Monday.  Moscow is bracing itself for a slew of new U.S. sanctions despite Putin meeting U.S. President Donald Trump at a summit in Helsinki in July, an encounter both sides said went well.  Initial Russian triumphalism after the summit turned sour however as anger over what some U.S. lawmakers saw as an over deferential Trump performance galvanized a new sanctions push. The U.S. State Department has said it will impose fresh sanctions by the end of this month, while bi-partisan legislation from senators calls for other curbs to be widened. Moscow is also bracing itself for potential U.S. measures designed to frustrate its Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project.   Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call that the new U.S. sanctions proposals were unfriendly, illegal and would harm world trade. “Let’s wait and see what will happen, if anything,” said Peskov, saying any Russian response would be dictated by Russia’s own national interests. “The Russian president is hoping for the best and, despite all this, wants to pull our bilateral ties out of the deep crisis they are in.

2018-08-20,"(Repeats item issued earlier. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: India's coal imports by source: tmsnrt.rs/2OP1zhX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 20 (Reuters) - India’s coal imports appear headed for another strong month in August, raising the question as to why the usually cost-sensitive market hasn’t scaled back purchases given a surge in prices to the highest in nearly seven years. Total coal imports may reach 17.7 million tonnes in August, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters. This figure may be revised as it becomes clearer when ships will arrive and discharge their cargoes, but the August imports are likely to be more or less in line with the 17.4 million tonnes imported in July, which was the strongest monthly outcome so far in 2018. But no matter what the exact level of imports turns out to be, India’s coal imports have been exceptionally strong and are on track to rise for the first year in three in 2018. This is despite prices for thermal coal rising to the highest in 6-1/2 years, with the Australian benchmark Newcastle cargoes trading above $120 a tonne recently, taking the year-to-date gain to around 18 percent. The gain in prices has been largely driven by strong Chinese imports, partly because of output restrictions at domestic mines and partly because of high demand caused by a recent heatwave. Previously Indian coal imports, especially for thermal grades used to generate electricity, have been thought to be sensitive to price, and likely to decline if prices moved rapidly higher, as they have done this year. But Indian imports have been on an upward trend in recent months, despite the rising prices. An easy answer as to why is to point to the recent difficulties state miner Coal India has experienced in transporting the polluting fuel from pits to power plants. But as Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), pointed out in a recent note, there is more to the situation. Data from India’s Central Electricity Authority show that coal imports for what are termed on-grid power plants, i.e. those that supply power to the network, are actually declining, falling 14 percent in the June quarter. So, as far as thermal coal imports for the power sector are concerned, the price signal is working insofar as they are declining as prices rise. However, as Buckley notes, a large part of India’s coal imports are used by consumers other than on-grid power plants. There is a about 30 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired generation capacity that is used by captive power plants, Buckley said in a recent paper sent to Reuters. These users include aluminium smelters, cement makers and other industrial users, and they are more reliant on coal imports as their demand isn’t prioritised by Coal India, effectively meaning they are last in line for domestic supplies. If this 30 GW was run at 61 percent capacity, it would need about 96 million tonnes of thermal coal a year, Buckley said, a figure that represents about two-thirds of current thermal coal imports. Given these consumers have to run their captive power plants in order to produce their goods, they have no option but to turn to imports when Coal India can’t meet their needs. Thus, it appears that as much as two-thirds of India’s current coal import demand is from buyers that aren’t price sensitive. This likely means that coal imports will remain robust, at least for as long as Coal India is struggling to meet the needs of the various consumers of the fuel. This dynamic of captive power-plant users importing coal also appears to be shifting the buying patterns of India. In the first seven months of the year, India’s coal imports totalled 112.5 million tonnes, with Indonesia the largest supplier at 43.4 million. However, Indonesia’s share of imports is declining, running at 38.6 percent of the total so far in 2018, down from 43.8 percent for the whole of 2017. In contrast, South Africa’s share of Indian imports in the first seven months of 2018 rose to 18.1 percent, from 17.1 percent for 2017, while that of the United States rose to 9.6 percent from 7.1 percent. South Africa and the United States supply higher grades of coal with greater energy content than Indonesia. It makes sense for captive-power plant buyers in India to seek higher quality coal as it maximises the output from their plants. Australia’s share of India’s imports is also up, rising to 23.9 percent in the first seven months of 2018 from 22.6 percent in 2017. However, virtually all of Australia’s exports are coking coal, used in steel-making, and the increase is likely a reflection of rising domestic steel production, as well as the paucity of Indian supplies of this higher-grade type of coal.

Transnet, which operates nearly three-quarters of the African rail network, the bulk of which is in South Africa, has been investigating allegations of corruption in the procurement of 1,064 diesel and electric locomotives. The firm said during its results presentation that the year had been “characterised by a number of serious procurement related governance challenges which has impacted on the company’s reputation and the ability to attract investment.” Transnet said its board and management were developing an action plan to prevent irregular expenditure, which is referred to by Treasury as expenditure other than unauthorised expenditure, incurred in contravention of existing rules. The firm reported full-year revenue ending March 2018 up 11.3 percent to 72.9 billion rand ($5 billion), boosted by an increase in volumes of export coal and container volumes. Coal export volumes it transported by rail for the financial year rose 4.3 percent to 77 million tonnes, the firm said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 18 percent to 32.5 billion rand from 27.6 billion rand in the previous reporting period.

2018-08-20,"(John Kemp is a Reuters market analyst. The views expressed are his own) * Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2OQQrkO By John Kemp LONDON, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Hedge funds have cut their bullish position in crude oil and refined fuels to the lowest level for almost a year, as fund managers continued to close out former long positions. Hedge funds and other money managers cut their net long position in the six most important petroleum futures and options contracts by 69 million barrels in the week to Aug. 14. Net length has been cut in 12 out of the last 17 weeks with a total reduction of almost 460 million barrels since April 17. Portfolio managers now hold a net position of just 952 million barrels, down from a peak of 1.484 billion in January, and the lowest since September 2017. Fund managers are becoming less bullish on the outlook for prices but few have dared to bet on substantial price falls (tmsnrt.rs/2OQQrkO). Gross long positions across the six major contracts have fallen by 464 million barrels since late April, while short positions have also fallen by 10 million barrels over the same period. Last week, as in most previous weeks, the reduction in net length was led by crude, with Brent down by 17 million and WTI by 41 million. By contrast, U.S. gasoline positions were down by 14 million barrels, but U.S. heating oil was unchanged and European gasoil rose by 4 million. And as in previous weeks, the reduction in net length was driven by the liquidation of former long positions (-67 million barrels) rather than the creation of new short ones (+2 million). Hedge fund managers continue to exit from their former bullish positions in Brent and WTI, according to regulatory and exchange data. Portfolio managers have cut their net long position in Brent in 13 of the last 18 weeks, by a total of 296 million barrels. Net length in Brent has fallen to its lowest level for 55 weeks, unwinding most of the increase since prices started to rise in July 2017. Brent long positions are very close to their lowest level 24 months; it is only the comparative absence of short positions that gives the hedge fund community a bullish position overall. The liquidation of so many former long positions has mitigated one source of downside risk hanging over oil prices. But with so few short positions, the hedge fund community’s positioning remains stretched, with almost 10 long positions for every short. If the outlook for the global economy and oil consumption deteriorates, there is still scope for funds to add short positions and push prices lower.

The pan-European STOXX was up 0.6 percent and the broad-based gains in Europe and Asia helped lift the MSCI All-Country World index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, by 0.2 percent. The gauge has nearly recouped the losses from last week caused by the plunge in Turkey’s lira. China and the United States will hold trade talks this month, the two governments said last week. The Wall Street Journal reported that the talks would take place on Aug. 22 and Aug. 23 - just before new U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods take effect, along with retaliatory tariffs from Beijing on an equal amount of U.S. goods.. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan climbed nearly 0.8 percent and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index added 1.4 percent. Shanghai blue chips rose 1.2 percent and Japan’s Nikkei ended 0.3 percent lower. Futures for the S&P500 indicated a higher open on Wall Street. Analysts gave a more lukewarm reception. “Trade talks between the U.S. and China are to be resumed this month, and traders are cautiously optimistic, but just because the meeting has been lined up doesn’t mean anything will come of it,” CMC Markets chief markets analyst David Madden said. “Some traders view the (recent) weakness in the Chinese stock market and currency as a sign that Beijing will be more accommodating when it comes to negotiations,” he said. Turkey’s lira fell as much 1.8 percent, more than 6 lira per dollar. The currency was last down 1.4 percent. Turkish sovereign dollar bonds fell across the curve on Monday and the cost of insuring exposure to Turkish debt rose after Moody’s and S&P Global lowered their sovereign credit ratings on Friday. In addition, shots were fired at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara, compounding tensions between Turkey and the United States as a dispute over Turkey’s detention of an American pastor simmered. In a week light on economic data, investors are turning their attention to central banks. Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should show policy makers are upbeat on the economy and committed to further interest rate increases. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers meet at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Friday to discuss stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and lethargic productivity gains. “The question is not only whether the Fed acknowledges the EM market volatility, but also the fact that its own policy signals are playing a part in the broader deterioration in global risk appetite,” ING currency strategist Viraj Patel wrote in a note to clients. The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies, was up 0.2 percent. The euro was down 0.2 percent, while the dollar gained 0.2 percent to 110.65 yen and just above recent lows at 110.11/31. In commodity markets, gold was 0.3 percent higher at $1,187.51 an ounce after its largest weekly loss since May 2017. It hit a 19-month low at $1,159.96 last week. Brent oil stabilised after several weeks of decline, weighed down by concern over slowing global economic growth but supported by an expected fall in supply from Iran caused by U.S. sanctions. Brent was 0.3 percent higher at $72.06 a barrel. U.S. crude was down 0.1 percent at $65.85.

2018-08-20,"SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday averted a possible leadership challenge by dropping targets for cutting greenhouse gas emissions to appease his critics, say local media, as a poll showed his government losing voter support. Conservatives in his coalition were reportedly sounding out colleagues for a possible leadership challenge before Turnbull on Monday announced the removal of emission reduction targets from the National Energy Guarantee (NEG) policy. Under headlines such as “PM’s leadership on knife edge” major papers said some government members were gauging support for Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton to replace Turnbull. Dutton said he supported the prime minister. Asked whether his leadership was under threat, Turnbull declared: “I enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and my party room”. The leadership talk was fuelled by an Ipsos poll published in Fairfax newspapers, which showed support for Turnbull’s Liberal-National coalition falling four points to 45 percent, 10 points behind opposition party Labor and enough for a crushing electoral defeat. The next election is due by 2019. Turnbull said his slim parliamentary majority and internal dissent, with some government members saying they would vote against the energy policy, left him no option but to remove the emission cuts that were part of the Paris Climate Agreement. “Politics is governed by the iron laws of arithmetic and in a House of Representatives with a one-seat majority... if a small number of people are not prepared to vote with the government on a measure, then it won’t get passed,” Turnbull told reporters. Though Australia remains a signatory to the Paris accord, the removal of emissions targets from the NEG mean the country has no legislative or regulatory path to meeting the agreement’s requirements. Turnbull’s move may relieve immediate pressure on his leadership, though internal peace is seen as fragile as the government’s re-election prospects look dim. And having conceded on energy, he may face demands for other changes. “It’s a complete capitulation to the right-wing members of the Liberal Party of Australia,” said Robyn Eckersley, Professor and Head of Political Science at University of Melbourne. “Turnbull is desperately hanging on to his leadership above and beyond everything else.” In 2009, Turnbull, then leader of the Liberal Party in opposition, crossed the floor to vote with the Labor government in favour of an Emissions Trading Scheme, a move that ultimately lost him the party leadership. A successful challenge to Turnbull’s prime ministership would have been the fifth change in national leadership since 2009, with no prime minister seeing out a full term in office since 2007.

Spreadbetters pointed to a mildly positive start for European shares with FTSE futures up 0.1 percent. Eurostoxx 50 futures opened 0.3 percent higher.

Reports suggested the talks in Washington would take place on Aug. 21 and 22, just before U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods take effect. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Friday it doubled the length of tariff hearings on the next $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to six days from the previously planned three due to overwhelming demand from companies to testify. The hearings will be held Aug. 20-24 and on Aug. 27. Dealers cited speculation the talks could set the stage for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November. “Although such a timeline for agreement is totally unrealistic given how far apart the two sides are, the positive headlines should help sentiment to improve and a positioning unwind of USD is possible,” said analysts at JPMorgan. “This would set Emerging Market Asia equities up for a short-term squeeze, with HK/China yuan sensitives likely leading the way higher.” Helping the general mood was a steadying in the Turkish lira, which was holding around 6.06 per dollar on Monday. Qatar and Turkey’s central banks have signed a currency swap to provide liquidity and support for financial stability, Qatar’s central bank said on Sunday. “Sentiment toward Turkey has stabilised, but medium-term vulnerabilities remain substantial and markets continue to penalise currencies with weak fundamentals,” cautioned Barclays economist Michael Gapen. “But we see contagion risk from Turkey as a relatively low-risk outcome.

2018-08-20,"(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) * GRAPHIC: India's coal imports by source: tmsnrt.rs/2OP1zhX By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 20 (Reuters) - India’s coal imports appear headed for another strong month in August, raising the question as to why the usually cost-sensitive market hasn’t scaled back purchases given a surge in prices to the highest in nearly seven years. Total coal imports may reach 17.7 million tonnes in August, according to vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Thomson Reuters. This figure may be revised as it becomes clearer when ships will arrive and discharge their cargoes, but the August imports are likely to be more or less in line with the 17.4 million tonnes imported in July, which was the strongest monthly outcome so far in 2018. But no matter what the exact level of imports turns out to be, India’s coal imports have been exceptionally strong and are on track to rise for the first year in three in 2018. This is despite prices for thermal coal rising to the highest in 6-1/2 years, with the Australian benchmark Newcastle cargoes trading above $120 a tonne recently, taking the year-to-date gain to around 18 percent. The gain in prices has been largely driven by strong Chinese imports, partly because of output restrictions at domestic mines and partly because of high demand caused by a recent heatwave. Previously Indian coal imports, especially for thermal grades used to generate electricity, have been thought to be sensitive to price, and likely to decline if prices moved rapidly higher, as they have done this year. But Indian imports have been on an upward trend in recent months, despite the rising prices. An easy answer as to why is to point to the recent difficulties state miner Coal India has experienced in transporting the polluting fuel from pits to power plants. But as Tim Buckley, director of energy finance studies at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), pointed out in a recent note, there is more to the situation. Data from India’s Central Electricity Authority show that coal imports for what are termed on-grid power plants, i.e. those that supply power to the network, are actually declining, falling 14 percent in the June quarter. So, as far as thermal coal imports for the power sector are concerned, the price signal is working insofar as they are declining as prices rise. However, as Buckley notes, a large part of India’s coal imports are used by consumers other than on-grid power plants. There is a about 30 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired generation capacity that is used by captive power plants, Buckley said in a recent paper sent to Reuters. These users include aluminium smelters, cement makers and other industrial users, and they are more reliant on coal imports as their demand isn’t prioritised by Coal India, effectively meaning they are last in line for domestic supplies. If this 30 GW was run at 61 percent capacity, it would need about 96 million tonnes of thermal coal a year, Buckley said, a figure that represents about two-thirds of current thermal coal imports. Given these consumers have to run their captive power plants in order to produce their goods, they have no option but to turn to imports when Coal India can’t meet their needs. Thus, it appears that as much as two-thirds of India’s current coal import demand is from buyers that aren’t price sensitive. This likely means that coal imports will remain robust, at least for as long as Coal India is struggling to meet the needs of the various consumers of the fuel. This dynamic of captive power-plant users importing coal also appears to be shifting the buying patterns of India. In the first seven months of the year, India’s coal imports totalled 112.5 million tonnes, with Indonesia the largest supplier at 43.4 million. However, Indonesia’s share of imports is declining, running at 38.6 percent of the total so far in 2018, down from 43.8 percent for the whole of 2017. In contrast, South Africa’s share of Indian imports in the first seven months of 2018 rose to 18.1 percent, from 17.1 percent for 2017, while that of the United States rose to 9.6 percent from 7.1 percent. South Africa and the United States supply higher grades of coal with greater energy content than Indonesia. It makes sense for captive-power plant buyers in India to seek higher quality coal as it maximises the output from their plants. Australia’s share of India’s imports is also up, rising to 23.9 percent in the first seven months of 2018 from 22.6 percent in 2017. However, virtually all of Australia’s exports are coking coal, used in steel-making, and the increase is likely a reflection of rising domestic steel production, as well as the paucity of Indian supplies of this higher-grade type of coal.

2018-08-20,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets of U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp (HES.N), estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion(3.92 billion pounds), have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand’s PTTEP PCL (PTTEP.BK) and Austrian energy group OMV AG (OMVV.VI), people familiar with the matter said. Hess, which has a collection of gas fields in North Malay Basin in offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) with 50 percent equal partner Petronas, has not yet decided whether to sell the assets, according to financial and industry sources.  Their estimated market value would be about $4 billion to $5 billion, the sources said. They declined to be identified because the takeover interest had not previously been made public. The interest in Hess’ assets, among the few long-term and sizeable projects in the region, comes as cashed-up firms such as PTTEP are buying overseas assets, while the likes of OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company have been scouring for acquisitions in Asia.. Hess, which hasn’t reported a profit since 2014, has been under pressure from investors to make money. It posted a smaller-than-expected loss in April-June, but many of its peers have turned profitable after the oil price crash two years ago, fuelling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit. The firm is developing large offshore oil projects in South America and U.S. shale oil. In 2014, it sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for $1 billion and also sold its Indonesian assets. “We don’t comment on rumours but we continue to believe that our Malaysia assets are an important part of our portfolio and our value creation strategy,” Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker said in a statement. “JDA and North Malay Basin are significant long-term, low-cost cash generators, producing stable production and free cash flows, which provide funding for our compelling, long-term opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken (in the United States).” “A number of parties have looked (at the Hess assets) and have teams working on this,” said one financial source. “Increasing numbers of companies believe a sale is probable,” said the person, adding that Hess’ project would also appeal to private-equity backed players and mid-sized energy firms. He said PTTEP was working with a financial advisor for its interest in the assets. Another source said some parties had done preliminary work on the assets and were waiting to see if Hess would start a sale process. OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company declined to comment. This month, OMV won regulatory approval to buy Royal Dutch Shell’s (RDSa.L) upstream assets in New Zealand for $578 million. OMV said in March that the acquisition was a key step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with its new strategy. Petronas declined comment while PTTEP said it was focused on expanding in Southeast Asia. “PTTEP is interested in M&A deals with particular focus on assets located in PTTEP’s region of experience such as South East Asia, which is PTTEP’s areas of expertise and the operating risk is moderately low,” the Thai company told Reuters, declining to comment specifically on Hess assets. For graphic on Brent crude oil & Asian spot LNG prices, tmsnrt.rs/2vMILJj The industry’s prospects have brightened as oil LCOc1 and natural gas LNG-AS prices have more than doubled since early 2016, with demand for oil in Asia - the world’s biggest consumer - also growing strongly even as production is falling faster than anywhere else. Hess’ nine gas fields in the North Malay Basin have an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 20 million barrels of condensate. Production started in July 2017. The company has a 50 percent working interest in the Southeast Asian blocks with Petronas Carigali, a fully-owned subsidiary of Petronas. Hess signed a production-sharing contract with Petronas in 2012 and has a contract with the oil major till 2029. “Hess is pursuing divestments globally, high grading its portfolio centred around its Guyana and U.S. Bakken (shale) interests,” said Saul Kavonic, director of Asia/Pacific markets and head of energy research in Australia at Credit Suisse.

2018-08-20,"(Updates prices) * Eyes on Sino-U.S. trade talks touted for this week * China shares up marginally, Nikkei slips * Dollar off highs, focus on China’s yuan and Turkish lira By Wayne Cole SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Most Asian share markets crept cautiously higher on Monday as investors awaited developments on proposed Sino-U.S. trade talks and the Chinese yuan rallied away from alarming lows. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan gained 0.6 percent, while Shanghai blue chips firmed 0.2 percent. Moves were modest with Japan’s Nikkei off 0.15 percent in thin trade, while EMini futures for the S&P 500 were flat. The yuan reached its highest in a week at 6.8450 per dollar as Beijing acted to prevent a test of the psychologically important 7.0000 level. Investors were also encouraged by news China and the United States will hold lower-level trade talks this month, offering hope that they might resolve an escalating tariff war. Reports suggested the talks in Washington would take place on Aug. 21 and 22, just before U.S. tariffs on $16 billion of Chinese goods take effect. The U.S. Trade Representative’s office said on Friday it doubled the length of tariff hearings on the next $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to six days from the previously planned three due to overwhelming demand from companies to testify. The hearings will be held Aug. 20-24 and on Aug. 27. Dealers cited speculation the talks could set the stage for a summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in November. “Although such a timeline for agreement is totally unrealistic given how far apart the two sides are, the positive headlines should help sentiment to improve and a positioning unwind of USD is possible,” said analysts at JPMorgan. “This would set Emerging Market Asia equities up for a short-term squeeze, with HK/China yuan sensitives likely leading the way higher.” Helping the general mood was a steadying in the Turkish lira, which was holding around 6.0000 per dollar on Monday. Qatar and Turkey’s central banks have signed a currency swap to provide liquidity and support for financial stability, Qatar’s central bank said on Sunday. “Sentiment toward Turkey has stabilised, but medium-term vulnerabilities remain substantial and markets continue to penalise currencies with weak fundamentals,” cautioned Barclays economist Michael Gapen. “But we see contagion risk from Turkey as a relatively low-risk outcome. History indicates emerging market volatility is unlikely to knock the U.S. economy, or the Fed, off course.” Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s August policy meeting are due on Wednesday and should show policy makers are upbeat on the economy and committed to further gradual rate hikes. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and other central bankers meet at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, from Friday to discuss the root causes of stubbornly low inflation, slow wage growth and lethargic productivity gains. The prospect of yet higher U.S. rates had been underpinning the dollar, though the currency took a knock on Friday as risk appetite improved just a little. The dollar index was a fraction firmer at 96.201 on Monday, having fallen almost 0.6 percent at the end of last week. The euro held at $1.1430 after bouncing from a 13-month trough at $1.1297 last week, while the dollar was idling at 110.55 yen and just above recent lows at 110.11/31. In commodity markets, gold was 0.1 percent higher at $1,185.58 an ounce having suffered its largest weekly loss since May 2017. It hit a 19-month low at $1,159.96 last week. The upward trend in the U.S. dollar has also pressured oil, with U.S. crude down for a seventh consecutive week and global benchmark Brent off for a third week. On Monday, Brent was 22 cents lower at $71.61 a barrel , while U.S. crude eased 24 cents to $65.67.

2018-08-20,"* Australian government amends centrepiece energy policy * Australia delays legislation governing emission reductions * Move comes amid reports PM faces potential leadership contest By Colin Packham and Erin Cooper SYDNEY, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Monday stripped requirements for reducing greenhouse emissions from his centrepiece energy policy in the face of political opposition, although the country remains a signatory to the Paris Agreement. The National Energy Guarantee had mandated that greenhouse emissions from its power industry be lowered by 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. With Australia’s east coast in the middle of the worst drought in 60 years, Turnbull said his government would seek to legislate emission reductions in the future. He gave no timetable for revisiting the issue, but said his government is committed to its Paris accord commitments. “The legislation to move forward with the emissions component of the National Energy Guarantee will not be able to pass the House of Representatives,” Turnbull told reporters in Canberra. The decision drew immediate scorn from critics, who argued it was meaningless to be committed to a treaty without working to hit its targets. “It’s a complete capitulation to the right wing members of the Liberal Party of Australia, who want to perpetuate Australia’s coal economy,” said Robyn Eckersley, Professor and Head of Political Science at University of Melbourne. Conservatives, led by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, argue reducing emissions puts Australia at an economic disadvantage after the United States withdrew from the Paris accord in 2017. The message resonates with rural voters, a key electorate for Turnbull. Australia’s centre-right government has fractured in recent days after a handful of ruling lawmakers said they would vote against the National Energy Guarantee, which aimed to lower energy bills for voters, improve reliability, while meeting commitments to lower carbon emissions. Turnbull’s move may relieve immediate pressure, though internal peace is seen as fragile as the government’s re-election prospects look dim. The change also drew criticism from Australia’s energy sector. “One of the things that’s been missing in the whole energy sector is certainty around carbon policy. That’s what has stalled investment. And this just continues that,” Carl Kitchen, a spokesman for the Australian Energy Council, said of the decision to remove emissions targets. With Turnbull, a social liberal who supports fighting climate change, struggling to unite the party, local media reported Home Affairs minister Peter Dutton was considering a leadership challenge. Australia has seen five different leaders since 2009. Turnbull, however, moved to quell the reports. “Peter Dutton was at our leadership group meeting this morning and he was at the Cabinet last night. He’s a member of our team. He’s given me his absolute support,” Turnbull said. A widely watched poll on Monday shows support for Turnbull has crashed to its lowest level since December. The Ipsos poll published in Fairfax newspapers shows that although Turnbull is still personally more popular than opposition Labor leader, Bill Shorten, support for his Liberal-National coalition fell four points to 45 percent, 10 points behind Labor and enough for a crushing electoral defeat.

2018-08-20,"SINGAPORE, Aug 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped on Monday as concerns over slowing economic growth weighed on markets. International Brent crude oil futures were at $71.78 per barrel at 0019 GMT, down 5 cents from their last close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 4 cents, at $65.87 per barrel. “Disappointing industrial data out of China along with concerns over emerging market economies centered on Turkey weighed on commodities,” Edward Bell of Emirates NBD bank said in a note on Sunday. In the United States, U.S. energy companies last week kept the oil rig count RIG-OL-USA-BHI unchanged at 869, according to Baker Hughes energy services firm on Friday. “The recent softening in benchmark prices should temper the pace of growth in U.S. exploration and production activity and lead to slower overall output growth,” Bell said. Outside the United States, traders said U.S. sanctions against Iran could soon impact prices. The U.S. government has introduced financial sanctions against Iran which, from November, will also target the country’s petroleum sector. Iran produced around 3.65 million barrels per day of crude in July, according to a Reuters survey, making it the third biggest producer within the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), behind Saudi Arabia and Iraq.
