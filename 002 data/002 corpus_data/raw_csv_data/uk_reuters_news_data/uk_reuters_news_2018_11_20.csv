2018-11-20,"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - British Columbia’s premier said on Tuesday his government will introduce legislation next year that will require all new light-duty cars and trucks sold in the province by 2040 to be electric or zero-emission vehicles. Premier John Horgan said the government will phase in the sales targets, which apply only to new vehicles. They will start at 10 percent by 2025, rising to 30 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2040.  To support the plan, British Columbia will expand its fast-charging network and spend an addition C$20 million ($15 million) this year on incentives for consumers who buy electric vehicles.  “We need to make clean energy vehicles more affordable, available and convenient,” Horgan said in a statement. He noted the targets were part of a long-term plan to achieve ambitious carbon emission reduction goals. British Columbia offers credits of up to C$5000 for the purchase or lease of new battery electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles, and C$6000 for new hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. It plans to expand the incentive program over time. The province follows Quebec, which passed legislation in 2016 targeting 15.5 percent of sales and leases be zero emission vehicles by 2020. A number of U.S. states, including California, have similar laws designed to increase the supply and sales of plug-in electric vehicles. Electric vehicle sales are booming in Canada, more than doubling in the second quarter of 2018 compared with the same period of 2017, according to clean-tech data firm FleetCarma. But demand is still far lower than for conventional vehicles. Tesla Inc’s (7201.T) Model 3 is the most popular electric car in Canada, followed by Nissan Motor Co’s (7201.T) Leaf and General Motor’s (GM.N) Chevrolet Bolt, according to FleetCarma.  The International Energy Agency said last week that electric vehicles and more efficient fuel technology will cut transportation demand for oil by 2040 more than previously expected.

2018-11-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices tumbled more than 6 percent on Tuesday in heavy trading volume, with U.S. crude diving to its lowest level in more than a year, caught in a broader Wall Street selloff fed by mounting concerns about a slowdown in global economic growth. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures ended the session down $3.77, or 6.6 percent, at $53.43 per barrel. The contract fell as much as 7.7 percent during the session to touch $52.77 a barrel, the lowest since October 2017.  More than 946,000 front-month WTI contracts changed hands, exceeding the daily average over the last 10 months and the second-highest daily volume since June, according to Refinitiv data.  Brent crude futures fell $4.26, or 6.4 percent, to settle at $62.53 a barrel. The international benchmark fell as much as 7.6 percent to $61.71 during the session, the lowest since December 2017.   Oil’s slide has been largely unimpeded since early October when WTI prices were near four-year peaks. Since then, WTI has fallen more than 30 percent. “For the time being it’s more about risk,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. “When the stock market comes off 8 or 9 percent, it tends to conjure up images of a weak global economy and that feeds into expectations of weaker-than-expected oil demand.”  The S&P 500 index on Tuesday hit a three-week low as weak results and forecasts from big retailers fanned worries about holiday season sales, while tech stocks slid further on concerns about iPhone sales. Global stock markets have slumped in the past two months on worries about corporate earnings, rising borrowing costs, slowing global economic momentum and trade tensions. Traders see further downside risk to oil prices from growing U.S. shale production and a deteriorating economic outlook. Macro-focused funds and commodity trading advisory (CTA) firms have pulled back positions in recent weeks as the selloff has accelerated, market participants said.  According to Credit Suisse, prior to oil’s selloff in early October, macro/discretionary funds and CTAs held a net long position that ranked in the top decile over the past five years. As of Monday, those funds were balanced between long and short positions as traders sold long positions and funds shifted to the sidelines. “This is a risk aversion trade,” said Mark Connors, global head of portfolio and risk advisory at Credit Suisse.  U.S.-SAUDI RELATIONS Prices ticked lower after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States intends to remain a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia even though “it could very well be” that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had knowledge of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last month in Turkey. This eased concerns about potential oil supply disruptions amid heightened U.S.-Saudi tensions. “I never really understood the premium behind some kind of friction between U.S. and Saudi Arabia from a policy standpoint ... It really is a too-big-to-fail relationship,” said Joe McMonigle, senior energy policy analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management in Washington. Expectations for a ninth straight week of U.S. crude inventory increases also weighed on prices. Analysts polled ahead of weekly data forecast crude stocks rose about 2.9 million barrels last week. Oil prices pared losses briefly after data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed crude inventories fell by 1.5 million barrels last week to 439.2 million.  Official government data is due Wednesday morning.  U.S. crude production has soared almost 25 percent this year, to a record 11.7 million barrels per day (bpd).  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pushing for a supply cut of 1 million bpd to 1.4 million bpd when it meets on Dec. 6.  The OPEC envoy for the United Arab Emirates said it was very likely that the group would reduce output but the exact level had yet to be decided. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned OPEC and other producers of the “negative implications” of supply cuts, with many analysts fearing a spike in crude prices could erode consumption. “We are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty in oil markets,” IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Tuesday.

2018-11-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - World equity markets and oil prices tumbled on Tuesday as investors grew more worried about economic growth prospects, while the U.S. dollar rose on flight to safe-haven currencies. U.S. stocks slid further. Shares of consumer discretionary companies plunged after several retailers, including Target Corp (TGT.N) and Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N), gave underwhelming quarterly results and earnings forecasts. Shares of Apple Inc (AAPL.O), dragged by softening demand for the iPhone, fell further after Goldman Sachs trimmed its price target for the stock for the second time in just over a week. “It’s the market adjusting to an early 2019 that looks different from the months of 2018 in that there have been mounting concerns over global growth,” said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. Oil prices dropped more than 6 percent to mirror the stock sell-off as fears about slowing global demand and a surge in U.S. production outweighed expected supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Oil extended losses after U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States intends to remain a “steadfast partner” of Saudi Arabia even though “it could very well be” that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman knew about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Heightened tensions between the two countries had raised concerns about possible supply disruptions. U.S. crude futures CLc1 slumped $3.77, or 6.59 percent, to settle at $53.43 a barrel. Brent crude futures LCOc1 settled $4.26 lower at $62.53 a barrel, down 6.38 percent. U.S. crude has now fallen more than 30 percent from a near four-year peak in early October. “When the stock market comes off 8 or 9 percent, it tends to conjure up images of a weak global economy and that feeds into expectations of weaker-than-expected oil demand,” said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates. The dollar index .DXY, tracking the greenback against a basket of six major currencies, rose 0.7 percent. Other safe-haven currencies such as the yen and Swiss franc also gained. Keeping with the flight to safe-haven assets, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield also touched a seven-week low, though it later rose above that level. The euro EUR=, by contrast, was down 0.72 percent to $1.1368, mirroring a sell-off in European stocks. The pan-European STOXX 600  ended 1.1 percent lower as shares of technology companies lagged.

2018-11-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency granted oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) a 2017 hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws for its Utah refinery earlier this year, according to a source familiar with the company’s operations. Chevron, which reported a net income of $9.2 billion in 2017, becomes the largest known company to be awarded a hardship waiver from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), which requires refiners to blend biofuels like ethanol into their fuel pool or buy compliance credits from competitors that do.  The waivers, which have grown significantly under the Trump administration, have angered corn-belt farmers who say it hurts demand for ethanol and other biofuels. “When an oil company whose net profits surpass the total value of the Iowa corn crop claims it is experiencing ‘hardship,’ you know we’ve reached a new level of absurdity,” said Geoff Cooper, CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association.  California-based Chevron declined to confirm whether it received a small refinery hardship waiver, but did say that seeking them can level the playing field. “EPA has acknowledged that it has granted several small refinery exemptions from the RFS. Any Chevron refinery not exempted from the RFS would be at a disadvantage in the highly competitive markets where we operate,” the company said in an emailed statement. The EPA did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  Refineries with a capacity less than 75,000 barrels-per-day can receive waivers from the RFS if they prove compliance would cause them disproportionate hardship. Chevron’s Salt Lake City, Utah, plant is 54,000 barrels-per-day. The EPA, under President Donald Trump, expanded the waiver program, awarding 29 exemptions for the 2017 calendar year, up from 19 in 2016 and just seven in 2015, EPA data shows. The EPA has attributed the program’s expansion to a lawsuit brought by two oil refiners who challenged the EPA’s denial of their waiver request. A federal judge ruled the EPA was using too narrow of a test to evaluate applications. Biofuel backers say the expansion was politically driven by former EPA administrator Scott Pruitt, who sought ways to lower compliance costs for refiners. The Chevron approval was granted under Pruitt, the source said. The surge in hardship waivers has pummeled the price for compliance credits some refiners must buy.  Reuters previously reported that Chevron, along with Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), sought a hardship waiver from U.S. biofuel laws. Exxon Mobil’s application status was unclear.

2018-11-20,"HOUSTON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Crude flowing from North Dakota’s Bakken shale is taking a larger share of the U.S. Gulf Coast market, siphoning demand from refiners and exporters for local grades, traders and brokers said. Bakken crude at Beaumont and Nederland, Texas, traded around a $2 per barrel discount to Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) on Tuesday, a spread that has made Bakken crude more attractive. Rising production in the nation’s third-largest shale play has filled pipelines and Midwest refiners’ demand for the light, sweet crude, pushing more toward the Gulf Coast on TransCanada Corp’s 470-mile Marketlink pipeline to Nederland, Texas. Bakken crude pricing “is pretty distressed,” one trader said. For buyers who can grab it at the Gulf Coast, the crude “is going to look a lot more attractive than the local grades.” Next month, LLS, which is now trading at a more than $8 per barrel premium to U.S. crude futures, will have greater pressure with the opening of Energy Transfer LP’s 300,000 barrel per day (bpd) Bayou Bridge Pipeline to the St. James, Louisiana, hub. Bakken crude has traded around a $15 per barrel discount to U.S. crude futures this week in North Dakota as production topped the region’s pipeline takeaway capacity, hitting a record 1.3 million bpd last month. The steep discount has kept Bakken crude at Beaumont and Nederland trading cheaper. LLS’s premium to U.S. crude was $8.20 per barrel compared to $5.70 to $6.25 per barrel for Bakken. The spread between coastal Bakken and LLS is expected to narrow to $1 or below in coming month, market participants said. “LLS is a blend barrel, and refineries are less inclined to take blends, especially if there is access to a field grade crude,” one broker said, explaining why the spread will narrow. Rising Bakken production making its way to the Gulf Coast helped launch a price assessment for the crude at Beaumont and Nederland. Pricing agency Argus estimated Bakken crude makes up about 185,000 bpd of the nation’s 2.2 million bpd of exports. The influx of Bakken crude may not be enough to weigh on prices for West Texas Intermediate at East Houston, because the grade commands a larger, more diversified market than LLS, traders said.

2018-11-20,"Nov 20 (Reuters) - Alberta said on Tuesday that it will double its incentives for companies developing new plants to make petrochemical products,  as the Western Canadian province seeks to diversify its economy beyond crude extraction and export. The province will now provide royalty credits worth C$2.1 billion ($1.6 billion), up from earlier commitments totaling C$1.1 billion, to projects that convert natural gas and oil into value added products like gasoline, fertilizer and plastics. Alberta said it was expanding the program after receiving 23 applications from Canadian and international companies for the incentive program, representing C$60.2 billion in potential investment in the province. “It sends a clear signal that companies from around the world want to invest in Alberta,” said Margaret McCuaig-Boyd, Minister of Energy, in a statement. “We need to put our foot on the gas pedal.” The province has been struggling with sagging oil and gas prices, as rising crude output has outstripped existing pipeline takeaway capacity, while gas production that used to be sold into the Northeastern United States has been displaced by expanding U.S. supplies. In Alberta, most petrochemical upgrading uses natural gas byproducts like ethane, propane and butane. The province first launched the petrochemical incentives in 2016. Two projects, including Inter Pipeline Ltd’s C$3.5 billion petrochemical plant near Edmonton, were approved to share the original C$500 million in royalty credits. It announced the second round earlier this year. Alberta also said it would double its support for petrochemical feedstock plants, which provide the raw materials for petrochemical upgrading. $1 = 1.3245 Canadian dollars

2018-11-20,"LONDON (Reuters) - Global oil markets are adjusting to relatively strong demand for diesel and jet fuel compared to gasoline, coupled with the introduction of new bunker fuel regulations at the start of 2020. Rising diesel and jet fuel prices, at least relative to crude and gasoline, are forcing adjustments that should lessen the chance of a severe shortage at the end of next year. Futures prices for ultra-low-sulphur diesel delivered at New York Harbor have moved to a premium of more than $21 per barrel over futures prices for gasoline delivered at the same location. The diesel premium has doubled since the end of September. It is trading at the highest level since 2011 and before that 2008, both of which were years when diesel consumption was growing much faster than gasoline. Refiners have a strong incentive to maximise the production of diesel and jet fuel while minimising output of gasoline, and many are adjusting production plans in response. In the United States, for example, refiners cut gasoline yields by 1 percentage point while boosting yields of jet fuel by 0.7 point and distillate fuel oil by 0.5 point in August compared with a year earlier. U.S. refiners produced a near-record 40 barrels of middle distillates (mostly diesel and jet fuel) from every 100 barrels of crude in August, the most recent month for which data is available. U.S. refiners have rarely squeezed more middle distillate from each barrel of crude they process, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). (Chartbook: tmsnrt.rs/2PHrexW) At the same time, refiners produced fewer than 45 barrels of gasoline per 100 barrels of crude, close to multi-year lows (“Petroleum Supply Monthly”, EIA, October 2018). As a result, the ratio of distillate to gasoline production is at the highest level since the summer of 2008, when oil prices were spiking before the global financial crisis. Global diesel consumption has generally been rising faster than gasoline for the last quarter of a century. Diesel consumption increased by 10.5 million barrels per day (bpd) between 1992 and 2017 while gasoline was up by just 8.4 million bpd (“Statistical Review of World Energy”, BP, 2018). Refiners have responded by squeezing more diesel and jet fuel from every barrel, mostly at the expense of lower-value products such as heavy fuel oil, bitumen and asphalt. U.S. refiners made almost 39 barrels of diesel and jet fuel from every 100 barrels of crude in 2017, up from 31 barrels in 1993, according to the EIA. Over the same period, production of residual fuel oil and asphalt declined from nine barrels to fewer than five barrels per 100 (“Petroleum Supply Annual”, EIA, August 2018). The International Maritime Organization’s new regulations on bunker fuels are likely to accelerate the transition to distillate fuel oil and away from heavy fuel oil. From the start of 2020, the regulations will require ship owners to start using lower-sulphur distillate fuel oil unless they start buying lower-sulphur heavy fuel oil or install exhaust gas cleaning systems (“scrubbers”). Some analysts have expressed concern that the regulations will create an acute shortage of middle distillates resulting in a surge in diesel and jet fuel prices and pulling up crude oil prices with them. But with prices already starting to adjust, there is probably enough flexibility in the system to enable it to meet the rise in middle distillate demand over the next 12-15 months. Experience shows U.S. refiners have flexibility to adjust the gasoline/distillate mix by two to four barrels per 100 barrels of crude, and in some cases more, in the short term by making straightforward operational changes. For example, fluid catalytic cracking units can be operated at reduced severity to cut the production of light hydrocarbons in the gasoline range and increase the number of heavier hydrocarbons in the diesel and jet range. FCC units play a critical role in giving refiners the flexibility to adjust their output mix in response to short-term changes in gasoline/diesel demand over a matter of months. Over longer time horizons, refiners have multiple routes to increase the output of diesel by investing in new processing units (“Refinery configurations for maximum conversion to middle distillates”, Chevron, 2011). Most refiners have been planning to increase their yield of middle distillates for nearly a decade in response to projections of increased diesel demand. The new mega-refineries in the Middle East and Asia have all been planned to maximise the production of middle distillates for the transport market in anticipation of new IMO rules and projected increases in freight demand. On the consumption side, price changes will help smooth the adjustment to IMO rules, with higher diesel prices forcing more fuel efficiency in the freight transportation sector. And the sharp rise in diesel prices relative to gasoline is likely to accelerate the shift away from diesel among European motorists, making more fuel available to the shipping sector. By encouraging maximum refinery production and restraining consumption over the next six to nine months, the rise in diesel prices should help build stocks and reduce the risk of a price spike in late 2019 and 2020.

2018-11-20,"MILAN (Reuters) - Europe’s biggest utility, Italy’s Enel (ENEI.MI), pledged on Tuesday to invest more in its green energy and network businesses to boost earnings and meet growing demand for electricity and new digital services. In its new three-year plan, the world’s largest private renewables player raised its spending intentions for the next three years by 12 percent to 27.5 billion euros (24.47 billion pounds) with some 80 percent earmarked for green operations and grids. The utility, which controls Spanish energy group Endesa (ELE.MC), said it expected 62 percent of its power production to be emission-free by 2021 compared with 48 percent this year. By 2050 it will have no carbon footprint.  “Renewables is increasingly a customers’ choice,” Enel CEO Francesco Starace told analysts. To sell electricity, Enel is increasingly turning to purchase agreements with companies such as Google (GOOGL.O) and Facebook (FB.O) that demand power from renewable sources. As governments introduce more stringent rules to meet climate targets, Europe’s power sector is undergoing significant change driven by a boom in renewable energy as costs fall and   technology advances. Italy’s populist 5-Star Movement, which took office with coalition partner the League in June, has placed green energy and digital technology at the heart of its industrial policy. Enel said it aimed to add 11,600 megawatts (MW) of new renewable capacity in the next three years, mostly in the Americas, while withdrawing around 7,000 MW of thermal capacity. “Enel will reinforce its focus on markets where it has an integrated presence, such as Italy, Spain, Chile and Brazil,” it said. The utility said its core earnings would grow by around 6 percent per year and reach 17.4 billion euros next year, better than the 17.2 billion euros in its previous plan. It confirmed it would pay 70 percent of its ordinary net profit as dividends, but said it was introducing a minimum dividend per share target over the plan for the first time. “Enel’s targets were significantly better than expected with a focus on growth in renewables and networks, efficiencies ... and shareholder returns,” Milan broker Equita said. At 1353 GMT Enel shares were up 1.9 percent, while Italy’s blue-chip index was down 1.3 percent. Starace said Enel was ready to make acquisitions. “There is balance-sheet headroom and mid-sized acquisitions remain an option,” he said. In June, Enel agreed to spend almost $1.5 billion to buy a majority stake in Brazil’s Eletropaulo. The utility recently looked at acquiring Colombia’s distressed power distribution company Electricaribe but remains cautious. “We would never embark on a standalone basis but would require a Colombian partner,” Starace said when asked about Enel’s interest.

The dollar sagged on concern about the U.S. economy after home builder sentiment weakened and oil prices fell half a percent despite OPEC production cuts. News around Apple Inc triggered the latest bout of stock market selling, after the Wall Street Journal reported Apple was cutting production for its new iPhones. The European tech sector sank 2.2 percent, hitting its lowest level since February 2017, following Asian tech stocks lower. Shares of companies supplying chips to Apple suffered. The selloff was compounded by an auto sector drop led by Nissan and Renault after Ghosn, chairman of both carmakers, was arrested in Japan for alleged financial misconduct. The broad European STOXX 600 index was down 0.5 percent to a four-week low, and futures trading suggested another tough session was likely in the United States, with Nasdaq Futures down over 1 percent. “Most of Europe had a red session yesterday and that has been compounded by the news on Apple and tech stocks overnight, The overall climate is risk-off,” said Investec economist Philip Shaw. “Beyond stocks, the Italian bonds spread (over German bonds) is at its widest in about a month now, and Brexit continues to rumble on - uncertainty is very much hurting risk sentiment,” he said. Italian government bond yields jumped to a one-month high on Tuesday and Italian banking stocks dropped to a two-year low, hurt by risk aversion and concerns over the Italian budget. Euro zone money markets no longer fully price in a 10-basis- point rate rise by the European Central Bank in 2019, indicating growing concern about the economic outlook in the region. Earlier, MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 1.2 percent, with Samsung Electronics falling 2 percent. In Japan, Sony Corp shed 3.1 percent. Japan’s Nikkei slipped 1.1 percent, with shares of Nissan Motor Co tumbling more than 5 percent after Ghosn’s arrest and reports he would be fired from the board this week. Global stock markets have suffered a shakeout in the past two months, pressured by worries of a peak in corporate earnings growth, rising borrowing costs, slowing global economic momentum and international trade tensions. Trillions of dollars were wiped off equities in a particularly torrid October. In currencies, the dollar hovered near a two-week low against a basket of currencies. Data released on Monday showed U.S. home builder sentiment recorded its steepest one-month drop in more than four years in November. The dollar had also been undercut by Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan, who raised concerns late last week about a possible global slowdown. Oil prices lost ground as fears about slower global demand and a surge in U.S. production outweighed expected supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). Brent crude slipped 0.6 percent to $66.39 per barrel.

2018-11-20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will propose new targets for the final three years of the nation’s renewable fuel program in January, replacing ambitious decade-old goals set by Congress with volumes closer to the industry’s current output, two people familiar with the matter said.   The planned reset of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard is likely to set up a fresh battle between two industries, with corn growers wanting the highest possible targets to spur investment, and oil companies eyeing the smallest to reduce costs. The standard, which expires in 2022, was established in 2007 to boost the Corn Belt economy and help wean the country off of fossil fuels. Refiners are required to blend increasing amounts of biofuels like corn-based ethanol into U.S. gasoline and diesel each year, or purchase blending credits from companies that do. Oil companies say the policy costs them a fortune. Yet it has fallen short of original targets because production has proven more costly and inefficient than expected, even with subsidies. The two sources, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the matter, said on Monday the EPA was planning to slash the 2022 target to bring it closer to current market realities, but added that the agency had not settled on a number. An EPA official confirmed the agency is working with stakeholders on a reset proposal, and aimed to finalize its plan by November 2019. Congress had hoped biofuel production volumes under the standard would hit 36 billion gallons by 2022. But the industry in 2018 produced only around 20 billion, with advanced biofuels - made from things like corn fiber and algae - posting the biggest shortfalls. As a result, the EPA has been forced to ignore the statutory targets in its annual rule-making process, setting out instead what it views as more realistic and attainable yearly mandates.  For the first time, the EPA wants to officially rewrite the congressional targets for 2020 through 2022. The Trump administration has tried to reduce compliance costs for refiners, drawing the ire of biofuel producers and their legislative backers. Oil and agriculture groups said the outcome is crucial.  “We are going to ask and we expect to see lower volumes across the board,” Derrick Morgan, a lobbyist for the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said in a phone interview. He said the ethanol targets, currently at 15 billion gallons a year, should be more fluid and based on expected gasoline demand. The 2019 ethanol target should be closer to 14 billion gallons, he said, which is 9.7 percent of the U.S. government’s gasoline demand projection. Biofuel backers say the program should retain loftier targets in its final years to encourage companies to keep investing in new plants and technology. “Our goal is simple: to keep moving the RFS forward, not backward,” said Emily Skor, chief executive of Growth Energy, a biofuel trade group.

2018-11-20,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland expects its first nuclear power plant to start operating after 2030 as the country aims to cut its use of coal in producing electricity, Deputy Environment Minister Michal Kurtyka said. The east European country, which hosts global climate talks in December, generates around 80 percent of its electricity from coal in outdated power plants, many of which will have to close in the coming decade.  Poland has considered building a nuclear power plant for years, but has yet to take a binding decision on the project. “The discussion over launching the nuclear power plant has accelerated. It is mostly about the international partnership. We are able to finance the construction on our own, but we have to draw the technology from somewhere,” Kurtyka told Reuters.  He added Poland would talk with France, the United States, Japan and South Korea about nuclear technologies. “The energy minister is also in such talks with the U.S. side. The recent signals show that they are very advanced (...)  I assume that (the) nuclear power station will start generating power after 2030,” said Kurtyka, also a former deputy energy minister.  During a visit to Poland earlier in November, U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Polish Energy Minister Krzysztof Tchorzewski signed a joint declaration of enhanced cooperation over energy security, including the nuclear power plant. The Energy Ministry is expected to publish Poland’s long-term energy policy by the end of the year, likely at the U.N. climate conference in Katowice, the heart of the coal industry in the south of the country.  Government officials have said Poland will gradually reduce its reliance on coal, so it accounts for half of electricity generation by 2040. “In future the significance of coal in Poland’s energy supplies will be diminishing. We assume that in 2030 the share of coal in Poland’s energy mix will be 60 percent,” said Kurtyka. He added that 25 gigawatts or 44 percent of Poland’s installed power capacity in 2030 will be based on coal while the remaining energy sources will be wind, some photovoltaic and gas.

2018-11-20,"(Repeats earlier story for wider readership with no change to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) By Clyde Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia, Nov 20 (Reuters) - U.S. coal exporters have effectively lost a promising market in China since the imposition of tariffs as part of the ongoing trade dispute, but so far they have managed to find other buyers in Asia, chiefly India. China imposed a 25 percent tariff on imports of U.S. coal in August as part of its retaliation against tariffs on its exports implemented by the administration of President Donald Trump. Vessel-tracking and port data compiled by Refinitiv show that no coal from the United States was discharged in China in October, while two cargoes totalling 212,000 tonnes are being unloaded this month. However, both the cargoes being unloaded in November left the United States before the tariffs took effect on Aug. 23. While China isn’t the most important Asian buyer for U.S. coal, it had been growing in importance until this year. In the first 10 months of 2018, China imported 3.2 million tonnes of U.S. coal, which was down from 5.1 million for the same period last year. Much of the coal China buys from the United States is higher value coking coal, used in steel making, and it usually is at least double the price of thermal coal, used for power generation. The loss of the China market hasn’t been a devastating blow to U.S. coal exporters, as they have so far been able to find other buyers in Asia. India imported 13.5 million tonnes of coal from the United States in the first 10 months of the year, according to Refinitiv data, up 36 percent from the 9.9 million tonnes in the same period in 2017. Japan, Asia’s third-biggest coal importer behind China and India, bought 7.1 million tonnes from the United States in the January to October period, up from 6.2 million tonnes in the same period last year. Overall, Asia’s imports from the United States were 28.2 million tonnes in the first 10 months of the year, up 2.9 percent from the 25.3 million in the same period last year. That doesn’t sound like a poor outcome for U.S. coal exporters, but the data doesn’t reflect whether it has been relatively easy for U.S. coal miners to sell their product in Asia, or whether they have been offering discounts in order to stay competitive with the region’s powerhouse exporters, Australia and Indonesia. Since China stopped providing detailed customs data earlier this year, it’s been difficult to work out how much the country is paying for various coal imports by country of origin. However, data on the website of the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that the average price of coking coal exports to China in the second quarter of this year was $129.96 a short tonne, equivalent to about $142.96 a metric tonne. For India, the price for U.S. coking coal exports was about $147.72 a metric tonne in the April to June period. For the same quarter, the price of coking coal futures on the Singapore Exchange, which are based on the Steel Index price for Australian cargoes, was between $182 and $200 a tonne. While the pricing doesn’t take into account any quality differentials or freight costs, it does nonetheless imply that U.S. coal exporters had to discount in order to sell into the Chinese market. There may also be some disturbing signs for U.S. coal exporters to India, with imports slowing in recent months. From a peak of 2.3 million tonnes in May, India’s imports of U.S. coal have trended lower, with October recording 1.05 million tonnes, according to the Refinitiv data. November may be slightly better, with the vessel-tracking data showing India’s imports of U.S. coal at around 1.19 million tonnes, but this is still well below the May peak. Overall, while it seems that U.S. coal exporters have been able to find markets in Asia to replace lost volumes to China, it may be at the cost of having to accept lower prices, and to become more reliant on sales to India, a country that has a government policy of reducing coal imports to zero.

2018-11-20,"OSLO (Reuters) - Oil markets are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty due to geopolitical instability and a fragile global economy, the head of the International Energy Agency said on Tuesday. Concerned about an emerging production overhang similar to the one that led to a price slump in 2014, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is pushing for a supply cut of 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd).  The United States restored sanctions targeting Iran’s oil sector in early November, cutting the country’s crude exports by close to 1 million bpd from a summer peak. Although Washington has pledged eventually to halt all of Iran’s global sales of crude oil, for now it has said eight buyers - China, India, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Greece, Taiwan and Turkey - can continue imports without penalty. “The U.S. decision on the Iranian sanction waivers took some of the players in the market by surprise,” the IEA’s Fatih Birol said in an interview on the sidelines of a conference organised by Norwegian energy company Equinor (EQNR.OL).   “As a result, what we see today is that markets are well supplied and the (oil) price went down by $20,” Birol said.  “But the global economy is still going through a very difficult time and is very fragile and ... we have very thin production capacity left in the world, in a world which is becoming more dangerous.”  Brent crude LCOc1 surged above $86 a barrel in October, mainly on worries about supply tightness due to the Iran sanctions. But since the waiver announcement, prices have fallen on concerns about oversupply, as well as a slowdown in global trade. Brent fetched around $66 a barrel on Tuesday. [O/R]    “We are entering an unprecedented period of uncertainty in oil markets,” Birol told the conference.  Birol reiterated his call on key producers to exercise “common sense” at OPEC’s policy meeting in December. Asked whether the oil price could overheat next year, Birol said it would depend on three factors.  “Despite the weak shape of the global economy, oil demand is still strong, spare production capacity is very thin and we do not know what the decision of the key producers in OPEC in December will be,” he said.

2018-11-20,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Glacier melt at major sites in western China is accelerating fast, Greenpeace said on Tuesday, prompting thousands to evacuate in recent months and underscoring the vulnerability to climate change in a “wake-up call” for the world. Satellite analysis showed that the rate of retreat at glaciers in China’s remote western regions had more than doubled, Greenpeace said, with the annual rate at the Tianshan Glacier No. 1 in Xinjiang rising from an average of 5,000 square meters between 1962 and 1986 to 10,600 square meters between 1986 and this year.    “This is a wake-up call for China and the world,” said Greenpeace’s climate and energy campaigner Liu Junyan. “Glaciers in China supply water to 1.8 billion people, and they’re melting, fast. In just the last few months, thousands of people have been evacuated from their homes due to threats of flooding.” Greenpeace has identified two major disasters caused by glacier melt this year, including the release of 25 million cubic meters of floodwater into the Yarkant river basin that forced the evacuation of residents in August. Researchers with the China Academy of Sciences said in September that glaciers in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau had shrunk 15 percent as a result of rising temperatures over the last 50 years. Temperatures in the region are rising faster than the global average, they said. China has pledged to bring carbon emissions to a peak by “around 2030” as part of its commitment to the 2015 Paris agreement, which aims to keep average global temperature increases to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above the historical norm.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned in a report in October that high-altitude zones like the Tibetan plateau would be especially vulnerable if global temperature rises were not restricted to 1.5 degrees Celsius.     Another CAS study published in October said China was at risk of longer and more intense drought as well as more destructive flooding if global temperature rises were not limited to 1.5 degrees.

2018-11-20,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering adding Venezuela to its list of state sponsors of terrorism but no final decision has been made, a person familiar with the deliberations said on Monday. Adding Venezuela to the list could limit U.S. economic assistance and impose financial restrictions on a country already suffering from hyperinflation, mass migration and shortages of food and medicine. Discussions on the issue have moved forward in recent days with strong lobbying from Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who has long pressed the administration to take a tougher stand against the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the source said. A time frame for a decision on whether to add Venezuela to the terrorism list had not yet been determined, the source said. A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it would be a challenge for the Trump administration to provide concrete proof linking the Maduro government to terrorism if it decides to put Venezuela on the list. The four countries currently on the list - North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria - have been found to “have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism.” Rubio and two other Republican senators sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in September urging him to name Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism and accusing it of links to Lebanon’s Hezbollah militant group and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, but they offered no proof. The Trump administration has levied several rounds of sanctions against Maduro’s Socialist-led government since 2017, accusing it of undermining democracy. On Nov. 1, President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed a disrupting Venezuela’s gold exports.  Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Maduro, who denies limiting political freedoms, has said he is the victim of an “economic war” led by the United States. The Washington Post, which first reported that the Trump administration was considering the designation, said the U.S. State Department had been asking for feedback on the proposed move from various agencies in recent days. A State Department spokesperson said it “consistently and on an ongoing basis reviews available information and intelligence, from many sources, on possible state-level involvement in terrorism, evaluating all credible, verified, and corroborated information in its entirety.” The White House declined to comment. A senior U.S. official told Reuters earlier this month that the Trump administration was “looking at all potential avenues” to pressure Maduro’s government. “We believe his presidency to be illegitimate,” the official said, reiterating Washington’s rejection of the outcome of Venezuela’s elections earlier this year. Maduro won a new six-year term in May but his main rivals disavowed the election and alleged massive irregularities. “The regime really understands that the world is getting smaller for them. And that’s the kind of pressure that is needed to really change minds in the regime. The sanctions are having an effect,” the official said.

2018-11-20,"* OPEC, allies to meet on Dec. 6 to discuss supply cuts * Cuts would counter demand slowdown, surge in U.S. output By Henning Gloystein SINGAPORE, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Oil prices edged up on Tuesday as markets expected producer club OPEC to agree to supply cuts at their next meeting on Dec. 6, aimed at preventing oversupply amid slowing demand growth and a surge in output from the United States. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures, were at $57.32 per barrel at 0048 GMT, up 12 cents, or 0.2 percent from their last settlement. Front-month Brent crude oil futures had yet to trade. Reuters’ technical commodity analyst Wang Tao said on Tuesday Brent may rise into a range of $67.60 to $69.04 per barrel and WTI to $58.29 a barrel in the short-term. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), de facto led by Saudi Arabia, is pushing for the producer cartel and its allies to cut 1 million to 1.4 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply to adjust for a slowdown in demand growth and prevent oversupply. “Fundamentals over the next six months point to a recovery in oil prices following their sharp decline in October and early November,” BNP Paribas said. The French bank said this was due to “sizeable” losses in Iranian exports expected because of U.S. sanctions against Tehran and because of risks of disruptions in Venezuela and also Libya and Nigeria. “Meanwhile, producers are considering supply reductions in response and we expect OPEC to agree to a supply cut at its next official meeting on 6 December,” BNP said. The bank therefore said it expected Brent to recover to $80 per barrel before the year-end. “In 2019, we expect WTI to average $69 per barrel and Brent $76 per barrel,” BNP said. Despite the gains, crude prices remain almost a quarter below their recent peaks in early October, weighed down by surging supply and a slowdown in demand growth. This comes as supply in the United States is surging, with crude oil production C-OUT-T-EIA up by almost a quarter this year, to a record 11.7 million bpd.

MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dropped 0.3 percent. Australian stocks lost 0.7 percent and tech-heavy South Korean shares dropped 0.9 percent. In Seoul, Samsung Electronics fell 2.1 percent and SK Hynix Inc dropped 3 percent, while Japan’s Tokyo Electron was down 2.5 percent, Advantest lost 1.8 percent and Sony Corp shed 2.8 percent. Japan’s Nikkei was down 1 percent. Shares of Nissan Motor Co tumbled roughly 6 percent after its Chairman Carlos Ghosn was arrested on Monday for alleged financial misconduct and will be fired from the board this week. U.S. stocks came under heavy selling on Monday, with Nasdaq tumbling 3 percent, as investors dumped Apple, internet and other technology shares. Conflicting signals between the United States and China on their trade dispute added to caution. “The drop by U.S. stocks will cut short any attempt by equity markets to mount a sustained bounce. Investor sentiment has been subdued by lingering weakness in U.S. technology shares,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management in Tokyo. Worries of a peak in corporate earnings growth amid rising borrowing costs, slowing global economic momentum and international trade tensions triggered a shakeout in stocks over the past two months, with trillions of dollars worth of equity losses in a particularly torrid October month. In currencies, the dollar struggled at a near two-week low against a basket of currencies. The greenback was hit after data released on Monday showed U.S. home builder sentiment recorded its steepest one-month drop in over 4-1/2 years in November. The dollar had also been weighed down after Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan late last week raised concerns over a potential global slowdown. The U.S. currency has rallied strongly this year, buoyed by three Fed rate hikes and a robust economy, though some expect the bull run may be nearing an end. With long-term U.S. Treasury yields slipping to a seven-week low of 3.052 percent in the wake of weaker stocks and U.S. housing data, the dollar index against a basket of six major currencies hovered near 96.120, an 11-day low plumbed on Monday. The euro was little changed at $1.1455 after gaining 0.35 percent overnight. The dollar slipped to a three-week low of 112.40 yen and last traded at 112.48. U.S. crude futures gained 0.3 percent to $57.36, adding to the previous day’s gains, supported by a reported drawdown of U.S. oil inventories, potential European Union sanctions on Iran and possible OPEC production cuts.

2018-11-20,"SEOUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - South Korean shipyards have boxed out their Japanese rivals from the market for building large ships carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG), winning all of the orders for the next three years worth more than $9 billion.  Three South Korean yards - Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) (042660.KS), Hyundai Heavy Industries (009540.KS) and Samsung Heavy Industries (010140.KS) - have won the more than 50 orders placed for new large-scale LNG tankers for delivery in the next three years, according to data from the companies and two tanker brokers. The bulging orderbook illustrates the dominance the South Korean yards have achieved over their competitors, especially in Japan. It is also sign of how the companies have rebounded from a sector-wide slump only two years ago and how they are positioned to command the sector in the future. “The demand for LNG carriers surged followed by increased global demand of LNG,” said Park Hyung-gun, vice president of DSME. “There is a bright outlook ahead for LNG demand and South Korean shipbuilders will be able to excel in the LNG market.” (Graphic: LNG tanker orders - tmsnrt.rs/2PXkwDu)  Including floating LNG storage and support vessels, ship brokerage Braemar estimates South Korean yards have bagged 78 percent of all LNG-related orders this year, with just 14 percent and 8 percent going to Japan and China, respectively.  A set of data collected by another ship broker, who did not want to be identified, showed all of this year’s orders for large LNG tankers went to South Korea, at a combined value of over $9 billion. The new ships will increase the global LNG fleet by around 10 percent. Dominating this segment is key for shipyards, as gas consumption outgrows that of other fuels such as oil or coal. The South Korean shipbuilders have outperformed their Japanese competitors this year with the equities for all three Korean firms rising while the Japanese builders are either flat or down. (Graphic: Shipyard stock market performance - tmsnrt.rs/2DlC5GE) With its dominance in new orders, this share will increase. Virtually all the LNG from new projects in the Russian Arctic, Papua New Guinea, Australia, the United States, East Africa or Qatar will be delivered on South Korean ships made near the cities of Busan and Ulsan on the country’s southern coast. DSME said it has received 12 orders for LNG tankers this year. Those orders are worth about $2.2 billion to the company, according to data from Daiwa Capital Markets.  LNG tanker orders this year have made up over half its business, DSME said, helping it recover from a near collapse in 2016/17, when its stocks were suspended amid one of the deepest shipping industry downturns on record. An official at Samsung Heavy, who did not wish to be identified, said “market conditions are improving” and the firm has received 11 LNG tanker orders this year, around 40 percent of its total book. Hyundai Heavy, which had its worst year ever in 2016, said LNG ship orders started rising in 2017. This year, they will account for 21 percent of its new orders between January and September, up from 14 percent over the same period in 2017, company data showed. Two-thirds of the global LNG vessels in service today were built in South Korea, according to Braemar, versus 22 percent from Japan, 7 percent from China, and the rest made in France, Spain and the United States. (Graphic: GRAPHIC: LNG tanker by type - tmsnrt.rs/2Pvpzf1) South Korea’s edge comes from its technological and service standards as well as investment into research and development.  DSME developed the world’s first ice-breaking LNG tankers and the company will deliver the eighth such ship, the Georgiy Brusilov, to Russia’s Arctic LNG producer Novatek (NVTK.MM) this month. Another six are under construction. Price is also a factor in South Korea’s success, with the country’s shipyards building LNG carriers for as low as $175 million, according to data from Daiwa.  Japanese ships, however, are above $200 million, according a ship broker in Asia and a European shipping manager. Further cementing South Korea’s grip, the LNG industry has shifted away from the Moss tanker design, identified by the four or five spherical tanks holding the fuel and named for the company that designed them in 1973.  Instead, customers are demanding Membrane-type vessels that leave less dead space within the ship’s hull. This efficiency allows a Q-Max vessel, the largest class of Membrane carrier, to load up to 260,000 cubic meters of LNG versus 182,000 cubic meters on the biggest Moss-type tanker.   “Ship designs are changing,” said Park Moo-hyun, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment in Seoul, with customers preferring the Membrane tankers.      “China and Japan are not well responding to the change... and this led to no orders (there)... and that’s why European shipowners are placing orders to South Koreans,” he added.         Braemar estimates 71 percent of the global LNG tanker fleet is made up of Membrane carriers, versus 22 percent Moss tankers, and 7 percent using other systems. This year, 93 large LNG carriers using the Membrane design were ordered versus only eight Moss style, according to Braemar.  A spokesman for Japan’s Mitsubishi Shipbuilding (7011.T) confirmed it has won no LNG carrier orders since 2015. A spokesman at Kawasaki Heavy Industries (7012.T) said the same. Japan Marine United last won an order in 2014. Japan contends, however, that South Korea began unfairly supporting the shipyards during the 2016 downturn, when the South Korean government paid out subsidies and gave credit to keep the companies alive and their hundreds of thousands of workers employed.  The country plans to file a complaint over the issue with the World Trade Organization (WTO), Japan’s Nikkei paper reported this month. Whoever dominates this market is set to reap large benefits. Global LNG demand is surging from new users in emerging markets and because of a huge gasification program in China. The fuel is set to become important for marine transport as the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will require shippers to use cleaner fuels from 2020. The rising thirst is being met by new production projects, especially in North America and Australia, which will require more ships to transport LNG to its customers. Korea’s shippers are confident they will be the ones to ship most of this gas. “I see the current cycle lasting for at least 10 years and South Korea is expected to keep dominating the LNG market. Rival countries can’t catch up in the short term given their engineering skills and proficiency,” said Hana Financial’s Park.
