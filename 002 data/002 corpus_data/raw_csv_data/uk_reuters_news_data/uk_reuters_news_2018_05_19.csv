2018-05-19,"NAIROBI, May 19 (Reuters) - Kenya will start the small scale export of crude oil from its fields in the far northern county of Turkana in June after an  agreement on how to share the revenue, averting delays, the presidency said on Saturday. Tullow Oil and its partner Africa Oil discovered commercial reserves in the Lokichar basin in 2012. Total has since taken a 25 percent stake. A row had broken out after President Uhuru Kenyatta cut the share of the Turkana county government to 15 percent and that of the local community to 5 percent, leaving the rest to the national government. He then met officials from Turkana at State House in Nairobi to strike a new deal, which will raise the county government’s share to 20 percent and cut the national government’s to 75 percent. “We now have an understanding that can put Kenya on the map of oil exporting countries,” Kenyatta said in a statement. The deal will allow a long-delayed law on oil exploration and production to clear parliament, letting exports begin. “We will intensify our exploration efforts not just in Turkana but in the rest of the country now that we have a legal instrument that can help guide how oil and gas will be handled in our republic,” the president said. The deal was struck after the national government agreed to eliminate a cap on the revenue due to the county government and the local community, said a senior government official. Officials in Nairobi had proposed to cap the annual allocation from oil exports to Turkana, arguing that the local economy could not absorb a sudden influx of too much cash. “The clincher was the removal of the cap,” said Andrew Kamau, the principal secretary in the ministry of petroleum and mining.

2018-05-19,"TEHRAN (Reuters) - Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh said on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to quit a multinational nuclear deal would not affect Tehran’s oil exports if the EU could salvage the pact. “Every new decision in OPEC needs unanimity... I believe that if the European Union helps us... the level of the oil exports of Iran will not change,” Zanganeh told reporters after a meeting with the EU’s energy chief Miguel Arias Canete. Following Trump’s decision on May 8, the U.S. Treasury said Washington would reimpose a wide array of Iran-related sanctions after the expiry of 90- and 180-day wind-down periods, including sanctions aimed at Iran’s oil sector and transactions with its central bank. The EU wants to salvage the 2015 nuclear deal, which offers the Islamic Republic relief from economic sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear programme. Europe sees the agreement as an important element of international security. During the last round of sanctions, Iran’s oil supplies fell by around one million barrels per day, but the country re-emerged as a major oil exporter after sanctions were lifted in 2016.  However major European companies, partly wary of the remaining U.S. sanctions on Iran, have been reluctant to do business with Tehran, which needs to attract over $100 billion in foreign investment to boost its crude output. “I have no doubt that these extraterritorial sanctions from U.S. against Iran will have an impact on (foreign) investment in Iran,” Zanganeh told reporters. “It will not stop us but will reduce the rate of growth.” In the wake of new U.S. sanctions, some buyers of OPEC’s third-largest oil producer said they would seek U.S. waivers to purchase Iranian crude. “Our main customers are in Asia ... but we expect to preserve and save this level of exports to Europe and Africa,” he said. Arias Canete, who is in Tehran for a two-day trip, presented Iranian counterparts with an array of potential measures drafted by the EU this week to mitigate the impact of U.S. sanctions in a bid to bolster moderates around President Hassan Rouhani, who want to keep trade open with the West. “We want to solve all the problems that are impeding normal trade in oil,” Arias Canete said.         Zanganeh said Iran was particularly keen for the EU to act on a proposal urging EU governments make direct euro-denominated payments for oil exports to Iran’s central bank, bypassing the U.S. financial system. Other measures included renewing a sanctions-blocking measure to protect European businesses in Iran and allowing the European Investment Bank to do business in Iran. EU investment in Iran, mainly from Germany, France and Italy, has jumped to more than 20 billion euros since 2016, in projects ranging from aerospace to energy. But some foreign firms have already started signaling their intent to pull back from Iran. The French energy company Total (TOTF.PA) said on Wednesday it will pull out of a multibillion-dollar gas project in Iran if it cannot secure a waiver from U.S. sanctions. Iran had hailed the contract as a symbol of the accord’s success. “If Total does not receive U.S. waivers, they will quit and will be replaced by a Chinese company,” Zanganeh said.  French gas and power group Engie (ENGIE.PA), Polish gas firm PGNiG (PGN.WA) and German lender DZ Bank were the latest companies on Friday to say that their business dealings with Iran would be affected by new U.S. sanctions. Zanganeh said other countries such as Russia and China were keen to fill the vacuum left by the potential exit of European investors.  “The Chinese are very eager. Two big companies SINOPEC and CNPC are our historical partners for Iran. In the biggest fields in Iran they are eager to be involved,” Zanganeh said.

2018-05-19,"SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated on Saturday a hydroelectric power plant in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, amid protests from neighbor Pakistan which says the project on a river flowing into Pakistan will disrupt water supplies. The 330 megawatt Kishanganga hydropower station, work on which started in 2009, is one of the projects that India has fast-tracked in the volatile state amid frosty ties between the nuclear-armed countries. “This region can not only become self-sufficient in power but also produce for other regions of the country,” Modi said in the state’s capital, Srinagar. “Keeping that in mind we have been working on various projects here in the past four years.” Pakistan has opposed some of these projects, saying they violate a World Bank-mediated treaty on the sharing of the Indus river and its tributaries upon which 80 percent of its irrigated agriculture depends. “Pakistan is seriously concerned about the inauguration (of the Kishanganga plant),” its foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday. “Pakistan believes that the inauguration of the project without the resolution of the dispute is tantamount to violation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).” The Kishanganga project was delayed for several years as Pakistan dragged India to the International Court of Arbitration, which ruled in India’s favor in 2013. India has said the hydropower projects underway in Jammu and Kashmir are “run-of-the-river” schemes that use the river’s flow and elevation to generate electricity rather than large reservoirs, and do not contravene the treaty. A day before Modi’s trip to the northern state, at least nine people were killed on both sides of the border due to firing by each other’s security forces, officials said. The two countries have fought three wars, two over Kashmir that they rule in part but claim in full. India accuses Pakistan of promoting militancy in Kashmir, a charge that Islamabad denies. Modi, who is on a day-long visit to the state, also flagged off the construction of the 14 km (9 mile)-long Zojila tunnel to provide all-weather connectivity between the cities of Srinagar, Kargil and Leh. The government said it would be the longest road tunnel in India and Asia’s longest two-way tunnel, to be constructed at a cost of $1 billion.

2018-05-19,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China’s President Xi Jinping said the country must fight against waste and irrational consumption as it bids to reverse the damage done to its environment after decades of breakneck growth, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Saturday.  Xi said at a meeting that while China had made great progress in fighting against pollution, the achievements so far had not yet been fully “consolidated”.   “We must speed up the construction of a system of ecological civilization and ensure that the ecology and environment is fundamentally improved by the year 2035, and that our goal of building a beautiful China is basically achieved,” he said. China had now reached a critical period when it came to protecting the environment, with public expectations growing, Xi added.  China launched a war on pollution in 2014 in a bid to head off growing public discontent about the damage done to the country’s skies, water and soil since the economy began opening up in 1978.  It has since launched a series of campaigns aimed at curbing industrial pollution, improving environmental law enforcement and boosting emission standards and clean energy use.  China managed to bring average concentrations of hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 down 6.5 percent last year, but it remains significantly higher than the national standard of 35 micrograms per cubic meter, especially in smog-prone northern regions. China’s environment ministry warned last month that the battle against smog had reached a “stalemate” and experts have called for more targeted measures to improve air quality further.

2018-05-19,"(Reuters) - Courts in Curacao and Bonaire have partially lifted attachments introduced by ConocoPhillips (COP.N) aiming to seize Venezuelan PDVSA’s [PDVSA.UL] assets to satisfy a $2 billion (£1.48 billion) arbitration ruling, according to a copy of the documents seen by Reuters. Conoco has aggressively moved to take over state-run oil firm PDVSA’s inventories, cargoes and facilities following an award by the International Chamber of Commerce last month.  The dispute has particularly affected the Caribbean, where PDVSA owns and operates refineries and terminals that supply several islands. “Both the court in Curacao and those in Bonaire have decided that the attachments must be lifted to the extent that this is necessary for the fuel and/or electricity supply on both islands,” the Common Court of Justice said in a release.  The proceeds from the fuel sales to local distributor Curoil must be transferred to a specially designated account, where the money will remain until it is established who will be entitled to it, the court added.  “We are pleased with the result, as this is consistent with the proposal made by ConocoPhillips to both (islands’) local authorities, Curoil and the local courts,” Conoco said in a statement. PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.    Conoco’s seizure requests froze PDVSA’s oil inventories in Aruba, Curacao, Bonaire and St. Eustatius, as well as two oil cargoes off Aruba. Curacao’s 335,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Isla refinery is currently operating, but PDVSA has not sent crude to that facility since last week, so it is expected to halt operations in the near future, according to PDVSA sources.  The Bonaire and Curacao judges also ruled that PDVSA must resume fuel deliveries to Curoil, but it is unclear how Isla would continue producing. PDVSA will be fined $1 million for each day it does not comply with the ruling, with a maximum fine of $100 million, the Curacao judge said in a statement.       Conoco’s legal actions have created worry across the Caribbean and Central America as 47,000 bpd of fuel were expected to be shipped by PDVSA from Curacao in May mainly to Cuba, Belize, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Haiti, according to PDVSA’s internal trade reports. Curacao Prime Minister Eugene Rhuggenaath last week said the dispute is posing a “potential crisis” for the island. Aruba is preparing a contingency plan to avoid a situation similar to Curacao and Bonaire, where inventories were blocked, according to Aruba’s prime minister, Evelyn Wever-Croes. The U.S. State Department earlier this week said there is enough oil in the global market to make up for potential fuel disruptions due to Conoco’s actions.    “The U.S. Department of State remains in contact with our partners in the Caribbean to reduce the risk of supply disruptions,” said Vincent Campos, spokesman for the Bureau of Energy Resources.
